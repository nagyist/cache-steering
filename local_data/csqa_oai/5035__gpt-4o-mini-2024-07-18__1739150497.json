  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that there is a common understanding or belief that many people overlook regarding a fundamental principle.",
    "The phrase \"on god can what?\" suggests looking for something that is uniquely attributed to \"God\" or associated with divine capability.",
    "Reviewing the choices, we need to identify which one fits with the idea that only God can do something.",
    "Choice A: \"anything\" is too broad and does not specifically align with divine actions alone.",
    "Choice B: \"everywhere\" speaks to a quality of being omnipresent, which is true for God but doesn't fit the structure of \"on god can what?\"",
    "Choice C: \"judge men\" implies a specific role often associated with a divine being, as judging is often thought to be beyond human capability and reserved for God.",
    "Choice D: \"give peace\" is more about a divine gift rather than an action limited to God alone, suggesting it could be offered by others too.",
    "Choice E: \"help people\" is also an action that can be performed by humans and is not exclusive to God.",
    "Out of all the choices, \"judge men\" is the most fitting because judging is a characteristic that is mainly attributed to God, aligning with the idea presented in the question."
