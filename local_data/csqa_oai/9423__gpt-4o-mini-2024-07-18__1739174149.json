  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question: Sally worked at a dentist office and had to work late. We need to find a reason why she might have had to stay late.",
    "Consider what factors could lead someone working at a dentist's office to stay past regular hours. This could include needing to attend to patients or handle administrative work.",
    "Evaluate the options provided for relevance to the situation. \nA: office building \u2013 does not provide a reason for working late.\nB: town \u2013 not directly related to the reason for Sally working late at the office.\nC: patient \u2013 could easily be a direct reason, as treating a patient may require staying later than usual.\nD: michigan \u2013 irrelevant in the context of working late at a dentist office.\nE: office desk \u2013 does not imply a specific cause for working late.",
    "Between the options, \"patient\" seems most likely directly related to reasons for working late at a dentist's office since it suggests additional care or treatment needed.",
    "No other options suggest a valid reason as strongly as \u201cpatient,\u201d which denotes an obligatory duty to serve or attend to someone requiring dental assistance."
