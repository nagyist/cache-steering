  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequences of hurting someone else in the eyes of authorities.",
    "Hurting someone else is generally viewed as a criminal act, which can lead to legal consequences.",
    "Authorities, such as the police, typically respond to incidents of violence or harm by intervening.",
    "Intervention often includes assessing the situation and determining whether any laws have been broken.",
    "If the authorities witness you hurting someone, it is likely they will act to prevent further harm.",
    "Based on legal practices, the most common course of action in such scenarios is to arrest the individual causing harm.",
    "Other choices like sadness, racial profiling, anger, and suffering do not directly address the immediate legal consequences of the action.",
