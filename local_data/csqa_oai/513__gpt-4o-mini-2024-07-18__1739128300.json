  "query": "Question: Many containers full of goods are unloaded where after their long sea journey\n\nChoices:\nA: port\nB: cargo ship\nC: refrigerator\nD: food\nE: lorry",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where containers full of goods are unloaded after a sea journey.",
    "Containers of goods are typically transported by cargo ships over long distances.",
    "Upon arriving at their destination, these cargo ships dock at facilities designed for unloading goods.",
    "These facilities are commonly known as ports, where various logistical operations take place.",
    "A port enables the transfer of goods from the cargo ship to land-based transportation or storage.",
    "Now, let's consider the other options: a cargo ship cannot be a place for unloading; it is the vehicle that carries the containers.",
    "A refrigerator is an appliance used for storage, not for unloading goods; it is irrelevant to the context.",
    "Food is the type of product within containers but does not relate to where they are unloaded.",
    "A lorry is a form of transportation that might be used after unloading but is not the location of unloading itself.",
    "Since \"port\" is the only suitable location where containers are unloaded, it is the correct answer to the question."
