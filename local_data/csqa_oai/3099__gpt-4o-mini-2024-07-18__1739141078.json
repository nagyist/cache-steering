  "query": "Question: Where would you use a computer while gaining knowledge?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: house\nC: table\nD: house\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the main purpose of using a computer while gaining knowledge. This involves a space that is conducive to learning and accessing information.",
    "Next, I look at the options provided. \"Apartment\" and \"house\" are both types of residential spaces; while they may include computers, they are not inherently focused on learning.",
    "\"Table\" alone is not a place. It is just a piece of furniture where a computer could be placed, and does not indicate a specific environment for learning.",
    "\"School\" is primarily an educational institution where computers are often used for teaching and learning purposes. It is directly related to the act of gaining knowledge.",
    "Now, I analyze the options to see if there are any duplications. The option \"house\" appears twice (B and D), which means I can disregard one of them, but it does not impact the main focus on learning with a computer.",
    "At this point, \"school\" stands out as the best option for a focused learning environment with computers, compared to the other residential options that do not inherently emphasize gaining knowledge.",
    "Finally, I confirm that the environment where computers are commonly used for learning is indeed at a \"school.\""
