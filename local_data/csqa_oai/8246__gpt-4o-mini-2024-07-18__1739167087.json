  "query": "Question: A teacher thought that John wasn't doing  his best. She knew he had potential, so she tried to do what to him?\n\nChoices:\nA: tell story\nB: lower expectations\nC: time test\nD: bribe\nE: encourage",
  "steps": [
    "The question presents a scenario where a teacher believes that John is not performing up to his potential despite recognizing that he has the ability to do better.",
    "To address the situation, the teacher is likely to take steps that motivate or support John, rather than actions that would lower his drive or lead to an unethical outcome such as bribery.",
    "Option A, \"tell story,\" does not directly support or encourage John and might not effectively address her concerns about his performance.",
    "Option B, \"lower expectations,\" implies a negative approach that would not help John realize his potential but rather suggest that it is acceptable for him to underperform.",
    "Option C, \"time test,\" could refer to a method of assessment but does not directly pertain to motivating John or addressing his lack of effort.",
    "Option D, \"bribe,\" is an unethical approach and would contradict the teacher's intent to foster potential and improvement in John.",
    "Option E, \"encourage,\" is inherently positive and aligns with the teacher's goal of helping John realize his potential and improve his performance.",
    "Among the options, \"encourage\" stands out as the most logical and effective method for the teacher to help John perform better."
