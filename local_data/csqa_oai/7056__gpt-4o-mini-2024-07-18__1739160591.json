    "The question asks about the importance of exploring all avenues to maintain peace and what should therefore be avoided.",
    "When discussing peace, the opposite or what is typically avoided is conflict or war.",
    "Choices A (happened) and B (elusive) do not relate directly to the maintenance of peace or the topic at hand.",
    "Choice C (peacework) is not an oppositional term or a consequence but rather relates to the efforts that can be made to sustain peace.",
    "Choice D (violent) describes a potential outcome or characteristic of conflict, but it does not directly articulate the consequences of not maintaining peace.",
    "Choice E (war) clearly represents the state of conflict and is often seen as the most straightforward consequence of failing to maintain peace.",
    "Thus, the logical conclusion is that maintaining peace should aim to avoid \"war.\""
