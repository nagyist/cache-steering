  "query": "Question: If a lot of cargo trucks come and go every day, where would the forklift get the most use?\n\nChoices:\nA: loading dock\nB: construction site\nC: construction yard\nD: warehouse\nE: cargo",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of a forklift, which is primarily designed to lift and move materials over short distances.",
    "Next, evaluate the environments listed in the choices to determine where a lot of lifting and moving of cargo or materials would occur.",
    "The loading dock is a common area for the arrival and departure of cargo trucks, where forklifts could be used to load and unload goods from trucks.",
    "At a construction site, forklifts may also be useful, but they may not be required as frequently as in a loading dock since materials might be stored in piles rather than requiring constant movement.",
    "In a construction yard, there would be use for a forklift to handle materials, but again, it does not have the consistent activity level seen at a loading dock.",
    "A warehouse is likely to have a lot of cargo movement, as goods are often stored and retrieved, which would necessitate numerous forklift operations.",
    "\"Cargo\" as a selection is quite broad and does not refer to a specific place of operation but rather the goods themselves.",
    "Compare the scoring potentials of the loading dock and warehouse. Both environments have significant forklift use, but the loading dock focuses more on immediate truck operations.",
    "Given the original context of the question\u2014lots of cargo trucks coming and going\u2014a loading dock serves as a more specific, concentrated point of forklift use.",
    "Finally, consolidate that the primary purpose of forklifts, in relation to the frequent presence of cargo trucks, aligns best with a loading dock."
