  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequence of a grooming appointment taking longer than anticipated.",
    "When a grooming appointment runs over time, it impacts the schedule of subsequent appointments.",
    "Possible consequences of running late could include customers for future appointments having to wait.",
    "The most direct and relevant result of a grooming appointment taking longer than expected is that the next appointment will be delayed.",
    "Considering the choices provided, \"late\" most accurately describes the outcome of the next appointment after a grooming takes longer than expected.",
    "Other options like \"injury,\" \"beauty,\" \"mistakes,\" and \"annoyed\" do not directly relate to the scheduling implications of running over time.",
    "Thus, the outcome of the next appointment due to a delay is best encapsulated by the term \"late.\""
