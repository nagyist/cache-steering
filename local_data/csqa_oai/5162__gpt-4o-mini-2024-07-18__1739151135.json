  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a label or term that describes someone who frequently goes on vacations.",
    "Looking at the options, I can analyze which ones are most relevant to the act of going on vacations.",
    "Option A, \"vacate,\" refers to leaving a place or making it empty, which does not appropriately describe someone who enjoys vacations.",
    "Option B, \"vacationgoer,\" combines the words \"vacation\" and \"goer,\" and appropriately describes someone who goes on vacations.",
    "Option C, \"include cruise,\" does not seem like a proper term for someone who frequently goes on vacations. Instead, it specifies a type of vacation.",
    "Option D, \"racecation,\" is a niche term that refers to combining a racing event with a vacation, which would not apply to all types of vacations.",
    "Option E, \"traveler,\" is a general term that could encompass anyone who travels, including those who go on vacations.",
    "Between options B and E, \"vacationgoer\" is more specific and directly tied to the concept of taking vacations compared to the broader term \"traveler.\"",
    "Considering the focus on someone who goes on vacations rather than just travels, the most fitting option is \"vacationgoer.\""
