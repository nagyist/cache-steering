  "query": "Question: Johnny's behavior was a bigger problem.  Even if the original incident wasn't intentional, his actions afterward are completely what?\n\nChoices:\nA: accidental\nB: detestable\nC: effusive\nD: enabled\nE: shocking",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the sentence. It discusses Johnny's behavior after an incident that wasn't intentional, implying that his subsequent actions are significant in characterizing him.",
    "The phrase \"his actions afterward\" suggests that the focus is on the nature of these actions rather than the unintentional incident. Therefore, it's important to consider how one might typically interpret actions taken after an incident.",
    "The word \"completely\" indicates a strong emphasis on the nature of Johnny's actions. This implies that the subsequent actions are viewed very negatively.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate the answer choices:\n- A: accidental - suggests a lack of intention, which is not relevant here since the actions are described as significant.\n- B: detestable - implies that the actions are highly objectionable and immoral.\n- C: effusive - refers to expressing feelings of gratitude or pleasure, which doesn't match the context of problematic behavior.\n- D: enabled - suggests that his actions facilitated something negative, but it doesn't necessarily carry a strong moral judgment.\n- E: shocking - indicates that the actions are surprising or alarming, which could be a possibility.",
    "Among the choices, B (\"detestable\") suggests a strong moral judgment and indicates that Johnny's behavior is seen as reprehensible, which aligns with the idea that it is a bigger problem.",
    "E (\"shocking\") could also be relevant because unexpected actions could indeed be alarming. However, \"detestable\" provides a clearer condemnation of his behavior.",
    "Considering all options and the strong wording of \"completely,\" the most fitting adjective that summarizes Johnny's problematic behavior after the incident is \"detestable.\""
