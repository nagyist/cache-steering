  "query": "Question: Glass that hasn't been treated to be extra strong is what?\n\nChoices:\nA: weak\nB: fragile\nC: forceless\nD: regular\nE: flimsy",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about untreated glass and its properties.",
    "Untreated glass typically refers to standard glass that hasn't undergone any special processes to improve its strength.",
    "When considering the options, \"weak\" indicates inability to withstand force, which could apply to untreated glass.",
    "The term \"fragile\" suggests that the glass is easily broken, aligning with how untreated glass can be viewed.",
    "\"Forceless\" is not a common term used to describe materials and may not specifically refer to glass properties.",
    "The word \"regular\" may imply standard, but it doesn\u2019t capture the weakness or delicateness of untreated glass.",
    "\"Flimsy\" suggests a lack of sturdiness or strength, which is also applicable to untreated glass.",
    "Now, I have evaluated the most applicable choices\u2014\"weak,\" \"fragile,\" and \"flimsy.\" All suggest a lack of strength but imply slightly different connotations.",
    "Considering that untreated glass is often described in layman terms as being easily breakable or delicate, \"fragile\" is the most fitting descriptor.",
    "In conclusion, although \"weak,\" \"flimsy,\" and \"fragile\" could apply, \"fragile\" specifically emphasizes the risk of breaking."
