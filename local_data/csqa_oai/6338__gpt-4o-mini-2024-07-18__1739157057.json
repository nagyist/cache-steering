  "query": "Question: Every living person has what on top of their neck?\n\nChoices:\nA: immune system\nB: belly button\nC: two eyes\nD: one head\nE: name",
  "steps": [
    "To analyze the question, we need to identify a feature that is universally present on every living person, specifically located on top of the neck.",
    "Let's evaluate each option to see if they fit the criteria of being universally present on top of the neck.",
    "Option A: Immune system - This is not a physical feature located on top of the neck; it is a biological system throughout the body.",
    "Option B: Belly button - This is located on the abdomen, far from the neck.",
    "Option C: Two eyes - While most people have two eyes, they are not necessarily \"on top\" of the neck; they are on the face.",
    "Option D: One head - The head is indeed located on top of the neck and is universally present in all living humans.",
    "Option E: Name - A name is not a physical feature and is not located on the body at all.",
    "From this analysis, the only correct answer that fits the criteria of being a universal physical feature located on top of the neck is option D, as all living people have one head."
