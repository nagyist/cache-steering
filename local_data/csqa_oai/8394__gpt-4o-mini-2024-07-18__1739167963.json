  "query": "Question: Where would you store your hair gel near where you get clean?\n\nChoices:\nA: barbers\nB: bathroom\nC: bath\nD: perfumery\nE: beauty salon",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what the question is asking. It wants to know where one would store hair gel in relation to getting clean.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options provided. Barbers typically provide haircuts and grooming services, but not necessarily a place to store gel.",
    "The bathroom is a common place for personal grooming and hygiene tasks, making it a suitable location for storing hair gel.",
    "The term \"bath\" often refers to the act of bathing or the tub itself, which does not suggest storage for hair products.",
    "A perfumery is primarily focused on perfumes and fragrances, so it is unlikely to be a suitable place to store hair gel.",
    "A beauty salon offers a range of beauty services and may use hair products, but it\u2019s less common for individuals to store their personal products there.",
    "Comparing the options again, the bathroom stands out as the most logical and practical place for personal grooming items like hair gel.",
    "I will double-check the options to ensure that I have not missed any viable storage places.",
    "No other option seems to provide the same convenience and appropriateness for storing hair gel as the bathroom does.",
    "Thus, based on all the points considered, the best answer is the bathroom for storing hair gel close to where one gets clean."
