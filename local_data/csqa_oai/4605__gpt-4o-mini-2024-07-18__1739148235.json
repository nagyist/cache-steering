    "The statement mentions that dinner was finished and dishes were cleared, implying that we are in a dining context.",
    "The bust boy's role involves cleaning up after a meal, particularly focusing on surfaces where food might have been served.",
    "Dirt and crumbs from a dinner setting are typically found on tables where food is served.",
    "While it is possible for crumbs to also be found on the floor and other options, the logical primary focus in a dining scenario is to wipe down the table.",
    "The other choices (box of crackers, face, rug, floor) do not fit as common surfaces for collecting crumbs from a served dinner.",
    "Given the context and responsibilities of the bust boy, the most plausible answer would be the table where the dinner was likely served."
