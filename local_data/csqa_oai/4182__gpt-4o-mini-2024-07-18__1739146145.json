  "query": "Question: Where should you keep a pet lizard?\n\nChoices:\nA: desert\nB: garden\nC: galapagos archipelago\nD: wild\nE: glass cage",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat requirements of a pet lizard. Most pet lizards thrive in controlled environments that mimic their natural habitat.",
    "Next, evaluate the choice of a desert. While some lizards are desert dwellers, this environment is generally too extreme for most pet lizards that require specific temperature and humidity control.",
    "Then, consider a garden. A garden may not provide adequate protection from predators and environmental factors, and it lacks the controlled conditions that pet lizards need.",
    "Now, look at the Galapagos Archipelago. While it is home to unique species of lizards, it's not practical or legal to keep pet lizards in their natural habitat.",
    "Next, consider keeping a lizard in the wild. This is not suitable for domesticated lizards, which have been bred in captivity and depend on human care.",
    "Now, evaluate the option of a glass cage. A glass cage can provide a controlled environment with the necessary temperature and humidity levels, along with protection from predators.",
    "Furthermore, a glass cage allows for proper ventilation and is often designed for easy cleaning and feeding, making it ideal for pet lizard care.",
    "Assessing all options, the most appropriate and practical choice for keeping a pet lizard is in an environment designed for their needs, such as a glass cage."
