  "query": "Question: Socialising with the in crowd was tiring, she found herself always suffering what when seeing what everybody had that she didn't?\n\nChoices:\nA: friendships\nB: making friends\nC: conflicts\nD: interruptions\nE: jealousy",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to understand the context given in the statement about socializing with the \"in crowd\" and feeling tired. This implies some negative emotion or feeling related to social interactions.",
    "Next, the phrase \"suffering what when seeing what everybody had that she didn't\" suggests feelings of inadequacy or envy regarding the possessions, relationships, or social status of others.",
    "I will analyze the choices provided to see which one fits this context. \n- A (friendships) refers to relationships she may wish to have, but it doesn't specifically convey the emotion she's experiencing.\n- B (making friends) also does not match because it implies a proactive approach rather than a feeling of suffering.\n- C (conflicts) suggests confrontation, which doesn\u2019t directly correlate with the feeling of seeing what others have.\n- D (interruptions) is unrelated to the emotional context presented.\n- E (jealousy) directly refers to the feeling of resentment or envy towards what others possess.",
    "Among the choices, \"jealousy\" is the only option that directly aligns with the feeling of suffering due to comparison with others.",
    "To further confirm, jealousy specifically deals with the emotional response of noticing what others have, leading to feelings of inadequacy and discontent, which exactly matches the scenario described."
