  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for locations where travelers can safely pull off the road to stretch their legs during travel.",
    "The options provided include various types of transportation settings. I need to consider which of these options is designed for travelers to stop and take breaks.",
    "A rest area is specifically designed for travelers to stop, rest, and stretch their legs. It typically offers amenities such as benches, restrooms, and sometimes food options.",
    "Airports are primarily for air travel and while they do have areas where travelers can rest, they are not specifically designed for road travelers looking for a place to stop while driving.",
    "Train stations are similar to airports but cater to travelers using trains rather than cars. They may not be convenient for someone traveling by road.",
    "Coming home does not refer to a specific location where one can stop and stretch; it implies the end of a journey rather than a place to rest during travel.",
    "A bus depot serves as a stop for bus travelers, but it is less commonly considered a place for vehicle travelers to pull off the road compared to a rest area.",
    "Comparing all the options, a rest area is the only choice that perfectly fits the description of a place for road travelers to pull over and stretch."
