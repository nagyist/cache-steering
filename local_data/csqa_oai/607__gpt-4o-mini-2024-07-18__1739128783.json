  "query": "Question: The college kids weren't known for their apartment decor choices, they used a folding chair inside their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: closet\nC: school\nD: room\nE: church",
  "steps": [
    "The question hints at a context involving college students, suggesting a casual or simple living environment that may lack attention to decor.",
    "The inclusion of a \"folding chair\" implies a practical and space-saving approach to furniture, which is common in small living spaces.",
    "Each option needs to be assessed based on typical environments where college students spend time.",
    "A \"bathroom\" is not a typical place for a folding chair to be used, as it is usually reserved for essential fixtures.",
    "A \"closet\" is also not a common area for a chair, as it is primarily for storage and not for seating.",
    "\"School\" could imply a classroom or school environment, but it wouldn't be referring to an apartment.",
    "\"Church\" is generally not a personal space where one would typically bring their own folding chair, especially in the context of college decor.",
    "This leaves us with \"room,\" which likely refers to a living space, such as a bedroom or common area in a college apartment.",
    "Additionally, college students often have limited space, making folding chairs a practical choice for their rooms.",
    "Hence, considering the context and practicality of the situation, the most logical answer is that the folding chair is inside their room."
