  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that the individual frequently experienced thirst at night and required a drink, suggesting a personal habit or preference.",
    "It mentions that he always had a night table, which is typically associated with bedrooms, where one might keep water or a drink for convenience.",
    "The phrase \"everywhere he had lived\" suggests a variety of living situations, implying permanence or long-term habitation rather than temporary arrangements.",
    "Analyzing the choices, A (furniture store) does not fit, as it is not a living space. B (life) is too broad and nonspecific regarding living arrangements.",
    "C (hallway) does not typically have a night table present. D (hotel) indicates temporary stays, which contradicts the frequent need for a night table in all locations.",
    "E (homes) fits well since it encompasses various living situations where one would naturally have a night table, especially if they often got thirsty at night.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, E (homes) is the most logical conclusion for where he needed a night table."
