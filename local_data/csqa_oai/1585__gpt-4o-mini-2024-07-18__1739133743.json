  "query": "Question: Where do I store folding chairs for religious experiences?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: church\nC: room\nD: basement\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common locations where folding chairs might be stored. Such locations should be accessible and typically used for gatherings or events.",
    "Next, evaluate the option of a closet. A closet might be suitable for a small number of chairs, but it may not provide enough space for many folding chairs, especially for a religious experience that might require several chairs.",
    "Now, let's consider the option of church. A church often has designated areas for storing chairs since they are frequently used for services, meetings, and gatherings. This makes it a practical choice for storing folding chairs for religious experiences.",
    "Analyzing the option of a room, this could mean either a personal room or a common area, but it generally lacks the appropriateness as a storage location specifically for folding chairs intended for religious use.",
    "Next, consider the basement as an option. Basements can serve as storage spaces, but they are often difficult to access and not specifically tailored for organized storage of chairs needed for events or religious experiences.",
    "Lastly, the garage could provide ample space for folding chairs, especially if they are not in use. However, it may not be the best location since chairs stored in a garage may become dirty or damaged over time and are not typically the most accessible when needed for religious services.",
    "Based on the evaluations, the church stands out as the most suitable, accessible, and appropriate location for storing folding chairs specifically intended for religious experiences."
