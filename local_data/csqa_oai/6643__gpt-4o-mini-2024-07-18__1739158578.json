  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that mouthwash is a liquid product typically used for oral hygiene.",
    "Next, I consider how mouthwash is packaged for consumer use; it is commonly sold in a container that allows for easy dispensing.",
    "I recall that mouthwash is usually sold in a bottle, which can vary in size but is the standard form of packaging for liquids.",
    "Now I analyze the answer choices presented: \nA: this bottle will not fit in the medicine cabinet - not relevant to what mouthwash is stored in.\nB: bottle - this matches my understanding so far.\nC: dentist's office - not where mouthwash is stored generally.\nD: drug store - location where mouthwash can be purchased but not stored.\nE: bathroom - a common place for storing personal hygiene items, including mouthwash, but not the actual container it comes in.",
    "Based on the recognition that the main form of storage for mouthwash is in a bottle, I confirm that option B is the most accurate representation of what mouthwash is stored in."
