  "query": "Question: Where is a dinner sometimes sold as a plate?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: kitchen cupboard\nC: table\nD: banquet\nE: cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of the question, which is about where dinner might be sold as a plate.",
    "I think about the options provided: restaurant, kitchen cupboard, table, banquet, and cabinet.",
    "A restaurant typically sells meals, and plates of food are common there; so it seems like a possible answer.",
    "The kitchen cupboard is a storage space and does not sell food, so this is not a suitable option.",
    "The term \"table\" could refer to a dining table where dinner is served, but it does not imply selling it.",
    "A banquet usually involves multiple people dining together, but it is more of an event rather than a selling location.",
    "A cabinet, like a kitchen cupboard, is used for storage and does not sell anything, so it is also not suitable.",
    "Since a restaurant is a place that directly sells food on plates, I conclude that this is the best fit.",
    "None of the other options directly fit the idea of selling dinner, which strengthens the case for a restaurant.",
    "To summarize, the option \u201crestaurant\u201d aligns with the concept of where plates of dinner can potentially be sold."
