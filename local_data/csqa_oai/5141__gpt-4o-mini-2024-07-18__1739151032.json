  "query": "Question: Where do you buy tickets to a show?\n\nChoices:\nA: stadium\nB: home\nC: auditorium\nD: arena\nE: opera house",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the locations associated with purchasing tickets for different types of shows.",
    "A stadium is usually associated with sports events, and tickets can be purchased at the stadium or online; however, it is not the most common place for general shows.",
    "Home is not a location for buying tickets, as it's a personal space and generally not involved in ticket sales.",
    "An auditorium is designed for performances, lectures, and shows, and it typically has a box office where tickets can be purchased directly. Therefore, buying tickets for a show can happen there.",
    "An arena is similar to a stadium and usually hosts larger events; while tickets can be bought there, it is not specifically associated with shows in the same vein as an auditorium.",
    "An opera house is specifically designed for opera performances, which are a type of show. Tickets can indeed be purchased there, but it is more specific compared to an auditorium.",
    "I need to evaluate which options are the most broadly relevant for buying tickets to a show. An auditorium serves a variety of performances while the opera house serves a more specific purpose.",
    "Since the question refers to a general show rather than a specific type, the auditorium is the better fit because it is used for many types of performances.",
    "Thus, the best option from the list provided that encompasses a broader category for purchasing tickets to various shows is C: auditorium."
