  "query": "Question: Where does the shopping bag go after you finish shopping?\n\nChoices:\nA: crank\nB: mart\nC: supermarket\nD: home\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a shopping bag, which is to carry purchased items from a shopping location to another destination.",
    "Next, think about typical shopping locations where one would use a shopping bag. Common places include supermarkets, grocery stores, and malls.",
    "Evaluate the choices given. Options A (crank) and B (mart) do not seem to correspond to a logical destination for a shopping bag.",
    "Option C (supermarket) is a potential destination as it is a place where shopping bags are commonly used to carry groceries.",
    "Next, consider option D (home). It is reasonable to assume that after shopping, one would take their shopping bag home to unpack the items.",
    "Lastly, option E (closet) is not directly related, as a closet is not typically a destination for the shopping bag itself, but rather a storage place for items.",
    "Since the shopping bag is used to carry items from a shopping venue and usually ends up at home to unload the items, the best answer is option D."
