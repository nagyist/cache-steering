  "steps": [
    "First, consider the usual customs and traditions surrounding marriage proposals.",
    "Typically, a wedding ring is presented at the moment of the proposal.",
    "Next, I analyze the options given in relation to where a wedding ring would be placed before proposing.",
    "Option A: \"box\" is a common place to hold or store a ring before the proposal, as many people use ring boxes for this purpose.",
    "Option B: \"church\" refers to a location where some may choose to propose, but it does not specifically answer where to put the ring before proposing.",
    "Option C: \"finger\" indicates the position where the ring goes after the proposal, not before.",
    "Option D: \"friend's wedding\" is an event where a proposal could take place, but it does not serve as a logical place to keep the ring beforehand.",
    "Option E: \"beach\" could be a romantic proposal location, but it does not specify where the ring would be kept prior to proposing.",
    "Among these options, the \"box\" stands out as the most logical answer for where someone would put a wedding ring before proposing."
