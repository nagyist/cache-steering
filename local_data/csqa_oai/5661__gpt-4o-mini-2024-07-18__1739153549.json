    "Lizards are known for their climbing abilities, and they often climb surfaces that provide good traction and stability.",
    "Some common climbing surfaces for lizards include trees, bushes, and rocky terrain.",
    "The options provided include a variety of surfaces, so I need to assess which of these options lizards are most likely to climb.",
    "Option A, \"stream bed,\" typically refers to a flat area near a body of water and is not a vertical climbing surface.",
    "Option B, \"great outdoors,\" is a general term and does not specify any climbing surface.",
    "Option C, \"plane,\" is not related to climbing as it typically refers to an aircraft or flat surface, not something lizards interact with.",
    "Option D, \"garden,\" while it may contain some climbing elements like fences or plants, is not specific enough to indicate a climbing surface.",
    "Option E, \"rock wall,\" clearly indicates a vertical surface that lizards can climb, as many lizards are adept climbers and can scale rocky terrains easily.",
    "Comparing all the options, \"rock wall\" is the most logical choice for what lizards climb up."
