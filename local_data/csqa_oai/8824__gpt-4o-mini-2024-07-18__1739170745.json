    "Identifying what the term \"gutters\" refers to in the context of preventing a ball from becoming runaway. The most common context for \"gutters\" in relation to a ball is in bowling, where the gutters run along the sides of the bowling lane.",
    "Evaluating the options given. The term \"gutters\" is not typically associated with a city (B), military base (C), fashion show (D), or football game (E) in a way that pertains to preventing runaway balls.",
    "Considering the option of a bowling alley (A) carefully. In a bowling alley, when a bowled ball goes off the lane and into the gutters, it is rendered out of play, thus preventing it from continuing down the lane.",
    "Understanding that this context of a \"runaway\" ball - one that would otherwise keep rolling and potentially cause issues - clearly fits the scenario of a bowling alley.",
    "Reaffirming that the main purpose of gutters in a bowling alley is to catch any wayward balls that do not stay on the lane, making it the only plausible answer."
