  "query": "Question: What do humans have that cerberus does not have?\n\nChoices:\nA: one head\nB: two ears\nC: lay eggs\nD: 3 legs\nE: two feet",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the defining characteristics of humans. Humans are bipedal mammals known for having a complex brain and various physical features.",
    "Next, consider Cerberus, the mythical three-headed dog from Greek mythology. Cerberus is a creature typically depicted with three heads, a serpent for a tail, and often described with characteristics of canines.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options one by one:\n- A: one head - Cerberus has three heads, so this option is likely correct as humans have one head.",
    "- B: two ears - Humans do have two ears, and typically, Cerberus (as a dog) would also have two ears. This doesn't distinguish them.",
    "- C: lay eggs - Humans do not lay eggs; they give live birth. Cerberus, as a mythological creature, is not known to lay eggs either, but this doesn't provide a distinction as it's not a common trait for mammals.",
    "- D: 3 legs - Cerberus does not have three legs, he has four legs. Humans have two legs, meaning this option doesn't distinguish them as well.",
    "- E: two feet - Humans have two feet, while Cerberus would have four paws/feet. Therefore, this also doesn't distinctly separate the two if considering general mobility.",
    "After reviewing all options, the most distinct difference between humans and Cerberus is that humans have one head, while Cerberus has three heads."
