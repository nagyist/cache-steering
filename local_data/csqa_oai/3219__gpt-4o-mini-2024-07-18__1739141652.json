  "query": "Question: Where is a warm water anemone likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: florist\nB: atlantic ocean\nC: nursery\nD: sea water\nE: south pacific",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a warm water anemone is likely to be, we need to understand its natural habitat.",
    "Warm water anemones are typically found in marine environments and prefer warmer temperature ranges.",
    "The Atlantic Ocean generally has varied temperature zones, but warmer waters can be found in specific areas.",
    "\"Nursery\" generally refers to a place for plants or young animals, which doesn't relate directly to marine life.",
    "\"Sea water\" is too vague as it refers to all ocean waters and not specific habitats.",
    "The South Pacific is known for its warmer waters, making it a suitable location for warm water anemones.",
    "Comparing the South Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, the South Pacific is more commonly associated with warmer water habitats.",
    "Given that warm water environments are critical to the survival of warm water anemones, we need to narrow it down between Atlantic Ocean and South Pacific.",
    "While the Atlantic Ocean has some warm waters, the South Pacific region is more universally recognized for its tropical and subtropical marine life.",
    "Thus, the most accurate choice based on the habitat of warm water anemones would be the South Pacific."
