  "query": "Question: If a person acts in a manner that embarrasses themselves and family their behavior is what?\n\nChoices:\nA: have no home\nB: ridiculous\nC: beautiful\nD: restricted\nE: shameful",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a person's behavior that leads to embarrassment for themselves and their family.",
    "The behaviors that cause embarrassment usually relate to social norms and values.",
    "Among the choices, we are looking for a word that captures the negative impact of such behavior.",
    "Choice A, \"have no home,\" does not directly relate to the concept of embarrassment.",
    "Choice B, \"ridiculous,\" suggests something funny or silly but does not necessarily encapsulate the idea of embarrassment.",
    "Choice C, \"beautiful,\" is the opposite of what would logically follow from embarrassing behavior.",
    "Choice D, \"restricted,\" indicates limitations, which does not connect to embarrassment.",
    "Choice E, \"shameful,\" directly relates to feeling of shame or vulnerability that arises from actions that lead to embarrassment.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best choice that describes behavior causing embarrassment is \"shameful.\""
