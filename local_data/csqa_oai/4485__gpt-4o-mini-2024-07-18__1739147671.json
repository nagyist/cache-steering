  "query": "Question: What device with a lens would you use to take photos?\n\nChoices:\nA: microscope\nB: device requires optics\nC: telescope\nD: spoon\nE: camera",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the purpose of a device that uses a lens to take photos. A photo is typically a still image captured by a device that can focus light.",
    "Next, I will consider each option provided in the question. The microscope is primarily used for looking at very small objects, not for taking photos in general.",
    "Now I will assess option B, which states \"device requires optics.\" While this is true for many devices, it doesn\u2019t specifically point to taking photos, as many optical devices may not be used for photography.",
    "Moving on to option C, the telescope. This device is meant for observing distant objects, primarily in astronomy. While it may have the capability to take photos, it is not commonly used for general photography.",
    "Now, I will examine option D, the spoon. A spoon is not related to photography and does not have any optical components.",
    "Finally, I will consider option E, the camera. A camera is a device specifically designed for capturing photos using a lens to focus light onto a sensor or film.",
    "Since option E directly corresponds to the task of taking photos through the use of a lens, I will conclude that this is the most accurate answer."
