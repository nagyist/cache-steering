  "query": "Question: Where do nurses work with older people?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: clinic\nC: doctor's office\nD: nursing home\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where nurses typically provide care for older people.",
    "Nurses often work in settings where healthcare services are specifically tailored to meet the needs of older adults.",
    "Thinking about the options, a \"park\" (A) is not a healthcare facility and is unlikely to involve nursing care for older people.",
    "\"Clinic\" (B) could be a relevant option, as some clinics serve older populations, but it's not exclusively dedicated to them.",
    "A \"doctor's office\" (C) may also serve older adults, but it is generally focused on specific visits rather than ongoing care.",
    "A \"nursing home\" (D) specifically provides residential care for older adults, focusing on their health and daily living needs, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Lastly, a \"hospital\" (E) provides acute care and may have older patients, but it is not a dedicated environment like a nursing home.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the most suitable answer for where nurses work with older people is indeed the nursing home, as it is designed to cater specifically to older individuals needing constant nursing care."
