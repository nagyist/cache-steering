  "query": "Question: What businesses  serve liquor?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar\nB: cabinet\nC: fraternity house\nD: soft drink\nE: state farm",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which businesses serve liquor, I need to understand the nature of each option provided.",
    "Option A is 'bar', which is commonly recognized as a business that primarily serves alcoholic beverages to customers.",
    "Option B is 'cabinet', which typically refers to a furniture piece used for storage and is not a type of business that serves liquor.",
    "Option C is 'fraternity house'. While some fraternity houses may host social events where alcohol is served, they are primarily residential places for students and not traditional businesses.",
    "Option D is 'soft drink', which refers to non-alcoholic beverages and suggests the opposite of serving liquor.",
    "Option E is 'state farm', which is an insurance company and does not serve liquor.",
    "From reasoning through each option, it is clear that only option A (bar) directly indicates a business that serves liquor.",
    "I will confirm that a bar is widely known and regulated to serve liquor, while other options do not meet that criterion.",
    "Since fraternity houses can sometimes host events with alcohol, they do not fit as a business serving liquor in the same definitive way that bars do.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only clear business that serves liquor is option A."
