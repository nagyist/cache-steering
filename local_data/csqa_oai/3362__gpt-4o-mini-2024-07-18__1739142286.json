  "steps": [
    "The question implies that he has a positive trait that contributes to his quick hiring prospects.",
    "Out of the choices provided, options A (frustration), D (stress), and E (rejection) suggest negative attributes that would not typically lead to quick hiring.",
    "That leaves us with options B (humor) and C (working hard) as potential positive traits.",
    "While having a sense of humor can be beneficial in the workplace, it doesn't directly correlate to getting hired quickly in a job application context.",
    "On the other hand, having a reputation for working hard is a strong positive trait that employers look for when hiring.",
    "A reputation for hard work would indicate reliability and dedication, which are highly valued in most job environments.",
    "Thus, based on the context of being hired quickly, the most logical conclusion is that his reputation for hard work played a significant role.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, option C (working hard) aligns best with the characteristics needed for quick employment."
