  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that most kids were enjoying themselves at the dance, implying an atmosphere of joy and activity.",
    "However, it specifically mentions a \"shy one,\" suggesting this individual is not participating in the same way as the rest of the kids.",
    "In the context of dances, a \"wallflower\" refers to someone who remains on the edge or sidelines, avoiding participation, often due to shyness.",
    "The term \"wallflower\" perfectly fits the description of a shy person during a dance, as they may feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable joining the others.",
    "Other options such as \"standing still\" or \"stand still\" do not convey the same social nuance. \"Partner\" and \"dancing\" imply engagement and are less likely for a shy individual.",
    "Thus, of the given choices, the best answer to describe a shy person's position at a school dance is \"wallflower.\""
