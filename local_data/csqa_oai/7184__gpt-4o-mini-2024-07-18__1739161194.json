  "query": "Question: What item does the fork belong on?\n\nChoices:\nA: plate\nB: video game\nC: kitchen drawer\nD: table\nE: road",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the primary function of a fork. A fork is typically used for eating and serves as a utensil in dining contexts.",
    "Next, I consider where forks are commonly found when they are not in use. They are often stored in kitchen drawers or cabinets.",
    "Then, I think about the contexts in which a fork is used. The most common scenarios involve dining, which typically occurs on a table or with a plate.",
    "I evaluate the choices given. A plate is where food is served, and forks are usually placed on or used with a plate during meals.",
    "Next, I consider the option of a table. A fork can also be placed directly on a table when setting it up for a meal.",
    "I review the kitchen drawer option, acknowledging that while forks can be stored there, it is not where they are primarily used.",
    "I eliminate \"video game\" and \"road\" since they are not relevant to typical fork usage at all.",
    "Now, comparing \"plate\" and \"table,\" I reflect that forks are usually placed on plates when fighting food rather than just laying on a table.",
    "I decide to visualize a typical dining setup. When eating, forks are most often found alongside plates on a table.",
    "Ultimately, since a fork is typically used with food served on a plate, I establish that the best answer would be that the fork belongs on a plate."
