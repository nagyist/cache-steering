  "steps": [
    "The question asks what has contributed to the bald eagle being a protected species.",
    "Bald eagles are known to rely on specific environments for nesting, hunting, and living.",
    "A key factor that has impacted bald eagles populations is the loss of their living environments.",
    "Natural habitats include forests, wetlands, and areas near large bodies of water where they can find food and build nests.",
    "Dwindling natural habitats can severely affect the survival and reproduction of the bald eagle.",
    "Looking at the options: A (nest), B (everglades), C (high places), D (in washington), and E (natural habitat).",
    "The term \"natural habitat\" encompasses the overall environments bald eagles need to thrive.",
    "While nests are important, they are part of the broader concept of natural habitat.",
    "Options B, C, and D are too specific or irrelevant to the bald eagle's general conservation needs.",
    "Therefore, the best choice that summarizes the reason for the bald eagle being a protected species due to dwindling resources is E."
