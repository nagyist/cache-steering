  "query": "Question: When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do?\n\nChoices:\nA: sit\nB: being sociable\nC: talk\nD: drinking\nE: medium",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of having food at a formal place, which typically involves dining etiquette.",
    "Second, sitting is often the first action taken when one arrives at a formal dining setting; it\u2019s where the meal begins.",
    "Third, being sociable is an important aspect of dining, especially in formal settings where interaction is encouraged.",
    "Fourth, talking is a form of sociability that is likely to occur during a meal, but it may not be the first action taken.",
    "Fifth, drinking can also be part of the dining experience, but it generally follows sitting and socializing, not preceding them.",
    "Sixth, the option \"medium\" seems out of context as it doesn\u2019t relate directly to an action taken during dining.",
    "Seventh, among the actions listed, sitting is an essential first step in any formal dining scenario.",
    "Eighth, being sociable, which includes both talking and engaging with others, is also a critical aspect, but it typically occurs after being seated.",
    "Ninth, talking is an action that happens while sitting and being sociable, which means it's part of the broader social interaction during the meal.",
    "Tenth, given the context, the action most directly associated with formal dining as a starting point is sitting rather than the other actions."
