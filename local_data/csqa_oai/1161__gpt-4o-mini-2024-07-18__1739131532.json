  "query": "Question: Where is confetti thrown from the rooftops?\n\nChoices:\nA: big cities\nB: new year's eve\nC: air\nD: shredder\nE: streets",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what confetti is and in what contexts it is typically used. Confetti is often associated with celebrations and parties.",
    "Next, I think about the location from which confetti is commonly thrown. It is often seen being thrown from elevated places during celebrations, such as rooftops or balconies.",
    "Now, I review the choices given in the question: A) big cities, B) new year's eve, C) air, D) shredder, E) streets.",
    "Among the choices, \"big cities\" (A) could be relevant for celebrations where confetti is thrown, but it does not specify rooftops.",
    "\"New year's eve\" (B) is an event where confetti is commonly used, particularly in large gatherings, but again does not specifically indicate rooftops.",
    "\"Air\" (C) is more of a physical space rather than a source. While confetti does end up in the air when thrown, it does not describe where it is thrown from.",
    "\"A shredder\" (D) does not relate to the act of throwing confetti.",
    "\"The streets\" (E) could refer to where confetti lands but does not indicate the source of where it is thrown from.",
    "Considering the context of celebrations, confetti is often thrown from rooftops during events, especially in big cities, and particularly seen on New Year\u2019s Eve. However, none of the choices directly state rooftops.",
    "Since the act of throwing confetti is often from elevated surfaces during events, and most notably New Year\u2019s Eve in big cities, the most appropriate answer that aligns closely with where confetti is thrown from would be 'big cities'."
