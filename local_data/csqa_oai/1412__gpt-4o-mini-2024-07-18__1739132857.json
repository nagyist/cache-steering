  "query": "Question: Where does a lizard that needs warmth likely live?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden\nB: new mexico books\nC: tropics\nD: china\nE: forrest",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the characteristics of lizards, specifically their habitat requirements. Lizards are ectothermic animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.",
    "Consider what type of environments provide warmth. Warm climates, such as tropical areas, provide consistent sunlight and heat, ideal for lizards to thrive.",
    "Evaluate the options provided: \n- A: Garden \u2013 gardens can vary in climate but are not specifically associated with warmth.\n- B: New Mexico books \u2013 this does not describe a habitat.\n- C: Tropics \u2013 tropical regions are known for their warm climates year-round.\n- D: China \u2013 while China has warm areas, it is a large country with diverse climates, so it is less certain.\n- E: Forrest \u2013 forests can also be variable in temperature and may not always provide consistent warmth.",
    "Determine which option most clearly represents a warm climate. The tropics are characterized by consistently warm temperatures, which are suitable for lizards that need warmth.",
    "Validate whether lizards are commonly found in the tropics. Many species of lizards indeed inhabit tropical areas where the temperatures are ideal for their survival and activity.",
    "Eliminate the other options based on their lack of consistent warmth compared to the tropics.",
    "Conclude that the most suitable habitat for a lizard that requires warmth is the tropics, as it directly meets their ecological and thermal needs."
