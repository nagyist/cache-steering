  "steps": [
    "To determine where the closest place to find a potato is, I will consider each option provided.",
    "Option A: Ireland is known for its potato cultivation, but whether it's the closest depends on my location, which is unspecified.",
    "Option B: Kitchen cupboard is a common storage place for potatoes in households, making it a very likely candidate for being the closest.",
    "Option C: England also has a significant potato farming industry, but again, its proximity to the individual asking the question is unclear.",
    "Option D: Chicken is not a location, and potatoes are not typically found with or among chickens, making this option unlikely.",
    "Option E: Maryland may have potato production, but like Ireland and England, the distance is uncertain without knowing the individual's location.",
    "Considering these options, the kitchen cupboard (Option B) is a specific, personal location that actually suggests having potatoes at hand if one cooks or prepares meals.",
    "Since I evaluated the choices based on proximity and relevance, kitchen cupboard stands out as the most logical choice where potatoes are likely found closest to a person."
