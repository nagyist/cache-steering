  "query": "Question: Where can you find a musician that no one is listening to?\n\nChoices:\nA: subway station\nB: symphony\nC: studio\nD: orchestra\nE: stage",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the characteristics of each location provided in the choices. A subway station often has buskers performing music, and while some may not pay attention, it often has some audience. A symphony usually has a focused audience, and people are expected to listen.",
    "Next, analyze the orchestra. Similar to the symphony, an orchestra performs in front of an audience that is traditionally engaged and focused on the music, meaning it is unlikely to have a musician that \"no one\" is listening to.",
    "Now, consider the stage. While performance on a stage can vary, it usually implies an audience. Performers on stage are typically expected to have at least some listeners, whether in a concert or a smaller performance.",
    "The studio, however, is a place where musicians often work alone or with a small number of collaborators. When musicians are recording, they may be playing to no audience at all, just the producers or sound engineers. This fits the description of a musician that no one is listening to.",
    "Thus, based on the analysis of the functions of each location, the studio is the most fitting choice for where a musician could be found without an audience."
