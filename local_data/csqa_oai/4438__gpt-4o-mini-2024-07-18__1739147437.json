  "steps": [
    "To determine where one should watch to avoid being pinched by a crab, we need to consider where crabs are commonly found.",
    "Crabs typically inhabit coastal areas, including beaches, tide pools, and estuaries. Thus, locations near water bodies are more likely to have crabs.",
    "The eastern coast generally has sandy beaches, tide pools, and mudflats where crabs live and can pinch people who venture near them.",
    "A sandy beach (choice B) is also a common place where crabs can be found, particularly in shifting sand environments during low tide.",
    "Focusing specifically on the options, the fish market (choice C) may have crabs, but it is not a natural habitat where someone might be pinched; rather, it\u2019s a place where crabs are sold.",
    "North Carolina (choice D) is an eastern coastal state and has sandy beaches where crabs can be found, but it is a broader location rather than a specific point of caution.",
    "Sand dunes (choice E) are often found near beaches but are not specifically places where crabs are commonly encountered in a way that results in pinching.",
    "By comparing all options, the fish market seems like the least likely place to be pinched by a crab since crabs are usually dead or contained there.",
    "Given that both the eastern coast and sandy beaches have crabs where pinching can occur, these choices (A and B) would necessitate careful watching to avoid being pinched.",
    "The question asks for \"where\" to avoid being pinched, making it a practical situation. Therefore, sandy beaches (B) would be the most direct answer since it truly reflects a location where one might commonly encounter crabs and need to be watchful."
