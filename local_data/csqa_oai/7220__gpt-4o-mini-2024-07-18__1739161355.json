  "query": "Question: Jerry was too old for this shit.  He was too square, too.  He never did drugs, never drank, but he was in his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fifties\nB: geometry\nC: polygon\nD: four sides\nE: town center",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence begins by indicating that Jerry is \"too old\" and \"too square,\" suggesting he is of an advanced age or has traditional, conservative qualities.",
    "The phrase \"never did drugs, never drank\" implies that Jerry has lived a life adhering to certain norms and perhaps has avoided risky behaviors common in younger demographics.",
    "Next, we need to analyze the choices given. Options B, C, D, and E do not relate to age and instead refer to geometry or locations, which are not applicable in this context.",
    "Thus, we focus on choice A, which refers to a numerical age range.",
    "Fifties is the only option that aligns with someone being \"too old\" for certain behaviors typically associated with youth.",
    "Considering the emotional tone of the excerpt, \"too old for this shit\" suggests someone who feels they no longer fit in with younger crowds or activities, further supporting an age-related answer rather than a location or geometrical reference.",
    "Therefore, the other options being irrelevant reinforces that A (fifties) must be the correct interpretation of Jerry\u2019s situation."
