  "query": "Question: If you have a small dog you can have it ride in what instead of walking?\n\nChoices:\nA: barbeque\nB: baby carriage\nC: carseat\nD: grandma's house\nE: basket",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question. It asks for an alternative to walking for a small dog.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided and whether they make sense for transporting a dog.",
    "Option A, \"barbeque,\" is irrelevant as it's not a mode of transportation.",
    "Option B, \"baby carriage,\" is a viable option as it can accommodate a small dog comfortably.",
    "Option C, \"carseat,\" could potentially work for a small dog but is generally designed for human passengers, not pets specifically.",
    "Option D, \"grandma's house,\" is a destination rather than a transportation option.",
    "Option E, \"basket,\" could be used to carry a small dog, depending on the basket's size and design.",
    "Now, I need to evaluate which options are most practical for transporting a small dog. The baby carriage (B) is designed for carrying and has safety features. A basket (E) might also work but isn't as secure or common for transporting a dog.",
    "Comparing B and E, the baby carriage is specifically intended for transport and is generally more suitable for a small dog than a basket.",
    "Thus, the best answer is the baby carriage (B) since it\u2019s designed for transporting smaller beings safely."
