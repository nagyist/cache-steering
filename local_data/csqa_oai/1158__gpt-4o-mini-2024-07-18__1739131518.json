  "steps": [
    "Analyze the context of the sentence. Sally found the people she hired entertaining. This suggests she valued their ability to engage and entertain her.",
    "Consider the phrase \u201cbut that was what she expected.\u201d This implies that there is a reason for her expectation of entertainment from the people she hired.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided to identify the one that relates to entertainment and expectation in a hiring context.",
    "Look at choice A: \"making friends.\" This does not relate to a professional context or a hired relationship.",
    "Examine choice B: \"fatigue.\" This also does not correlate with the context of hiring or expectations of entertainment.",
    "Assess choice C: \"envy.\" This does not make sense in the context of what is expected from hired individuals.",
    "Review choice D: \"getting paid for.\" This directly relates to a hired relationship where the expectation of entertainment can come from the professionals performing as part of their paid role.",
    "Consider choice E: \"appreciate more.\" Although appreciation could tie to their performance, it does not directly correlate with the expectation from hired entertainers.",
    "Having analyzed all the options, choice D stands out as the most logical answer because it connects the act of hiring with the expectation of entertainment due to being compensated for their services."
