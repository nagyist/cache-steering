  "query": "Question: Where would you find a desk normally occupied by a young person?\n\nChoices:\nA: office building\nB: schoolroom\nC: library\nD: bedroom\nE: gym",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify the environment where a young person typically uses a desk.",
    "An office building is mostly associated with adults working in professional settings, making this option less likely.",
    "A schoolroom is specifically designed for students and is a common place for young people to have desks for studying and learning.",
    "A library can have desks, but it is generally a space for independent study rather than occupied desks like those found in classrooms.",
    "A bedroom can also have a desk, but it is a personal space and not necessarily associated with young people in a formal or structured way, which lessens its relevance in this context.",
    "A gym is primarily focused on physical activities and does not typically contain desks used for study or work.",
    "Comparing the options, the schoolroom stands out as the most common association with young people and desks.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the answer is likely to be the schoolroom since it is directly related to the educational environment where young people usually have desks."
