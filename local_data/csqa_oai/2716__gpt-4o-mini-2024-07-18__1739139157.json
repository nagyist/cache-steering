  "query": "Question: At what institution can you learn about a shark, a whale, or a dolphin?\n\nChoices:\nA: bad movie\nB: pool hall\nC: bathtub\nD: outside\nE: marine museum",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one can learn about a shark, a whale, or a dolphin. These creatures are all marine animals, suggesting that the location should be related to the ocean or marine life.",
    "Let's analyze the options provided. \nOption A suggests \"bad movie,\" which is not a place for learning about marine life; rather, it suggests entertainment.",
    "Option B is \"pool hall,\" which is a location for playing billiards and has no connection to marine biology or learning about sea creatures.",
    "Option C states \"bathtub.\" While you can physically find water in a bathtub, it is not an educational venue for learning about sharks, whales, or dolphins.",
    "Option D is \"outside.\" While one could observe marine life in general outside, this option is vague and does not imply a structured learning environment regarding the specific animals mentioned.",
    "Option E is \"marine museum.\" This type of institution is specifically designed for the study and exhibition of marine life, including sharks, whales, and dolphins, making it highly relevant for learning about these creatures.",
    "Clearly, the marine museum stands out as the most appropriate choice given the context of learning specifically about marine animals."
