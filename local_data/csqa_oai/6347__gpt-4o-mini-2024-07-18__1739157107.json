  "query": "Question: The food show specialized in pizzas, each week they went to different states visiting a pizzeria in each of their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: chicago\nB: little italy\nC: new york\nD: friends house\nE: capital cities",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the food show specialized in pizzas and visited different states each week. Therefore, it's likely that they were looking for notable locations associated with pizza.",
    "Option A, \"chicago,\" is a city known for its famous deep-dish pizza, but it is not representative of other states.",
    "Option B, \"little italy,\" refers specifically to neighborhoods in various cities, primarily known for Italian restaurants, but again does not represent a state.",
    "Option C, \"new york,\" is known for its style of pizza (New York-style pizza) which is particularly famous, but like Chicago, it is a specific city rather than a state.",
    "Option D, \"friends house,\" doesn't logically fit a food show format visiting pizzerias, as it suggests private residences rather than public dining establishments.",
    "Option E, \"capital cities,\" suggests a broader category where many states have capital cities, and it's plausible that these cities could have notable pizzerias.",
    "Given that both Chicago and New York are cities known for specific styles of pizza and Little Italy is a specific area, they don't align with the concept of visiting various states' pizzerias.",
    "\"Friends house\" is not a fitting choice as a location for a professional food show.",
    "Thus, visiting \"capital cities\" allows for the exploration of many different states and their culinary offerings in a structured manner that makes sense for a show focused on pizzas."
