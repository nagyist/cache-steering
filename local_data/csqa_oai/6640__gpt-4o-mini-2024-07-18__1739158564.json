  "steps": [
    "The question states that bald eagles like to have a lay of the land even when they are not in flight. This suggests they prefer to be in a position where they can see their surroundings clearly.",
    "Bald eagles are known for their exceptional eyesight, which allows them to spot prey from a distance. Therefore, they tend to perch in locations that provide a good vantage point.",
    "Among the choices given, \"high places\" indicates a position that would offer a better view of the landscape as opposed to lower areas.",
    "Additionally, \u201ctree\u201d could also be a suitable answer since eagles often perch in tall trees; however, \"high places\" might refer to any elevated location, while \"tree\" is more specific.",
    "Considering eagle behavior, they often choose elevated platforms where they can survey a large area, such as tall trees or cliffs.",
    "The other provided options (A, B, C) do not directly relate to the eagle's behavior of seeking high ground to observe their surroundings.",
    "As such, \"high places\" would best encapsulate the behavior of bald eagles wanting to see their surroundings, as this term is broad and inclusive of many potential perches.",
    "I will now confirm that the best answer corresponds to the reasoning about their perched locations."
