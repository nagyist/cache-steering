  "query": "Question: What do you hold the handle of after going to Starbucks?\n\nChoices:\nA: gripping\nB: briefcase\nC: carry object\nD: frying pan\nE: coffee cup",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what items are commonly associated with a visit to Starbucks.",
    "Starbucks is a coffee shop, so it's likely that people go there to buy coffee or related beverages.",
    "I analyze each choice to see which one is most relevant to the experience that typically follows visiting Starbucks.",
    "Option A, \"gripping,\" is a vague term that doesn't refer to a specific object.",
    "Option B, \"briefcase,\" is unrelated to the typical Starbucks experience, as customers do not commonly buy or carry briefcases from there.",
    "Option C, \"carry object,\" is also vague and does not specify what object is meant.",
    "Option D, \"frying pan,\" is completely unrelated to Starbucks and the food & drink it offers.",
    "Option E, \"coffee cup,\" directly relates to what one would typically hold after visiting Starbucks since most people purchase drinks served in coffee cups.",
    "Therefore, based on my reasoning, the most logical answer is the one that corresponds with a common item obtained from Starbucks."
