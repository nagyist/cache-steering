  "query": "Question: Where can you spend the night on the ground floor when you're away from home?\n\nChoices:\nA: brownstone\nB: highrise building\nC: hotel\nD: subway\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of each option in relation to spending a night away from home.",
    "A brownstone is typically a residential building and may not offer overnight accommodations for travelers.",
    "A highrise building could be residential or commercial, but it also generally doesn't provide overnight accommodations.",
    "A hotel is specifically designed to accommodate guests overnight, making it a suitable option for spending the night.",
    "A subway is primarily a public transportation system, not a place where people can legally or comfortably spend the night.",
    "An office building is usually where work is conducted and not intended for overnight stays, with few exceptions.",
    "Evaluate the practicality of spending the night in each option based on accessibility and legality.",
    "A hotel stands out because it is explicitly designed for lodging and accommodates travelers.",
    "None of the other options provide adequate or lawful settings for overnight stays like a hotel does.",
    "Thus, based on all evaluations, the most suitable choice for spending the night away from home is a hotel."
