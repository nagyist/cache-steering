  "query": "Question: What is going to happen if you kill people?\n\nChoices:\nA: get punished\nB: vengeance\nC: going to prison\nD: joy\nE: going to jail",
  "steps": [
    "The act of killing people is illegal in almost all societies.",
    "The legal consequences of murder typically include arrest and prosecution.",
    "If found guilty, a person is likely to face imprisonment.",
    "There are different legal terms associated with being incarcerated, such as \"going to prison\" and \"going to jail,\" which can be similar but often refer to different types of facilities.",
    "Option A mentions getting punished, which is a general consequence but does not specify where one would be punished.",
    "Option B mentions vengeance. While it may happen on a personal level, it is not a direct legal consequence of killing someone.",
    "Option D suggests joy, which is not an expected emotional response to killing someone, especially in relation to the consequences.",
    "Option E, \"going to jail,\" is a correct consequence but usually refers to a temporary detention facility, while \"going to prison\" implies a longer-term incarceration.",
    "Upon analyzing the choices, \"going to prison\" (C) and \"going to jail\" (E) are both valid, but \"going to prison\" encompasses the full range of consequences for more severe convictions like murder.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate final answer, taking into account the likelihood of serious legal consequences, is option C."
