  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the options provided to determine which piece of office furniture is designed to store paper files.",
    "The first option, \"drawer,\" can hold papers, but it is too vague as a standalone item for proper file storage.",
    "The second option, \"filing cabinet,\" specifically denotes a type of office furniture that is utilized primarily for storing files and documents in an organized manner.",
    "The third option, \"computers,\" are not furniture and do not store paper files; instead, they store digital files.",
    "The fourth option, \"desk,\" is primarily a work surface and while it may have drawers, it doesn't specifically identify as a storage solution for paper files.",
    "The fifth option, \"filing cabinet,\" is repeated and confirms that it is indeed meant for storing paper files.",
    "Having identified \"filing cabinet\" as a specialized piece of furniture for storing paper files, I can eliminate the other options based on their description.",
    "To summarize, \"filing cabinet\" directly answers the question about storing paper files, while the other options do not fulfill this requirement adequately."
