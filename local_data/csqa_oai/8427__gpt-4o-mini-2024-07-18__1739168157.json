  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"waiting on a bench for something on tracks.\" This implies that whatever is being waited for is likely to be a mode of transportation that travels on tracks.",
    "Considering modes of transportation that run on tracks, the main options are trains and some types of light rail or trams.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option in relation to the presence of tracks and benches for waiting.",
    "Option A, \"train station,\" typically has benches for passengers to wait and there are trains that run on tracks, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Option B, \"state park,\" generally does not involve trains or tracks, and while there may be benches, it does not match the criteria.",
    "Option C, \"crosswalk,\" does not fit because it's a pedestrian passage and does not have benches specifically for waiting for trains or buses.",
    "Option D, \"bus stop,\" has benches but buses do not run on tracks, thus it does not satisfy the requirement of waiting for something on tracks.",
    "Option E, \"bus depot,\" as with the previous option, accommodates buses primarily, and buses also do not run on tracks.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only one that involves waiting on a bench for something that travels on tracks is the train station."
