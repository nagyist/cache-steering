  "query": "Question: The friends enjoyed getting together to play cards, even though one of them always won because he was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: winning\nB: bored\nC: have fun\nD: excellent\nE: good at",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the friends enjoyed playing cards together. This implies a social activity, where enjoyment is central.",
    "One of the friends always wins, which indicates a skill level that is higher than that of the others. The phrase \"always won\" is a significant clue.",
    "Now, we look at the choices presented. The correct choice should explain why this friend consistently wins.",
    "Choice A: \"winning\" is not a characteristic that explains why he wins; it is a state rather than a reason.",
    "Choice B: \"bored\" does not relate to winning skills and does not make sense in this context.",
    "Choice C: \"have fun\" does not explain the reason for winning and is more about the activity rather than skill.",
    "Choice D: \"excellent\" could imply high skill, but it is somewhat vague and doesn\u2019t specifically connect to the activity of winning in cards.",
    "Choice E: \"good at\" directly correlates to having skill in the game, which is why this friend is able to win consistently.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing all choices, the best answer that explains why one of the friends always wins is \"good at.\""
