  "query": "Question: If I wanted to see a lizard in its natural habitat but I do not speak Spanish, where would I go?\n\nChoices:\nA: utah\nB: south america\nC: new hampshire\nD: japan\nE: new mexico",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify regions where lizards can be found in their natural habitats.",
    "Lizards are commonly found in warm climates, typically in regions like deserts, forests, and tropical areas.",
    "Now, I will evaluate each choice to see if it is known for lizard habitats.",
    "Utah (Choice A) is a desert state where various lizard species can be found, particularly in its desert regions.",
    "South America (Choice B) is home to a wide variety of lizard species, particularly in tropical regions like the Amazon.",
    "New Hampshire (Choice C) is largely temperate and has fewer lizard species due to its colder climate.",
    "Japan (Choice D) has some lizards, but it is not particularly renowned for a diverse lizard population in comparison to other regions.",
    "New Mexico (Choice E) is also a desert state with a rich diversity of lizard species.",
    "Next, I need to consider the language barrier mentioned in the question. Since I do not speak Spanish, I should avoid regions where Spanish is predominantly spoken, which eliminates South America and New Mexico.",
    "The remaining options are Utah (Choice A) and New Hampshire (Choice C). New Hampshire is less likely to have diverse lizard habitats.",
    "Therefore, Utah is the best choice because it offers a suitable habitat for lizards and does not predominantly speak Spanish."
