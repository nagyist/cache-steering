  "query": "Question: Where is someone living in new York City's bathroom located that they use the most?\n\nChoices:\nA: at hotel\nB: restaurant\nC: public building\nD: public place\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of the question: it is asking about where someone lives in New York City and refers to the bathroom they use the most.",
    "Analyze each of the choices in relation to where a person would primarily reside in New York City.",
    "Choice A (at hotel): While hotels have bathrooms, someone living at a hotel is typically a temporary guest rather than a permanent resident.",
    "Choice B (restaurant): A restaurant is a place where one might eat or socialize, but it is not typically a place where someone resides nor uses the bathroom regularly.",
    "Choice C (public building): Public buildings may have bathrooms, but they are not considered places where someone lives and would use a bathroom every day.",
    "Choice D (public place): Similar to public buildings, public places like parks or streets don't constitute a residence and involve transient bathroom use.",
    "Choice E (apartment): An apartment is a common form of residence in New York City where someone would live and use the bathroom daily.",
    "Evaluate which answer best fits the context of someone living in New York City and using their bathroom the most.",
    "Since the question specifies \"living in New York City,\" it strongly implies a permanent residence, which points to the apartment being the correct answer."
