  "query": "Question: He was a man with many loose morals, but when it came to his wife he was always what?\n\nChoices:\nA: compact\nB: discreet\nC: unfaithful\nD: faithful\nE: close fitting",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a man with \"many loose morals,\" which implies that he may not uphold strong ethical standards generally.",
    "However, it specifically states that when it came to his wife, he had a different behavior, suggesting a contrast to his overall moral status.",
    "The word \"always\" suggests that his behavior towards his wife is consistent and unwavering.",
    "The options include \"compact,\" \"discreet,\" \"unfaithful,\" \"faithful,\" and \"close fitting.\"",
    "Considering the context of a man with loose morals, it would be unlikely for him to be described as \"faithful\" unless it indicates a significant exception made for his wife.",
    "The term \"unfaithful\" aligns with the idea of someone with loose morals, suggesting extramarital activities.",
    "However, the wording of the question implies he might behave differently with his wife, potentially being faithful.",
    "The options \"discreet\" and \"faithful\" imply a level of respect and commitment potentially towards his wife, contrary to his other behaviors.",
    "Given the phrasing, \"when it came to his wife he was always,\" it favors the notion that despite the man's nature, there may be a highlighting of a fidelity to his wife.",
    "Thus, the most logical interpretation leaning towards loyalty in this context is that he would be described as \"faithful.\""
