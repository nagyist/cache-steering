  "query": "Question: What would someone wear to protect themselves from a cannon?\n\nChoices:\nA: ungulate\nB: bomber\nC: body armor\nD: tank\nE: hat",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a cannon is and the type of damage it can cause. Cannons are large artillery weapons that fire projectiles at high velocity, capable of causing significant injury or death.",
    "Next, we want to consider what kind of attire or equipment could effectively protect someone from the impact of cannon fire or shrapnel.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"ungulate\" refers to a hoofed mammal and does not signify any form of protective gear. Therefore, it is not a valid choice.",
    "The term \"bomber\" could refer to bomber jackets or bomber planes. In this context, neither provides substantial protection against cannon fire, making it an unsuitable option.",
    "The option \"body armor\" generally refers to protective clothing designed to absorb or deflect physical attacks, including gunfire or explosive impacts. This aligns closely with the need for protection from a cannon.",
    "The choice \"tank\" refers to armored vehicles used in warfare. While they offer significant protection, the question implies what an individual would wear rather than operate or utilize.",
    "Lastly, the option \"hat\" would not provide any meaningful protection against a cannon, which demonstrates that it is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the only viable option for protection against cannon fire is \"body armor.\""
