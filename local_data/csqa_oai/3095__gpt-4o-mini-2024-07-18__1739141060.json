  "query": "Question: What do eating hamburgers in excess lead to short term?\n\nChoices:\nA: gain weight\nB: health problems\nC: death\nD: nausea\nE: tomato",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the effects of consuming excess food, particularly hamburgers, in the short term.",
    "Eating hamburgers typically includes high levels of calories, fats, and sodium. This can lead to immediate physical discomforts.",
    "One common short-term effect of overeating is nausea, as the body struggles to process an excessive amount of food.",
    "While gaining weight can occur over time with excess caloric intake, it is a longer-term effect rather than a short-term one.",
    "Health problems can arise, but they tend to manifest over a longer period rather than immediately after a single meal.",
    "Death is an extreme consequence and is highly unlikely to occur from excessive hamburger consumption in the short term, especially for an otherwise healthy individual.",
    "Therefore, out of the given choices, nausea is the most plausible immediate effect of consuming too many hamburgers.",
    "To finalize, I need to choose the answer that aligns with this reasoning."
