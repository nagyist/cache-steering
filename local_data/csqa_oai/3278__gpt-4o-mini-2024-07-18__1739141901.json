  "query": "Question: The woman was yelling obscenities in public, and while it was entertaining for people passing by, what did her husband feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: happiness\nB: embarrassment\nC: fatigue\nD: fulfillment\nE: enjoyment",
  "steps": [
    "The woman is yelling obscenities in public. Yelling obscenities often attracts attention and can be socially inappropriate.",
    "People passing by might find the situation entertaining, suggesting that it deviates from social norms and can be amusing in a public context.",
    "The husband of the woman is likely to have a different reaction than the onlookers. He may feel responsible for her behavior, which could lead to feelings of embarrassment.",
    "Husbands often experience a social obligation to maintain their partner's reputation, and public outbursts can negatively affect that perception.",
    "While others may laugh or enjoy the antics, the husband might feel a disconnect from the amusement because he is tied to her actions.",
    "Other choices such as happiness, fulfillment, and enjoyment imply positive emotions, which are unlikely given that his wife is causing a public scene.",
    "Fatigue is also a less likely response; while he may feel stressed, fatigue typically relates to physical tiredness, not directly to the situation described.",
    "Considering all these aspects, the most fitting emotional reaction of the husband in this context is embarrassment, as that aligns with social expectations and personal feelings in reaction to public behavior."
