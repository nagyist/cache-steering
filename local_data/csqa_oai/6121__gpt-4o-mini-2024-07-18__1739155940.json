  "query": "Question: Where would you see a picture created by a professional?\n\nChoices:\nA: wall\nB: shelf\nC: on a wall\nD: desktop\nE: art show",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of the question, which asks where you might see a picture created by a professional.",
    "Pictures created by professionals are often displayed in places where art is showcased or appreciated.",
    "Looking at the options, \"wall\" and \"on a wall\" both imply that pictures can be hung or displayed.",
    "The option \"shelf\" suggests a place for objects but is not typically where pictures are prominently displayed.",
    "The option \"desktop\" might refer to a computer screen or an office space but generally does not pertain to professionally created artwork.",
    "The option \"art show\" is a specific event where professional artwork is displayed, making it a strong contender.",
    "However, one can see professional pictures that are part of an art show displayed \"on a wall.\"",
    "Analyzing the options further, \"on a wall\" specifically indicates a display location for art, while \"art show\" refers to an event rather than a location per se.",
    "Since the question asks for a place rather than a type of event, \"on a wall\" fits better as a direct answer.",
    "However, both \"art show\" and \"on a wall\" are valid answers, but \"art show\" may imply a broader range of professional artworks in context."
