  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider each option and the context of where a lot of beds might typically be found.",
    "Option A, \"Bedford,\" could imply a place related to beds (since \"bed\" is in the name), but it is more of a geographical location and does not necessarily mean there will be a lot of beds there.",
    "Option B, \"rest area,\" generally refers to a stopping place for travelers, typically having restrooms and sometimes picnic tables or benches, but not usually beds.",
    "Option C, \"neighbor's house,\" could have beds, but it's uncertain how many would be there, as it depends on the specific household.",
    "Option D, \"hospital,\" usually has multiple beds in patient rooms and wards to accommodate patients, which suggests a significant number of beds.",
    "Option E, \"loft,\" typically refers to a type of living space and may or may not have beds, but it usually has fewer beds compared to a hospital.",
    "After evaluating all these options, the one that most commonly has a lot of beds is the hospital, given that it is specifically designed for that purpose."
