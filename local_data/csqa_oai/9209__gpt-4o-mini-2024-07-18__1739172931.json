  "query": "Question: A super ball is a popular what that children enjoy?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy\nB: park\nC: earball\nD: play with\nE: bounces",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a super ball is commonly known as. A super ball is primarily recognized as a type of object that children play with.",
    "Next, examine the context of the question, which is specifically about something popular among children.",
    "Look through the answer choices provided to see which one fits the description of this object being popular among children.",
    "Option A suggests \"toy,\" which fits well since a super ball is indeed a toy utilized for play.",
    "Option B, \"park,\" is not directly related to super balls. While they can be used in parks, a park is not specifically a thing children enjoy playing with.",
    "Option C, \"earball,\" does not seem relevant at all; it sounds like a misinterpretation or a misspelling.",
    "Option D, \"play with,\" describes an action rather than an object, so it doesn't fit as an answer.",
    "Option E, \"bounces,\" describes a quality of the super ball rather than what children enjoy in terms of a category.",
    "Since only option A stands out as a clear match for something that is popular among children and directly correlates to a super ball, we can arrive at the answer."
