  "query": "Question: Bob the mouse lived in a densely populated area.  Where might he look for shelter?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: corn field\nC: abandoned houses\nD: shed\nE: desktop",
  "steps": [
    "Bob the mouse needs to find a place to shelter from predators and weather conditions in a densely populated area.",
    "The kitchen (Choice A) is a common place for food, but it may also be crowded with humans which could pose a danger to Bob.",
    "A corn field (Choice B) is likely away from the population, but it may not provide immediate shelter and might expose Bob to dangers like birds.",
    "Abandoned houses (Choice C) can offer good shelter since they are often safe from human disturbance and can provide nesting material, but their condition and safety may vary.",
    "A shed (Choice D) can offer some protection, especially if it\u2019s in a backyard, but it may also be somewhat frequented by humans.",
    "A desktop (Choice E) is an unusual choice. While it may seem safe, it\u2019s not a practical place for shelter as it\u2019s an indoor environment typically disturbed by the inhabitants.",
    "Considering the options, shelters that are both safe and somewhat secluded from humans would be more favorable for Bob.",
    "Between all the choices, abandoned houses might provide the best all-around opportunity for safety, resources, and protection from the densely populated area."
