  "steps": [
    "The troublemaker expected a lenient or soft punishment, indicating they desired a lighter sentence.",
    "The phrase \"but the ruling handed down was quite what\" suggests that the ruling was unexpected and possibly severe.",
    "To evaluate the choices, we need to identify synonyms or words that convey the idea of a strict or severe punishment.",
    "Looking at the options, \"harsh\" (B) directly implies severity and strictness, contrasting with the troublemaker's hope for leniency.",
    "The word \"hard\" (D) could also imply a strict punishment; however, \"harsh\" is a more precise term used in the context of punishments.",
    "The options \"ruled\" (A) and \"sensible\" (E) do not convey any sense of severity regarding punishment.",
    "The word \"abrasive\" (C) typically refers to a rough texture or a personality trait and does not accurately describe a punishment.",
    "Based on this evaluation, the most fitting word that completes the sentence regarding the unexpected severity of the ruling is \"harsh.\""
