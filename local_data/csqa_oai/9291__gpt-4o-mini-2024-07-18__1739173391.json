  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"he kept calling\" suggests that the person was trying to reach out to someone or something repeatedly.",
    "The term \"to no avail\" indicates that these attempts were unsuccessful, meaning he did not achieve his goal through those calls.",
    "To understand what he was hoping to get, we should consider the common purpose of making calls, which is usually to get a response or some kind of information.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, option A (communicate) is a broad term but does not specify a direct goal or outcome.",
    "Option B (answer) aligns closely with the context since the common expectation when calling someone is to receive an answer.",
    "Option C (attracting ducks) does not relate to the context of making calls and is clearly an outlier.",
    "Option D (hang up) contradicts the action of \"kept calling\" because if he was calling, he wouldn't be wanting to hang up.",
    "Option E (respond) is also relevant since it implies he wanted a reply, which is similar to receiving an answer.",
    "Between options B (answer) and E (respond), both relate closely, but \"answer\" is more directly tied to what one typically expects when making a phone call.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer that directly aligns with the context of calling is option B (answer)."
