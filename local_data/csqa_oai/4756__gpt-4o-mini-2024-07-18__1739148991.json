    "The question asks about the location of some of the most famous skyscrapers on the east coast of the U.S.",
    "Chicago is known for its skyscrapers, but it is located in the Midwest, not the east coast.",
    "To find a location on the east coast with famous skyscrapers, I need to consider major cities in that region.",
    "New York City is a well-known major city on the east coast and is famous for its skyline, which includes many iconic skyscrapers.",
    "While \"large city\" (Choice C) is somewhat vague and could refer to several places, it does not specify a well-known location.",
    "\"Big city\" (Choice A) is also vague, similar to \"large city\".",
    "\"In the sky\" (Choice D) does not make sense in the context of where skyscrapers are physically located.",
    "Since the question specifically relates to the east coast, and New York City is the premier example of famous skyscrapers there, it is the best answer.",
