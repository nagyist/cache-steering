  "query": "Question: It was a very expensive wristwatch, when he wasn't wearing it he kept it displayed in it's what?\n\nChoices:\nA: jewelery box\nB: hock\nC: jewelry store\nD: case\nE: dresser",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the wristwatch is very expensive and that he kept it displayed when not wearing it.",
    "Knowing that expensive items often require protective storage, I can deduce that it wouldn't be left out in the open or just put on a surface like a dresser.",
    "Considering the options, \"jewelry box\" (A) is typically used for storing jewelry, but does not imply display.",
    "\"Hock\" (B) does not relate to jewelry storage; it refers to pawning an item.",
    "\"Jewelry store\" (C) also does not fit because that\u2019s a retail space, not a personal display.",
    "\"Case\" (D) could refer to a display case or a protective case that is designed for showing off high-value items like watches.",
    "\"Dresser\" (E) does not convey a protective display; it's just a piece of furniture.",
    "Comparing \"case\" and \"jewelry box,\" the term \"case\" is more aligned with a display purpose for a wristwatch.",
    "Therefore, the most suitable option that reflects both the protection and display of the wristwatch is \"case.\""
