  "query": "Question: Where could you find 10 or 100 home that are attached together?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighborhood\nB: apartment building\nC: michigan\nD: countryside\nE: city or town",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for locations where multiple homes are attached together, implying some form of housing structure.",
    "Choice A: \"neighborhood\" refers to an area where homes are located but does not specifically indicate that the homes are attached.",
    "Choice B: \"apartment building\" signifies a multi-unit structure where many homes (apartments) are attached together, often in the range of 10 to 100 units.",
    "Choice C: \"michigan\" is a location that may have attached homes, but it is too broad and does not specify a housing structure.",
    "Choice D: \"countryside\" typically refers to rural areas, where homes are generally detached rather than attached.",
    "Choice E: \"city or town\" suggests urban settings where homes can be attached, but it is still less specific than \"apartment building.\"",
    "Since attached homes usually refer to units within buildings rather than stand-alone houses, \"apartment building\" clearly fits the description best.",
    "Reviewing the choices, \"apartment building\" is the only option that inherently involves a design of many homes being attached together.",
    "Thus, \"apartment building\" maximally fulfills the criteria of having 10 or 100 homes that are attached together."
