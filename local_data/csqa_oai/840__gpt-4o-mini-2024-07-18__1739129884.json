  "query": "Question: Mark wanted to know the truth, because he didn't want to continue existing in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: understand\nB: were there\nC: ignorance\nD: in-between\nE: ignorant",
  "steps": [
    "I will first analyze the question by identifying Mark's motivation for wanting to know the truth.",
    "The phrase \"want to know the truth\" suggests a desire for clarity or understanding, indicating that the alternative is undesirable.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each choice to see if it fits with the idea of an undesirable state Mark wishes to avoid.",
    "Choice A: \"understand\" does not fit well, as understanding would be a result of knowing the truth, not a state of existence.",
    "Choice B: \"were there\" is an incomplete thought and doesn\u2019t relate to the concept of existing in an undesirable state.",
    "Choice C: \"ignorance\" is the state of lacking knowledge or awareness, which aligns well with Mark\u2019s pursuit of truth. Ignorance is generally considered undesirable.",
    "Choice D: \"in-between\" refers to a state of uncertainty or ambiguity. While this could relate to not knowing, it is not as direct as the concept of ignorance.",
    "Choice E: \"ignorant\" is the adjective form of ignorance, meaning lack of knowledge. However, it doesn't capture the state of existing as a noun does.",
    "Upon reviewing all options, the most directly relevant answer is \"ignorance,\" as it embodies the state Mark wants to escape by pursuing the truth."
