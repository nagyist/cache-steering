  "query": "Question: Where can you learn about operations with numbers?\n\nChoices:\nA: math book\nB: phonebook\nC: statistic\nD: music school\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what the question is asking: it wants to know where one can learn about operations with numbers.",
    "Operations with numbers generally refer to basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which are fundamental components of mathematics.",
    "Consider the options provided: A (math book), B (phonebook), C (statistic), D (music school), E (office).",
    "Option A, a math book, is specifically designed to teach mathematical concepts, including operations with numbers.",
    "Option B, a phonebook, is a directory for contact information and does not contain educational material on numbers or mathematics.",
    "Option C, statistic, refers to a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection and analysis, but it is not directly about learning basic operations with numbers.",
    "Option D, music school, is focused on teaching music and does not relate to mathematics or operations with numbers.",
    "Option E, office, is typically a workplace and is not related to educational resources for learning math.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only one that directly addresses the need to learn about operations with numbers is option A, the math book."
