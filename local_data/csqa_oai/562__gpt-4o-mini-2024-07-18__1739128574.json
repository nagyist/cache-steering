  "steps": [
    "To analyze the negative effects of a divorce, it is essential to consider the impacts on individuals who are connected to the spouses but are not married to them.",
    "Divorce can lead to a lot of grief for friends and family as they witness the breakup and the emotional turmoil it causes, suggesting that option A may be valid.",
    "Depression is often a direct effect on the spouses, but friends and family may also experience empathy or concern leading to their own sadness, supporting option B.",
    "The option C, \"no spouse,\" isn't directly relevant to individuals other than the couple involved, making it less applicable.",
    "Divorce can lead to financial strain on the spouses, which could also affect those financially tied to them, like family or friends, suggesting option D could be relevant.",
    "However, the most direct negative impact on individuals other than the spouses generally comes from the presence of children, who often suffer during and after a divorce\u2014thus highlighting option E.",
    "Considering all these factors, option E, \"children suffer,\" stands out because children are a direct extension of the couple and are impacted emotionally and psychologically by the divorce.",
    "While options A, B, and D have merit and can be argued, the effect on children tends to be more pronounced and severe, solidifying option E as the most significant negative effect on others due to a divorce."
