  "steps": [
    "To find out which type of home is most likely to have an attic filled with historical items, we should first consider the characteristics of attics in general. Attics are often used for storage, which might include older belongings or items of sentimental value.",
    "Next, we evaluate the age of the house. Older houses tend to have attics that have been used for storage over many years, which increases the likelihood of having historical items.",
    "Now, let's analyze the specific types of houses in the choices provided. \"Victorian houses\" (C) are a category of older houses that are known for their elaborate architecture and often have spacious attics.",
    "We should also consider that while \"older houses\" (B) includes many styles, it is a broader category than \"Victorian houses.\" Victorian houses are specifically known for their characteristic designs and the time period they represent, making them unique in the context of historical items.",
    "Looking at \"own home\" (D), this does not specify an age or type and therefore does not directly imply a relationship to historical items in the attic.",
    "\u201cMaterial\u201d (E) doesn\u2019t relate to the type of home, and therefore it isn\u2019t relevant to the question.",
    "Finally, although both \"older houses\" and \"Victorian houses\" might have attics filled with historical items, the specificity of \"Victorian house\" makes it the best candidate for having an attic with historical items."
