  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what the phrase \"thought that her party was a surprise\" implies. Sarah expected something unexpected or different.",
    "Next, if the party was \"entirely\" something else, it would mean it didn't meet her expectation of a surprise.",
    "The choices given are A: bland, B: predictable, C: known about, D: boring, and E: send flowers.",
    "Now, let's examine what \"surprise\" would imply if the opposite were true. A surprise party being predictable would mean that the guests and the setting were expected by Sarah.",
    "The word \"known about\" in choice C also suggests that Sarah was already aware of the party, which contradicts her impression of it being a surprise.",
    "However, \"predictable\" signifies that the outcome or nature of the party was something she could foresee, aligning more closely with what it means to be surprised or unexpected.",
    "\"Known about\" feels like too strong a phrase, implying she fully was in the loop about the party, which may not be the case that Sarah felt surprise.",
    "Comparing the nuances of \"predictable\" and \"known about,\" \"predictable\" captures the essence of something that might still be surprising in concept but was expected in practice\u2014thus fitting better in this context.",
    "Finally, let's select a single letter based on the reasoning that the party was likely not unexpected in outcome (predictable) rather than fully known."
