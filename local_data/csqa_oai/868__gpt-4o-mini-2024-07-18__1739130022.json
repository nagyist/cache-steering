  "query": "Question: My house is very dry, with little water in the air. What tool should I use to fix this?\n\nChoices:\nA: humidifier\nB: surface of earth\nC: skating rink\nD: ice cube\nE: burn it to the ground",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that the house is very dry, which indicates that the humidity level in the air is low.",
    "To fix this issue, I need a tool or device that can increase the humidity in the air.",
    "Looking at the options provided: \n- A humidifier is specifically designed to add moisture to the air, making it a suitable choice for increasing humidity.\n- The surface of the earth does not directly address the humidity issue in the house.\n- A skating rink is primarily for recreation and does not relate to humidity levels.\n- Ice cubes may temporarily add moisture, but they are not a practical or effective long-term solution for increasing air humidity.\n- Burning it to the ground would cause complete destruction and certainly not resolve the issue of dryness.",
    "Given that the only option that directly addresses the issue of low humidity in the air is the humidifier, it seems to be the most logical choice."
