  "query": "Question: Where would you usually find a hole made by an animal?\n\nChoices:\nA: trap\nB: golf course\nC: wall\nD: ground\nE: swiss cheese",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of where animals typically create holes. Animals dig or burrow into the ground to create homes or nests.",
    "Examine each option provided: \n- A: trap - This is usually a mechanism to catch animals, not a place where they would create holes.\n- B: golf course - While there may be ground holes (like for the cups), these are not made by animals.\n- C: wall - Some animals might create holes in walls (like rodents), but it is less common compared to the ground.\n- D: ground - Many animals, such as rabbits and moles, dig into the ground to make their habitats. \n- E: swiss cheese - This is a product and has holes, but these are not made by animals in a natural habitat sense.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most common place for an animal-made hole is in the ground, considering that many animals burrow or dig to create their living spaces or nests.",
    "Conclude that the best answer is the ground, as it aligns perfectly with how / where many animals create holes."
