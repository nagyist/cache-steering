    "To determine what adult people are usually expected to do, we should consider societal norms and responsibilities associated with adulthood.",
    "Shaking hands (Choice A) is a common greeting gesture but is not an expectation or responsibility of adulthood.",
    "Owning property (Choice B) may be common for some adults but is not universally expected, as many adults rent or live with family.",
    "Paying bills (Choice C) is a significant responsibility that comes with adulthood, as adults typically manage their own finances and obligations.",
    "Smoking (Choice D) is not an expectation and is generally discouraged due to health concerns. It is a personal choice rather than a societal norm.",
    "Talking to each other (Choice E) is a general social behavior, but it doesn't specifically represent an expectation tied to adult responsibilities.",
    "Among the choices analyzed, the action that directly correlates to a responsibility typically expected of adults is paying bills, as it signifies financial independence and maturity."
