  "query": "Question: Where would you sit in a waiting room before getting an x-ray of your jaw?\n\nChoices:\nA: waiting room\nB: doctor's office\nC: maternity ward\nD: dentist's office\nE: clinic",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to sit before getting an x-ray of the jaw, I need to consider the context of having a jaw x-ray.",
    "X-rays of the jaw are typically performed in specific healthcare settings where dental or oral health services are provided.",
    "The options provided include locations like a waiting room, a doctor's office, a maternity ward, a dentist's office, and a clinic.",
    "A maternity ward is focused on prenatal and postnatal care and is not relevant for a jaw x-ray.",
    "A doctor's office could be a general healthcare setting, but it doesn't specifically indicate it handles dental x-rays.",
    "A dentist's office specifically deals with dental work, including x-rays of the teeth and jaw, and would be a suitable place for the procedure.",
    "A clinic may also conduct various healthcare services, but it is less specific than a dentist's office when it comes to jaw x-rays.",
    "Considering that a jaw x-ray is most relevant to dental health, the most logical place to wait before such an x-ray would be at the dentist's office.",
    "Thus, among the provided choices, the answer must be the dentist's office, which directly correlates with the context of the x-ray."
