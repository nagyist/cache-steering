  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the baby came unexpectedly; this suggests an event that was not anticipated.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"died\" (A) does not correlate with the idea of \"came\" since that implies arrival rather than absence.",
    "The choice \"boy or girl\" (B) is simply a classification of the baby and does not directly answer what the baby did upon arriving.",
    "The choice \"learn to walk\" (C) refers to a developmental milestone that occurs later in a child's life, not immediately upon arrival.",
    "\"Talk nonsense\" (D) is an action that would typically happen as the child grows and begins to communicate, not something that occurs right at birth.",
    "\"Arrive early\" (E) fits the context of coming unexpectedly, as it suggests that the baby came before it was anticipated.",
    "Among all the choices, \"arrive early\" (E) is the only one that fits logically and contextually with the rest of the question's phrasing."
