  "query": "Question: Where would you put sunglasses if you do not have anything to put them in that can be carried with you?\n\nChoices:\nA: stores along beach\nB: shirt pocket\nC: eye doctor\nD: drugstore\nE: bag",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify a location where sunglasses can be placed without a carrying case and that is available to the person at that moment.",
    "Options A (stores along beach), C (eye doctor), and D (drugstore) suggest commercial or professional locations. These don't typically serve as practical locations for placing sunglasses temporarily.",
    "Option E (bag) assumes the person has a bag to put the sunglasses into, which contradicts the condition of not having anything to carry them in.",
    "This leaves option B (shirt pocket) as the only viable solution for placing the sunglasses, given that they can fit into a shirt pocket without needing a case.",
    "To ensure that sunglasses can indeed fit into a shirt pocket, we must recognize that most sunglasses are designed relatively compactly and can indeed fit into standard-sized shirt pockets.",
    "With all other options either requiring storage or additional items the person does not have, placing sunglasses in a shirt pocket becomes the most logical step.",
    "Thus, shirt pocket is both a practical and accessible option for placing sunglasses temporarily without anything for carrying."
