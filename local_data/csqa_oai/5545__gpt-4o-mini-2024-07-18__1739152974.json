  "query": "Question: Where do you need to use a fan?\n\nChoices:\nA: hot room\nB: sports stadium\nC: appliance store\nD: hockey game\nE: sauna",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the purpose of using a fan, which is generally to cool down an area by circulating air.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the provided choices to see which location requires cooling or better air circulation.",
    "Choice A: hot room - A fan is quite useful in a hot room to cool it down.",
    "Choice B: sports stadium - While a fan can be beneficial in a sports stadium, it may not be necessary as there are usually larger ventilation systems in place.",
    "Choice C: appliance store - An appliance store may have fans on display, but it does not necessarily need a fan for cooling.",
    "Choice D: hockey game - Similar to the sports stadium, cooling is more dependent on the facility itself rather than the event.",
    "Choice E: sauna - A sauna is designed to create heat, so a fan would typically not be used in this environment.",
    "After evaluating all options, it is clear that the hot room is the most appropriate place for using a fan directly for cooling purposes."
