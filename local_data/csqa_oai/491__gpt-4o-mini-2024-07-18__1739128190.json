  "query": "Question: The shore was now a tourist attraction with nearby little shops, but at one time this what was home to a bustling fishing industry?\n\nChoices:\nA: seaside town\nB: resort\nC: ocean\nD: california\nE: beach",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the location was once home to a bustling fishing industry, which suggests it was a populated area with maritime activity.",
    "The phrase \"tourist attraction with nearby little shops\" indicates that the area has been developed for tourism rather than solely for its original purpose.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"seaside town\" implies a location that would traditionally support both a fishing industry and tourism.",
    "The term \"resort\" usually refers to a vacation destination that may not necessarily have historical ties to fishing, making it less likely to be the correct answer.",
    "The term \"ocean\" does not refer to a location but rather a body of water, thus it cannot be the correct answer.",
    "The term \"California\" is a state rather than a specific location related to the question.",
    "The term \"beach\" could be a part of a seaside town, but it does not encompass the idea of a developed town as described in the question.",
    "Based on the reasoning around the context of shops, tourism, and the original fishing industry, \"seaside town\" is logically the most fitting answer."
