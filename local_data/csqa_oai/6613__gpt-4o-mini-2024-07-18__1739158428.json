  "query": "Question: What part are the police likely to have in a killing?\n\nChoices:\nA: gun\nB: pleasure\nC: investigation\nD: dies\nE: punishment",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the roles of police in relation to a killing. Typically, the police are involved in the immediate aftermath of any homicide.",
    "Analyze the options in the context of police involvement. A gun could be involved in the killing, but it is not a part of the police's role.",
    "Evaluate the option \"pleasure.\" It is unlikely that police would have any association with pleasure in a killing scenario, as their role is serious and professional.",
    "Look at the option \"investigation.\" This is a primary function of police after a killing occurs, as they gather evidence and try to determine what happened.",
    "Assess the option \"dies.\" This does not relate to the police's role in a killing; rather, it describes the outcome of the incident.",
    "Examine the final option \"punishment.\" While police may arrest and detain suspects, the actual punishment is typically handled by the legal system, not the police directly.",
    "Having reviewed all options, it is clear that the most relevant role of the police in the case of a killing is through investigation."
