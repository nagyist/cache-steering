  "steps": [
    "Linda wanted to talk to someone about her situation, indicating she recognized the importance of discussing her issues.",
    "She acknowledged that she was doing \"bad stuff,\" which suggests she is aware that her actions are not appropriate or healthy.",
    "The phrase \"talking was the first step\" implies that Linda is seeking a way to improve her current situation, indicating a desire for change.",
