  "query": "Question: If you need a cavity filled where do you go?\n\nChoices:\nA: molar\nB: doctor\nC: dentist\nD: teeth\nE: unbrushed tooth",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to go for a cavity filling, it is important to identify the professional who specializes in dental care.",
    "A cavity is a dental issue that requires treatment, specifically focused on the teeth and oral health.",
    "Among the choices, \"molar\" refers to a type of tooth, and doesn't indicate a place to receive treatment.",
    "\"Doctor\" is a general term but typically refers to a medical doctor rather than one specializing in dental health.",
    "\"Dentist\" is a professional specifically trained to handle dental problems like cavities, making it a potential choice.",
    "\"Teeth\" refers to the objects needing filling but does not represent a location or professional.",
    "\"Unbrushed tooth\" describes a state of dental neglect but does not indicate a service provider or location for filling a cavity.",
    "Given the key role of a dentist in diagnosing and treating cavities, this option aligns directly with the needs of someone requiring a cavity filling.",
    "No other listed option is directly applicable to treating cavities; hence, \"dentist\" is the best choice."
