  "query": "Question: Where south of the U.S. can you find a steak house serving Dos Equis cerveza?\n\nChoices:\nA: japan\nB: restaurant\nC: mexico\nD: united states\nE: texas",
  "steps": [
    "First, the question specifies a location where a steak house serves Dos Equis cerveza, which suggests a connection to Mexican culture since Dos Equis is a Mexican beer.",
    "Second, we need to determine the geographical direction \"south of the U.S.\" This indicates we are looking for a location on the southern side of the U.S. border.",
    "Third, I review the choices provided. A: Japan is located east of the U.S.; it doesn't fit. B: Restaurant is a general term and doesn't indicate a location or answer the question directly. D: United States is the location of the steak house but does not fit \"south.\" E: Texas is in the United States and is not a separate country or area south of the U.S.",
    "Fourth, focusing on option C: Mexico aligns perfectly with the geographic context of \"south of the U.S.\" and is a country known for its steakhouses and where Dos Equis is commonly served.",
    "Fifth, I consider whether any options could be more fitting than Mexico for the specific question asked. No other options describe a location south of the U.S. that serves Dos Equis cerveza.",
    "Sixth, I also note that the cultural ties of Mexico to steak houses and Dos Equis\ub97c give further support to choosing Mexico as the correct answer.",
    "Seventh, summarize everything: the question specifically requires a location south of the U.S. that serves Dos Equis, leading me to conclude Mexico matches these criteria best."
