  "query": "Question: What do you feel when you're not getting paid?\n\nChoices:\nA: income tax\nB: happiness\nC: satisfaction\nD: sorrow\nE: blissfulness",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about feelings associated with not receiving payment.",
    "When someone is not getting paid for their work or effort, they typically feel a sense of dissatisfaction or negative emotion.",
    "Option A, income tax, is not a feeling; it is a financial obligation.",
    "Option B, happiness, contradicts the premise of not getting paid, as one is unlikely to feel happy in this situation.",
    "Option C, satisfaction, also seems unlikely because lack of payment typically leads to dissatisfaction rather than satisfaction.",
    "Option D, sorrow, closely aligns with the negative feelings one might experience when not compensated for their work.",
    "Option E, blissfulness, is also an unrealistic response, as blissfulness implies happiness and contentment, which would not be felt when unpaid.",
    "Considering all options, \"sorrow\" seems to be the most accurate option reflecting the typical emotional response to being unpaid."
