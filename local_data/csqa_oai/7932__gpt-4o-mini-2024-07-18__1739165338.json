  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question. The woman is feeling anxious because her child is in a competition.",
    "Next, identify the common advice friends give to someone who is anxious or stressed about a situation involving a loved one, particularly when it is out of their control.",
    "Options A (comfortable) and B (buy an ipod) don't directly address anxiety relief.",
    "Options C (go to bed) and D (listen to music) might help her relax, but they are not as directly related to her friend offering reassurance.",
    "Option E (stop worrying) directly addresses the woman\u2019s emotional state and suggests a proactive approach to managing her anxiety.",
    "Considering the nature of friendship and support, it is likely her friend encouraged her to stop worrying about her child\u2019s competition.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate response indicative of reassurance and emotional support is to \"stop worrying\"."
