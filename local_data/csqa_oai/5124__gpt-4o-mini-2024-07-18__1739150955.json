  "query": "Question: Where would you store potato chips in their home?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: toilet\nC: pantry\nD: bar\nE: motherboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what a pantry is and its purpose in a home setting. A pantry is typically a small room or cupboard where food items, especially dry goods and snacks, are stored.",
    "Next, I can analyze the other options: a supermarket is where food is bought, not stored; a toilet is not a place for food storage; a bar is primarily for serving beverages; and a motherboard is a computer component, not relevant to food storage at all.",
    "I realize that potato chips are a snack item that would most logically be stored in a place where snacks and other food items are kept, which aligns with the function of a pantry.",
    "Additionally, potato chips should ideally be stored in a cool, dry place, which is another characteristic of a pantry, rather than in areas like the toilet or where drinks are served.",
    "Since option C (pantry) directly supports the needs of storing potato chips while the other options do not, I can confidently conclude that the best answer is the pantry."
