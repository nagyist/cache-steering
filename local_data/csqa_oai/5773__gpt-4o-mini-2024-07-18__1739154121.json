  "steps": [
    "The question asks for methods to change the shape of wood.",
    "One common method of changing the shape of wood is by grinding it down, which removes material to create a different form.",
    "Nailing wood generally involves attaching pieces together rather than changing its shape.",
    "Carving wood also effectively changes its shape by removing material in a sculptural way, shaping it into specific designs.",
    "Polishing wood improves its surface finish but does not change its shape.",
    "Warping refers to the deformation of wood due to moisture or stress, but it is not an active method to change shape, rather it is an unwanted outcome.",
    "With the options considered, both grinding and carving actively change the shape of wood, but carving suggests a more artistic process compared to grinding, which is more about reducing size.",
    "The question does not specify the context (artistic vs functional), yet \"carved\" stands out as a definitive method of changing the shape of wood.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer that actively changes the shape of wood is \"carved\"."
