  "query": "Question: Where can someone get a flute?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: steal it\nC: marching band\nD: symphony\nE: musical instrument store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a flute is and where it is typically found or purchased.",
    "Flutes are musical instruments and can be found in various musical settings, such as orchestras, bands, and other ensembles.",
    "Look at the options provided: orchestra, steal it, marching band, symphony, and musical instrument store.",
    "Orchestras (A) and symphonies (D) often have flutes as part of their ensemble, but one doesn't usually get a flute from these places directly.",
    "Marching bands (C) also use flutes, but similar to orchestras and symphonies, they aren't a place to purchase a flute.",
    "The option \"steal it\" (B) is not appropriate or legal and thus should not be considered.",
    "The best option for acquiring a flute is through a musical instrument store (E), which specializes in selling instruments.",
    "Since a musical instrument store is a legitimate place to buy a flute, it stands out as the best answer."
