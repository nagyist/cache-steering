  "steps": [
    "The question states that a steel cable could be used to pull the tug if \"Steve had what?\" This implies that a certain tool or device is needed for the steel cable to be effectively utilized.",
    "Looking at the options, a winch (A) is a machine that can wind up (or pull) a cable, which would be useful in this scenario.",
    "A wrench (B) is a tool used for gripping and turning objects, but it is not relevant to pulling or using cables.",
    "A suspension bridge (C) is a structure that typically doesn't relate to pulling a tug, as it does not perform a functional role in this context.",
    "A factory (D) is a place where goods are manufactured and is unrelated to the context of pulling a tug with a cable.",
    "A ship (E) is relevant as it may be involved with tugs, but it does not specifically help in utilizing a steel cable for pulling.",
    "By evaluating the options regarding their relevance to pulling a tug with a steel cable, the only option that makes sense as a necessary tool is a winch (A)."
