  "query": "Question: He needed to check an electrical connection in the house, where did he look?\n\nChoices:\nA: telephone network\nB: freeway\nC: company\nD: wall\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of checking an electrical connection; this implies a focus on where electrical systems are typically found.",
    "Next, eliminate options that are not related to electrical connections. A telephone network (A) deals with communication, which is not directly related to electrical systems.",
    "The freeway (B) is primarily related to transportation and does not house electrical connections relevant to a house.",
    "Considering the company (C), while it may have electrical systems, it is not the most logical place to check an electrical connection in a house setting.",
    "Review the option of the wall (D); in homes, electrical wiring and connections are often located within or behind walls, making this a viable option.",
    "Lastly, the airport (E) is unrelated to typical residential electrical systems, further confirming that it does not fit the context.",
    "Taking into account all the options and their relevance to checking an electrical connection, the most logical choice is the wall (D)."
