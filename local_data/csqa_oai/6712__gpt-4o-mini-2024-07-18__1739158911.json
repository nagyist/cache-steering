  "steps": [
    "To determine how to institute a civil action, we first need to understand what a civil action is. A civil action typically involves a legal dispute between two or more parties seeking compensation or resolution for a grievance.",
    "Next, we consider the general process involved in initiating a civil action. This usually starts with a party filing a complaint or petition with the appropriate court. This complaint outlines the grievances and the relief sought.",
    "We need to analyze the provided choices to identify which one best fits the initial step of instituting a civil action. The options include disobedience, court case, trial, anger, and complications.",
    "\"Disobedience\" (A) does not relate to the legal procedure for filing a civil action. Instead, it suggests a failure to comply with laws or orders.",
    "\"Trial\" (C) refers to the examination of the case in court and is a subsequent stage in the civil action process, not the initiation of it.",
    "\"Anger\" (D) is an emotion and does not represent any procedural step in instituting a civil action.",
    "\"Complications\" (E) might arise during the process but does not address how to start a civil action.",
    "This leaves us with \"court case\" (B), which directly refers to the legal proceedings that take place when a civil action is initiated.",
    "To properly initiate a civil action, one must file a complaint, which indeed leads to a court case as the mechanism through which legal disputes are resolved."
