  "query": "Question: A person that is really skilled with harmonica might find a gig with what sort of group?\n\nChoices:\nA: mouth\nB: blues band\nC: rock band\nD: gymnastic squad\nE: music shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary function of a harmonica in music. It is often associated with specific genres that highlight its unique sound.",
    "Next, think about the genres of music where harmonica is commonly used. The most notable genres include blues, folk, and rock.",
    "Now, evaluate the options provided. Option A (mouth) does not pertain to a musical group. Option D (gymnastic squad) is also not related to music.",
    "Option E (music shop) refers to a place where instruments are sold and does not imply a musical group.",
    "This leaves us with options B (blues band) and C (rock band). Both of these groups can utilize harmonica effectively.",
    "However, the blues genre is particularly known for its heavy use of harmonica, making it an ideal match for a skilled harmonica player.",
    "While a rock band might also incorporate harmonica, it is less characteristic of the rock genre compared to blues.",
    "Therefore, based on the specific association of harmonica with genres, the best fit for a skilled harmonica player would be a blues band."
