  "steps": [
    "To determine the best answer, we must consider the context of \"ready for school\" as it relates to what admissions counselors typically focus on.",
    "Admissions counselors assess various criteria when evaluating a child's readiness for school, including age, social skills, and ability to learn.",
    "The phrase \"ready for school\" often refers to the child being at an appropriate age and having some foundational skills necessary for starting school.",
    "One significant aspect of readiness is whether the child is \"old enough\" to begin formal schooling, which usually correlates with developmental milestones and age requirements.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"old enough\" clearly aligns with the general consensus on when a child is deemed ready for school, as it reflects a crucial eligibility criteria.",
    "Other choices such as \"student,\" \"leave home,\" \"register,\" and \"see work\" do not directly indicate a child's readiness in the context of age or developmental readiness.",
    "After reviewing all the choices, \"old enough\" stands out as the only option that directly answers what admissions counselors would say about a child's readiness for school."
