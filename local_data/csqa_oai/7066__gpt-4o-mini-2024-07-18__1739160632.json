  "query": "Question: Where is a tree hugger likely to reside?\n\nChoices:\nA: forest\nB: rainforest\nC: san francisco\nD: state park\nE: university",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what a \"tree hugger\" typically refers to. A tree hugger is often associated with environmentalism and a deep appreciation for nature.",
    "Consider the common locations associated with environmentalists or people who deeply care about nature preservation. These include areas where nature is abundant and protected.",
    "Evaluate the given choices: A: forest, B: rainforest, C: San Francisco, D: state park, E: university.",
    "A: forest and B: rainforest are natural areas, but they don't necessarily imply a residence location for tree huggers\u2014they are places one might go to advocate for trees, rather than live.",
    "C: San Francisco is a city known for its progressive values, environmental awareness, and active eco-communities. It could be home to many individuals who identify as tree huggers.",
    "D: state park could also attract tree huggers, as it's a protected area where they might spend time, but it's not typically a residential area.",
    "E: university settings often have environmental studies and activism communities, but not all university students or staff identify as tree huggers.",
    "Comparing the options: C (San Francisco) appears to be the most plausible residential location for a tree hugger due to the city's strong environmental movement and urban setting, which may attract such individuals.",
    "While state parks, forests, and rainforests are significant locations for nature and conservation, they are not city residents. Hence, considering residence rather than visitation is critical."
