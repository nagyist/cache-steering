  "query": "Question: She preferred the light blanket, what did she think of the older blanket?\n\nChoices:\nA: empty\nB: calorific\nC: crucial\nD: cumbersome\nE: forceful",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that she preferred the light blanket, which implies she had some opinion about the older blanket.",
    "If she preferred the light blanket, it suggests that she found the older blanket less favorable in comparison.",
    "The term \"cumbersome\" means something that is heavy or difficult to handle, which is often the case with thicker or older blankets.",
    "Considering her preference for the light blanket, it is reasonable to infer that she may have found the older blanket cumbersome or awkward to use.",
    "The other options do not connect well with her decision:\n- A: \"empty\" does not relate to the context of blankets.\n- B: \"calorific\" suggests heat, which isn't directly addressed by her preference for a lighter option.\n- C: \"crucial\" implies importance, which is not relevant to her preference stated.\n- E: \"forceful\" is not applicable in this context.",
    "Thus, the only choice that logically follows from her preference for a lighter blanket is that she likely found the older blanket cumbersome."
