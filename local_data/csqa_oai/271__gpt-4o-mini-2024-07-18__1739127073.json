  "query": "Question: I am looking to buy honey right from an apiary, where should I go?\n\nChoices:\nA: jar\nB: stick to fingers\nC: beehive\nD: stick to fingers\nE: farmer's market",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where to buy honey directly from an apiary, which typically refers to a place where bees are kept and honey is harvested.",
    "The choices provided include various options, but we need to determine which one is most relevant to purchasing honey directly.",
    "Option A \"jar\" refers to containing honey, not a location for purchase.",
    "Option B and D both say \"stick to fingers,\" which does not imply a location or mode of purchasing honey.",
    "Option C \"beehive\" suggests the very structure where bees live and produce honey. While it might be where honey is harvested, it is not a typical setting to buy honey from as an end consumer.",
    "Option E \"farmer's market\" is a more reasonable choice, as it often includes local producers, including those who may sell honey harvested from nearby apiaries.",
    "Considering that a beehive is not where consumers purchase honey, and the other options are less relevant or nonsensical, the best option remains E."
