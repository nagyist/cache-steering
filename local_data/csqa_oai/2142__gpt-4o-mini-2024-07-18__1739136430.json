  "query": "Question: Billy bought pencils and put them in his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: kitchen sink\nC: backpack\nD: cabinet\nE: store",
  "steps": [
    "To find out where Billy would typically put pencils, I consider the common locations where a student might store school supplies.",
    "A classroom often contains tools and supplies needed for learning, but Billy would not typically take his pencils home to leave there.",
    "A kitchen sink is an unusual place to store school supplies; it is used primarily for washing dishes and preparing food.",
    "A backpack, however, is designed specifically to carry school-related items, including pencils, books, and notebooks.",
    "A cabinet might store school supplies, but that is less common for a student who needs to carry items with them to class.",
    "A store is where you buy school supplies, not a place to keep them after purchase.",
    "Based on the purpose and function of each option, it is clear that the most logical choice for where Billy would put his pencils is in his backpack."
