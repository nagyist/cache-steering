  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of the man waking up with a hangover and a broken nose. This suggests that he had a wild night, possibly involving drinking and then some sort of misadventure or physical incident.",
    "Next, I'm considering the possible scenarios listed in the choices. Getting drunk often leads to unpleasant consequences, so I should think about what typically happens in such situations.",
    "Option A: \"vomit\" could be a possible consequence of drinking too much. However, it doesn't necessarily explain the broken nose.",
    "Option B: \"stagger\" may be a common behavior when someone is intoxicated, but it doesn't directly relate to waking up with a hangover and injuries like a broken nose.",
    "Option C: \"get arrested\" is a serious consequence that could result from drunken behavior, but it doesn\u2019t explain how he ended up with a broken nose unless there was an altercation with law enforcement or another individual.",
    "Option D: \"fall down\" is also a plausible result of being drunk, as drunken individuals are prone to losing their balance. This could realistically lead to both a hangover and a broken nose if he fell in a way that he hit his face.",
    "Option E: \"sleep over\" implies staying the night at someone\u2019s place, which doesn\u2019t align well with the context of waking up to a hangover and an injury.",
    "Now I must compare the strongest candidates. Between \"get arrested,\" \"fall down,\" and \"vomit,\" I find that \u201cfall down\u201d best fits the scenario of waking up with both a hangover and a broken nose, as it explains the physical injury more directly than the other options.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the man likely got drunk and then \"fell down,\" which led to his injuries."
