  "query": "Question: If someone had been smoking, an easy way to tell would be if they were what?\n\nChoices:\nA: inhale\nB: unhealthy\nC: a chimney\nD: go outside\nE: coughing",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify common indicators of smoking behavior.",
    "Inhaling smoke is a direct action associated with smoking, but it is not a definitive indicator for someone who has already smoked.",
    "Being unhealthy can be a long-term result of smoking, but it is not an immediate indicator of whether someone has smoked recently.",
    "A chimney is an exaggerated metaphorical reference and is not a relevant indicator in this context.",
    "Going outside can be related to smoking since many smokers step outside to smoke, but it does not definitively indicate that someone has smoked.",
    "Coughing is a common symptom among smokers and can be a direct indicator that someone has been smoking.",
    "Among the choices, coughing stands out as a clear, temporary consequence of smoking that can easily signify recent smoking behavior.",
    "We should therefore conclude that the best answer based on common signs of smoking is coughing."
