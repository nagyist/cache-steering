  "query": "Question: The audience watched the principal speaking, where were they seated?\n\nChoices:\nA: sporting event\nB: lecture\nC: school\nD: concert hall\nE: hockey game",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions an audience watching the principal speaking. This suggests a formal setting, likely related to education.",
    "Since the principal is mentioned, this indicates that the context is likely a school or related to a school event, rather than a sporting event or concert.",
    "The choices include a sporting event, lecture, school, concert hall, and hockey game. Among these options, a lecture and school are closely related to a principal speaking.",
    "A lecture typically takes place in a classroom or auditorium setting, frequently associated with educational institutions.",
    "The option \"school\" directly relates to where a principal would typically be and addresses the setting of the speech.",
    "Although a lecture could occur in a school, the option \"school\" is broader and encompasses all activities, including those where a principal might speak.",
    "The options \"sporting event\", \"concert hall\", and \"hockey game\" are less likely settings for a principal's speech compared to a school or a lecture environment.",
    "Comparing \"school\" and \"lecture\", the broader concept of \"school\" fits all scenarios including the one described, whereas \"lecture\" is more specific.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer considering the context and the role of a principal is \"school\"."
