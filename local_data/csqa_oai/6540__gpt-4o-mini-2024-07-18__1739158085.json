  "query": "Question: He liked his indoor ficus, he simply had to keep it watered and near a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical forest\nB: ecosphere\nC: sunny window\nD: sun\nE: tropical rainforest",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions keeping an indoor ficus plant, which typically thrives in bright light conditions.",
    "I know that ficus plants require good sunlight to grow well and stay healthy.",
    "Based on that requirement, I can eliminate options that do not involve light, such as A (tropical forest) and E (tropical rainforest).",
    "Option B (ecosystem) is also not specific enough regarding light conditions for a ficus plant.",
    "Now, I am left with options C (sunny window) and D (sun).",
    "While both C and D suggest light, option C specifically mentions a \"sunny window,\" which clearly indicates a good placement for an indoor plant.",
    "Option D (sun) is somewhat vague because it does not specify the location of sunlight.",
    "Considering that ficus plants are commonly kept indoors, a sunny window would be a practical and effective choice.",
    "Therefore, the best answer is C, as it provides the necessary condition for maintaining an indoor ficus properly."
