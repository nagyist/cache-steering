  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"tentative agreement\" implies that the two conglomerates have come to a preliminary understanding or compromise.",
    "In the context of companies or conglomerates, a \"tentative agreement\" typically suggests that they may work together in some capacity.",
    "The choices provided can be analyzed to see which aligns best with the idea of two companies reaching a tentative agreement.",
    "Choice A: \"do business\" suggests a collaborative effort, which is plausible for two companies in agreement.",
    "Choice B: \"accomplish\" is vague and does not directly relate to a clear partnership or collaboration.",
    "Choice C: \"stop arguing\" might suggest a resolution, but it doesn't indicate an agreement on what they will work toward.",
    "Choice D: \"make progress\" sounds beneficial, but it is not specific enough to clearly define the nature of their agreement.",
    "Choice E: \"digging holes\" is contextually irrelevant and does not relate to the business partnerships between conglomerates.",
    "Between the remaining relevant choices, \"do business\" appears to encapsulate the essence of what two conglomerates would agree on most directly."
