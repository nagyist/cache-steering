  "query": "Question: What can happen to your car if you take a corner at too high a velocity?\n\nChoices:\nA: roll over\nB: move quickly\nC: slow down\nD: go fast\nE: be late",
  "steps": [
    "Taking a corner at too high a velocity increases the chances of losing control of the vehicle.",
    "When a car is navigating a turn, the centripetal force must be sufficient to keep the car on its intended path.",
    "If the speed is too high, the gravitational force and friction may not be enough to counteract the centrifugal force.",
    "This imbalance may lead the car to start sliding outward, which can cause it to roll over if the incline is significant or if it's a sharp turn.",
    "The potential for rolling over is particularly high with taller vehicles or those with a higher center of gravity.",
    "The option \"roll over\" explicitly indicates a devastating effect on the vehicle due to high speed in a corner.",
    "The other options, such as \"move quickly,\" \"slow down,\" \"go fast,\" and \"be late,\" do not accurately describe the specific outcome that results from taking a corner too quickly.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, \"roll over\" stands out as the most relevant consequence of taking a corner too quickly."
