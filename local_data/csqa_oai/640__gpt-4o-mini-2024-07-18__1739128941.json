  "query": "Question: What divider stores papers for work or school?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: binder\nC: obesity\nD: living room\nE: office suite",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the term that relates to a physical object used for organizing papers.",
    "Next, I consider the word \"divider.\" A divider typically means something that separates or organizes.",
    "I analyze the options. The term \"binder\" refers to a device that holds loose sheets of paper together, making it a potential candidate.",
    "In contrast, \"street,\" \"obesity,\" \"living room,\" and \"office suite\" do not pertain to an object used specifically for paper organization.",
    "Now, I focus on the option \"binder.\" It is commonly used in both school and work contexts for organizing pages.",
    "\"Office suite\" refers to a collection of software or a space but does not imply a physical object for storing papers.",
    "I verify that a binder can hold different types of documents, making it multifunctional for both work and school.",
    "Since all other options fail to relate to a physical document organizer, \"binder\" stands out as the correct choice."
