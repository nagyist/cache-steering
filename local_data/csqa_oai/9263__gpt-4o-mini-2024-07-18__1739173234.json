  "query": "Question: What makes it possible for your bones to move?\n\nChoices:\nA: flesh\nB: human body vertebrates\nC: skin and\nD: muscle\nE: cartilage",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the components of the skeletal system and how they interact with muscles to facilitate movement.",
    "Bones provide structure and support to the body, but they cannot move on their own. They require other systems to enable movement.",
    "Muscles are the primary tissues responsible for movement in the body; they contract and pull on bones to cause movement at the joints.",
    "Flesh refers to the soft tissues of the body, but it does not specifically address the mechanics of bone movement.",
    "The term \"human body vertebrates\" is too broad and does not specifically pinpoint what makes bones move.",
    "Skin serves as a protective layer for the underlying structures but does not contribute to the movement of bones.",
    "Cartilage is found at joints and provides cushioning and support, but it does not actively cause bones to move.",
    "Muscle contractions pull on bones through tendons, efficiently translating muscular effort into movement.",
    "Since the question specifically asks about what enables bones to move, the most appropriate answer focuses on muscles.",
    "After evaluating all choices, the best answer that explains what makes bones move is D: muscle."
