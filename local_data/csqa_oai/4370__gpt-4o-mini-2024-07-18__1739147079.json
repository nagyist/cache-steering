  "query": "Question: Where is a larger shopping mall likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: suburbs\nB: suburban area\nC: downtown\nD: indiana\nE: out of town",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the characteristics of larger shopping malls. They tend to be located in areas with higher foot traffic and accessibility to consumers.",
    "Identify the different choices. Suburbs (A), suburban area (B), downtown (C), Indiana (D), and out of town (E) each have different implications for visibility and accessibility.",
    "Downtown (C) areas typically have higher population density, meaning there are more potential shoppers nearby. This could support larger retail spaces.",
    "Suburban areas (A and B) can also host larger shopping malls, but they might not have the same foot traffic as downtown locations, particularly in less populated suburbs.",
    "Considering out of town (E) locations, while they can host larger malls, they might cater more to specific demographics and could be less accessible to the general public compared to downtown malls.",
    "Indiana (D) is a state which does not specify a location type (urban, suburban, or rural) and could host various shopping setups without implying a significantly larger mall.",
    "Operational costs and ease of access favor the downtown areas for larger malls, as they are typically designed to attract a diverse shopper base.",
    "Compare the density and demand in downtown versus suburban malls. Downtown has a higher density, likely leading to higher sales and operational sustainability.",
    "Evaluate the potential of each option against the prevailing trends, where urban areas tend to host bigger retail formats due to competition and visibility.",
    "Given this analysis, downtown is the most logical location for a larger shopping mall."
