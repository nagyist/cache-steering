  "query": "Question: which door with lock regularly holds cars?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: autolock\nC: garage\nD: file cabinet\nE: safe",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the question which is asking about a door that \"regularly holds cars.\"",
    "Next, I consider the options provided and what they mean in relation to holding cars.",
    "Option A: house - A house can have a garage, but it itself is not specifically designed to hold cars.",
    "Option B: autolock - This refers to a locking mechanism rather than a door that holds anything, so it does not apply.",
    "Option C: garage - A garage is specifically designed for storing cars and typically has a door that can be locked, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Option D: file cabinet - This is designed to hold documents, not cars, so it is irrelevant.",
    "Option E: safe - While a safe can hold valuable items, it does not typically hold cars.",
    "After considering each option, the only one that regularly holds cars is the garage."
