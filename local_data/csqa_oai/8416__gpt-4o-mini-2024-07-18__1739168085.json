  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the options to see which one is specifically designed to cut living things.",
    "Option A, scissors, are sharp tools used for cutting but are not typically used to cut living plants or organisms on a large scale.",
    "Option B, the blade of grass, does not cut; rather, it is a type of living plant.",
    "Option C, rollerblade, refers to a type of footwear and does not possess cutting capabilities.",
    "Option D, lawn mower, is designed specifically to cut grass and other similar living plants, making it relevant to the question.",
    "Option E, helicopter, does not cut living things in a direct way; while the blades can cause damage, they are not designed for cutting living organisms in the same context.",
    "I have determined that only the lawn mower (option D) is explicitly designed to cut living plants, which fits the criteria of the question."
