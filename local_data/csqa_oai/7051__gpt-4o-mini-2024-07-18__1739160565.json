  "query": "Question: At a university, what sort of building is likely to be called a hall?\n\nChoices:\nA: conference\nB: small classroom\nC: large building\nD: dormitory\nE: inside",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what type of building might be referred to as a \"hall,\" I need to consider the common usages of the term in a university context.",
    "The term \"hall\" often implies a larger space rather than a smaller, individual room.",
    "In universities, \"hall\" could refer to various types of buildings, such as lecture halls, dining halls, or residence halls.",
    "A \"conference hall\" is specifically designed for meetings, which aligns with the term \"hall\" but may not be the most common or encompassing type of building within a university context.",
    "A \"dormitory,\" or residence hall, is a type of hall specifically designated for student housing, making it a strong candidate.",
    "The answer choices suggest that I'm looking for a broader classification, so \"large building\" might be a suitable option as well, since many halls are indeed large.",
    "However, option \"B: small classroom\" does not seem fitting as classrooms are usually smaller than what would be classified as a hall.",
    "The option \"E: inside\" does not refer to a specific type of building, rather it describes a location, so it's not relevant.",
    "Considering my earlier assessment, the most appropriate term relating to university buildings that include the term \"hall\" would be \"dormitory\" and \"large building.\"",
    "To finalize my choice, \"dormitory\" is a common and specific type of hall present in universities, while \"large building\" is too vague without directly connecting to the university setting."
