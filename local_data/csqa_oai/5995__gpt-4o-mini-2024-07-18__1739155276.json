  "steps": [
    "Consider what praying typically involves. It often includes communication with a higher power and seeking assistance or guidance.",
    "Evaluate the different choices in relation to common practices during prayer.",
    "A: \"talking to god\" is a primary action of prayer where individuals express their thoughts or needs.",
    "B: \"clap\" is generally not associated with traditional prayer practices and seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "C: \"kneel down\" is a common physical posture for prayer, demonstrating humility or reverence.",
    "D: \"look upward\" can symbolize looking towards the divine but is less focused on communication or action than other options.",
    "E: \"ask for help\" directly relates to prayer, where individuals typically seek assistance or support through their petitions.",
    "Consider the context of someone experiencing troubles. They might not just be looking for communication, but also need a specific form of assistance or support.",
    "When narrowing the choices down based on the need for assistance, both \"ask for help\" and \"talking to god\" seem strongly relevant.",
    "However, the action of \"kneeling down\" signifies the seriousness of one's plea and can be seen as both a request for help and a personal commitment to the act of prayer.",
    "Ultimately, while all answers relate to prayer, the act of \"asking for help\" encapsulates the intent behind praying during troubled times."
