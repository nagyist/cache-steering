  "query": "Question: I have a machine for making bread, I keep it in my what?\n\nChoices:\nA: laboratory\nB: bathroom\nC: house\nD: museum\nE: industrial area",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary function of a bread-making machine, which is to bake bread.",
    "Next, think about where one would typically use such a machine. It is most commonly used in a domestic setting.",
    "Evaluate the choices given:\n- A laboratory is not typically associated with baking or making bread.\n- A bathroom is not a suitable location for a bread-making machine due to hygiene and space issues.\n- A house is the most logical location for storing kitchen appliances, including a bread-making machine.\n- A museum is not appropriate for personal appliances unless for demonstration purposes, which is not common.\n- An industrial area could theoretically have baking machines, but it\u2019s less likely that a personal bread-making machine would be kept there.",
    "Since a bread machine is meant for home use rather than professional baking environments, it strongly suggests the appropriate location is a house.",
    "Double-checking, a bread-making machine's most common environment would indeed be a residence, often in the kitchen or utility room."
