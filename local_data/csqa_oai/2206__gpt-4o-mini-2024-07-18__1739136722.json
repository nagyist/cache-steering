  "query": "Question: What has a pocket for a hydration pack full of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: first aid kit\nC: tsunami\nD: snowball\nE: backpack",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking specifically about an item that can hold a hydration pack, which typically refers to a device or container designed for carrying water or liquid.",
    "The options provided include an ocean, which is a large body of water and cannot hold a hydration pack; a first aid kit, which is intended for medical supplies; a tsunami, which is a large wave of water; a snowball, which is simply a ball made of snow; and a backpack, which is commonly used to carry various items, including hydration packs.",
    "Considering the function of each option: the ocean can't hold a portable hydration pack as it's not a carrier; the first aid kit is focused on injuries and doesn't accommodate hydration packs; a tsunami is a natural disaster and not something that can contain items; a snowball just can't hold anything substantial.",
    "On the other hand, a backpack is specifically designed to carry items, and many backpacks are equipped with compartments specially made to hold hydration packs full of water for outdoor activities, hiking, or biking.",
    "Therefore, the only viable option from the given choices that fits the description of having a pocket for a hydration pack is a backpack."
