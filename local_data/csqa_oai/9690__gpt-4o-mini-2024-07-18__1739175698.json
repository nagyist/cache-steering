  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the question, which asks about the most common hope people have when engaging in sexual activity.",
    "It's important to consider the context of sexual activity; typically, people engage in sex for pleasure, intimacy, or reproduction.",
    "Among the choices provided, A (unwanted pregnancy) and D (getting pregnant) are not typically \"hopes\" as they imply potential negative consequences or specific goals, rather than a general desire.",
    "Choice C (aids) is not a hope but a disease outcome, and most people do not engage in sex wishing to contract diseases.",
    "Now, we focus on the remaining options: B (bliss) and E (orgasm).",
    "Bliss can describe the overall state of happiness or joy, but it is more of an abstract feeling than a specific outcome of sex.",
    "Orgasm is widely recognized as a primary physiological and pleasurable goal of many sexual encounters, often associated with satisfaction and physical pleasure.",
    "Thus, while both B and E can represent outcomes of sexual activity, E (orgasm) is often seen as a clearer, more tangible achievement during sex compared to the broader concept of bliss.",
    "In conclusion, most people likely aim for orgasm as a direct result of the sexual experience, as it can be universally recognized and scientifically linked to sexual activity."
