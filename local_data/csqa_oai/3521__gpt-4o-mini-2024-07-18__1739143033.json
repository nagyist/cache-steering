  "query": "Question: What does your body do when walking?\n\nChoices:\nA: exercise\nB: move\nC: getting somewhere\nD: moving forward\nE: keep moving forward",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary action of walking. Walking involves complex movements of the body.",
    "Next, analyze what walking primarily accomplishes. It allows an individual to transition from one place to another physically.",
    "Look at the specific terminology used in the choices provided. \"Move\" indicates physical motion, which is essential to walking.",
    "Evaluate the choice \"exercise.\" While walking is a form of exercise, the question asks what the body does during the act of walking specifically, not the broader implications of health or fitness.",
    "Now, consider the choice \"getting somewhere.\" This phrase implies a purpose in walking, meaning a destination is involved, but it doesn\u2019t directly describe the physiological action of walking itself.",
    "The choice \"moving forward\" refers to the direction in which walking typically occurs, which is forward, but it is more of a description than a functional explanation of what the body is doing.",
    "Then, \"keep moving forward\" adds the sense of continuity, suggesting sustained motion, but once again doesn\u2019t focus on the specific act of walking.",
    "Upon evaluating all options, \"move\" is the most direct and functional description of what the body does when walking, because walking inherently involves movement.",
    "Lastly, while other options hint at elements of walking, \"move\" captures the essential characteristic of the action most accurately."
