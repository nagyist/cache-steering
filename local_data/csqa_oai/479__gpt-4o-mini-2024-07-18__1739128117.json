  "query": "Question: John's RV needs electricity so that he can cook lunch.  Where would he go to plug in?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy store\nB: basement\nC: school\nD: rest area\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John's RV needs electricity to cook lunch, which implies he needs a power source.",
    "To find a suitable place to plug in, I need to consider locations that commonly provide electricity access for RVs.",
    "Let's analyze the choices: \nA: toy store - unlikely to provide RV electrical hookups.\nB: basement - not a common place for RV access and typically does not have external power access suitable for RVs.\nC: school - while schools have electrical outlets, they are usually not designed for RVs.\nD: rest area - many rest areas offer electrical hookups specifically for RVs.\nE: building - somewhat vague, but could imply access, though not specifically designed for RVs.",
    "Among these options, the rest area is known for facilities catering to RVs, making it a probable choice for providing the necessary electricity.",
    "No other option explicitly states that it offers services for RVs, confirming that the rest area is likely the best choice.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer for where John would go to plug in his RV for cooking lunch is the rest area."
