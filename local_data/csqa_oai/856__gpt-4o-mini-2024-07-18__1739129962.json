  "query": "Question: Remembering past successe is likely to cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: problems\nB: crying\nC: inspiration\nD: trauma\nE: nightmares",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of remembering past successes. It often brings about positive emotions and feelings of accomplishment.",
    "Second, reflecting on past successes can boost self-confidence and motivation, leading individuals to feel inspired to replicate those achievements.",
    "Third, inspiration is generally associated with the positive recollection of events, while the other choices tend to imply negative effects or outcomes.",
    "Fourth, fears and concerns may arise when thinking about past successes, but these fears do not generally outweigh the positive feelings typically associated with success.",
    "Fifth, problems are usually linked with failures or negative memories rather than successes, further leaning towards inspiration rather than issues.",
    "Sixth, crying, trauma, and nightmares are all responses more aligned with negative experiences or failures, not successes.",
    "Seventh, in motivational psychology, recalling achievements is often used as a technique to inspire and uplift individuals facing challenges.",
    "Eighth, review the options given. Only \"inspiration\" directly aligns with the positive associations of recalling successful moments.",
    "Ninth, contemplate whether any other options can be tied back to remembering past successes. None of the others fit as they imply negative connotations.",
    "Tenth, based on the reasoning above, the option that logically follows from remembering past successes is inspiration."
