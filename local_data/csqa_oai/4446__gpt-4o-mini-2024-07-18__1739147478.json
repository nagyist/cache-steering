  "query": "Question: What do people feel when something good happens?\n\nChoices:\nA: experience joy\nB: believe in god\nC: sadness\nD: get sick\nE: ask questions",
  "steps": [
    "We need to understand the emotions people typically feel when something positive occurs in their lives.",
    "Common positive emotions include happiness, excitement, gratitude, and joy, among others.",
    "The prompt specifically asks about what people feel when something good happens, which suggests a primarily positive emotion.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"experience joy\" is the clearest and most direct representation of a positive emotional response to good events.",
    "The other options (B, C, D, and E) either do not align with a good experience or represent negative or neutral emotional responses.",
    "\"Believe in god\" (B) does not logically connect to all good happenings universally, as it pertains to a belief system rather than an emotional response.",
    "\"Sadness\" (C) is the exact opposite of the expected emotion when something good occurs, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "\"Get sick\" (D) represents a negative outcome and is not a common response to positive events.",
    "\"Ask questions\" (E) could occur during curiosity but does not reflect an emotional response to good happenings specifically.",
    "After evaluating all the options, \"experience joy\" stands out as the best and most appropriate answer corresponding to the question."
