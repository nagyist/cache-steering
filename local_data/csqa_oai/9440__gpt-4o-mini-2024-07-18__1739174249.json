  "query": "Question: The aboriginal people ended up being displaced by settlers who justified themselves with the fact that the displaced people didn't have a formal system to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fight back\nB: spend time\nC: own home\nD: talk to each other\nE: own land",
  "steps": [
    "The question discusses the displacement of aboriginal people by settlers who justified their actions based on the aboriginal people lacking a formal system.",
    "We need to identify what this formal system is related to. The use of the term \"displaced\" suggests an issue of land ownership or territorial rights.",
    "The choices given relate to different aspects of societal systems: fighting back (A), spending time (B), owning home (C), talking to each other (D), and owning land (E).",
    "Among these, \"owning land\" (E) is the most relevant to the context of displacement, as it directly addresses the settlers' justification for taking over lands previously used by the aboriginal people.",
    "The settlers likely believed that the absence of a formal system of land ownership among the aboriginal people made it easier to justify their claims to the land.",
    "The term \"formal system\" implies a recognized and structured method of ownership, which relates closely to legal rights regarding land.",
    "Checking choice C: \"own home\" refers to personal housing, which doesn\u2019t capture the broader issue of territorial displacement.",
    "Choices A (fight back), B (spend time), and D (talk to each other) do not pertain to land ownership either and do not align with the justifications settlers might provide for displacement.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best answer, emphasizing the lack of a formal system concerning territory, is thus \"own land\" (E)."
