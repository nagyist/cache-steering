  "query": "Question: My friend makes a living playing trumpet, where might he work?\n\nChoices:\nA: music shop\nB: brass band\nC: horn\nD: high school band\nE: orchestra",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what jobs are typically associated with someone who plays the trumpet professionally.",
    "A music shop primarily sells instruments and may offer lessons, but it is not a direct form of employment for a trumpet player.",
    "A brass band is specifically an ensemble that features brass instruments, including trumpets, making it a suitable place for a trumpet player to work.",
    "The option \"horn\" is somewhat ambiguous. If it refers to a physical object, it does not represent a place of employment for a trumpet player.",
    "In a high school band, a trumpet player could work in a teaching or performing capacity, but it generally represents a more educational rather than a professional setting.",
    "An orchestra is another professional setting where a trumpet player might perform, as orchestras often have brass sections that include trumpets.",
    "Now, I will compare the relevant options. Options B (brass band) and E (orchestra) both represent professional settings for trumpet players.",
    "Considering this, I will evaluate which of these two options is commonly associated with professional trumpet playing.",
    "While both options are valid, orchestras are typically seen as a more prestigious professional environment for musicians.",
    "Additionally, since no other options provide a fitting workplace for someone whose main profession is playing the trumpet, I can conclude that one of the two viable choices is likely the most accurate."
