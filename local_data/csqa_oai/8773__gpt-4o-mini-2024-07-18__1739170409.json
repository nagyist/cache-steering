  "query": "Question: Miranda wasn't sure about what she was doing, she just knew that she couldn't stop moving her smelly feet. This was a problem, because she was told to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shoes\nB: stay still\nC: hands\nD: walk\nE: stink",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Miranda wasn't sure about her actions but could not stop moving her feet. This suggests that her movement is contradictory to an instruction she received.",
    "The phrase \"she couldn't stop moving her smelly feet\" indicates that there is something about her feet (specifically the smell) that is bothersome or unwanted.",
    "We need to find out what instruction Miranda was given that relates to the inability to stop moving her feet.",
    "From the choices given, A: shoes does not fit as it does not imply staying still or moving.",
    "B: stay still directly contrasts with Miranda's inability to stop moving, which suggests that she was indeed told to stay still.",
    "C: hands does not logically relate to the context of moving her feet and keeping them still.",
    "D: walk implies movement, which does not conflict with her current situation of moving her feet but doesn't address the contradiction.",
    "E: stink, while relevant to the smell of her feet, does not provide actionable advice or instruction that Miranda could follow.",
    "The most logical conclusion from the choices given is that Miranda was told to stay still, as her ongoing movement of her feet suggests she is not following that instruction."
