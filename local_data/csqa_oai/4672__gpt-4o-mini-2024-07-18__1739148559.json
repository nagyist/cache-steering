  "query": "Question: If I was using a hairpin on a female customer where do I need to put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: woman's hair\nB: hair salon\nC: bathroom cabinet drawer\nD: forehead\nE: barber shop",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a hairpin should be placed when using it on a female customer.",
    "A hairpin is used primarily to secure hair in place, so the immediate thought is that it should be applied to the customer's hair.",
    "Choice A suggests placing the hairpin in the woman's hair, which aligns with the intended use of the hairpin.",
    "Choice B mentions a hair salon, which is not a physical location for placing a hairpin on the customer; rather, it's the context or setting of the action.",
    "Choice C suggests a bathroom cabinet drawer, which is not relevant to the action of placing a hairpin on a female customer at the moment it's being used.",
    "Choice D suggests the forehead, which is not a conventional place for a hairpin; hairpins are generally used to secure hair and not placed on the forehead.",
    "Choice E mentions a barber shop. Similar to choice B, it is a setting and does not involve the actual placement of a hairpin on the female customer.",
    "Considering the function of a hairpin and the context of the question, the most appropriate answer is indeed choice A."
