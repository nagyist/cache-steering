  "steps": [
    "Consider typical indoor activities that children engage in when they are not playing outside.",
    "Evaluate the options provided. \"Rush around\" (A) typically refers to an outdoor activity rather than indoors.",
    "Next, look at \"play video games\" (B), which is a common pastime for many children when they are indoors.",
    "Assess \"teach parents\" (C). While children do sometimes explain things to parents, this is less of a consistent activity they engage in when bored.",
    "Now, consider \"reach over\" (D). This option is vague and does not represent a typical activity.",
    "Lastly, evaluate \"eat\" (E). While eating is a common activity, it\u2019s not specifically an activity children do when they are bored indoors.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most representative and common indoor activity for children is playing video games."
