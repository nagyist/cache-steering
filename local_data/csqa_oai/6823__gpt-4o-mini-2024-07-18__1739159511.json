  "query": "Question: Whilst his girlfriend preferred sweet, he preferred what kind of snacks?\n\nChoices:\nA: lame\nB: sour\nC: ocean\nD: salty\nE: dry",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that his girlfriend preferred sweet snacks, which implies a contrast in their taste preferences.",
    "To answer the question accurately, I need to find a flavor or type of snack that is typically not sweet.",
    "The options given are lame, sour, ocean, salty, and dry.",
    "\"Lame\" does not refer to a flavor or type of snack, so it can be eliminated.",
    "\"Sour\" is a contrasting flavor to sweet but does not necessarily align with typical snack preferences commonly associated with the other choices.",
    "\"Ocean\" is not a flavor but rather suggests something related to the sea, which does not fit typical snack options.",
    "\"Salty\" is another contrasting flavor to sweet and is a common preference for snacks (e.g., chips, pretzels).",
    "\"Dry\" describes a texture rather than a specific flavor and may not represent a preference compared to sweet.",
    "Considering the most likely contrast to sweet snacks among the choices, \"salty\" stands out as a clear preference.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is that he preferred salty snacks."
