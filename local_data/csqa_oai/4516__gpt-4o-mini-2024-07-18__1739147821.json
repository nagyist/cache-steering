    "The question states that he was very formal when talking to others, which suggests that he was trying to communicate in a respectful and polite manner.",
    "In formal communication, maintaining eye contact is often considered a key component of effective interaction as it shows attentiveness and engagement.",
    "Language is another important aspect of formal communication, as it involves choosing words and phrases that are appropriate to the context and audience.",
    "Listening is crucial in any conversation but may not directly relate to formality; it's more about interaction quality than adherence to formality.",
    "Compliments can be part of a formal interaction, but they aren't a necessary or defining feature of formal communication, and their appropriateness can depend on the context.",
    "Smiling is often associated with friendliness rather than formality; while a formal person may smile, it\u2019s not a requirement.",
    "From the options provided, maintaining eye contact (A) seems to align closely with being formal, as is appropriate language (B) for such settings.",
    "However, since the phrase is asking for what he always maintained an effort to do, option A (make eye contact) directly relates to a consistent practice in formal communication.",
    "After analyzing each option based on the idea of formality, I conclude that making eye contact is the most relevant aspect of formal interaction compared to the other options."
