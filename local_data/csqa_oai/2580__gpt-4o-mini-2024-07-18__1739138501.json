  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the implications of cleaning what you eat.",
    "Cleaning food typically refers to removing dirt, pesticides, and bacteria.",
    "A primary benefit of cleaning food is to promote health by reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.",
    "Healthy food preparation practices can lead to improved nutrition and overall well-being.",
    "This indicates that the option related to health outcomes is plausible.",
    "Now, consider the other options: neatness may refer to physical organization rather than health.",
    "Bad aftertaste does not logically follow from cleaning food; it is generally expected that cleanliness would lead to better taste.",
    "Using water is involved in the cleaning process, but this is more of a method than a direct outcome.",
    "Allergies are not necessarily a result of cleaning food; they are related to individual sensitivities.",
    "Based on these reasoned outcomes, \"healthy living\" stands out as the most appropriate and relevant answer."
