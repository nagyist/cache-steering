  "query": "Question: Feathers are less common in what because many people are allergic?\n\nChoices:\nA: cap\nB: house\nC: bird cage\nD: birds nest\nE: pillow",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where feathers are found and why they might be less common in that context due to allergies.",
    "Feathers are commonly found in birds and bird-related items, such as bird cages and bird nests.",
    "Pillows often contain feathers or down, which can cause allergic reactions in some people.",
    "Caps might also use feathers for decorative purposes, but they are less common than pillows when it comes to allergies.",
    "Now, let's evaluate each option in context of allergies to feathers: \n- A: A cap could have feathers but it's not a primary use for them.\n- B: A house could have feathers in decorations, but it's still not common.\n- C: A bird cage may contain feathers if there's a bird inside; however, the concern of allergies is irrelevant here as typically there are no feathers in a bird cage.\n- D: A bird's nest obviously contains feathers and is directly related to birds, which people may be allergic to.\n- E: Pillows are one of the most common household items that contain feathers and where allergies are a significant concern.",
    "Since the question specifically asks where feathers are less common due to allergies, the strongest candidate here is pillows, as they are used by many and directly linked to allergic reactions.",
    "The wording of the question suggests looking for the item that typically does contain feathers but where its use may be restricted due to allergies.",
    "Upon reviewing the options, it's clear that pillows are often avoided by those allergic to feathers, making option E the best answer for this question."
