    "Drunkenness (choice A) usually refers to the state of being intoxicated during the drinking session rather than a next-day effect.",
    "Misery (choice B) could result from various factors, but it\u2019s not a specific consequence of heavy drinking like some others on the list.",
    "Alcoholism (choice C) is a chronic condition that develops over time and wouldn't be an immediate next-day effect of a single night of drinking.",
