  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves Sam examining something closely, indicating that he has a strong interest in it.",
    "If someone is examining something closely, it usually implies a desire to understand or gain deeper knowledge about it.",
    "Among the answer choices, the only option that aligns with wanting to understand or gain knowledge about something is \"learn more about\".",
    "The other options, such as \"interesting,\" \"interests,\" \"complex,\" and \"go to bed,\" do not denote a desire to acquire knowledge or understand the subject matter.",
    "Specifically, options A, B, and D do not express a desire for knowledge or entail further investigation in the same manner that C does.",
    "Option E, \"go to bed,\" is irrelevant to the context of examining something closely with curiosity.",
    "Therefore, the primary motive for Sam\u2019s close examination is to expand his understanding or knowledge about the subject."
