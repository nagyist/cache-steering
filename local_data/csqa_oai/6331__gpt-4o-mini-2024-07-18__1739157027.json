  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct answer, I first need to understand what is commonly involved in the act of prayer.",
    "Prayer is often considered a way to communicate, express feelings, or seek guidance from a higher power, particularly in religious contexts.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the provided options to see which one best describes a common aspect of prayer.",
    "Option A (\"were religious\") does not describe an action or activity performed during prayer; it describes a state of being.",
    "Option B (\"help from god\") implies a request for assistance but does not specifically describe an action taken during prayer.",
    "Option C (\"talk to god\") directly describes the act of communicating with a divine being, which is a fundamental part of prayer.",
    "Option D (\"you're scared\") suggests a feeling or emotion but does not relate to the primary purpose of prayer.",
    "Option E (\"thank god\") refers to one specific practice within prayer, but it does not encompass the full scope of what one does when they pray.",
    "Considering all the options, option C clearly captures the essence of prayer as a communicative act, making it the most comprehensive and accurate choice."
