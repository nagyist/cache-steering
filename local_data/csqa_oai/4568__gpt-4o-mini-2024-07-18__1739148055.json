  "query": "Question: After the killing of another young member of the community people began to really what?\n\nChoices:\nA: get in trouble\nB: commit crime\nC: die\nD: feel anger\nE: getting hurt",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that after a killing, there was a significant reaction from the community.",
    "I will analyze the choices and see which one logically follows the context of the situation described.",
    "Choice A, \"get in trouble,\" doesn't specifically relate to community feelings or reactions but rather suggests individual consequences.",
    "Choice B, \"commit crime,\" could be a reaction but seems less aligned with a direct emotional response to a homicide.",
    "Choice C, \"die,\" is a potential outcome of violence but does not reflect a reaction by the community as a whole.",
    "Choice D, \"feel anger,\" seems directly related to a community\u2019s reaction after a violent event; anger is a common emotional response.",
    "Choice E, \"getting hurt,\" implies physical consequences rather than emotional reactions and seems less applicable.",
    "Considering the context of a killing, anger is often a prominent reaction, making \"feel anger\" the most relevant choice."
