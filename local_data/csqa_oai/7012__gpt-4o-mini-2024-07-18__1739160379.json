  "steps": [
    "First, identify the keyword in the question which is \"condominium near the Pacific ocean.\"",
    "Next, note that the Pacific Ocean borders the western coast of North America, which includes states like California, Oregon, and Washington.",
    "Now, examining the given options closely: A (Washington), B (Florida), C (Community), D (Michigan), and E (Complex).",
    "Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States and does not border the Pacific Ocean, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Michigan is located in the Midwest and borders the Great Lakes, thus also eliminating it because it doesn't touch the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Options C (Community) and E (Complex) do not refer to specific geographical locations but rather types of living arrangements. They can be eliminated as they don't fit the requirement of being near the Pacific Ocean.",
    "The only option left that refers to a state that borders the Pacific is A (Washington).",
    "Considering the requirement for a condominium near the Pacific Ocean, Washington has coastal areas that fulfill this need.",
    "Therefore, the best choice for buying a condominium near the Pacific Ocean is option A (Washington)."
