  "steps": [
    "The question states that diamonds are neither free nor cheap, which indicates their cost is above a certain threshold.",
    "To analyze the options, let's consider what \"not free\" means: diamonds cannot be obtained without payment.",
    "Next, \"not cheap\" suggests that diamonds are expensive and require a significant amount of money to purchase.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"enslaved\" and \"imprisoned\" (A and E) do not align with the context of cost and value associated with diamonds.",
    "\"Free with coupon\" (B) clearly contradicts the information that diamonds are not free, and it implies there is a cost or mechanism to obtain it for lower value, which isn't valid here.",
    "\"Paid for\" (D) suggests that diamonds are bought, which is true since they cannot be obtained for free, but it doesn't necessarily convey their relative cost compared to other items.",
    "The only choice that effectively encapsulates both the idea of being not free and not cheap is \"expensive\" (C).",
    "Therefore, considering the definitions and implications of each choice, the correct answer that describes diamonds is \"expensive.\""
