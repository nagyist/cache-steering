  "query": "Question: Where would you find a pet jellyfish?\n\nChoices:\nA: australia\nB: movie\nC: japanese restaurant\nD: shore\nE: tank",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a pet jellyfish requires for a habitat. Jellyfish are aquatic animals, so they cannot survive in environments like a movie or a restaurant setting without specific adaptations.",
    "Next, look at the choices provided. Options A (Australia) and D (shore) suggest natural settings. However, these locations aren't typically associated with keeping jellyfish as pets.",
    "Then, evaluate option C (Japanese restaurant). While jellyfish can be served in some cuisines, it does not indicate a habitat for them as pets.",
    "Now, consider option E (tank). Jellyfish can be kept as pets in specially designed tanks that mimic their natural ocean environment, providing them with the necessary space and water conditions.",
    "Since tanks are specifically designed for keeping aquatic life, and jellyfish often require very particular conditions (like water circulation and temperature), they wouldn't survive well outside of such an environment.",
    "Reviewing all options, the only viable choice for keeping a pet jellyfish is in constrained, monitored environments where their needs can be met consistently.",
    "Thus, the best answer that directly correlates with keeping a pet jellyfish is option E (tank)."
