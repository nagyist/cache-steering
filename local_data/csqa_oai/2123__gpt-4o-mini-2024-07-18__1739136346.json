  "query": "Question: If you're in someone's house, where would you be likely to find plants?\n\nChoices:\nA: surface of earth\nB: windowsill\nC: park\nD: roof tiles\nE: greenhouse",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what type of environment a house provides. A house usually has areas where indoor plants might be present.",
    "Next, I will think about common places within a house where plants are typically found. One common place is the windowsill, as many people place plants there to receive sunlight.",
    "Now, I will review the answer choices provided. Options A (surface of earth), C (park), D (roof tiles), and E (greenhouse) are not typical locations within a house.",
    "Although option E (greenhouse) does involve plants, it is not generally considered a part of a typical house environment but rather a separate structure for growing plants.",
    "Therefore, the only answer option that fits as a likely location for plants within someone's house is option B (windowsill)."
