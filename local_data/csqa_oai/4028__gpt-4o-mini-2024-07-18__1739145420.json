  "query": "Question: Where might be a well manicured lawn?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: michigan\nC: north america\nD: golf course\nE: united states",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the options one by one to see which ones are most associated with a well manicured lawn.",
    "A lawn that is well maintained is usually found in residential areas, parks, or commercial landscapes, so the ocean (Option A) is unlikely to have a lawn.",
    "Michigan (Option B) is a state where many residential lawns are found. However, it is not exclusively known for manicured lawns.",
    "North America (Option C) as a continent includes a wide variety of landscapes and types of lawns, but it isn't specific to well manicured lawns.",
    "A golf course (Option D) is specifically designed to have well manicured lawns. The greens and fairways are maintained to a high standard for play.",
    "The United States (Option E) also includes areas with manicured lawns, but like Michigan, it is not exclusive to that description.",
    "Considering the specific nature of a \"well manicured lawn\", the golf course stands out as the most appropriate choice since its purpose is to maintain such a condition constantly.",
    "Now I will compare all the options again:\n- Ocean (A): no lawn\n- Michigan (B): some lawns, but not specifically associated with being manicured\n- North America (C): too broad, not specific to well manicured lawns\n- Golf Course (D): well manicured by design\n- United States (E): includes manicured lawns but is not specific",
    "Given the analysis, the best choice that directly relates to the idea of a well manicured lawn is a golf course."
