  "query": "Question: The electric motor powered many important things, including one if almost every house. Name this item?\n\nChoices:\nA: electric locomotive\nB: electric typewriter\nC: multi-coloured walrus\nD: electric refrigerator\nE: electric drill",
  "steps": [
    "First, I\u2019ll identify what common household item is generally powered by an electric motor.",
    "The question suggests it is an important item found in almost every house. This narrows it down to appliances that are ubiquitous in homes.",
    "Options like \"electric locomotive\" and \"electric typewriter\" seem less likely, as locomotives are typically not found in homes and typewriters, though historically significant, are not common anymore.",
    "The option \"multi-coloured walrus\" is clearly not a relevant item, as it\u2019s not an appliance.",
    "Next, I consider \"electric refrigerator\". Refrigerators are indeed vital in almost every household for food preservation and are powered by electric motors.",
    "Finally, I consider \"electric drill\". While it's useful, it's more of a tool found in some homes rather than an essential appliance found in nearly every household.",
    "Based on this reasoning, \"electric refrigerator\" is the most fitting choice, as it aligns with being powered by an electric motor and is a common household item."
