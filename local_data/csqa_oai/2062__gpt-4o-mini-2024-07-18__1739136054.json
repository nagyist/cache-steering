  "query": "Question: Where did the two best friends end up having a slumber party?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie internet cafe\nB: fraternity house\nC: internet cafe\nD: friend's house\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of a slumber party, which typically involves a sleepover at someone's home or a similar intimate setting.",
    "Next, I will consider the options available and evaluate each one to see if it fits the usual definition of a slumber party.",
    "Option A: \"movie internet cafe\" suggests a place focused on movies and internet activities, but it is unlikely to be suitable for a sleepover.",
    "Option B: \"fraternity house\" suggests a college setting, which while it might host gatherings, it is not typically where a slumber party would be held as it often involves more communal living and less privacy.",
    "Option C: \"internet cafe\" seems similar to the first option and likely does not provide an environment conducive to a slumber party.",
    "Option D: \"friend's house\" is the most fitting option as slumber parties are usually hosted at a friend\u2019s home.",
    "Option E: \"school\" is not an appropriate location for a traditional slumber party due to rules and boundaries regarding overnight stays.",
    "After evaluating all options, option D: \"friend's house\" stands out as the most logical and appropriate choice for where the two best friends would have a slumber party."
