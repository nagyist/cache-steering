  "query": "Question: Where might you use a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves?\n\nChoices:\nA: loading dock\nB: construction site\nC: supermarket\nD: construction yard\nE: warehouse",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a forklift might be used to stack boxes onto shelves, let\u2019s first consider the primary function of a forklift, which is to lift and move heavy items.",
    "A loading dock is typically used for loading and unloading goods from trucks, but it's less common to stack boxes onto shelves specifically in this area.",
    "A construction site generally involves lifting construction materials but is less likely to have shelving where boxes are stacked.",
    "A construction yard is similar to a construction site but more focused on storage of materials and tools; however, it wouldn\u2019t typically involve stacking boxes onto shelves like a warehouse.",
    "Supermarkets do require goods to be stocked on shelves, but they usually utilize different methods or equipment (e.g., hand trucks or pallet jacks) for directly moving items onto store shelves rather than forklifts.",
    "A warehouse is specifically designed for storage of large quantities of goods and often features shelving where forklifts are used to stack boxes efficiently, given the volume of inventory.",
    "Considering all options, the warehouse is the most appropriate place where a forklift would be commonly used to stack boxes onto shelves.",
    "Thus, the option that best fits the scenario described in the question is the warehouse."
