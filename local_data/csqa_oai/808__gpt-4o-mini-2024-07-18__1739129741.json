  "query": "Question: She was processing the wool, she kept her leg bouncing to operate the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospital bed\nB: legroom\nC: spinning wheel\nD: grand piano\nE: rhythm",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the statement indicates that she is engaged in a task involving wool processing. This suggests that she is likely involved in a craft or a textile-related activity.",
    "A spinning wheel is a device specifically designed to spin fiber, such as wool, into thread or yarn, which aligns with wool processing.",
    "The phrase \"she kept her leg bouncing\" implies a rhythmic motion. Many spinning wheels require the operator to use foot pedals to spin the wool effectively, indicating that her leg movement would be necessary to operate the spinning wheel.",
    "Let's analyze the other options: \n- A hospital bed is not relevant to wool processing.\n- Legroom refers to the space for legs, which is unrelated to the activity at hand.\n- A grand piano does not relate to wool processing either.\n- Rhythm could be a general term but doesn\u2019t specifically connect to the mechanical operation needed in the task described.",
    "Given the specific context of wool processing and the need for a continuous motion provided by the foot, the most logical conclusion is that she is operating a spinning wheel."
