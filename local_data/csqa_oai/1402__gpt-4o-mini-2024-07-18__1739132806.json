  "query": "Question: When not in a city where would expect to see a bald eagle?\n\nChoices:\nA: painting\nB: aviary\nC: rural area\nD: zoo\nE: colorado",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the habitat preferences of bald eagles. They are often found near large bodies of open water with abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.",
    "Next, I consider the options given: a painting, an aviary, a rural area, a zoo, and Colorado.",
    "A painting (Choice A) is not a physical location where a bald eagle could be seen in the wild, so it's not a valid choice.",
    "An aviary (Choice B) is a man-made enclosure where birds are kept, usually for viewing or conservation purposes. While you might see bald eagles here, it's still not a natural setting.",
    "In contrast, a rural area (Choice C) typically includes open spaces, forests, or areas near water bodies, which are suitable habitats for bald eagles to hunt for fish and nest.",
    "A zoo (Choice D) is similar to an aviary in that it is also a controlled environment meant for public viewing of animals, including eagles, but not their natural habitat.",
    "Colorado (Choice E) is a state where bald eagles are known to inhabit certain areas, but it does not guarantee a bald eagle's presence at all times outside of urban settings.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the most fitting answer that represents a location where bald eagles can typically be found, especially when not in a city, is a rural area."
