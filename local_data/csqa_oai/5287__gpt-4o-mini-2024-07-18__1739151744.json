  "query": "Question: Billy wanted to impress his family.  What might he do to impress people?\n\nChoices:\nA: make art\nB: believe in god\nC: leave\nD: come home\nE: go out",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what actions are generally perceived as impressive to family members. Making art often showcases creativity and effort, which many families appreciate.",
    "Next, believing in God can be a personal matter that might impress some families, especially those who share similar faith values, but it's not an action that is typically demonstrated outwardly.",
    "Leaving may imply abandoning the family situation, which usually doesn\u2019t impress but rather disappoints.",
    "Coming home can be seen positively, especially if Billy has been away for a while. It shows commitment to family and could be heartwarming, but it\u2019s not inherently impressive.",
    "Going out could mean many things and does not directly imply impressing anyone. It may even be seen as disengaging from the family.",
    "Among the options, making art stands out because it requires skill and could demonstrate thoughtfulness and dedication, potentially impressing his family.",
    "While coming home could be nice, it doesn't showcase any particular talent or effort since it\u2019s simply returning.",
    "Considering all these perspectives, making art is more likely to leave a lasting impression compared to the other listed options."
