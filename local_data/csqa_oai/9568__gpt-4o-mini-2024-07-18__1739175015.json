  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location to place a bed in a new house.",
    "A bed is a piece of furniture, so the furniture category might initially seem appropriate, but it does not specify a location.",
    "The garage is typically used for parking vehicles and storing tools, not for placing a bed.",
    "The term \"floor\" indicates a surface within the house where you actually place the bed.",
    "\u201cSleep\u201d and \u201cawake\u201d are states of being, rather than physical locations for objects.",
    "Since a bed must be placed on a physical surface inside the house, \"floor\" is the most logical option.",
    "Evaluating all choices, \"floor\" is specifically where a bed belongs within the context of a house.",
    "Thus, the correct answer to the question is indeed the floor."
