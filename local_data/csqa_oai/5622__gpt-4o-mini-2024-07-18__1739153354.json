  "query": "Question: Where are prepared mushrooms purchased?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: ground\nC: grocery store\nD: pizza\nE: forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where prepared mushrooms are typically sold. Prepared mushrooms are not found in natural settings, so options like the forest and ground can be eliminated.",
    "Next, let's examine if prepared mushrooms are commonly found in a grocery store. Grocery stores often sell a variety of prepared foods, including canned or packaged mushrooms.",
    "Now, evaluate the option of purchasing prepared mushrooms from a refrigerator. While they can be stored in a refrigerator, it is not a location where they are purchased.",
    "Consider the option of pizza. While pizza may contain prepared mushrooms as a topping, it is not a direct source for purchasing prepared mushrooms themselves.",
    "Having ruled out the forest, ground, and pizza, we are left with the grocery store as a primary option.",
    "In a grocery store, prepared mushrooms can be found in various sections, such as canned goods or fresh produce. This confirms their availability in grocery stores.",
    "Assessing all the options again confirms that the grocery store is a common and practical place to purchase prepared mushrooms.",
    "Therefore, the best answer based on the reasoning and elimination of other options is the grocery store."
