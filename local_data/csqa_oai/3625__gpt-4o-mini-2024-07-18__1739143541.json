  "steps": [
    "The sentence states \"The man drank his coffee at work,\" indicating that the location is related to a workplace environment.",
    "From the choices provided, I need to discern which location is typically associated with a workplace.",
    "Option A: coffee shop - While people might drink coffee at a coffee shop, it is not a workplace context.",
    "Option B: table - A table is a piece of furniture and doesn\u2019t specify a location related to \"work.\"",
    "Option C: kitchen - A kitchen may be part of a workplace but is not typically referred to as such in an office context.",
    "Option D: office - This option directly relates to a work environment; it makes sense that the man drank his coffee there.",
    "Option E: chair - Like a table, a chair is simply furniture and does not specify a work-related location.",
    "The only option that appropriately categorizes the place where the man could drink coffee within the \"work\" context is D."
