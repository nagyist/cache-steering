  "query": "Question: He had only experienced tangible and corporeal events in his life, but the hippy girl opened up his what side?\n\nChoices:\nA: insubstantial\nB: mind\nC: intangible\nD: ethereal\nE: spiritual",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"tangible and corporeal events\" suggests that the man's experiences have been physical and concrete in nature.",
    "The hippy girl is often associated with free-spiritedness, openness, and exploring aspects of life that go beyond the physical realm.",
    "If she opened up a different side of him, it likely refers to a realm of experience that transcends the material and physical.",
    "Let's analyze the answer choices:\n- A: \"insubstantial\" suggests lacking substance or reality, which is not likely the intended meaning.\n- B: \"mind\" may be relevant but does not capture the essence of the transcendent experience.\n- C: \"intangible\" refers to something that cannot be touched or physically measured, which aligns with the idea of non-physical experiences.\n- D: \"ethereal\" implies something delicate and light, often associated with heavenly or otherworldly experiences, but is more descriptive than definitive.\n- E: \"spiritual\" directly relates to the non-physical and transcendent aspects of existence, indicating a connection to beliefs or practices beyond the material world.",
    "Considering the context, \"spiritual\" could be a strong candidate as it encompasses the idea of connecting with deeper, non-material aspects of life. However, \"intangible\" fits well as it specifically describes experiences that cannot be grasped physically.",
    "Ultimately, both \"intangible\" and \"spiritual\" are relevant, but \"spiritual\" signifies a more profound transformation linked to personal inner experiences often attributed to such interactions.",
    "There is an inclination to lean towards \"spiritual\" as it encapsulates the greater aspect of life experiences that the hippy girl might have introduced to him."
