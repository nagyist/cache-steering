  "query": "Question: What kind of store has jewelry and clothing?\n\nChoices:\nA: suitcase\nB: department store\nC: safe deposit box\nD: ring box\nE: vault",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a type of store that contains both jewelry and clothing.",
    "We can eliminate option A (suitcase) because a suitcase is a travel item and does not refer to a store.",
    "Option C (safe deposit box) is not a store; it is a secure place to store items like jewelry and valuables.",
    "Option D (ring box) is a container for rings and does not refer to a store or have clothing.",
    "Option E (vault) is a storage facility for valuables but is not a store and does not sell clothing.",
    "That leaves option B (department store), which is known for selling a variety of items, including clothing and jewelry.",
    "Department stores typically have different sections for clothing, accessories, and jewelry.",
    "Therefore, option B fits the criteria of having both jewelry and clothing available for purchase."
