  "query": "Question: Why does wood float?\n\nChoices:\nA: it is a good swimmer\nB: solid\nC: gilded\nD: less dense than water\nE: porous",
  "steps": [
    "Wood floats because of its physical properties, one of which is density.",
    "For an object to float, it must be less dense than the fluid it is placed in; in this case, water has a density of 1 g/cm\u00b3.",
    "Wood typically has a density that is lower than that of water, allowing it to float rather than sink.",
    "When a piece of wood is placed in water, it displaces a volume of water equal to its weight.",
    "If the weight of the displaced water is greater than or equal to the weight of the wood, the wood will float.",
    "In summary, the reason wood floats is primarily due to its density being lower than that of water.",
    "Now, reviewing the answer choices, we need to identify which one correctly explains why wood floats.",
    "Choice A (\"it is a good swimmer\") does not provide a scientific reason.",
    "Choice B (\"solid\") does not explain the floating phenomenon relevant to density.",
    "Choice C (\"gilded\") relates to something covered in gold, which is irrelevant.",
    "Choice D (\"less dense than water\") accurately describes the reason for wood floating.",
    "Choice E (\"porous\") could contribute to wood's overall density but is not the primary reason for it floating."
