  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the context of having more guests than expected in a house. This suggests that the folding chair needs to be placed in a location that can accommodate extra seating.",
    "Next, I consider the function of a folding chair, which is generally used for temporary seating and is easy to store and set up.",
    "Now, I will evaluate each option given in the choices. \nA: auditorium - this is typically a large, public space and not relevant to the situation.\nB: ocean - this does not provide a practical solution for seating guests.\nC: church - while churches may have seating arrangements, they are not normally where I would put a folding chair for guests at home.\nD: room - this is a vague option. However, if this means another room in the house, it could be a feasible option for placing the chair.\nE: garage - this could also be a storage solution for the folding chair, but it is not an ideal placement for accommodating guests right away.",
    "Considering that I have more guests than expected and need to make additional seating available, the option that implies immediate accessibility to guests is \"room.\"",
    "Since the folding chair is likely needed quickly, it makes sense to place it in an area of the house that is already configured for hosting, rather than in the garage, which is more for storage."
