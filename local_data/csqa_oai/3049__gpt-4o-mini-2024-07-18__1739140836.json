  "steps": [
    "Mary was a high school student, which indicates she is still in secondary education, not yet at university.",
    "The context mentions that she was in a quiet place to study, suggesting she was preparing for class.",
    "The bell ringing typically signifies a transition, often toward a designated place such as a classroom.",
    "Given the role of a bell in a school setting, it is most commonly associated with class changes rather than leaving for dinner or going to a university or library.",
    "The option of \"every aspect of life\" is too broad and nonspecific to relate to where she needed to go at that moment.",
    "Among the options available, the classroom is the most logical place to go after the bell rang, as it signifies the start of another period for the students."
