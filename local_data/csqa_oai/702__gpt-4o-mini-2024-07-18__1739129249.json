  "query": "Question: The shark was migrating between continents, where did biologists find it?\n\nChoices:\nA: fresh water\nB: gulf of mexico\nC: open ocean\nD: television program\nE: coral reef",
  "steps": [
    "Sharks are known to be highly migratory species, often traveling long distances in the open seas between different ocean regions and continents.",
    "The options provided include specific habitats: fresh water, Gulf of Mexico, open ocean, television program, and coral reef.",
    "Fresh water is not a typical habitat for sharks as they predominantly live in saltwater environments.",
    "The Gulf of Mexico is a saltwater body, and while sharks can be found there, it is a specific area rather than a broad migratory route.",
    "The open ocean is vast and aligns with the behavior of migratory sharks traveling between continents.",
    "A television program is not a viable option as it does not pertain to a physical location where sharks would be found.",
    "Coral reefs can be habitats for certain shark species, but they are not the primary environment for migratory sharks during their long-distance travels.",
    "Considering the information, the most logical choice for where biologists would find migrating sharks is the open ocean."
