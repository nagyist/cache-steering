  "query": "Question: Billy wasn't good at communicating with other people so he took a found a mentor and put a lot of effort into doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: puzzle\nB: learning\nC: exchanging ideas\nD: confusion\nE: response",
  "steps": [
    "Billy recognized that he struggled with communication, so he sought a mentor to help improve this skill.",
    "Finding a mentor typically involves a commitment to learning and developing through guidance.",
    "Since communication is a skill that needs to be developed, the effort he put in would logically be focused on learning how to communicate better.",
    "The options provided include activities or states that may align with his efforts. 'Puzzle' does not connect to communication, nor do 'confusion' or 'response' as direct efforts toward improvement.",
    "'Exchanging ideas' might initially seem relevant, but it would infer that he was already proficient enough to engage in dialogues, which contradicts the information that he struggled with communication.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting choice based on the context that he sought to improve his communication skills through a mentor is 'learning'."
