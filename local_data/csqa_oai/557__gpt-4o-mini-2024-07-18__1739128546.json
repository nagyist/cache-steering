  "query": "Question: John lives in Texas. If he takes the highway South and doesn't stop, where will he end up next?\n\nChoices:\nA: oklahoma\nB: developed land\nC: united states\nD: desert\nE: mexico",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the direction John is taking. He is going south, which means he is moving towards the southern borders of Texas.",
    "Next, I will recall the geographic location of Texas. It is situated in the southern part of the United States and shares a border with Mexico to the south.",
    "If John continues south without stopping, he will eventually reach the border of Mexico. Therefore, he will not remain in Texas for long.",
    "Now, I will consider the choices given: \nA: Oklahoma is north of Texas, so this option is not valid.\nB: Developed land is vague and does not specifically indicate a location.\nC: The United States is the country he started in, but he is leaving it by going south.\nD: Desert is also vague and does not specify a particular location.\nE: Mexico is directly south of Texas, making it the most logical endpoint if he continues south.",
    "Since Mexico is the only option that accurately reflects where John will end up if he travels south from Texas, it is reasonable to conclude that this is the correct answer."
