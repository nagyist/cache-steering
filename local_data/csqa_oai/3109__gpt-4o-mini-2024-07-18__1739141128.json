  "steps": [
    "The question states, \"I know the answer, but I do not do what to it?\" This implies there is an action related to knowledge that is not being performed.",
    "The word \"do\" suggests we are looking for a verb related to knowledge or understanding.",
    "Let's analyze the choices: \n- A: \"ignorant\" suggests a lack of knowledge, which doesn't fit since the subject says they know the answer.\n- B: \"correct\" doesn't fit either as it is not a verb, and doesn't relate to an action in this context.\n- C: \"ignorance\" refers to a lack of knowledge, which contradicts the statement of knowing the answer.\n- D: \"had learnt\" isn't applicable as it refers to a past action rather than an ongoing one.\n- E: \"understand\" could fit as an action that is related to knowledge.",
    "Since \"understand\" is the only option that corresponds as an action that could be negated in the context of knowing an answer, this suggests that the subject understands the answer but does not act on this understanding.",
    "Thus, the statement could be interpreted as the individual knowing the answer but not understanding it well enough to apply or act on this knowledge."
