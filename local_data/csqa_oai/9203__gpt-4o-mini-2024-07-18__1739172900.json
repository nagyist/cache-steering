  "query": "Question: If people have no contact with others they will experience what emotion?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel lonely\nB: togetherness\nC: feed themselves\nD: compete with each other\nE: talk to each other",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the emotional response experienced by people who have no contact with others.",
    "When people lack social interaction, they often report feelings of isolation and sadness.",
    "The term \"lonely\" specifically describes the emotional state of being alone and feeling sad about it.",
    "The other options provided (B, C, D, E) do not correlate with the lack of contact with others.",
    "Option B, \"togetherness,\" implies a social connection, which contradicts the premise of having no contact.",
    "Option C, \"feed themselves,\" does not directly relate to an emotional response but rather to a physical need.",
    "Option D, \"compete with each other,\" suggests a social dynamic that requires interaction, which is not applicable here.",
    "Option E, \"talk to each other,\" also suggests interaction and is irrelevant in the context of no contact.",
    "Given the understanding that lack of contact leads to feelings of sadness and isolation, the most fitting answer is that people will \"feel lonely.\""
