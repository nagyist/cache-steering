  "steps": [
    "Ferrets are domesticated animals that thrive in environments where they have space to roam and explore.",
    "A classroom is a confined space with limited room for movement, which is not suitable for a ferret to feel free.",
    "North Carolina is a state that can have both indoor and outdoor environments, but does not inherently mean freedom for a ferret.",
    "North America is a large continent that encompasses a variety of environments, but again does not directly imply freedom.",
    "Great Britain, like North Carolina, has both urban and rural areas but is also not a particularly spacious environment for a ferret.",
    "The outdoors, in contrast, generally provides ferrets with a more open environment where they can dig, run, and explore, which caters to their natural instincts.",
    "Given that ferrets are naturally active and inquisitive animals, an outdoor setting would likely provide them with the most freedom to express their behaviors.",
    "Evaluating all options, the choice that ensures the most freedom for a ferret is clearly the outdoors."
