  "query": "Question: What is likely to be the feeling of someone who hurts someone else?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel remorse\nB: will resent\nC: anger\nD: sadness\nE: bad karma",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that hurting someone can evoke a range of emotional responses depending on the context and the person's character.",
    "Next, evaluate the choice A: \"feel remorse.\" This is a common reaction for many people after causing someone else pain, as they may recognize the wrongness of their actions.",
    "Now, look at choice B: \"will resent.\" This implies a feeling towards the hurt person rather than a response to the act of hurting, and often it is not instinctive after causing harm.",
    "Examine choice C: \"anger.\" This could be a direct reaction, especially if the act of hurting was defensive or retaliatory; however, it's typically not the primary feeling after causing harm.",
    "Consider choice D: \"sadness.\" While some might feel sad for their actions, it usually hinges on their personal empathy, which can vary widely.",
    "Finally, assess choice E: \"bad karma.\" This is more philosophical and does not reflect an immediate emotional response; it's more of a belief than a feeling.",
    "After evaluating the emotional responses, \"feel remorse\" stands out as the most likely initial feeling after hurting someone else."
