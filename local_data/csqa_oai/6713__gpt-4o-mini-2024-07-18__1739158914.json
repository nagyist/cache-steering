  "steps": [
    "To determine the primary duty of a chef, I need to understand the main responsibilities typically associated with that role.",
    "A chef is primarily responsible for overseeing the kitchen and ensuring that food is prepared correctly, safely, and efficiently.",
    "I will evaluate each option in relation to the chef's primary responsibilities.",
    "Option A, \"manual,\" is vague and does not clearly represent what a chef primarily does, as \"manual\" could refer to any physical activity.",
    "Option B, \"thin sauce,\" describes a specific task but is not comprehensive enough to be considered a primary duty. Chefs are tasked with a wide variety of cooking techniques and types of dishes.",
    "Option C, \"study French cooking,\" reflects an area of expertise but is not a primary duty. Not all chefs specialize in French cooking, as culinary expertise can vary widely.",
    "Option D, \"cook dinner,\" is a simplified version of a chef's role. While cooking is indeed a major aspect of a chef's job, it does not encompass all the responsibilities involved.",
    "Option E, \"prepare food,\" is broad and encompasses the primary duty of chefs, which includes not only cooking but also planning menus, sourcing ingredients, and managing kitchen staff.",
    "Among the options, \"prepare food\" is the most inclusive and directly relates to the essence of a chef's responsibilities in a professional kitchen."
