  "query": "Question: Lance owns a vineyard.  To make grapes he needs plenty of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: deserts\nB: shops\nC: sunshine\nD: kitchen\nE: terrain",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what Lance needs in order to grow grapes in his vineyard, we need to consider the fundamental requirements for grape cultivation.",
    "Grapes thrive in specific environmental conditions, and one of the primary requirements is the availability of sufficient sunlight.",
    "Deserts (Choice A) generally have harsh conditions with extreme temperatures and limited water, which are not conducive to grape growth.",
    "Shops (Choice B) do not play a direct role in the agricultural process, so they are not necessary for growing grapes.",
    "Sunshine (Choice C) is crucial for photosynthesis, which is essential for the growth of the grapevines. Therefore, it is a key requirement.",
    "Kitchens (Choice D) are related to food preparation and have no relevance to the cultivation of grapes or vineyard management.",
    "Terrain (Choice E) is important for growing grapes since certain types of soil and landscape can affect vine health and yield, but terrain does not directly imply the need for grape growth compared to sunshine.",
    "Considering all the above points, while terrain can play a role, sunlight is absolutely essential for the growth of grapes. Thus, the best answer to Lance's requirement for making grapes is sunshine."
