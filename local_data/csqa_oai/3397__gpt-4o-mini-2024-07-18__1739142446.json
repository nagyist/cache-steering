  "query": "Question: If a storey contained many small restaurants, what type of structure would it be in?\n\nChoices:\nA: city hall\nB: apartment building\nC: mall\nD: book of stories\nE: tall building",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the type of structure that contains many small restaurants, I need to consider the common characteristics of various building types mentioned in the options.",
    "City halls typically serve governmental functions and do not usually have commercial spaces like small restaurants.",
    "Apartment buildings primarily focus on residential living and might have commercial spaces, but they are not known for multiple small restaurants.",
    "A mall is specifically designed to house various retailers, including restaurants, which makes it a strong candidate for containing many small restaurants.",
    "The option \"book of stories\" does not correlate to a physical structure but rather a literary format, thus it can be eliminated from consideration.",
    "A tall building simply refers to the height of a structure and does not specify its function. It could be residential, commercial, or mixed-use, so it's not a specific answer to the question of containing many restaurants.",
    "Considering the need for a space accommodating multiple small restaurants, the best match thus far appears to be a mall because it is designed for diverse retail experiences, including dining options.",
    "I should double-check if there may be other amusement or entertainment venues that could fit, but those aren\u2019t provided in the options.",
    "Since I only need to select an answer from the choices given, and since \"mall\" is the structure most associated with many small restaurants, this reinforces the conclusion."
