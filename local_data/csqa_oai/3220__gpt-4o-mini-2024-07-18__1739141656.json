  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that it is a hot day, suggesting that the temperature is high and potentially uncomfortable.",
    "Eating ice cream on a hot day is commonly associated with a desire to alleviate the discomfort caused by the heat.",
    "One of the primary reasons people eat ice cream in warm weather is to cool down, as it is a cold treat that provides relief from heat.",
    "The phrase \"they liked to eat ice cream\" implies enjoyment and a positive experience related to consuming this cold treat.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options given in context to their goal while eating ice cream on a hot day.",
    "Option A (\"were hungry\") does not align well with the connotation of consuming ice cream, which is often a treat rather than a staple food.",
    "Option B (\"cool down\") strongly correlates with the act of eating ice cream in hot weather to reduce body temperature.",
    "Option C (\"get full\") could be a consideration, but ice cream is often enjoyed more for the pleasure and relief it brings rather than simply to satiate hunger.",
    "Option D (\"depressed\") does not connect logically to enjoying ice cream; it has a negative connotation unrelated to the context.",
    "Option E (\"let melt in mouth\") focuses more on the sensory experience than a clear goal tied to the context of heat and relief.",
    "Given that their action of eating ice cream is primarily driven by addressing the heat, the most fitting choice is Option B."
