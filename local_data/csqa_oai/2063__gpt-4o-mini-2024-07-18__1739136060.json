  "steps": [
    "Sally noticed that the sword was straight and is looking for a different type of blade. This implies that she wants something that contrasts with the straight sword.",
    "The choices available are: A) crooked, B) curved, C) bent, D) straightforth, and E) broken.",
    "Since Sally wants a different type of blade, options that suggest some curvature or deviation from being straight would be more suitable.",
    "The term \"crooked\" (A) generally suggests being twisted or out of alignment, which could be one interpretation of a different type of blade. However, this does not suggest any specific form of sword.",
    "The term \"curved\" (B) references a sword that bends gracefully, like a scimitar, which is a distinct style compared to a straight sword. This is a plausible option for what she wants.",
    "The term \"bent\" (C) might refer to a sword that is not straight but does not necessarily indicate a specific type of design or style, making it less descriptive.",
    "The term \"straightforth\" (D) seems nonsensical or non-standard in this context as it's not a recognized term in sword types, therefore it can be dismissed.",
    "The term \"broken\" (E) implies a sword that is damaged and would not be what Sally desires in terms of functionality or aesthetics.",
    "Out of the options presented, the term \"curved\" (B) is the most specific and fits Sally\u2019s desire for a sword with a distinct type of blade compared to something that is straight."
