  "query": "Question: Why do people go about killing people ?\n\nChoices:\nA: murder\nB: get killed\nC: sporting event\nD: hate\nE: feel remorse",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question which asks about the reasons that lead people to kill others.",
    "The options provided include various terms: \"murder,\" \"get killed,\" \"sporting event,\" \"hate,\" and \"feel remorse.\"",
    "\"Murder\" is a term that describes the act of killing, but it doesn't explain the reason behind why people would engage in such behavior.",
    "\"Get killed\" is the consequence of killing someone else; it doesn't relate to the motivation for killing.",
    "\"A sporting event\" typically does not involve intentional killing; it might imply competitive contexts, but it is not a valid reason for why people kill.",
    "\"Hate\" can be a significant motivator behind acts of violence and killing, often driven by deep-seated animosity.",
    "\"Feel remorse\" suggests regret after the act rather than a reason to commit the act of killing in the first place.",
    "Among the choices, \"hate\" stands out as a plausible reason that can lead to the act of killing.",
    "Thus, the best answer to the question of why people go about killing others, considering the motivations, would likely be \"hate.\""
