  "query": "Question: What preposition do you use if you want to combine two words?\n\nChoices:\nA: article\nB: adjective\nC: interjection\nD: conjunction\nE: pronoun",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question, which asks for a preposition that combines two words. However, I suspect the question may contain a small error because prepositions typically relate to nouns and do not combine words like conjunctions do.",
    "Next, I will look at the answer choices provided: article, adjective, interjection, conjunction, and pronoun. I need to determine which of these is relevant to combining two words.",
    "I note that \"article,\" \"adjective,\" \"interjection,\" and \"pronoun\" do not function to combine words. Instead, these are different parts of speech that fulfill different roles in a sentence.",
    "On the other hand, a \"conjunction\" is a word that connects clauses or words, making it directly applicable to the combining of two words. Examples of conjunctions include \"and,\" \"but,\" and \"or.\"",
    "I will now confirm that there are no ambiguities in the definitions. According to standard grammar rules, conjunctions are indeed used to connect not only phrases but also pairs of words.",
    "Given this analysis, \"conjunction\" fits the requirement of combining two words perfectly, as it serves specifically that function in sentence structure.",
    "Now, I can conclude that the best choice from the options is clearly \"D: conjunction,\" as it serves the purpose stated in the question."
