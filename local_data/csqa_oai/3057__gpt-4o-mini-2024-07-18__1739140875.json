  "query": "Question: He tried to jump his car, what terminal did he connect to after connecting the positive terminal?\n\nChoices:\nA: bad\nB: uncertain\nC: possimism\nD: negative\nE: adverse",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that he is trying to jump his car, which typically involves using jumper cables to transfer power from one car battery to another.",
    "When jumping a car, one of the first steps is to connect the positive terminal of the dead battery to the positive terminal of the functioning battery.",
    "After connecting the positive terminal, the next step in the process is to connect the negative terminal.",
    "In a proper jump-start procedure, the negative terminal of the functioning battery is connected to a grounding point on the dead car or the negative terminal of the dead battery.",
    "Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, he would connect to either a negative terminal or another grounding point, but the question specifically asks what terminal he connects to after the positive.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, the only terminal mentioned is \"negative.\"",
    "Thus, the correct answer to the question based on the process of jumping a car is \"negative.\""
