  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the source from which a mother reads a story to her child.",
    "Let's analyze the choices one by one.",
    "Choice A: \"tall building\" doesn't typically relate to where stories are read. It can be a place, but it is not a source of stories.",
    "Choice B: \"british building\" again refers to a place and has no inherent connection to storytelling.",
    "Choice C: \"mall\" is a location that might have bookstores, but it is not a direct source of reading stories to a child.",
    "Choice D: \"book of stories\" is a direct source from which stories are read, making it a probable answer.",
    "Choice E: \"moon\" is whimsical and doesn't serve as a source for reading stories.",
    "Among all these choices, the only one that represents a direct source of stories is \"book of stories.\"",
    "We can conclude that a mother typically reads stories from a book rather than from a location or an abstract concept."
