  "query": "Question: When the US is at war, where will it likely drop bombs?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: afghanistan\nC: aircraft\nD: arsenal\nE: suitcase",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to the United States' actions during war, specifically bomb dropping.",
    "I need to consider historical contexts and interventions by the US in wartime to analyze potential targets.",
    "Canada is a neighboring country and is typically not a target for US military action; this option is unlikely.",
    "Afghanistan has been a significant theater of conflict for the US military, especially during the War on Terror, making it a plausible target.",
    "\u201cAircraft\u201d does not refer to a geographical location where bombs are dropped; it is a type of object, so this option is not relevant.",
    "\u201cArsenal\u201d refers to a storage place for weapons and does not represent a target in a bombing context; therefore, it is not applicable.",
    "\u201cSuitcase\u201d does not connect to bombing targets either, unless implying a niche scenario, which is not typical; hence this option is also not suitable.",
    "With the analysis above, Afghanistan remains the only valid choice where the US has historically dropped bombs in wartime."
