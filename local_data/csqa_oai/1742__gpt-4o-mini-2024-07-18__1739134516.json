  "query": "Question: Regular pants are sometimes not long enough if a person is very what?\n\nChoices:\nA: goofy\nB: tall\nC: constipated\nD: abnormal\nE: new",
  "steps": [
    "Regular pants are designed to fit a certain range of body sizes, which includes height as an important factor.",
    "If a person is very tall, it is likely that standard lengths of pants will not reach the desired position on their legs, making them insufficiently long.",
    "The other choices do not directly relate to the length of pants.",
    "\"Goofy\" refers to a personality or behavior and doesn't influence pant length.",
    "\"Constipated\" refers to a medical condition and is unrelated to the fit of clothing.",
    "\"Abnormal\" is vague and does not specifically address height or any specific feature affecting pants length.",
    "\"New\" also does not relate to body size but rather to the condition or freshness of the pants.",
    "Thus, the only logical conclusion is that tall individuals may require longer pants."
