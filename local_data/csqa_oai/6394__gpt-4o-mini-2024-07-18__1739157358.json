  "query": "Question: You go into a building.  There were two guards at the entryway checking IDs.  Where might you be.\n\nChoices:\nA: department store\nB: house\nC: own home\nD: when you pick tomato's from your garden\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "The presence of two guards checking IDs suggests a location that requires security protocols, which is typically not found in casual or private settings.",
    "A department store usually does not have guards at the entrance checking IDs; customers can enter freely without any ID checks.",
    "A house is a private space where guards are generally not present, as most homes do not require ID verification for entry.",
    "Your own home would also not have guards checking IDs, as it is a personal space where occupants do not need to show identification.",
    "Picking tomatoes from your garden is an outdoor activity that does not involve security detail or ID checks.",
    "An office building often has security measures in place, including guard checks for employees and visitors to ensure safety and proper access control.",
    "Given the reasoning above, the only possible scenario that involves guards checking IDs consistently is an office building.",
    "I will confirm again that in an office building, it is common to have security for various reasons including protecting sensitive information and ensuring the safety of employees.",
    "Thus, considering all the locations and their typical security measures, the only fitting answer here is an office building."
