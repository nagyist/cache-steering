  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context: the person was prevented from leaving work, which implies that something external to their workplace is obstructing their way.",
    "Next, we consider the choices given, looking for something that would realistically block a person in the street after leaving work.",
    "Choice A: building. A building itself is usually a permanent fixture and wouldn't specifically block someone unless it was under construction or a person was trapped inside, which doesn't fit the context.",
    "Choice B: demonstration. A protest or demonstration in the street would logically prevent individuals from leaving their workplace, as crowds can block access.",
    "Choice C: laugh. This does not fit the context of something physical that could block a person in the street; it is an abstract concept.",
    "Choice D: garage. A garage is typically a place to park cars; unless it is malfunctioning or something is physically blocking the garage exit, it does not make sense in this context.",
    "Choice E: conference. While a conference may keep someone at work longer, it does not logically explain something blocking them in the street.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most reasonable choice that aligns with preventing someone from leaving their work is \"demonstration,\" as it involves people gathering in the street."
