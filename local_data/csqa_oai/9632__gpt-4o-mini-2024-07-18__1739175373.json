  "query": "Question: John thought that it was relaxing to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: feeling better\nB: lie back\nC: lower blood pressure\nD: feel happy\nE: fall asleep",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what it means for an activity to be relaxing. Typically, relaxing activities help a person to unwind and reduce stress.",
    "Consider each choice to determine if it represents an activity that could be considered relaxing.",
    "A: \"feeling better\" is a state rather than an activity. It does not describe an action John is taking.",
    "B: \"lie back\" is an action that involves resting and could definitely be considered relaxing.",
    "C: \"lower blood pressure\" is a result that may happen due to relaxation, but it is not an activity itself.",
    "D: \"feel happy\" is an emotional state, similar to feeling better, and does not specify an action.",
    "E: \"fall asleep\" is an activity that often occurs when a person is in a relaxed state and can be considered relaxing.",
    "Evaluate the actions that could lead to relaxation - both \"lie back\" and \"fall asleep\" fit this definition well, but \"lie back\" is a more immediate action that one can actively engage in to relax.",
    "Now, compare the options \"lie back\" and \"fall asleep.\" While both are relaxing, \"lie back\" is typically the first step towards a state of relaxation before falling asleep.",
    "Conclude that since John thought it was relaxing, \"lie back\" is a more direct and appropriate answer compared to the others."
