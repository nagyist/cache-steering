    "The man had worked hard, which suggests he invested significant effort and dedication into something he believed in.",
    "Seeing the idea come to reality indicates a successful outcome, likely leading to positive emotions.",
    "The phrase \"had him beaming\" implies a sense of happiness or pride, as beaming typically refers to a broad smile or expression of joy.",
    "Considering the successful realization of an idea he worked hard on, the most fitting emotions would likely be positive.",
    "Among the options, \"celebrate\" does not capture a specific emotion but rather an action; thus, it\u2019s less suitable.",
    "\"Joy\" signifies happiness but is not as specific as some of the other options regarding accomplishment.",
    "\"Feeling of accomplishment\" is a strong possibility but feels somewhat verbose compared to the other options.",
    "\"Sadness\" is directly contradictory to the context provided, as the scenario describes success, not failure.",
    "\"Pride\" matches the context of feeling satisfaction from completing something significant, which aligns well with working hard for success.",
