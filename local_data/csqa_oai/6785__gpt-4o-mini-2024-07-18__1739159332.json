  "query": "Question: What task can a lawyer plan for to engage a witness who has been difficult to find?\n\nChoices:\nA: come early\nB: state case\nC: nullified\nD: clear of all charges\nE: produce evidence",
  "steps": [
    "To determine how a lawyer can engage a witness who has been difficult to locate, we should consider effective strategies for reaching out and establishing a connection with the witness.",
    "A plausible approach is for the lawyer to plan ahead of time, as this could help in finding the witness. This aligns with option A (come early), suggesting preparedness and proactive measures.",
    "Considering engagement strategies, stating the case (option B) does not directly relate to finding a witness, but may become relevant once the witness is identified.",
    "Options C (nullified) and D (clear of all charges) do not seem applicable as they pertain to legal outcomes rather than strategies to engage a witness.",
    "Option E (produce evidence) might be relevant in a broader context of a trial or case but doesn't specifically address the act of locating or engaging a witness.",
    "Among the options, \"come early\" appears to be the most relevant strategy for a lawyer to find and engage a witness who has been difficult to find. It suggests taking initiative and preparing to make the encounter more likely."
