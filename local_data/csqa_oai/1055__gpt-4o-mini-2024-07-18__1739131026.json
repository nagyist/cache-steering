  "query": "Question: What happens to people in horror movies who die?\n\nChoices:\nA: killed in war\nB: murdered\nC: not important\nD: sentenced to jail\nE: cremated",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of horror movies and how they typically portray death.",
    "In horror movies, characters often face violent and brutal deaths as part of the genre's theme of fear and suspense.",
    "Now, we'll analyze the options provided:",
    "Option A, \"killed in war\", is generally not a common theme in horror movies, which focus more on personal or supernatural threats.",
    "Option B, \"murdered\", accurately reflects the frequent outcome for characters in horror movies, as they are often victims of a killer or monster.",
    "Option C, \"not important\", does not make sense as many deaths in horror movies are significant to the plot and character development.",
    "Option D, \"sentenced to jail\", is not applicable since characters don\u2019t typically die as a result of judicial actions in horror stories but rather from violent events.",
    "Option E, \"cremated\", while it may happen after a character dies, is not an event depicted within the horror movie itself as a direct consequence of the death.",
    "Thus, after considering all options, the most relevant and accurate description of what happens to people in horror movies who die is that they are \"murdered\"."
