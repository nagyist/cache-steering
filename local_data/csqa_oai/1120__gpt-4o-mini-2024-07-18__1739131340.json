  "query": "Question: Billy's boss told him to get a book from a high shelf, so he took a stepladder from what?\n\nChoices:\nA: store room\nB: tool shed\nC: hardware store\nD: construction worker's vehicle\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to analyze where a stepladder would typically be stored. Common places include storage areas, tool sheds, or workplaces with construction or maintenance equipment.",
    "Next, consider the context of the situation: Billy's boss asked him to retrieve a book from a high shelf, suggesting it is in an office, library, or similar environment where books are stored.",
    "A stepladder is more likely to be found in areas where tools or equipment for maintenance and access to higher shelves are kept, such as a store room or tool shed.",
    "While a hardware store does sell stepladders, it doesn't make sense as a location from which Billy would retrieve a stepladder for the task at hand.",
    "The option of a construction worker's vehicle can be ruled out because it would not be a logical location for accessing a stepladder for indoor use.",
    "A library could have a stepladder but it's not typically a place where one would retrieve stepladders as they're not generally needed by patrons for everyday tasks.",
    "The most reasonable conclusion is that Billy would get a stepladder from a store room, as this would be a common place for storing such equipment in an office or similar environment where books might be located.",
    "Thus, the stepladder is most logically retrieved from the store room."
