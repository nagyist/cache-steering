  "query": "Question: John is walking an aisle full of children's clothes and ahead of him he sees televisions.  What sort of store is he probably shopping at?\n\nChoices:\nA: drugstore\nB: garage\nC: church\nD: department store\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the items John is seeing. He is walking through an aisle of children's clothes which suggests a retail environment that sells such items.",
    "Next, look at the items ahead of him. He sees televisions, which indicates electronics are available in the same store.",
    "Clothing and electronics are typically sold in a department store rather than in a drugstore, garage, church, or grocery store.",
    "A drugstore generally sells health and beauty products with limited clothing items, a garage is not a retail space, a church does not sell retail products, and a grocery store focuses on food rather than clothing or electronics.",
    "Since both children's clothing and televisions are commonly found in a department store, this indicates that John is likely shopping at a department store.",
    "Let\u2019s confirm the department store offers various sections including clothing, electronics, and possibly other household items, making it a fitting environment for John\u2019s situation.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that John's shopping destination is a department store."
