    "We need to identify places that typically host live entertainment.",
    "Parks can sometimes feature live events, such as concerts, but they are not exclusively venues for live performances.",
    "A friend's house may host private gatherings or small performances, but it doesn\u2019t typically qualify as a venue for live entertainment.",
    "Movies are pre-recorded, so they don't qualify as live entertainment.",
    "Theatre is known for live performances, such as plays and musicals, which definitively fits as a venue for live entertainment.",
    "Shows generally refer to live performances as well, but this term can be more ambiguous compared to theatre, which is specifically dedicated to live performances.",
    "Among the choices, \"theatre\" directly correlates to the concept of live entertainment, as it primarily features live acts.",
    "Comparing the choices, \"theatre\" is the most appropriate choice for a location to see live entertainment."
