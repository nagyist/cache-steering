    "The question asks for a term that describes something not plain but with adornments.",
    "To clarify, \"plain\" typically means simple or without adornments, while \"adornments\" imply decorations or enhancements.",
    "The choices provided are: A) bells and whistles, B) fancy, C) exotic, D) decorative, E) extravagant.",
    "Looking at option A, \"bells and whistles\" often refers to extra features or embellishments, suggesting something extra rather than simplicity.",
    "Looking at option B, \"fancy\" suggests something that is ornate or elaborately designed, aligning well with the idea of adornments.",
    "Examining option C, \"exotic\" conveys a sense of being unusual or originating from a distant foreign place, which doesn't necessarily imply adornments.",
    "Considering option D, \"decorative\" directly relates to adding decoration or embellishments, fitting well with adornments.",
    "Looking at option E, \"extravagant\" indicates a larger scale of display or spending, often without necessarily focusing on just adornments.",
    "Both options B (\"fancy\") and D (\"decorative\") are strong contenders as they directly associate with something that has adornments.",
