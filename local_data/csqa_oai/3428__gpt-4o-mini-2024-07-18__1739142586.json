  "query": "Question: Where characteristically has a heart?\n\nChoices:\nA: all mammals\nB: person\nC: dogs\nD: hospital\nE: artichoke",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the question which asks where a \"heart\" is characteristically found.",
    "Consider the choices given and identify whether they are living beings, objects, or concepts.",
    "A: \"all mammals\" refers to a broad group that characteristically has a heart.",
    "B: \"person\" indicates an individual human, which definitely has a heart.",
    "C: \"dogs\" is a specific type of mammal and also has a heart.",
    "D: \"hospital\" does not characteristically have a heart, as it is a place or institution.",
    "E: \"artichoke\" is a plant, which does not have a heart as animals do, even though it has a concept of a core or center.",
    "Next, determine if multiple choices could be accurate, and if so, identify the most encompassing one.",
    "Since \"all mammals\" includes both persons and dogs, it can be considered the most broadly applicable choice.",
    "However, since the question asks for where characteristically has a heart, each living being option with a heart is also valid.",
    "Ultimately, the most inclusive answer reflecting where hearts are found across the categories is needed. \"All mammals\" captures the broader group."
