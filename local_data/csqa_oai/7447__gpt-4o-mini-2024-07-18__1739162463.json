  "query": "Question: If you order mixed drinks \"on the rocks\" you will get what in your drink?\n\nChoices:\nA: mixed drinks\nB: cold weather\nC: scotch\nD: antarctica\nE: water cooler",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"on the rocks\" refers to a drink served over ice. This indicates that the drink will be cold and have ice cubes in it.",
    "Ordering a drink \"on the rocks\" does not specifically imply any type of liquor; it can apply to various types of mixed drinks, not only scotch.",
    "The choices provided include various options, one of which is mixed drinks. Since \"on the rocks\" is a term typically used for cocktails or mixed drinks, option A is plausible.",
    "Options like cold weather (B), scotch (C), antarctica (D), and water cooler (E) do not relate directly to the context of ordering mixed drinks.",
    "Scotch (C) is a type of liquor that can be served on the rocks, but it does not encompass all mixed drinks.",
    "While scotch (C) might be served on the rocks, it does not represent the entire category of drinks that could be served in this manner.",
    "To summarize, \"on the rocks\" implies that the mixed drink is served with ice, which is more closely captured by option A: mixed drinks, rather than just scotch."
