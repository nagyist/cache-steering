  "steps": [
    "To determine where a jellyfish always lives, we need to consider the basic habitat of jellyfish, which are aquatic animals.",
    "Jellyfish are primarily found in marine environments, meaning they are typically located in oceans and seas.",
    "Among the choices given, option A (cartoon) does not represent a natural habitat for jellyfish.",
    "Option B (underwater) is a broad term but correctly describes where jellyfish live.",
    "Option C (pacific ocean) specifies one particular location where jellyfish can live, but it is not exhaustive of all jellyfish habitats.",
    "Option D (japanese restaurant) refers to a commercial establishment and not a natural habitat.",
    "Option E (red sea) is another specific body of water where jellyfish can be found, but like option C, it is not comprehensive of all their habitats.",
    "Therefore, since jellyfish can exist in various oceans around the world and are primarily found underwater, the most universally accurate answer is option B (underwater)."
