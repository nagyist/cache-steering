  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the method of delivery for a bank statement to an individual's house.",
    "A bank statement typically serves as a record of transactions and account balances, which needs to be communicated to account holders.",
    "Considering the choices, option A (legal document) is too broad and doesn't specifically relate to how a bank statement is received.",
    "Option B (newspaper) is not relevant because newspapers are not personal financial documents and are not sent as bank statements.",
    "Option C (press release) is related to public announcements and does not pertain to personal bank statements.",
    "Option D (email) is one possible method of communicating bank statements, especially in the digital age, but it may not involve sending it to a physical address.",
    "Option E (mail) refers to physical postal mail, which is a traditional and standard method for banks to send statements directly to customers' homes.",
    "Given that sending a bank statement via physical mail is common practice, option E is valid.",
    "Comparing the options, E (mail) is the most accurate and common way for someone to receive their bank statement at home."
