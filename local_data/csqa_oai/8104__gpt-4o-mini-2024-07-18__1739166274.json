  "steps": [
    "I need to identify what constitutes a non-perishable food item. Non-perishable foods typically include canned goods, dry grains, or anything that does not spoil quickly.",
    "I should consider common places in a house where non-perishable foods are usually stored.",
    "The stove is primarily used for cooking and not for storing food, so it is not a likely choice for finding non-perishable food.",
    "A table is usually for dining and does not serve as storage for non-perishable items, making it an unlikely option.",
    "A plate would generally be used for serving food, not storing it, so this option is also not viable.",
    "A jar can store non-perishable items like grains or dried fruits, but it is more of a specific container rather than a common storage area.",
    "The pantry is traditionally known as the place in a home where non-perishable food items are stored, making it the most logical choice.",
    "I have evaluated all options and determined that the pantry is the most appropriate place to find non-perishable food."
