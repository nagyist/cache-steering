  "query": "Question: Where might a milking machine be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: bar\nC: barn\nD: industrial area\nE: museum",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a milking machine might be located, consider the primary function of the machine, which is to milk cows.",
    "Since milking machines are specifically designed for dairy operations, they are typically found in environments related to agriculture and livestock.",
    "Next, evaluate each of the provided options. The office is generally for administrative tasks and not for agricultural activities.",
    "A bar primarily serves alcoholic beverages and does not typically involve farm machinery or livestock.",
    "An industrial area might have processing plants or manufacturing units, but it is not specifically geared towards milking cows.",
    "A museum is a place where artifacts are displayed for educational purposes, not where functional milking machines would be found.",
    "A barn, however, is a structure commonly found on farms where livestock, including cows, are kept, and where milking machines would be used.",
    "Therefore, considering all the options, the only logical location for a milking machine is in a barn."
