  "query": "Question: Unlike identical twins, with fraternal you can end up with both a daughter and what?\n\nChoices:\nA: brother\nB: daughtercard\nC: son\nD: boy\nE: dude",
  "steps": [
    "Fraternal twins are formed when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm cells, unlike identical twins who come from one fertilized egg that splits into two embryos.",
    "Since fraternal twins can be composed of any combination of male and female, it is possible to have a combination of a daughter and a son.",
    "The question specifically asks what you can end up with in addition to a daughter when having fraternal twins.",
    "By analyzing the options provided, \"brother\" (A) implies a male sibling, but it does not directly clarify that it refers to a son, which is usually a more typical term to use in this context.",
    "Option (C) directly states \"son,\" which is clear and unambiguous, matching the specific context provided in the question.",
    "Option (D) states \"boy,\" which is also correct, but it's less formal than \"son,\" and while it may refer to a young male, \"son\" fits better in family terminology.",
    "Options (B) and (E) do not relate to the context of familial relationships. \"Daughtercard\" is not a logical term in this scenario, and \"dude\" is colloquial and not relevant here.",
    "Given that both \"son\" and \"boy\" could be correct, \"son\" is the more appropriate choice for this context, as it specifically indicates the familial relation.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer here is the one that represents a direct familial relationship with a daughter."
