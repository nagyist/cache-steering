  "query": "Question: The farmer needed to go to the dental office, where did he have to go after turning out of his field?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: pub\nC: town\nD: hospital\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves determining the location the farmer would head to after leaving his field to visit a dental office. We need to consider logical destinations in relation to a dental office.",
    "Typically, a dental office is located in a populated area, often in a town or a city. This suggests that the farmer must go to a place where such offices are usually found.",
    "Choices A (Michigan), B (pub), and D (hospital) do not commonly represent a direct destination for someone specifically needing dental services. This helps narrow the options.",
    "Choice E (street) does not provide a clear destination for a dental office. While the street itself is a thoroughfare, it does not specify the need to visit an office.",
    "Choice C (town) is a plausible destination since dental offices are typically found in town centers or urban areas. It fits with the idea that the farmer is seeking a dental service.",
    "The farmer would logically have to head towards the town where he could find the dental office. This makes \"town\" the most suitable answer."
