  "query": "Question: Billy first used a spa when he had a torn ankle and his doctor recommended that he go where?\n\nChoices:\nA: health centre\nB: house\nC: leave\nD: country club\nE: backyard",
  "steps": [
    "Billy had a torn ankle, which likely required therapeutic treatment for recovery.",
    "A spa is often associated with health and relaxation, typically providing therapeutic services.",
    "Since a doctor made the recommendation, it implies that he advised a specific location beneficial for healing.",
    "A health centre is where patients usually receive medical advice, treatment, and recuperation services.",
    "The other choices (house, leave, country club, backyard) do not specifically cater to medical treatment or therapeutic recovery.",
    "Considering the context of Billy needing treatment for his injury, a health centre makes the most sense.",
    "The other options fail to convey a proper therapeutic environment for someone recovering from an injury.",
    "Thus, the choice that correlates with medical advice and effective recovery from a torn ankle is A: health centre."
