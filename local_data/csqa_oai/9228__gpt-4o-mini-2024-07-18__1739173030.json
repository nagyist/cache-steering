  "steps": [
    "To make friends, a welcoming and friendly expression is important to initiate connections with others.",
    "A smile is universally recognized as a positive gesture that conveys warmth and approachability.",
    "While a handshake can also be a friendly gesture, it is often more formal and may not be the first thing to do when trying to make friends.",
    "Meeting new people (D and E) is important in the process of making friends, but by themselves don\u2019t represent an expression.",
    "\"Nice\" (A) could imply a quality of demeanor but does not denote a specific expression like smiling.",
    "Since the question specifically asks for an expression, the most suitable choice is related directly to a physical expression rather than an action or descriptor.",
    "Considering all options, \"smile\" (B) is the clearest expression that fosters friendliness and invites social interaction."
