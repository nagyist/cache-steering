  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the context of the statement. The phrase \"a day didn't go by without somebody needing a saw\" implies that saws are commonly used tools, suggesting a practical or work-related environment.",
    "Next, consider the choices provided. A toolbox is a personal storage for tools and is commonly found in various settings. However, it may not specifically suggest a widespread communal need for saws.",
    "The hospital primarily focuses on medical tools and equipment, making it an unlikely choice for frequent use of saws.",
    "A basement can be a storage area for tools but does not specifically imply a high frequency of saw usage.",
    "A logging camp is a place specifically related to cutting trees, where saws are essential. This setting would logically imply that everyone would necessarily have their own saw.",
    "Finally, a tool shed is a common place for storing tools, but it may not reinforce the idea that everybody had their own saw readily available for everyday tasks.",
    "Given that a logging camp is a specialized environment where a saw is used daily, this makes it the most fitting choice compared to the other options."
