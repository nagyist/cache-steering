  "query": "Question: What does a birthday do to someone?\n\nChoices:\nA: regret\nB: indoor plumbing\nC: feel special\nD: own house\nE: electricity",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the essence of a birthday celebration. It is generally regarded as a personal milestone, marking the passage of time in an individual's life.",
    "Next, analyze the emotional aspects typically associated with birthdays. Many people reflect on their experiences, achievements, and growth over the past year.",
    "Then, think about the social interactions often involved with birthdays. Celebrations usually include gatherings of friends and family, leading to feelings of belonging and connection.",
    "Now, evaluate the options provided. Option A, \"regret,\" seems negative and doesn't align with the general sentiment associated with the celebration of a birthday.",
    "Consider option B, \"indoor plumbing.\" This is unrelated to birthdays and does not evoke any emotional or celebratory feelings.",
    "Next, review option D, \"own house.\" While owning a house can be a significant achievement, it is not a direct effect of having a birthday.",
    "Look at option E, \"electricity.\" Similarly to option B, this is irrelevant to the context of birthdays and lacks an emotional connection.",
    "Finally, contrast all options with option C, \"feel special.\" Birthdays often create a sense of being valued and cherished by others, which aligns perfectly with the typical feelings experienced during a celebration."
