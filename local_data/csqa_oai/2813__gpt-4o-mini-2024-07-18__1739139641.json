  "query": "Question: Football fans were storming the ticket booth, where were they?\n\nChoices:\nA: at a\nB: movie theatre\nC: clerk\nD: metro station\nE: sports arena",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the situation described in the question. The mention of \"football fans\" indicates a connection to a sports event.",
    "Consider where football fans would typically go to obtain tickets. They would most likely be seeking tickets for an impending football game.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided. \"A: at a\" is incomplete and meaningless, so it can be eliminated immediately.",
    "Look at \"B: movie theatre\". While people buy tickets at a movie theatre, this does not align with the context of football fans specifically.",
    "Next, analyze \"C: clerk\". This does not represent a location; it refers to a person who sells tickets, and hence does not fit the context.",
    "Now consider \"D: metro station\". Although people may purchase tickets at a metro station, it is unrelated to the activity of football fans.",
    "Finally, examine \"E: sports arena\". This location is directly associated with football events, where fans would indeed storm a ticket booth to buy tickets for a game.",
    "Since \"E: sports arena\" aligns perfectly with the context of football fans and ticket purchases, it is the most logical answer to the question."
