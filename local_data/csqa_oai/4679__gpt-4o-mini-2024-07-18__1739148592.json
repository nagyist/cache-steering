  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the implications of being \"broke,\" which typically means lacking sufficient money to meet one's needs.",
    "Next, I consider the possible solutions or actions that could genuinely assist someone in that financial state.",
    "Giving something (Option A) is helpful, but it may not address the financial instability if what is given is not monetary or if it's not something of significant value.",
    "Crossing the street (Option B) does not relate to helping someone who is broke. It seems irrelevant to the situation.",
    "Lending money (Option C) directly addresses the lack of financial resources and could provide immediate relief. It implies trust and willingness to support.",
    "Trusting God (Option D) may offer spiritual or emotional comfort to the person, but it does not provide tangible support in terms of finances.",
    "Feeling sorry (Option E) may show empathy but does not contribute any real help or support to the person who is experiencing financial difficulty.",
    "After evaluating all options, lending money (Option C) stands out as a practical choice that could directly help alleviate the person's financial struggles."
