  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where a gambling table should be placed.",
    "A gambling table is typically used in spaces where games of chance or skill are played, such as card games or casino games.",
    "The options provided include various places: card room, trash, living room, neighbor's house, and kitchen.",
    "A card room would specifically be designed for playing cards and likely have all necessary amenities for gambling.",
    "Placing a gambling table in the trash would be inappropriate since it's meant for disposal, not use.",
    "The living room is often a social space, but it's generally not designed primarily for gambling activities.",
    "Putting the table in a neighbor's house would be impractical unless the neighbor has a specific setup for gambling.",
    "The kitchen is typically used for cooking and dining, offering no space for gambling activities.",
    "Given all the options, a card room is the most suitable place for a table designed for gambling."
