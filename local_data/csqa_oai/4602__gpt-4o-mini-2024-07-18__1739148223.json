  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct choice, I need to understand what kind of place would have a backyard. A backyard is typically found in residential areas where there is enough space for homes and outdoor areas.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices given. A \"farm\" typically has a lot of land and outdoor space, but it may not always be referred to as having a \"backyard\" in the same sense as residential homes do.",
    "\"Suburb\" generally refers to a residential area outside of a city, which often includes single-family homes, many of which will have backyards.",
    "\"Property\" is a broad term that could refer to any piece of land, but it doesn\u2019t specify residential characteristics such as having a backyard.",
    "\"Neighborhood\" refers to a specific area within a community, and while neighborhoods may have homes with backyards, the term is not specific enough to indicate the presence of a backyard.",
    "\"Yards\" are just areas of land and don't specifically identify whether it's a backyard or front yard or any particular kind of property.",
    "Comparing these options, \"suburb\" stands out as it directly implies a residential setting that is likely to have homes with backyards.",
    "In contrast, the other options either lack clarity regarding backyards or do not emphasize residential characteristics as strongly.",
    "Given that the context is about having a backyard, \"suburb\" is the best fit."
