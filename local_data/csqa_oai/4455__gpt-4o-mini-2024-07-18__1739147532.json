  "query": "Question: How is someone likely to feel about someone hurting someone else they love?\n\nChoices:\nA: kick and kiss\nB: punishment\nC: jail time\nD: will resent\nE: bad karma",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotional bond that exists when someone loves another person. The feelings toward anyone hurting that loved one are usually strong and protective.",
    "Next, identify the common emotional responses to seeing a loved one harmed. Feelings of anger, resentment, or a desire for retribution are typical reactions.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: \nA (kick and kiss) doesn't logically fit as a response to someone hurting a loved one. It mixes two contrasting emotions.\nB (punishment) might seem relevant, but it does not specifically express emotional personal response. It is more about seeking justice.",
    "C (jail time) suggests an outcome or legal response rather than an emotional one. It's not a direct feeling about the situation.",
    "D (will resent) directly indicates a personal feeling of bitterness or anger towards someone for hurting a loved one. This aligns with typical emotional responses.",
    "E (bad karma) denotes a belief in consequences rather than a direct emotional response. While it reflects a thought on justice or retribution, it isn\u2019t an emotional feeling in itself.",
    "After examining all the options, only D expresses a clear emotional reaction that describes how someone might truly feel about another harming someone they love."
