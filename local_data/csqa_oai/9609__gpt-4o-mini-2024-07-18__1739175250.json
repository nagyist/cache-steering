  "query": "Question: What do people who are collectivist do?\n\nChoices:\nA: sail boats\nB: believe in god\nC: shake hands\nD: share things\nE: question authority",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what collectivism is. Collectivism is a political or economic theory advocating collective ownership and the importance of the group over individual interests.",
    "Next, we should analyze what actions or behaviors are commonly associated with collectivist ideologies. These often emphasize cooperation, sharing resources, and working together for the common good.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the answer choices in the context of collectivism:\n- A: sail boats - this activity is generally unrelated to collective ownership or group actions.\n- B: believe in god - belief systems can vary greatly within collectivist societies and do not exclusively define collectivism.\n- C: shake hands - this is a social gesture but does not particularly imply a collectivist approach.\n- D: share things - sharing is a fundamental aspect of collectivism, as it emphasizes mutual aid and collective benefit.\n- E: question authority - while questioning authority can occur in collectivist and individualist societies alike, it does not define collectivism.",
    "From the evaluations, option D, which involves sharing, directly aligns with the principles of collectivism.",
    "Furthermore, sharing resources is fundamental in many collectivist cultures where community and collective benefit are prioritized over individual acquisition.",
    "Finally, options A, B, C, and E do not resonate as directly with the main values associated with collectivism."
