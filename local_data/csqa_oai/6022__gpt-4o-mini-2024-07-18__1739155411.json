  "query": "Question: What would an adult do at a party?\n\nChoices:\nA: dress himself\nB: drive train\nC: grumble\nD: dress herself\nE: drink beer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a party, which is generally a social gathering where people engage in various activities for entertainment.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided and how they relate to typical behaviors at a party.",
    "Option A, \"dress himself,\" while relevant to preparing for a party, is typically done before arriving, not at the party itself.",
    "Option B, \"drive train,\" seems unrelated to the context of a party and is more about transportation or a work setting.",
    "Option C, \"grumble,\" suggests a negative behavior that might occur at a party, but it\u2019s not a common or socially accepted behavior at a party.",
    "Option D, \"dress herself,\" is similar to option A and relates to preparation, not an action taken during the party.",
    "Option E, \"drink beer,\" is a common activity at many parties, as alcohol is often served and consumed for socializing and relaxation.",
    "Among the choices, option E stands out as the most fitting and relevant action that an adult would typically engage in at a party."
