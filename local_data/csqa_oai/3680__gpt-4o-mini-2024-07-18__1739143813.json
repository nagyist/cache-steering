  "query": "Question: Where would you kick a ball that has grass?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy store\nB: pool table\nC: soccer field\nD: golf course\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location where a ball that has grass is typically used or kicked.",
    "First, consider the nature of the ball. If it is a grass-covered ball, it implies it is used outdoors or on a green surface.",
    "Now, analyze the choices provided:\n- A toy store generally does not have grass or fields; it is an indoor environment.\n- A pool table is also indoors, specifically designed for billiards, and does not involve grass.\n- A soccer field is specifically designed for playing soccer and is typically covered in grass.\n- A golf course is also an outdoor area that has grass, but it primarily pertains to the game of golf, which usually involves hitting a small ball rather than kicking.\n- The street is not a grassy area, and although some might use a ball on the street, it is not a dedicated grassy area.",
    "Given this analysis, the soccer field is the most appropriate choice as it is specifically designed for kicking a ball while on grass.",
    "It stands out from the other options due to its clear association with both grass and the action of kicking a ball."
