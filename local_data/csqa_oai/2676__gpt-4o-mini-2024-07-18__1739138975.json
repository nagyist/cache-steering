  "steps": [
    "The sentence implies a comparison between man's brain and another concept, which suggests that the missing term should represent something greater or more advanced than human intelligence.",
    "Let's examine the provided choices to see which aligns with the idea of being \"higher\" or superior to human intellect.",
    "A: culture - This does not inherently represent a higher intelligence than man's brain; rather, it's a social construct shaped by human behavior and intellect.",
    "B: inspiration - While inspiration can be powerful, it does not denote a higher intelligence than human intelligence; it is a mental state influenced by various factors.",
    "C: higher intelligence - This directly suggests an intelligence superior to that of human beings, fitting perfectly into the context of the comparison.",
    "D: increasing knowledge - While increasing knowledge may suggest growth intellectually, it does not compare to the notion of a greater intelligence.",
    "E: better grades - Better grades are a reflection of knowledge or performance, but do not imply anything about intelligence in comparison to man's brain.",
    "Considering all the options, C is the only one suggesting an intelligence greater than man's brain, which completes the thought in the sentence appropriately."
