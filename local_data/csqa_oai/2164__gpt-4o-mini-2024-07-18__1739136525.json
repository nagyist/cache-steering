  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where it is common practice to charge for shopping bags.",
    "Restaurants typically do not charge for takeout bags, so option A is unlikely.",
    "A closet is a place where bags are stored and does not involve transactions, so option B is not relevant.",
    "At Starbucks, they primarily sell drinks and snacks, but they do not usually charge for bags since they don't issue them for food items.",
    "Supermarkets often charge for shopping bags due to environmental initiatives or regulations, making option D a strong candidate.",
    "Home is a location where one might use or store bags but would not involve a purchase transaction, making option E irrelevant.",
    "Considering shopping habits, it is most common for supermarkets to implement charges for bags used during checkout.",
    "I can confirm that many supermarkets across various regions have policies to charge for bags, reinforcing option D.",
    "Since Starbucks does not typically charge for shopping bags and is more focused on coffee sales, it can be ruled out.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all the options, I conclude that the place where you are most likely to pay for a shopping bag is the supermarket."
