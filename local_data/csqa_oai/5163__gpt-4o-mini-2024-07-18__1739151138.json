  "query": "Question: If you're driving to catch a flight connection, what is the fasted road to take?\n\nChoices:\nA: secret passageway\nB: airport\nC: computer network\nD: freeway\nE: wires",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the question which asks about the fastest road to take when driving to catch a flight connection.",
    "Next, consider the options given: secret passageway, airport, computer network, freeway, and wires.",
    "Evaluate the option 'secret passageway'. It is unconventional and typically not a recognized or reliable route for driving.",
    "Consider the option 'airport'. This refers to the destination rather than a road or route for driving.",
    "Next, evaluate 'computer network'. This is a digital communication system and not applicable for physical road travel.",
    "Then, consider 'wires'. Similar to the computer network, this does not pertain to a road for driving.",
    "Now, focus on the option 'freeway'. Freeways are designed for fast vehicle travel and are typically the quickest route for long distances.",
    "Compare freeway with the other options. Only freeway stands out as an actual driving route that is fast and practical for reaching a destination like an airport.",
    "Conclude that the best choice for the fastest road to take while driving to catch a flight connection is 'freeway'."
