  "query": "Question: He was staying at a resort near Nevada and California, he left on his boat from the dock in the north and at the opposite end spotted a bald eagle, where was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: central idaho\nB: hells canyon\nC: canada\nD: south lake tahoe\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a resort near Nevada and California, which indicates a geographic location that is close to both states.",
    "The mention of a boat suggests that he's near a body of water, which could imply a lake or a river.",
    "Since South Lake Tahoe is a well-known resort area located at the border of California and Nevada and is situated around a lake, it aligns with both the location and water aspects.",
    "Central Idaho and Hells Canyon are located further north and do not fit the description of being near Nevada and California.",
    "Canada is too far north and not immediately relatable to a resort that combines both Nevada and California as the primary subjects.",
    "Park is too vague and does not specify a location or similar identifiable feature.",
    "Considering the context of the question, the only clear match for a resort that meets all criteria is South Lake Tahoe.",
    "The mention of spotting a bald eagle could relate to the environment around lakes, where such birds are commonly found, further supporting South Lake Tahoe.",
    "Based on all the reasoning and elimination of other choices, I conclude that the answer should be South Lake Tahoe, which corresponds to choice D."
