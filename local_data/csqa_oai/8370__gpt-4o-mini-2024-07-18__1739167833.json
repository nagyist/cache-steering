  "query": "Question: Where do uniformed officials search travelers looking for terrorists?\n\nChoices:\nA: prison\nB: afghanistan\nC: texas\nD: killed\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a location where uniformed officials are involved in searching travelers to detect potential terrorists.",
    "Uniformed officials typically refer to law enforcement or security personnel who are easily identifiable by their uniforms.",
    "One common location where travelers are searched is at transportation hubs, particularly at airports.",
    "Airports have security measures in place, including thorough searches of passengers and their belongings to prevent any threats, including terrorism.",
    "The other options provided do not fit as locations where uniformed officials broadly search travelers.",
    "Prison (option A) is a containment facility, not a location for searching travelers.",
    "Afghanistan (option B) is a country and while there may be military operations, it is not a location where uniformed officials search travelers in general.",
    "Texas (option C) could have security operations, but it is not specific about travelers or terrorism.",
    "Option D, \"killed,\" is not a location, and thus irrelevant.",
    "Given the context, the most obvious and widely recognized location where uniformed officials search travelers for security is indeed at airports."
