  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify which of the answer choices refers to a European country.",
    "Among the given options, \"Idaho\" is a U.S. state, \"Casserole\" refers to a dish, \"New Hampshire\" is another U.S. state, and \"Root Cellar\" is a storage method for vegetables.",
    "This leaves me with \"Ireland,\" which is indeed a European country.",
    "Next, I need to verify if Ireland is known for its potato industry.",
    "Historically, Ireland is well-known for its potatoes, which have significant cultural and agricultural importance in the country.",
    "Furthermore, the Great Famine in the mid-19th century was largely due to potato blight, underscoring the crop's importance to Ireland.",
    "Since I have determined Ireland is a European country and has a famous potato industry, I can confirm that it is the correct answer.",
    "Finally, I will rule out the other options as they do not fit the criteria of being a European country associated with potatoes."
