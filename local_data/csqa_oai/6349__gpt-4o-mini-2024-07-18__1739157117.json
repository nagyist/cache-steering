  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to understand the process through which a president is typically chosen in a democratic society.",
    "In many countries, particularly in a democratic context, the president is not chosen arbitrarily but rather through a formal process.",
    "The most common means of selecting a president is through an election, where citizens vote for their preferred candidate.",
    "Given that \"election\" implies a democratic selection process and is a standard method for appointing a head of state, we should consider this as a strong candidate.",
    "Other choices like \"board room,\" \"government,\" and \"self-appointed\" do not accurately reflect the democratic process of electing a president.",
    "\"Trouble\" does not make sense in the context of how a president comes to power, as it does not relate to the selection process.",
    "Thus, the most logical and correct way for a president to come to be is through a structured election.",
    "Now, I need to verify if any of the other options could also be valid in this context.",
    "\"Government\" can pertain to how the president operates post-election, but not to how they are elected.",
    "\"Self-appointed\" might apply to some other contexts of leadership but not in a democratic system where the president is typically elected by the populace."
