  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the purpose of the medicine recommended by the doctor after taking measurements with an armband.",
    "Armbands are often used for health monitoring, including heart rate, blood pressure, and other vitals.",
    "Typically, if a doctor recommends medicine following such measurements, it is usually to address a specific health issue indicated by those measurements.",
    "The most common issues that arise from monitoring blood pressure and heart rate include hypertension (high blood pressure) and its complications.",
    "While some of the options could potentially relate to the doctor's recommendations, we need to identify which one is most directly relevant to the purpose of using an armband, which is likely assessing cardiovascular health.",
    "Options A (guard against disease) and E (diabetes) are too vague or not directly connected to measurements typically gathered by armbands.",
    "Option B (lower cholesterol) is plausible but does not directly relate to the immediate measurements taken by an armband, which do not measure cholesterol levels.",
    "This leaves us with Option D (lower blood pressure), which is directly related to the purpose of the measurements taken with an armband.",
    "Considering all this reasoning, the most likely purpose for the medicine recommended by the doctor would be to lower blood pressure."
