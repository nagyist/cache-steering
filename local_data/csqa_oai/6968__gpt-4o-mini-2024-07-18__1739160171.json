    "The items he needs are a stapler and index card, which suggests he is likely preparing for a project or assignment.",
    "An oral report (Option A) does not relate to a place where one can buy supplies; it is an activity.",
    "A book store (Option B) primarily sells books and may offer some supplies, but it's not specifically known for stationery or office supplies.",
    "A library (Option C) mainly provides access to books and resources for study but typically does not sell items like a stapler or index cards.",
    "A card catalogue (Option D) is a method for organizing books and does not assist in purchasing physical items.",
    "An office supply store (Option E) specializes in selling various office supplies, including staplers and index cards, making it the most logical choice.",
    "Since the office supply store is specifically designed for such products and offers a variety of options for both items needed, it stands out as the best place for him to purchase them."
