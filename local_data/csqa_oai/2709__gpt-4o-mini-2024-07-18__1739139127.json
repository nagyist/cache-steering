  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the location where a group of guys threw a big party on campus.",
    "I need to analyze each option to see if it aligns with a typical location for a campus party.",
    "Option A: fraternity house - This is a common place for parties on college campuses, as fraternities often host events and parties.",
    "Option B: neighborhood - While it's possible for students to hold parties off-campus in a neighborhood, it is less likely to be referred to as being \"on campus.\"",
    "Option C: celebrating mother's birthday - This does not indicate a physical location; it's more about the occasion than a party venue.",
    "Option D: home - This could refer to any student's home, but it's not specific enough for the context of a campus party.",
    "Option E: friend's house - Similar to option D, this could be an off-campus location and is not intrinsically tied to campus life.",
    "Based on the analysis, options A (fraternity house) stands out as the most likely place for a big party on campus because it directly links to campus culture."
