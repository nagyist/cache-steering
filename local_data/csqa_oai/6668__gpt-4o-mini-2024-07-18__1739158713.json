  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a complementary factor to hard work that contributes to achieving an advantage in any field.",
    "Option A: timing - While timing can be important, it is often not a consistent factor that can be relied on across different contexts.",
    "Option B: determination - This implies perseverance and resilience, suggesting that one must be committed to their goals to achieve success alongside hard work.",
    "Option C: skill - Having skill is certainly advantageous, but it often comes as a result of hard work itself. Therefore, it may not fit as a complementary factor in the same way determination does.",
    "Option D: upper hand - This is vague and does not denote a specific quality or characteristic; it also implies an unfair advantage rather than a characteristic one can work on.",
    "Option E: superior - This term, like \"upper hand,\" is quite ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a specific quality.",
    "Between determination and skill, determination stands out as a quality that reinforces the effort put in through hard work, enabling one to push through challenges and setbacks.",
    "I will consider the overall context of the question; although skill is important, without determination, one may not fully utilize hard work effectively.",
    "Given the meanings of all the options, determination is the most fitting word that emphasizes the necessity of dedication alongside hard work to gain an advantage."
