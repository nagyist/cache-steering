  "steps": [
    "First, the question asks about what happens to a body when they die, implying a focus on the physical state or treatment of the body after death.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices provided to determine if they relate to the state of a body upon death.",
    "Choice A, \"killed in war,\" describes a situation leading to death but does not explain what happens to the body after death.",
    "Choice B, \"cremated,\" refers to a specific process that can occur after death, thus directly addressing the body.",
    "Choice C, \"opposed to war,\" is an opinion or stance and does not relate to the state of a body upon death.",
    "Choice D, \"introverted,\" is a personality trait and has no relevance to what happens to a body when it dies.",
    "Choice E, \"murdered,\" describes a method of causing death but does not answer the question of what happens afterward to the body.",
    "Among the options, only \"cremated\" (Choice B) is relevant to the process that can happen to a body after death.",
    "Thus, based on the analysis, the only answer that explicitly answers the question is \"cremated.\""
