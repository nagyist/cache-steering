    "The problem states that they were worried about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. This implies they needed a solution to keep the fruit from spoiling due to temperature.",
    "In a context where keeping fruit fresh is a concern, one common and effective solution is to store it in a cooler environment.",
    "A refrigerator is specifically designed to maintain a cool temperature and is widely used for storing perishable items like fruit to keep them fresh.",
    "Although a \"container\" could potentially work, it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply it would keep the fruit cool; it could just mean a box or bag without temperature control.",
    "A \"plate\" does not provide any temperature control and would not be suitable for keeping fruit fresh in the heat.",
    "\"San Francisco\" and \"gay bar\" are not relevant options for the context of keeping fruit fresh as they do not provide a solution for storage or temperature control.",
    "Thus, out of all the options provided, the refrigerator is the most logical choice for solving the problem of keeping fruit fresh in the heat."
