  "query": "Question: Where can leaves slide from and end up in a gutter?\n\nChoices:\nA: trees\nB: spout\nC: roof\nD: ground\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify that leaves can detach from a variety of sources. One major source is trees.",
    "Next, I consider whether leaves can slide from a spout. Spouts generally handle water drainage, not leaves, which means this option is less likely.",
    "I then analyze roofs. Roofs can collect leaves, especially if there are overhanging branches, and these leaves can slide down into gutters.",
    "Next, I evaluate the ground. Leaves on the ground do not slide into gutters; they would need to fall from a higher position.",
    "I also consider the street. While leaves can end up in the street, they do not slide from there into a gutter; they would rather collect in gutters.",
    "Given that both trees and roofs are valid sources for leaves that can slide into a gutter, I focus on which one is more applicable.",
    "I conclude that rooftops often have gutters directly alongside them, making it plausible for leaves to slide directly from roofs into those gutters.",
    "Although trees are a source of leaves, they are not directly connected to gutters in the same way roofs are.",
    "Therefore, after weighing my options, I determine that the most plausible answer, where leaves can slide into gutters, is the roof."
