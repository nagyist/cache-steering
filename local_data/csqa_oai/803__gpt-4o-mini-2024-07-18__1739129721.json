  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that \"they don't get grades or sit at desks,\" which suggests that the answer pertains to something that doesn't relate to traditional schooling or education.",
    "The phrase \"crowds of fish\" is key to understanding the context. Crowds of fish refer to a group behavior commonly observed in fish.",
    "One common term for a large group of fish is a \"school.\" This term is widely recognized in the context of marine biology and ecology.",
    "The options provided need to be evaluated against this context. \"Pets\" does not connect well with fish in a natural environment.",
    "\"Fills the pond\" is possible, but it doesn\u2019t capture what is distinctive about fish behavior or social groupings.",
    "\"Attempt to fly\" is irrelevant to fish, as they live in water, not in an environment where flying is common.",
    "\"School together\" directly references the behavior of fish grouping and swimming in coordinated formations, which matches the context well.",
    "\"Breath in water\" relates to fish behavior but does not answer the idea of what crowds of fish do in terms of social interaction or grouping.",
    "Amongst these options, \"school together\" is the only choice that accurately describes the behavior of fish in groups, which is a common observation among aquatic species."
