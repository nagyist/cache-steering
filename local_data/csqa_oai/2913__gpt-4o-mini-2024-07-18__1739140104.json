  "query": "Question: James went into his office at city hall.  What type of building is this?\n\nChoices:\nA: skyscraper\nB: public building\nC: tall building\nD: work\nE: a house",
  "steps": [
    "James is in an office at city hall, which suggests a government-related environment.",
    "City hall is typically where the administrative functions of a city government occur, indicating that it serves a public purpose.",
    "The term \"public building\" is generally used to describe structures that serve a civic function and are open to the public, such as city halls, libraries, and government buildings.",
    "While skyscrapers and tall buildings might house offices, they do not define the purpose of the structure, which is clearly administrative in this context.",
    "The option \"work\" is too vague and does not specifically categorize the building type.",
    "A house does not fit in this context since a house is typically a residential structure, whereas city hall serves a public and administrative role.",
    "Considering all these points, the best choice that accurately describes the type of building James is in is \"public building.\""

  "solution": "B"
