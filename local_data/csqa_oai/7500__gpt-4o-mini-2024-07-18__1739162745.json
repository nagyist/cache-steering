  "query": "Question: A single person is going to a party of other singles, what do they want to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: visit friends\nB: race cars\nC: meeting people\nD: having fun\nE: drinking alcohol",
  "steps": [
    "The context implies that the person is going to a party where other singles are present.",
    "At a party, especially one involving singles, social interaction is a primary activity.",
    "The individual likely desires to connect with other singles to potentially form relationships or friendships.",
    "While visiting friends could be part of the experience, the main goal in this scenario is likely to meet new people.",
    "Racing cars is not relevant to the context of a typical party setting.",
    "Having fun is a general desire at any gathering, but it often implies engaging with others, particularly at a party for singles.",
    "Drinking alcohol, while common at parties, is not the primary motivation for attending; it is more of an ancillary activity.",
    "Upon reviewing the options, \"meeting people\" directly correlates with the objective of attending a singles party.",
    "Thus, meeting people stands out as the most relevant choice for what a single person wants to do at such an event."
