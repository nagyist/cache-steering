  "steps": [
    "The question focuses on finding the best place for a lamp to improve visibility while doing homework.",
    "The options provided include locations where a lamp might be placed: nearby, table, house, building, and desktop.",
    "\"Nearby\" is too vague; it doesn't specify a particular surface or location for effective illumination.",
    "\"Table\" refers to a specific piece of furniture commonly used for studying or working on homework, suggesting practical functionality for the lamp.",
    "\"House\" is a broad term and does not dictate a meaningfully specific location for the lamp\u2019s placement.",
    "\"Building\" similarly generalizes the location, not providing a focused option for homework activities.",
    "\"Desktop\" specifically refers to a work surface where homework is likely completed and where a lamp could provide direct light.",
    "Computation of the best options shows that \"table\" and \"desktop\" are both suitable for placing a lamp to aid visibility.",
    "Choosing between \"table\" and \"desktop,\" \"desktop\" denotes a space upon which homework is typically organized, making it more specific.",
    "However, \"table\" can also indicate a more general study area that is likely suitable for homework as well."
