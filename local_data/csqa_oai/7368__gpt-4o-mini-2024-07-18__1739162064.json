  "query": "Question: Old refrigerators can often be stored where when not in use?\n\nChoices:\nA: in sub jail\nB: home\nC: garage\nD: food\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what locations are typically suitable for storing old refrigerators when they are not in use.",
    "I know that most people have limited space in their homes for large appliances, so areas like living rooms or bedrooms are not practical storage spaces for old refrigerators.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each choice based on common storage practices for large appliances.",
    "Choice A, \"in sub jail,\" does not make sense in the context of storing an old appliance and is likely not a typical storage solution.",
    "Choice B, \"home,\" is vague and could refer to any part of the home; however, it might not be practical due to space limitations.",
    "Choice C, \"garage,\" is a common location for storing items that are not frequently used, including large appliances like refrigerators.",
    "Choice D, \"food,\" is irrelevant since it does not represent a physical space where a refrigerator could be stored.",
    "Choice E, \"apartment,\" also does not specify an appropriate area and may have similar space limitations like a regular home.",
    "Thus, the most logical and practical option for storing an old refrigerator that is not in use is the garage."
