  "query": "Question: If I go outside and look down, what will I find outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: sun\nC: nature\nD: sky\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "When I go outside, I am transitioning from an indoor space to an outdoor environment.",
    "Looking down suggests that I will be observing the area directly beneath me rather than looking around at the scenery.",
    "The options provided include various elements that can be present outside.",
    "The ground is typically what is immediately below a person when they are outside, regardless of their location (e.g., park, street, field).",
    "The sun is in the sky, so looking down would not allow me to see the sun.",
    "Nature can exist beneath me (in terms of grass, flowers, etc.), but it is a broader term that encompasses various elements, not necessarily what I would see just by looking down.",
    "The sky is above, so while it is an important feature of the outdoor environment, it is not something I would see when I look down.",
    "The street, while it could also be underfoot if I am on one, is a more specific term compared to the general concept of \"ground.\"",
    "Given the immediate perspective of looking straight down, the most accurate and general answer to what I will find is the ground."
