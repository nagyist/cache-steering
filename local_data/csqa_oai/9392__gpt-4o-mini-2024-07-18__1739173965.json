  "query": "Question: How can you tell whether people are rich?\n\nChoices:\nA: sleep together\nB: own things\nC: live long\nD: believe in god\nE: need each other",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the general characteristics associated with wealth or being rich. One common factor is the ownership of material possessions.",
    "Evaluate choice B (\"own things\"). Rich people often have more assets, which can include property, cars, technology, and luxury items.",
    "Next, analyze the other options. Choice A (\"sleep together\") is not related to wealth in any way, as it pertains to personal relationships rather than financial status.",
    "Consider choice C (\"live long\"). While there may be correlations between wealth and health, longevity is not a direct indicator of wealth itself.",
    "For choice D (\"believe in god\"), belief systems vary among all socioeconomic classes and do not specifically indicate wealth.",
    "Assess choice E (\"need each other\"). While social networks can be beneficial in various contexts, they do not directly signify someone's wealth.",
    "Reiterate the remaining relevant choice, which is choice B. Ownership of valuable things is the most reasonable indicator of being wealthy.",
    "Reflect on the relevance of ownership within the other choices and confirm none provide a clearer indicator of wealth than owning things."
