  "query": "Question: Which larger group contains snare drum players and is usually done at a sports game?\n\nChoices:\nA: high school band\nB: drum kit\nC: marching band\nD: musical band\nE: orchestra",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what a snare drum player is and their typical context. Snare drum players are often part of ensembles that perform at sporting events, providing rhythm and energy.",
    "Consider the options provided. We need to find a larger group that includes snare drum players and is commonly associated with sports games.",
    "Evaluate option A: \"high school band.\" While high school bands can include snare drum players, they are not always specifically associated with sports games.",
    "Evaluate option B: \"drum kit.\" A drum kit is an assembly of drums and cymbals played by a single drummer, not a group that would include snare drum players specifically.",
    "Evaluate option C: \"marching band.\" Marching bands are large musical ensembles that perform outdoors for events, particularly sporting events, and they typically include snare drum players as part of their percussion sections.",
    "Evaluate option D: \"musical band.\" This is too broad and can refer to any group that plays music. It does not specifically indicate a connection to snare drum players or sports games.",
    "Evaluate option E: \"orchestra.\" An orchestra primarily focuses on classical music and does not typically perform at sports games. They usually do not include the snare drum in the traditional sense.",
    "Conclude that the only option that consistently includes snare drum players and fits the context of sports games is \"marching band.\""
