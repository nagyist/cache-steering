  "query": "Question: Sarah couldn't make the afternoon meeting and had to reschedule. She promised to .skip dinner and go to sleep earlier that night so that she could make it.  When might the meeting have been rescheduled to?\n\nChoices:\nA: before noon\nB: after\nC: morning\nD: evening\nE: before lunch",
  "steps": [
    "The context states that Sarah couldn't attend the afternoon meeting and had to reschedule it.",
    "The phrase \"afternoon meeting\" implies that it was originally scheduled for a time after 12 PM and before early evening, typically between 1 PM and 5 PM.",
    "Sarah promises to \"skip dinner and go to sleep earlier,\" suggesting the rescheduled meeting should occur at a time that allows her to maintain her sleeping schedule.",
    "If she is going to sleep earlier after a dinner that typically occurs in the evening, the rescheduled meeting would likely need to happen before dinner time.",
    "The options given include various parts of the day. \"Before noon\" and \"before lunch\" would imply a time during the morning, while \"after,\" \"morning,\" and \"evening\" indicate later times.",
    "The option \"morning\" clearly aligns with the idea of having the meeting before lunch or noon, which would still fit into her new plan to go to sleep earlier.",
    "The options \"after\" and \"evening\" do not fit well with her commitment to waking up early and prioritizing sleep since they imply later times than when she'd want to reschedule.",
    "Looking closely, \"before lunch\" also is a valid interpretation but is effectively synonymous with \"morning\" since both refer to the time before midday.",
    "Between the remaining options and what Sarah communicated regarding her sleep, \"morning\" is the clearest and most fitting choice."
