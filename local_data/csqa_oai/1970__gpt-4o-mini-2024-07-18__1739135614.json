  "query": "Question: Jeremy is mastering a music scale, where should he find books on the matter?\n\nChoices:\nA: post office\nB: music store\nC: assay office\nD: butcher shop\nE: doctor's office",
  "steps": [
    "Identify which locations would likely have resources related to music and practice.",
    "Consider the relevance of each option in relation to music materials or education.",
    "The post office is primarily for mailing services, making it irrelevant for music resources.",
    "A music store specifically caters to musical instruments, sheet music, and educational materials, making it a strong candidate.",
    "An assay office deals with testing metals and does not pertain to music, so it can be dismissed.",
    "A butcher shop specializes in meat and food products, which are unrelated to music resources.",
    "A doctor's office focuses on health and medical services, not music, thus is not pertinent.",
    "In summary, the most appropriate location for Jeremy to find books on mastering a music scale is the music store."
