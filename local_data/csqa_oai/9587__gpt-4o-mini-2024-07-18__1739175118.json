  "query": "Question: A garage is a type of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: home\nB: building\nC: downtown\nD: storage area\nE: car",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a garage is typically used for. A garage is primarily a structure associated with the storing of vehicles.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices presented. \"Home\" (A) usually refers to a dwelling for people, which may include a garage, but isn't an accurate classification.",
    "Look at option \"Building\" (B). A garage is indeed a type of building, as it is a constructed space designed for certain purposes.",
    "Then, consider \"Downtown\" (C). A garage is not specifically associated with a downtown area; it can be found in various locations, so this choice doesn't fit.",
    "Next, consider \"Storage area\" (D). A garage can certainly function as a storage area, particularly for vehicles and tools.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"Car\" (E). While a garage is associated with cars, it is not classified as a car itself.",
    "Now, compare the two strongest candidates: \"Building\" (B) and \"Storage area\" (D). A garage fits well within both definitions, but it primarily serves as a building.",
    "Re-assessing the primary architectural definition, I conclude that \"Building\" (B) is indeed the broader and more encompassing term applicable to a garage."
