  "steps": [
    "The question describes rich young people who just graduated and are experiencing boredom.",
    "These individuals are noted to be without responsibilities, suggesting they have the freedom to engage in various activities.",
    "The activities available to them include those that are leisurely and enjoyable, such as playing games, sleeping, smoking, reading books, or traveling.",
    "To determine which activity aligns best with the idea of boredom and a lack of responsibility, we should consider what recent graduates might want to do at that time.",
    "Playing games could be a possibility, as it is a fun way to pass time, but it might not necessarily be the top choice for those feeling bored.",
    "Sleeping also seems plausible; however, it may not be the most preferred option since it doesn't actively engage them.",
    "Smoking isn\u2019t typically a widely accepted activity that young, responsible individuals would choose, especially given today's cultural views.",
    "Reading books might be appealing, but it may not be associated with combating boredom in the same immediate way other options may be.",
    "Traveling, on the other hand, is an exciting and adventurous choice that fits the profile of young graduates looking for experiences before starting their jobs.",
    "Therefore, among the given options, traveling stands out as the most likely activity that rich young people would choose to engage in during their downtime after graduation."
