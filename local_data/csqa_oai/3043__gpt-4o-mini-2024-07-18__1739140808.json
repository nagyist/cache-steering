  "query": "Question: Beer is usually expensive when you attend what public event?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: drink\nC: fridge\nD: sporting event\nE: bowling alley",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about public events that are typically associated with higher beer prices.",
    "Option A, \"refrigerator,\" is not a public event; it refers to an appliance.",
    "Option B, \"drink,\" is too vague and does not refer specifically to a public event.",
    "Option C, \"fridge,\" is also not related to a public event; it is another term for a refrigerator.",
    "Option D, \"sporting event,\" is a common public event where beer is often sold at a premium price due to high demand and venue pricing.",
    "Option E, \"bowling alley,\" can sometimes have higher beer prices but is generally not as expansive or expensive compared to sporting events.",
    "After evaluating the options, the best choice that fits the criteria of the question is D because sporting events typically have a reputation for high-priced concessions, including beer."
