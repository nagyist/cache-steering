    "The question asks where homeless people go to try to move around, implying locations that facilitate mobility.",
    "We need to consider places where people can access transportation or gather, which typically include bus depots, train stations, or public areas.",
    "Choice A mentions suffering from mental disorders, which doesn't fit with a physical location where people would go to move around.",
    "Choice B, bus depot, is a specific location that serves as a hub for transportation, making it a reasonable option for where homeless individuals might go to move around.",
    "Choice C repeats the idea of suffering from mental disorders and does not offer a location.",
    "Choice D, street, is also a place where homeless individuals may reside or move around; however, it is less specific compared to the transportation-centric options.",
    "Choice E, bridge, might serve as a temporary shelter for some but does not facilitate movement in the same way as a bus depot does.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the most fitting choice for where homeless people go to try to move around is the bus depot."
