  "query": "Question: Where would you get a radio if you do not have one?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: space shuttle\nC: trunk\nD: stalk\nE: shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the definition of a radio. A radio is an electronic device that receives radio signals and allows users to listen to audio broadcasts.",
    "Next, assess each choice to see if it is a logical location where one might obtain a radio.",
    "For choice A (school), while schools may have radios for broadcasts, they typically do not sell or provide radios for personal use.",
    "For choice B (space shuttle), it is highly unlikely that a personal radio would be available on a space shuttle, as it is a specialized environment for astronauts.",
    "For choice C (trunk), this refers to a storage space, and it usually contains items already owned rather than places where radios can be acquired.",
    "For choice D (stalk), this option does not relate to obtaining a radio; it seems misplaced compared to the other choices.",
    "For choice E (shop), shops are commercial establishments that commonly sell various electronic devices, including radios.",
    "Having evaluated all the options, choice E (shop) stands out as the most logical place to obtain a radio."
