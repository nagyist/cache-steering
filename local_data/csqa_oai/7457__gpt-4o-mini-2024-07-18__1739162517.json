  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy took his desk lamp with him wherever he went because he needed lighting.",
    "It's likely that he did not trust the lighting in certain places he visited.",
    "The choices given are specific locations: office, corner, hotel, shop, and house.",
    "An office context usually has adequate lighting, making it a less likely option for him to distrust the lights.",
    "A corner is not a place but rather a part of a space and is, therefore, not relevant.",
    "In a shop, the lighting is generally sufficient, especially in well-lit stores, so it\u2019s unlikely he would take a lamp there.",
    "His own house would typically have lighting he trusts, so it's not a plausible option.",
    "The most appropriate option remaining is a hotel, as the quality and reliability of lighting can vary significantly in hotel rooms.",
    "Since hotels often have different types of lighting that may not be sufficient for personal needs, this aligns with why he might opt to carry his own lamp.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the location where he wouldn't trust the lights and thus would take his desk lamp is a hotel."
