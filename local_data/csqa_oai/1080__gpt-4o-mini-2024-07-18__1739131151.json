  "query": "Question: I wanted to stand up, what would I use to do this?\n\nChoices:\nA: feet\nB: balance\nC: effort\nD: hands\nE: courage",
  "steps": [
    "To stand up, one typically needs a body part or factor involved in the physical motion.",
    "Feet are the primary body parts that support standing and provide the necessary leverage.",
    "Balance is important for standing but is not a physical tool used to initiate the action.",
    "Effort is a conceptual aspect related to the energy expended but does not represent a part of the body.",
    "Hands can assist in standing up, especially in cases where support is needed, but they are not the primary means.",
    "Courage is a mental attribute and does not physically aid in the action of standing up.",
    "Since standing up primarily requires feet, they are the most fundamental choice among the options.",
    "I will compare the options: A (feet) is clearly essential for standing while B, C, D, and E serve different roles not foundational in the action.",
    "Therefore, feet (A) is the best and most direct answer to the question of what is used to stand up."
