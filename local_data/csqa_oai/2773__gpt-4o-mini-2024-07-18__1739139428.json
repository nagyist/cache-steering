  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where sunlight typically enters a house.",
    "Sunlight can enter a house primarily through openings, and the most common openings are windows.",
    "A windowsill is the part of the window where you can place items, but the sunlight itself comes through the glass of the window.",
    "The option \"sea\" does not relate to where sunlight enters a house.",
    "\"Disneyland\" is an amusement park and irrelevant to the context of sunlight entering a house.",
    "The term \"curtain\" refers to a fabric that may block sunlight, not a source of entrance for sunlight.",
    "The option \"street\" suggests an outside area, but sunlight does not directly enter through the street; rather, it enters through windows facing the street.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice is that sunlight comes through the windows in a house.",
    "Since sunlight comes through the windows, \"windowsill\" and \"window\" are conceptually linked.",
    "However, among the choices provided, the windowsill is technically where the light can be seen, though it is not where the light actually enters."
