  "query": "Question: Sally wanted to buy a house close to a city, but not too far away.  Where did Sally look for a home?\n\nChoices:\nA: residential area\nB: suburbs\nC: outskirts of city\nD: surface of earth\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "Sally wants to buy a house close to a city, indicating she prefers locations that are nearby and accessible to urban amenities.",
    "The term \"not too far away\" suggests that she is looking for a location that is adjacent to the city but not within the crowded urban center.",
    "A residential area typically refers to neighborhoods within a city, which would likely be too close and potentially crowded for her preference.",
    "The suburbs are areas that surround a city, often offering a more spacious environment that is close enough for commuting into the city.",
    "The outskirts of the city refer to areas that are at the edge or periphery, which may be further out than she desires.",
    "Given that \"not too far away\" implies a balance, suburbs seem optimal as they are typically still considered part of a metropolitan area but offer more space.",
    "The surface of the earth and street do not specifically refer to places where homes are located in relation to a city's distance.",
    "Comparing suburbs with the outskirts, the suburbs fit Sally's criteria better because they are intentionally designed to house people commuting to cities.",
    "Thus, based on her requirements for proximity to the city without the congestion, the suburbs are the most suitable option."
