  "query": "Question: What is a negative effect of getting divorce that does not involve people other than the person getting divorced?\n\nChoices:\nA: lot of grief\nB: freedom\nC: happiness\nD: no spouse\nE: children suffer",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the main emotional impact of divorce. The person getting divorced typically experiences a lot of grief and sadness as they go through the separation process.",
    "Evaluating the choices, \"lot of grief\" directly reflects the emotional turmoil that the individual may face during a divorce.",
    "Next, analyze the choice \"freedom.\" While it can be argued that divorce offers freedom, it can also lead to a sense of loss and loneliness, rather than a purely positive experience.",
    "Looking at \"happiness,\" it's unlikely to be a negative effect since happiness is generally a positive outcome and doesn't fit the context of the question.",
    "For \"no spouse,\" while this is a factual change resulting from divorce, it doesn't inherently reflect a negative emotional effect on the individual themselves in the context of grief and emotional recovery.",
    "Now consider \"children suffer,\" which pertains to the external effects on children and not the individual getting divorced, disqualifying it from the question's parameters.",
    "Thus, the option that most closely aligns with a negative effect solely affecting the person getting divorced is \"lot of grief,\" which encapsulates the emotional pain involved in the divorce process."
