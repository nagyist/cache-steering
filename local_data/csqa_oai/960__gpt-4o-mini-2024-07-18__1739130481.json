    "The question asks for a method of indicating agreement with someone.",
    "Option A, \"like more,\" does not directly indicate agreement; it speaks to preference rather than agreement.",
    "Option B, \"nodding,\" is a known non-verbal gesture that typically signifies agreement or understanding.",
    "Option C, \"by wearing rings,\" does not have a widely recognized connection to agreement; it is more about personal adornment.",
    "Option D, \"concordance,\" is a term that means agreement but is not a method of indicating agreement in everyday interactions.",
    "Option E, \"shake hands,\" is a gesture that can signify agreement or a deal but is less common for simple expression of agreement in conversation.",
