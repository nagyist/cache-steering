  "query": "Question: What type of building is a bank?\n\nChoices:\nA: main street\nB: secure place\nC: pool of currency\nD: financial center\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "To identify what type of building a bank is, I need to consider its primary function.",
    "A bank is primarily used for financial transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and loans.",
    "Given its function, it is designed to handle money and provide financial services to individuals and businesses.",
    "Looking at the options, a bank is not simply related to the location (main street) or a grocery store, so I can eliminate A and E.",
    "While a bank holds currency, the phrase \"pool of currency\" does not accurately encapsulate the broader role of a bank.",
    "This leaves me with two options: \"secure place\" and \"financial center\".",
    "A bank does indeed serve as a secure place for storing money, but it also serves as a financial center due to its role in the economy through various financial services.",
    "The term \"financial center\" seems to encompass the role of a bank better than \"secure place\" because banks are involved in a wide range of financial activities.",
    "Therefore, out of the given options, the most accurate type of building for a bank is \"financial center\"."
