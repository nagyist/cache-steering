  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify which of the choices listed can be immediately life-threatening due to stress if not treated right away.",
    "Option A mentions \"age grieving person\". While grief can have health implications, it does not directly lead to death.",
    "Option B states \"heart attacks\". Stress can trigger heart attacks, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions or risk factors. Immediate treatment could potentially save a person's life.",
    "Option C refers to \"depression\". Although severe depression can be dangerous and lead to suicide, it is not an immediate cause of death due to stress itself.",
    "Option D discusses \"hair loss\". Stress can cause hair loss, but this is not a life-threatening condition.",
    "Option E mentions \"headache\". While severe headaches can be debilitating, they are typically not life-threatening immediately and can often be managed.",
    "Out of all the options evaluated, \"heart attacks\" from option B stands out as a condition that can cause immediate death if stress triggers an acute cardiac event.",
    "Hence, the effect of stress that could potentially cause death if not treated immediately is heart attacks."
