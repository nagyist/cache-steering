  "query": "Question: Where do people drive on the left on a motorway?\n\nChoices:\nA: england\nB: europe\nC: new jersey\nD: city\nE: a river",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify where people drive on the left side of the road. This is a specific traffic system observed in certain locations.",
    "I will consider the geographical areas where left-side driving is practiced. The most recognized regions are the UK and some parts of Asia, among a few others.",
    "England is part of the United Kingdom, which predominantly has left-side driving.",
    "I will evaluate the other options. Europe as a whole includes several countries where driving is on the right side, making it a less viable option.",
    "New Jersey, which is in the United States, follows the right-side driving norm and thus is not applicable.",
    "The term \"city\" does not refer to a specific driving rule but rather to an area and could belong to any country, making this option irrelevant.",
    "A river does not relate to driving practices, so I can eliminate this option as well.",
    "After re-evaluating, I confirm that the most straightforward answer for where people drive on the left on a motorway is in England."
