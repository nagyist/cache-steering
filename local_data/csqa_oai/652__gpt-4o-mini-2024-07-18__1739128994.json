  "query": "Question: What sport is the audience the loudest at?\n\nChoices:\nA: show\nB: theatre\nC: hockey game\nD: movies\nE: event",
  "steps": [
    "I will start by considering where audiences are typically the loudest. The loudness of an audience can generally be linked to the excitement or engagement levels in a sporting or entertainment event.",
    "Show and theatre performances typically involve quieter, more focused audiences as they are being respectful of the performance. Therefore, I can rule out A (show) and B (theatre).",
    "Movies often have loud moments, especially during action sequences, but in general, audiences maintain a level of quiet to not disturb others. Thus, I can also rule out D (movies).",
    "That leaves me with C (hockey game) and E (event). \"Event\" is broad and can include many types of gatherings, not specifically sports.",
    "Hockey games are known for their intensity and excitement, often leading to very loud crowds, especially during crucial moments of the game.",
    "I will analyze other sports for comparison: while sports like football, basketball, and soccer can also attract loud crowds, hockey has a unique culture of fan engagement and noise.",
    "Furthermore, the confined space of a hockey arena also amplifies the sounds made by the audience, making it more noticeable compared to larger outdoor events.",
    "After considering the nature of different types of events and their audiences, it becomes clear that hockey games consistently generate the loudest noise from their fans.",
    "Therefore, the specific answer to the question about where audiences are the loudest is clearly at a hockey game."
