  "query": "Question: Which lawn do people not care about as much since people don't see it?\n\nChoices:\nA: golf course\nB: front yard\nC: back yard\nD: garden\nE: suburbia",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which is about areas of lawn or garden that are not prominently visible to the public.",
    "Next, evaluate option A: a golf course. Golf courses are usually well-maintained because they are frequently used and seen by the public.",
    "Now consider option B: the front yard. Front yards are typically visible to everyone and are often cared for to enhance curb appeal.",
    "Examine option C: the back yard. Backyards are generally private spaces and less visible to the public, leading to potentially less care and attention compared to front yards.",
    "Evaluate option D: a garden. Gardens can vary in visibility, but many are created for personal pride and enjoyment, which may lead to higher levels of care.",
    "Look at option E: suburbia, which describes a type of residential area. It does not pinpoint a specific lawn, so its care level would be inconsistent across different households.",
    "After analyzing all options, it appears that the back yard (option C) is the area not cared for as much because it is typically not seen by others.",
    "Since the goal is to find the lawn that people do not care about as much due to visibility, the back yard is the most fitting answer."
