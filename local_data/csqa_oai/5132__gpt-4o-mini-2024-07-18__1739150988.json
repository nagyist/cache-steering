  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a saying about snowflakes that indicates uniqueness. I need to find a phrase that complements the idea of uniqueness.",
    "Option A (\"have no home\") does not relate to uniqueness or individuality and instead conveys a sense of dislocation.",
    "Option B (\"open sores\") is negative and doesn't connect to the positive idea of uniqueness in a meaningful way.",
    "Option C (\"enjoy\") discusses a positive activity but doesn't inherently relate to the idea of uniqueness.",
    "Option D (\"different\") directly correlates with the idea of uniqueness, emphasizing that each person is distinct from others.",
    "Option E (\"anxiety\") is unrelated to the concept of uniqueness, as it pertains to feelings rather than individuality.",
    "After evaluating the options, \"different\" complements the idea expressed in the beginning about uniqueness, supporting the idea that while every person is unique, they are also inherently different from one another."
