  "query": "Question: If you're betting with a shark, where are you likely playing?\n\nChoices:\nA: aquarium\nB: mediterranean sea\nC: south pacific\nD: pool hall\nE: pacific ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what it means to bet with a \"shark.\" In gambling terminology, a \"shark\" typically refers to a skilled or expert gambler who is likely to have an advantage over others.",
    "Considering the context of betting, \"sharks\" could be associated with environments where gambling is prevalent. Thus, we need to look for locations that are commonly linked to betting.",
    "Looking at the options:\n- A: aquarium - This is a place for aquatic life, not related to gambling.\n- B: Mediterranean sea - A geographical location but not specifically known for gambling or betting.\n- C: South Pacific - Similar to the Mediterranean Sea, it's a geographical region without a specific gambling tie.\n- D: Pool hall - This is a place where people play pool and can engage in betting.\n- E: Pacific Ocean - Again, a geographical location, not specifically linked to betting.",
    "Now, focusing on option D (pool hall), gambling on pool games is common, and skilled players (sharks) often frequent these places.",
    "In contrast, while the South Pacific and Pacific Ocean could have gambling activities associated with casinos on islands, they do not specifically resonate with the idea of betting with a \"shark.\"",
    "Reiterating the choices, the only environment that directly connects to the notion of skilled players and betting is the pool hall.",
    "Hence, the logical conclusion is that if you're betting with a shark, you're likely in a place where skill-based gambling occurs, which is most associated with a pool hall."
