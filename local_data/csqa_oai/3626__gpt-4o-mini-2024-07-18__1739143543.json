  "query": "Question: He wanted to comfort friend with piling medical bills, he set up an event to raise what?\n\nChoices:\nA: money\nB: feeling bad\nC: sympathetic\nD: awareness\nE: care",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves a person wanting to help a friend who is facing financial burdens from medical bills.",
    "The person wants to provide comfort, which suggests a desire to alleviate the financial stress.",
    "Setting up an event typically implies organizing a fundraising effort or charity to gather support.",
    "Of the options given (money, feeling bad, sympathetic, awareness, care), fundraising generally pertains to gathering financial support rather than emotional or general support.",
    "\"Money\" directly correlates with the goal of easing financial burdens from medical expenses.",
    "The options \"feeling bad\", \"sympathetic\", \"awareness\", and \"care\" do not specifically imply raising funds, which is the most direct method for addressing the financial issue.",
    "Therefore, it follows logically that since the friend has medical bills, the event organized is likely to raise money specifically for that purpose."
