  "steps": [
    "The question discusses the challenges older people may face while using computers.",
    "It specifically mentions that a simple task can become more complicated for them.",
    "This complication often leads to negative feelings or experiences rather than positive ones.",
    "Let's analyze the answer choices for their relevance to the context of difficulty and complications.",
    "Choice A, \"glad,\" does not fit because the difficulty would not typically lead to feelings of happiness.",
    "Choice B, \"program created,\" is unrelated to the context of the emotional or experiential impact of difficulties faced.",
    "Choice C, \"pleasure,\" is also unlikely since the premise suggests that difficulties would not create pleasure.",
    "Choice D, \"stress,\" aligns well with the idea that complications from using computers could lead to frustration or stress.",
    "Choice E, \"increased efficiency,\" contradicts the indicated troubles since inefficiencies would arise from difficulties, not improvements.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"stress\" (Choice D) is the most fitting answer as it matches the idea of complications leading to negative experiences."
