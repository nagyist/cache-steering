  "query": "Question: James doesn't like reading books before bed.  He has an active imagination and finds that late night reading gives him what?\n\nChoices:\nA: nightmares\nB: enlightenment\nC: cramps\nD: drowsiness\nE: entertainment",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the central theme of the question, which revolves around James's feelings towards reading books before bed.",
    "Consider the fact that James has an \"active imagination.\" This implies that his mind is likely to be stimulated and possibly agitated by reading at night.",
    "Evaluate the nature of the choices available to see which one aligns with the implications of having an \"active imagination\" paired with reading before sleep.",
    "A: Nightmares could potentially arise from an overactive mind, especially after reading, suggesting a negative outcome.",
    "B: Enlightenment seems unlikely, as it is a positive outcome and does not fit with his dislike for reading before bed.",
    "C: Cramps does not logically connect to the idea of reading and an active imagination; it seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "D: Drowsiness would contradict the idea of an active mind, as one would generally expect reading to induce drowsiness rather than stimulate thought.",
    "E: Entertainment could be a neutral or positive conclusion; however, given that he doesn't like reading before bed, this choice does not fit well either.",
    "From the analysis, A (nightmares) emerges as the most plausible outcome for someone like James, who has an active imagination and dislikes reading before sleep."
