  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what is meant by a \"complex system.\" A complex system typically refers to a system made up of many interconnected parts that interact in various ways, often resulting in unpredictable behaviors.",
    "Next, we consider the choices provided to evaluate where one might legitimately purchase a complex system.",
    "Choice A, \"place,\" is too vague and doesn\u2019t specify a location or context for purchasing.",
    "Choice B, \"clothing store,\" primarily sells apparel, which does not fit the concept of a complex system.",
    "Choice C, \"computer store,\" is a more viable option, as computer systems can be considered complex systems due to their intricate hardware and software components that interact in multifaceted ways.",
    "Choice D, \"human body,\" while a complex system, is not something that can be purchased.",
    "Choice E, \"computer science,\" refers to a field of study concerning computers and algorithmic processes, which does not point to a place for purchasing a complex system.",
    "Based on the evaluation of the choices, the only logical answer that fits the criteria of where to buy a complex system is the computer store."
