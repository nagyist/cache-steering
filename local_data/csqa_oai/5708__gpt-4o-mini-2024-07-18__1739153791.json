  "steps": [
    "First, consider what places are likely to store or hold historical items like old newspapers.",
    "Libraries are places dedicated to the preservation and access of literature and historical documents, including newspapers.",
    "The option \"lawn\" does not traditionally hold old newspapers unless they have been discarded, which is not a likely situation to find them collected or organized.",
    "The \"front door\" could sometimes have newspapers left on it, but these would typically be current issues and not old newspapers.",
    "\"Jail\" is an unlikely place for old newspapers because although inmates may have access to reading materials, they wouldn't usually be the repositories of old newspapers.",
    "\"Subway\" could have old newspapers if discarded, yet public transport does not serve as a stable archive for such items.",
    "Given the analysis, the most appropriate and likely place to find old newspapers is a library."
