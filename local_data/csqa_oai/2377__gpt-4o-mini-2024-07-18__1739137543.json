    "Jill is walking to the second floor, which indicates that she is in a multi-story building.",
    "She sits in her cubicle, a term typically associated with office environments.",
    "Among the choices given, \"office building\" is the only option that typically contains cubicles.",
    "A house generally does not have cubicles in this context, nor do hotels or schools typically have cubicles like an office.",
    "The option \"a chair\" is not a location but rather a piece of furniture, so it's not applicable.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion based on the context provided is that Jill is in an office building."
