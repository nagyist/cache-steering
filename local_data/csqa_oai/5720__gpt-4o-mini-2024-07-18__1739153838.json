  "query": "Question: You would expect to find the reception desk in what part of a business?\n\nChoices:\nA: building\nB: lobby\nC: office park\nD: motel\nE: outside",
  "steps": [
    "To answer this question, we first need to define what a reception desk is and its purpose within a business environment. A reception desk is generally the point of contact where visitors first arrive and are greeted.",
    "Next, we consider the locations provided in the options. A reception desk is typically found in areas that are accessible and welcoming to visitors.",
    "Now let\u2019s evaluate the options one by one:\n- Option A: building. While a reception desk can be inside a building, this answer is too broad and does not specify a designated area within the building.",
    "- Option B: lobby. A lobby is a common area of a building where a reception desk is commonly found, as it serves as an entry point for visitors.",
    "- Option C: office park. An office park can contain multiple buildings, and while they may have reception areas, it is not specific enough to be a correct answer for the general presence of a reception desk.",
    "- Option D: motel. While motels have reception desks, they are specific to a particular type of business (accommodation). This option is narrower than \"lobby,\" which is more universally applicable to various businesses.",
    "- Option E: outside. A reception desk is typically located indoors to provide shelter and formality. Therefore, this option is not correct.",
    "From the analysis, the most appropriate answer is lobby, as it is specifically designed to accommodate reception desks in various types of businesses."
