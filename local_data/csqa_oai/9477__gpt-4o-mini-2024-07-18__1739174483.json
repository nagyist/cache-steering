  "query": "Question: What types of buildings typically have a column?\n\nChoices:\nA: whitehouse\nB: pantheon\nC: roman architecture\nD: spreadsheet\nE: greece",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about building types that typically have a column, which suggests a focus on architectural styles or specific notable buildings.",
    "The first choice, A: whitehouse, is a specific building known to have columns. However, it's more of a modern structure influenced by classical styles rather than being strictly categorized under classical architecture.",
    "The second choice, B: pantheon, refers to a specific ancient building that is a prime example of Roman architecture and has prominent columns, making it a strong candidate.",
    "The third choice, C: roman architecture, broadly encompasses many buildings that feature columns, such as temples, public buildings, and more. This suggests a larger category of structures known for columns.",
    "The fourth choice, D: spreadsheet, is not related to architecture at all, making it irrelevant to the question.",
    "The fifth choice, E: greece, although it could refer to Greek architecture which also features columns, it is not as specific as Roman architecture in regards to the typical use of columns.",
    "Now, comparing B and C: while the Pantheon is a specific building with columns, Roman architecture as a category (C) includes many structures with columns, making it a more encompassing answer.",
    "However, it's also important to consider if the question requires a specific example or a broader category. The phrasing \"types of buildings\" suggests a focus on categories rather than individual examples.",
    "Thus, considering all options, C (Roman architecture) stands out as it represents a style where columns are a fundamental feature across multiple buildings."
