  "query": "Question: Where is a monkey likely to be found in the rainforest?\n\nChoices:\nA: tree tops\nB: rain forest\nC: zoological gardens\nD: great outdoors\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of monkeys. Monkeys are primarily arboreal, meaning they spend most of their lives in trees.",
    "Next, think about the rainforest environment. Rainforests are dense with trees, providing an ideal living space for monkeys to climb, forage for food, and seek shelter.",
    "Now, examine the available choices: A) tree tops, B) rain forest, C) zoological gardens, D) great outdoors, E) zoo.",
    "Looking closely at choice A, \"tree tops\" specifically refers to where monkeys are likely to be found, as they live and move among the upper parts of trees.",
    "Assessing choice B, \"rain forest,\" is also a correct option, as it implies that monkeys can be found in this environment, but it is less specific than \"tree tops.\"",
    "Choices C and E, \"zoological gardens\" and \"zoo,\" refer to locations where monkeys might be seen but are not their natural habitats.",
    "Choice D, \"great outdoors,\" is too vague and could refer to any natural setting, not specifically where monkeys typically thrive.",
    "Between the specific option of \"tree tops\" and the more general \"rain forest,\" \"tree tops\" more accurately reflects where monkeys are likely to be found in the rainforest.",
    "Thus, conclude that the most precise answer is A, which directly indicates the monkeys' arboreal lifestyle."
