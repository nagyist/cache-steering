  "query": "Question: The hand was gentle, I washed around the dirt soly and softly.  But the chemicals were a different story.  They were very what?\n\nChoices:\nA: harsh\nB: firm\nC: hatred\nD: rough\nE: hard",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes a contrast between the gentle action of washing and the nature of the chemicals used.",
    "Since the washing is described as gentle and soft, the chemicals must be significantly different in nature to create a strong contrast.",
    "The word 'harsh' implies something that is severe or unpleasant, which fits with the notion of chemicals being potentially damaging or rough on surfaces.",
    "The other options are also considered: 'firm' implies strength but doesn't carry a negative connotation; 'hatred' is unrelated; 'rough' suggests a texture but isn't as strong as 'harsh'; 'hard' carries connotations of difficulty but lacks the negative emotional response associated with chemicals.",
    "Considering the context, 'harsh' effectively encapsulates the negative quality of the chemicals when compared to the gentle nature of washing."
