  "query": "Question: Where would you go to get maps that cannot be bought?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: guide drivers\nC: library\nD: internet\nE: bookstore",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to find maps that cannot be purchased. This implies the maps are either free or exclusive in nature.",
    "Option A, \"cabinet,\" does not specifically indicate a place for acquiring maps; it seems too vague and unlikely to contain maps.",
    "Option B, \"guide drivers,\" suggests a position but does not point to a physical location to obtain maps. This option is also irrelevant.",
    "Option C, \"library,\" is known to provide free resources, including maps, which may not be available for purchase elsewhere.",
    "Option D, \"internet,\" offers a wide array of maps, some of which might be free. However, many online maps can be accessed for free but are not exclusive in nature.",
    "Option E, \"bookstore,\" typically sells maps. Therefore, it cannot be the right choice since the question seeks a source for maps that cannot be bought.",
    "Evaluating the candidates, the library is a prime place for accessing unique or special maps that are not available for sale.",
    "Considering the definitions and the context of access, the library stands out as the optimal answer."
