  "steps": [
    "The question states that he likes to keep all his equipment out back. This suggests that the storage location is likely outside or at the back of a property.",
    "Next, we should consider the choices given. The garage is typically a part of the house and may not be described as being \"out back.\"",
    "A tool kit is usually a smaller, portable container meant for carrying tools, which is less likely to be kept \"out back\" in a traditional sense.",
    "A toolbox is similar to a tool kit, often used for smaller handheld tools, and is again not typically described as being kept \"out back.\"",
    "The hardware store is a retail location where one buys tools and should not be considered a place where equipment is stored.",
    "This leaves us with the tool shed, which is commonly found in backyards and designed for storing tools and equipment, making it the most logical choice.",
    "Therefore, based on the interpretation of \"out back,\" it is reasonable to conclude that the saw would be stored in the tool shed."
