  "steps": [
    "The passage describes a central hallway where one can pay bills or register to vote, implying that it serves civic functions.",
    "This suggests that the location must be a public space where governmental or administrative services are provided.",
    "An arched hallway is indicative of a structure designed for public interactions, commonly found in public buildings.",
    "Options B (thunderdome), D (tomb), and E (arena) do not fit the description of a place where you would pay bills or register to vote.",
    "Option C (access rooms) is not a suitable answer because it implies smaller, specific rooms rather than a central, functional space.",
    "By process of elimination, the only option that fits both the description of the setting and the functions provided is a public building.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer must be a location that is used for administrative purposes in the public sector."
