  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a type of person that usually gets an illness.",
    "The choices provided include a mix of people and non-people related terms.",
    "Choice A (beach) does not refer to a person and is irrelevant to the question.",
    "Choice B (elderly person) does refer to a type of person and is relevant to the question. Elderly individuals are known to be more susceptible to illnesses.",
    "Choice C (stomach) is not a type of person but rather an organ, so it\u2019s irrelevant.",
    "Choice D (hospital) refers to a place, not a type of person, making it also irrelevant.",
    "Choice E (body) refers to the physical form of a person but is too general and does not specify a type of person who gets ill.",
    "Among the choices, only B makes sense as it specifically names a group of people who are more likely to get illnesses due to age-related vulnerabilities."
