  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the natural habitats of weasels. Weasels are small carnivorous mammals that typically inhabit areas with plenty of cover, such as forests, fields, and backyards.",
    "Next, I will analyze the provided answer choices. \n- A law office is an urban setting, unlikely to be a natural habitat for a weasel.\n- A car is also a man-made environment, not a suitable home for a weasel.\n- Backyards may provide some cover and food sources, making them a potential habitat.\n- A hollow log is a natural structure and can serve as an excellent den for small mammals, including weasels.\n- A forest is also a natural environment where weasels can thrive.",
    "Now, I will weigh the two most suitable options, which are a hollow log and backyards. \n- A hollow log is specifically designed for small animals to live in and offers protection.\n- Backyards vary in their arrangements and may not always provide sufficient shelter or cover.",
    "Considering weasels often seek smaller, secluded locations to protect themselves from predators and harsh conditions, the hollow log seems like a more ideal choice compared to backyards.",
    "I should also consider the frequency of weasels being found in urban settings like backyards. While they can live there, they are less commonly observed than in their natural habitats, like hollow logs.",
    "Finally, to confirm, I will review the characteristics of the options again. A hollow log is a straightforward choice as it meets the criteria for weasel habitation best among the options given."
