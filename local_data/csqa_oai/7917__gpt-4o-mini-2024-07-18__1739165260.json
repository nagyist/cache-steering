  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to store a frying pan?\n\nChoices:\nA: galley\nB: department store\nC: kitchen cabinet\nD: closet\nE: homes",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary function of a frying pan which is to be used for cooking.",
    "Next, identify the most logical location for cooking utensils and cookware. This is typically the kitchen.",
    "In the kitchen, there are specific storage areas where frying pans are commonly kept, such as cabinets or drawers.",
    "Look at the given options and note that \"kitchen cabinet\" directly refers to a storage area specifically meant for kitchen items.",
    "The \"galley\" refers to a kitchen on a ship, which while valid, is less common and not universally applicable to all homes.",
    "\"Department store\" is not a suitable option since it is a place to purchase items rather than store them.",
    "\"Closet\" is usually used for clothes and other non-kitchen items, making it an unlikely choice for a frying pan.",
    "The option \"homes\" is too broad and does not specify a particular storage place.",
    "Evaluating all the choices, the most appropriate and specific location for storing a frying pan in a general context is the \"kitchen cabinet.\""
