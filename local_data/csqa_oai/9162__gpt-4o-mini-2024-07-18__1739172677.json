  "query": "Question: Where can you watch information on lizards?\n\nChoices:\nA: on the back of a cereal box.\nB: costa rica\nC: garden\nD: documentary\nE: captivity",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what kind of information can be found about lizards. Lizards are a type of reptile and there are various ways to learn about them, including their habitat, behavior, and species.",
    "Next, I can analyze the answer choices to determine which ones are most likely to provide detailed information about lizards.",
    "Choice A suggests information can be found on the back of a cereal box. This is unlikely, as cereal boxes typically do not contain detailed or scientific information about specific animals.",
    "Choice B mentions Costa Rica. While Costa Rica is known for its biodiversity and is home to many species of lizards, simply being in Costa Rica does not guarantee access to comprehensive information about lizards.",
    "Choice C refers to a garden. Gardens can host lizards, and observing them in their natural habitat could provide some basic understanding, but again, it would likely be limited.",
    "Choice D states \"documentary.\" This option typically refers to a film or program that provides in-depth information about specific topics, including animals like lizards. Documentaries often include research and expert commentary.",
    "Choice E mentions \"captivity,\" which could refer to lizards being kept in zoos or similar environments. While one can learn about lizards through observation in captivity, this may not be as informative as watching a documentary which could cover a wider range of topics.",
    "Now, evaluating the choices: A is not plausible, B is indirect, C may not offer comprehensive information, E could be limited in scope, but D stands out as a rich source of information.",
    "Thus, the best answer that indicates where one can watch information on lizards is choice D, \"documentary.\""
