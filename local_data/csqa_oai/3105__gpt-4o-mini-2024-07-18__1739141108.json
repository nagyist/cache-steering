  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the ideal location for buildings designed to hold a lot of people.",
    "A small area (Choice A) would not be suitable because it would limit the capacity for holding many people.",
    "Building in a hole (Choice B) might not provide adequate space and would also be impractical for large crowds.",
    "A university (Choice D) could accommodate a significant number of people, but it is a specific type of location that may not represent a broader area.",
    "A town (Choice E) could hold a decent population, but it may not necessarily have the infrastructure to support a large number of people in the buildings at once.",
    "A large city (Choice C) typically has the infrastructure, resources, and environment suitable for holding a lot of people in buildings designed for such purposes.",
    "Considering all options, a large city is the most logical choice as it provides the necessary space, structure, and amenities for accommodating many people."
