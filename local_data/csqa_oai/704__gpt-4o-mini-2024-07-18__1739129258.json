  "query": "Question: Where do  you park in the parking lot with shopping bags?\n\nChoices:\nA: amusement park\nB: urban area\nC: airport\nD: shopping malls\nE: train station",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where one typically parks when coming from shopping activities. Shopping bags suggest a recent visit to a retail location.",
    "Next, I consider the context of the options provided. Options like \"amusement park\" and \"airport\" do not typically involve shopping bags, as they are not primarily focused on retail.",
    "I then evaluate \"urban area.\" While urban areas may have shopping opportunities, it is not a dedicated place to park specifically for carrying shopping bags.",
    "Continuing with my analysis, \"train station\" is also not directly associated with shopping; it serves primarily transportation purposes.",
    "Finally, I focus on \"shopping malls,\" which are designed for shopping and have dedicated parking lots for shoppers. Parking here would logically align with the context of having shopping bags.",
    "Since \"shopping malls\" is the only option clearly associated with shopping and parking in preparation to carry bags, it stands out as the correct answer."
