  "query": "Question: If I recieve a letter from a friend over seas, why might I read it?\n\nChoices:\nA: pudding\nB: get news\nC: strain\nD: answer\nE: though",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of receiving a letter from a friend overseas. Typically, such a letter would contain personal messages or updates.",
    "Next, evaluate the most common reasons people read letters. One primary reason is to receive news about the sender's life or situation.",
    "Assess the provided answer choices. \"Pudding\" is irrelevant to the context of reading a letter.",
    "The option \"Strain\" does not relate to the act of reading a letter or the content it might contain.",
    "Looking at \"Answer,\" while it could imply responding, it does not directly relate to the immediate reason for reading the letter itself.",
    "The choice \"Though\" does not fit as a reason for reading a letter; it seems more like a conjunction or transition rather than a motivating factor.",
    "Given the previous evaluations, the option \"Get news\" stands out as the primary reason for reading a letter from a friend overseas, aligning perfectly with the context."
