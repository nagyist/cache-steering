  "steps": [
    "The question is asking why eating an uncooked hamburger may lead to illness.",
    "A hamburger that is not cooked may contain harmful bacteria or pathogens that can cause foodborne illness.",
    "Common bacteria associated with undercooked meat, particularly beef, include E. coli and Salmonella.",
    "These pathogens can multiply rapidly in food that is not cooked to safe temperatures.",
    "When ingested, these bacteria can cause various digestive illnesses, commonly referred to as food poisoning.",
    "Symptoms of food poisoning can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.",
    "In this context, food poisoning is definitely a significant risk associated with eating uncooked hamburgers.",
    "None of the other options (being full, filling the stomach, heartburn, or gas) specifically address the risk of illness from undercooked meat.",
    "Thus, the correct reason that a person is likely to become ill from eating an uncooked hamburger is due to the risk of food poisoning."
