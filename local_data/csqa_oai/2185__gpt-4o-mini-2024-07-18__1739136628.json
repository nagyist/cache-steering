  "query": "Question: Where is a bridge likely to be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: river bed\nB: river valley\nC: texas\nD: california\nE: over water",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify where a bridge is typically constructed.",
    "Bridges are often built to span physical obstacles like rivers, valleys, or roads to provide a pathway over them.",
    "A river bed refers to the bottom of a river, which is not a practical location for a bridge itself.",
    "A river valley is a low area between hills or mountains where a river flows, and it can be a location to build a bridge over the river.",
    "Texas and California are states, and while they may have bridges, they are not specific locations for bridges in general terms.",
    "The choice \"over water\" indicates the typical function of a bridge, which is to provide a transportation route above a body of water, such as a river or lake.",
    "Since a bridge serves the purpose of spanning and providing access over areas, the most general and relevant choice would be \"over water.\"",
    "Comparing the options, \"over water\" directly describes what a bridge does, while other answers describe either locations where a bridge could be placed or states but do not specifically mention the function of a bridge.",
    "Thus, the strongest candidate based on the purpose and typical locations of bridges is \"over water.\""
