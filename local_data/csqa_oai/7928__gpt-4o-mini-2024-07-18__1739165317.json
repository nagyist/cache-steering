  "query": "Question: Where can you buy a letter opener along with high quality writing instruments?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: dek\nC: martyr's chest\nD: stationery store\nE: office supply store",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the environments or types of stores where writing instruments and letter openers are typically sold.",
    "A grocery store primarily sells food and household items, not stationery or office supplies.",
    "A \"dek\" is not a commonly known retail environment for purchasing writing instruments or letter openers, and it may simply refer to a structure or platform.",
    "A martyr's chest is an unusual term and does not relate to office supplies or stationery; it is more likely a historical or symbolic term.",
    "A stationery store explicitly specializes in items such as paper products, writing instruments, and related accessories, including letter openers.",
    "An office supply store also specializes in selling writing instruments, office supplies, and equipment, including letter openers.",
    "Both the stationery store and office supply store are viable options for purchasing a letter opener along with high-quality writing instruments.",
    "Next, I need to narrow down my choices based on common understanding.",
    "Since both the stationery and office supply stores fit the criteria of selling both items, I will choose the most suitable option.",
    "The stationery store is more focused on writing tools and related items, while an office supply store covers a broader range of products."
