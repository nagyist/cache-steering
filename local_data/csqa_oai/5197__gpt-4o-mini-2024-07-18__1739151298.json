  "query": "Question: How might someone feel if they were committing perjury?\n\nChoices:\nA: embarrassment indictment\nB: tension\nC: going to jail\nD: penalty\nE: mistrial",
  "steps": [
    "To understand how someone might feel if they were committing perjury, we first need to identify what perjury is. Perjury is the act of lying under oath, typically during legal proceedings.",
    "Considering this definition, one might feel anxious or worried about the consequences of lying, as it is a serious crime.",
    "Next, we should consider the potential feelings of guilt. Committing perjury involves dishonesty and betrayal of trust, which could lead to feelings of guilt and remorse.",
    "A significant factor to consider is the fear of detection. If someone is committing perjury, they might constantly fear getting caught, which can create a persistent state of tension or anxiety.",
    "Now looking at the answer choices, we need to see which specifically aligns with feelings related to committing perjury.",
    "Choice A: embarrassment indictment - embarrassment could be a feeling, but \"indictment\" is a term related to being charged with a crime rather than a feeling.",
    "Choice B: tension - this seems reasonable as someone might feel tense due to the fear of being caught lying.",
    "Choice C: going to jail - while this is a significant consequence of perjury, it is more of an outcome rather than a direct feeling someone might experience while committing it.",
    "Choice D: penalty - similar to going to jail, a penalty is a consequence and does not directly represent a feeling.",
    "Choice E: mistrial - this refers to a legal situation, not an emotional response.",
    "After analyzing each option, choice B (tension) directly represents how someone might feel in the act of committing perjury due to the stress and anxiety of the situation."
