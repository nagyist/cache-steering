  "query": "Question: The churchyard looked peaceful after the fresh snow, the frozen great lake added to the serene scene where?\n\nChoices:\nA: england\nB: maine\nC: michigan\nD: country side\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "The description mentions a churchyard, which is commonly found in rural or small-town settings.",
    "The mention of a \"frozen great lake\" suggests that the location has large bodies of fresh water, which might limit the places to areas near the Great Lakes.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"england\" does not have Great Lakes; it has smaller lakes and rivers, which makes it less likely.",
    "\"Maine\" has some lakes but is better known for its coastal areas and might not fit the description of a churchyard alongside a frozen lake.",
    "\"Michigan\" is home to the Great Lakes and has many churchyards. It fits the context of a serene winter scene.",
    "Next, \"countryside\" and \"city\" are not specific places; instead, they describe general categories. A \"countryside\" option could fit but lacks specificity.",
    "Among the specific options, \"Michigan\" aligns best with all aspects presented: a churchyard and a frozen lake.",
    "Finally, the visual imagery of snow and a frozen lake aligns more with a northern state like Michigan during winter, reaffirming this conclusion."
