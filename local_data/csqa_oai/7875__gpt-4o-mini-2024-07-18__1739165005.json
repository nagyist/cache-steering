  "query": "Question: The host of the party spent most of her time at the front door so she could what?\n\nChoices:\nA: talk on radio show\nB: welcome guests\nC: shut the door\nD: expect company\nE: head table",
  "steps": [
    "The host of the party is typically responsible for greeting guests as they arrive.",
    "Being at the front door suggests she is positioned to receive people coming into the party.",
    "Welcoming guests is a common and expected behavior for a party host at the entrance.",
    "The other options do not make logical sense in the context of a host's responsibilities at a party.",
    "For example, talking on a radio show would not require her to be at the front door.",
    "Shutting the door is not a primary role of a host; rather, it's more about reception.",
    "Expecting company could be true but does not specifically explain why she would be at the door.",
    "\"Head table\" is usually a setup for seating and not relevant to being at the front door.",
    "Based on the roles and responsibilities of a host at a party, it is clear she is there to welcome guests."
