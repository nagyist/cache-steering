  "steps": [
    "To determine where you might find an expensive lantern, we should consider where valuable or unique items are typically located.",
    "A collector's house is a possibility since collectors tend to acquire rare and valuable items, including lanterns, so this option is worth considering.",
    "A dark place is not a logical choice for finding an expensive lantern, as it refers more to the absence of light rather than a location where one would typically store or sell valuable items.",
    "Looking at \"house\" alone does not indicate whether it's a place that would specifically house expensive or valuable lanterns; it could refer to any ordinary home.",
    "An antique shop is also a strong candidate, as antique shops specialize in selling vintage or unique items, which often include valuable antiques like lanterns.",
    "Now, we need to compare the collector's house and the antique shop more closely, as they are both plausible options for where expensive lanterns can be found.",
    "The specific mention of a collector's house suggests it might have specific valuable pieces, but an antique shop typically has a wider variety of antiques available for sale.",
    "Ultimately, while both options (A and D) are valid, the nature of an antique shop generally makes it a more appropriate place to find an expensive lantern.",
    "Therefore, considering all reasoning, the most logical answer is an antique shop, which is option D."
