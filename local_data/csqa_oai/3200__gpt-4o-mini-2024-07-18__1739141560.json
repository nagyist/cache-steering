  "query": "Question: Billy was a student taking a course in communications.  Where might he be taking his classes?\n\nChoices:\nA: every aspect of life\nB: library\nC: in a movie hall\nD: classroom\nE: university",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the typical locations where communication courses are taught.",
    "Communication courses are usually part of a larger educational program, such as those found in universities or colleges.",
    "While a library could be a location for studying or research, it is not where formal classes are typically held.",
    "A movie hall is not a formal educational setting, although it might be used for specific film studies or presentations.",
    "A classroom is a common setting for various subjects including communications, but its scope is limited to primary, secondary, or lower-level education.",
    "The term \"university\" encompasses a broader range of courses and is the most logical place for a student taking a communications course, as it typically offers those types of classes.",
    "I will compare options D (classroom) and E (university). While both are valid locations for taking classes, a university is more comprehensive and appropriate for a communications course.",
    "After weighing all options, the best choice where Billy might be taking his communication classes is at a university."
