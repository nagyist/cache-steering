  "query": "Question: Where do you originally get kleenex from?\n\nChoices:\nA: wipe nose\nB: blow nose\nC: box\nD: purse\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the original source or location from which Kleenex is obtained.",
    "Kleenex is a brand of facial tissues that are typically packaged in a box.",
    "When you need a tissue, you generally go to the box to take one out.",
    "Options A, B, D, and E refer to actions or places where you might use or carry tissues, but they do not represent the original source.",
    "Option A (wipe nose) and B (blow nose) refer to the actions performed with a Kleenex, not its source.",
    "Options D (purse) and E (pocket) suggest places where one might carry tissues, but again, they do not indicate the original source.",
    "Only option C (box) directly refers to where Kleenex tissues are originally found, indicating its packaging.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer is the box from which you initially obtain the Kleenex."
