  "query": "Question: Alexa needed a safe place to put her acoustic guitar when she wasn't playing it.  Where might she put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: drawer\nB: music shop\nC: house\nD: studio\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the options where a guitar could typically be stored.",
    "A drawer is usually too small for an acoustic guitar, making it an impractical choice.",
    "A music shop is not a place where she could store her guitar long-term, as it is a commercial space.",
    "Her house could serve as a place to keep the guitar, but it\u2019s a broad option and does not specify where in the house.",
    "A studio may be used for music production and might have space for musical instruments, but it is a specific location that may not be as available as home options.",
    "A closet is an enclosed space within a house and typically a good place to safely store musical instruments.",
    "Comparing the places within the context: the closet is more dedicated for storage, while a house is general.",
    "Since the closet is part of a house, and it provides safety and protection, it seems to be the best specific choice.",
    "Based on the reasoning, while multiple options are possible, the closet stands out as the ideal choice for safely storing the guitar."
