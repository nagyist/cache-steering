  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what types of places typically have a wide range of plant varieties.",
    "Botanic gardens are known for showcasing diverse collections of plants, including unusual varieties, as their purpose is often to educate and conserve different species.",
    "Flower gardens might contain a variety of flowers, but they are generally focused on common types rather than rare or unusual varieties.",
    "Backyards can have roses, but they usually feature more common types, as they are often planted for personal use rather than for unusual varieties.",
    "Supermarkets primarily sell commercially grown flowers, which tend to be popular varieties, and are unlikely to have unusual types of roses.",
    "The outdoors can include different environments where roses might grow, but finding unusual varieties would not be guaranteed outside of a cultivated setting.",
    "From the analysis, it becomes clear that the best option to find unusual varieties of roses is a botanic garden, where they are specifically curated for diversity."
