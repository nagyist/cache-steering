  "query": "Question: What prevents someone from going to bed?\n\nChoices:\nA: rest\nB: insomnia\nC: getting lost\nD: making love\nE: pregnancy",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of going to bed, which generally implies the act of sleeping or resting.",
    "Next, we'll evaluate each choice in relation to what might inhibit someone from going to bed.",
    "Choice A: rest \u2013 This is likely a result of going to bed, not a prevention, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice B: insomnia \u2013 This is a condition that directly prevents someone from sleeping, which aligns well with the scenario.",
    "Choice C: getting lost \u2013 While being lost may cause anxiety or distraction, it does not specifically prevent someone from going to bed.",
    "Choice D: making love \u2013 This activity can be seen as a reason someone might stay up rather than go to bed, but it's not a direct prevention of the act of going to bed.",
    "Choice E: pregnancy \u2013 While pregnancy can involve physical and emotional challenges, it doesn't directly prevent someone from going to bed, as many pregnant individuals still go to bed.",
    "To summarize, the strongest candidate that clearly inhibits the act of going to bed is insomnia, as it prevents sleep altogether."
