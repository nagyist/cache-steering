  "query": "Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck?\n\nChoices:\nA: glass\nB: shoulder\nC: body\nD: guillotine\nE: bottle",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which type of drink container requires holding by the neck, I'll analyze the options provided.",
    "Choice A, \"glass,\" typically refers to drinking glasses, which are usually held by the body of the glass rather than by the neck.",
    "Choice B, \"shoulder,\" does not logically correspond to a drink container, as it does not represent any standard type of drink.",
    "Choice C, \"body,\" also does not pertain to any standard type of drink container; it is more of a description rather than an item to hold.",
    "Choice D, \"guillotine,\" is unrelated as it refers to an execution device and has no relevance to holding a drink container.",
    "Choice E, \"bottle,\" refers to a common drink container, particularly for beverages like water, soda, and alcohol. Bottles often have a neck that is specifically designed to be held for pouring or drinking.",
    "Now, upon comparing all the choices, \"bottle\" is the only item that is typically held by the neck.",
    "Therefore, the correct choice is E, as it directly corresponds to the requirement of holding drinks by the neck."
