  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of a hard piece of rubber deflecting off a stick. This suggests a scenario where something is being hit or struck, which is common in various sports.",
    "Next, I should think about the properties of the object involved. A \"hard piece of rubber\" often refers to a hockey puck, which is specifically designed for the game of hockey.",
    "Since the scenario involves a stick deflecting the rubber object, that suggests the presence of hockey sticks, which are primarily used in ice hockey.",
    "The mention of a fan being struck implies an indoor setting, as most hockey games occur in rink arenas, which have fans that could be hit by a puck.",
    "Now, I evaluate the options to find a scenario where this could happen. A hockey game fits perfectly, as it directly involves hockey sticks and a puck.",
    "Looking at the other options, a sporting event is too general, and does not specify hockey. A living room is not a plausible environment for hockey-related activity. Soccer and football do not use a hard rubber object that behaves like a hockey puck.",
    "Thus, among the choices, only a hockey game aligns well with the described situation of a hard rubber puck deflecting off a stick and hitting a fan.",
    "Finally, I conclude that the only location where this specific interaction could feasibly occur is at a hockey game."
