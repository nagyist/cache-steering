  "steps": [
    "The question describes a scenario where someone is going out in public and feels their heart racing. This suggests a heightened emotional state.",
    "A racing heart can be associated with several feelings, but is commonly linked to anxiety or excitement. However, in the context of \"going public,\" anxiety is more relevant.",
    "Examining the choices: \"pain\" doesn't correlate with a racing heart in a public context, and \"sorrow\" typically does not cause a racing heart.",
    "\"Embarrassment\" can cause a racing heart, but it is typically accompanied by other feelings and might not be the most direct answer here.",
    "\"Panic\" is an intense reaction that can certainly cause a racing heart, especially in a stressful public outing scenario.",
    "\"Tired\" is not relevant to a racing heart during an outing, as tiredness generally implies a lack of energy rather than a heightened state.",
    "Between \"panic\" and \"embarrassment,\" \"panic\" aligns more closely with the physiological response of a racing heart in a potentially anxiety-inducing scenario like going public.",
    "Therefore, the best answer that encapsulates the intense emotional feeling associated with a racing heart while going public is \"panic.\""
