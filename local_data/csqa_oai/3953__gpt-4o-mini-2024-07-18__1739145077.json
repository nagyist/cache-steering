  "steps": [
    "The question states that two friends lived in different countries, which suggests they need a method of communication that can bridge the distance between them.",
    "We need to evaluate each option to see if they can reasonably allow for communication between friends in different locations.",
    "Option A, \"wedding,\" does not serve as a method of communication, as it is an event rather than a means to communicate.",
    "Option B, \"fraternity house,\" also does not function as a method of long-distance communication. It implies a location or a type of living arrangement.",
    "Option C, \"internet cafe,\" provides access to the internet and can be used for various forms of communication, such as emails, messaging apps, or video calls. This option is plausible.",
    "Option D, \"smoke signals,\" historically were used by some cultures for long-distance communication, but this method is largely outdated and impractical in modern contexts, particularly across countries.",
    "Option E, \"movie,\" similarly does not serve as a method of communication. While friends may watch movies together, it does not facilitate an ongoing dialogue or exchange of thoughts.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only reasonable method that allows for frequent communication between friends in different countries is the \"internet cafe.\""
