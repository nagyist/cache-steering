  "query": "Question: If you're going fishing what do you need to buy?\n\nChoices:\nA: tackle\nB: fishing rod\nC: bate\nD: boat\nE: fishing pole",
  "steps": [
    "To go fishing, one typically needs equipment and supplies necessary for the activity.",
    "The first item to consider is the fishing rod, which is essential for casting lines and catching fish.",
    "Next, tackle is important because it includes the hooks, lines, and other components that facilitate catching fish.",
    "Bait is also vital as it attracts the fish, making it more likely to catch them.",
    "A boat can be useful for certain types of fishing, especially if one is going on larger bodies of water, but it is not strictly necessary for all fishing activities.",
    "A fishing pole is essentially another term for a fishing rod, so it would serve the same purpose.",
    "Given that multiple options are needed, I must prioritize what is absolutely necessary for fishing.",
    "Of the given options, bait (C) stands out as the specific item that directly pertains to the act of fishing and is universally required to attract fish.",
    "While tackle, fishing rod, and even a boat could also be considered, bait is the one item that is explicitly necessary regardless of the method of fishing."
