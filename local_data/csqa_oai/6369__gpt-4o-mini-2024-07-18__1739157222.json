  "steps": [
    "The question indicates a condition related to the bladder, specifically when a person feels the need to urinate.",
    "When a person has to pee, it typically means they are experiencing a buildup of urine in the bladder.",
    "Bodily functions related to the bladder include the storage of urine until it is convenient to urinate.",
    "As the bladder fills with urine, pressure builds up, signaling the need to empty it.",
