  "steps": [
    "The question asks where board games are typically played.",
    "I think about different locations where people might commonly play board games.",
    "A shelf is a place where you store board games, not where you play them.",
    "A toy store is a place where you can purchase board games, but it is not a common location for actually playing them.",
    "A shelter could theoretically be a location for playing games, but it is not a primary or common setting for board game play.",
    "A house is a common location for family and friends to gather and play board games in a relaxed setting.",
    "A den is also a place where people might play board games, often referring to a cozy room in a home.",
    "Comparing \"house\" and \"den,\" both are valid, but \"house\" generally encompasses a broader idea of places where games are played.",
    "Therefore, the most suitable answer considering common practices is likely to be \"house.\""
