  "query": "Question: John was responsible for the biggest oil spill ever.  It was entirely what?\n\nChoices:\nA: detestable\nB: enabled\nC: effusive\nD: weird\nE: accidental",
  "steps": [
    "I start by interpreting the question and the context, which involves John and an oil spill, suggesting an event that is typically regrettable and undesired.",
    "Next, I analyze each of the choices provided to see which one fits best with the nature of oil spills, particularly in the context of responsibility.",
    "The first choice, \"detestable,\" indicates something that is highly unpleasant or deserving of hatred, which might describe the response to an oil spill, but doesn't encapsulate the event itself as John\u2019s responsibility.",
    "The second choice, \"enabled,\" suggests that someone facilitated or made something possible, which does not really describe the oil spill itself; it relates more to the actions leading up to it.",
    "The third choice, \"effusive,\" refers to expressing feelings of gratitude or pleasure in an unrestrained or heartfelt manner. This does not relate at all to an oil spill.",
    "The fourth option, \"weird,\" indicates something strange or unusual and doesn\u2019t effectively describe an oil spill or the implications of it.",
    "The fifth choice, \"accidental,\" implies that the incident occurred unintentionally. This aligns well with most large-scale environmental disasters which are often the result of accidents rather than deliberate actions.",
    "Now, focusing back on \"accidental,\" oil spills are frequently tied to unexpected incidents during drilling, transportation, or storage, fitting the context well.",
    "Therefore, based on the interpretation that John was responsible for an oil spill, the most fitting choice is that it was entirely \"accidental.\""
