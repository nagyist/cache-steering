  "query": "Question: Balthazar is a popular french restaurant located where?\n\nChoices:\nA: wine\nB: manhattan\nC: underwater\nD: quebec\nE: montreal",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to recognize that Balthazar is a well-known restaurant name.",
    "Balthazar is traditionally associated with French cuisine, so I can narrow down the locations that would best suit a French restaurant.",
    "I recall that Balthazar is highly regarded in New York City.",
    "Within New York City, Manhattan is the borough that houses Balthazar.",
    "I must consider the other options provided: underwater, Quebec, and Montreal.",
    "Underwater is not a plausible location for a restaurant; it is a physical impossibility for a conventional dining experience.",
    "Quebec and Montreal are certainly locations in Canada known for their French culture, but they don't correlate specifically with Balthazar.",
    "Furthermore, since Balthazar is popular in Manhattan, it confirms that it is not located in Quebec or Montreal.",
    "Thus, the only reasonable choice from the provided options, relating to the popular French restaurant Balthazar, is Manhattan."
