  "query": "Question: Where do you see a shark in Australia?\n\nChoices:\nA: deep ocean\nB: maritime museum\nC: pacific ocean\nD: at the aquarium.\nE: great barrier reef",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the natural habitats of sharks. Sharks typically inhabit oceans, seas, and can sometimes be found near coastal areas.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options provided. The deep ocean (A) is a possible natural habitat for sharks, as many species reside in deep waters.",
    "The maritime museum (B) is unlikely to be a place where one would see a live shark, as it is more focused on preserving artifacts and exhibits related to maritime history.",
    "The Pacific Ocean (C) is a vast ocean that does include parts of Australia, making it another possible location to see sharks in their natural habitat.",
    "The aquarium (D) is a controlled environment where sharks can be seen, but it is not their natural habitat.",
    "The Great Barrier Reef (E) is a renowned natural habitat for various shark species, offering a unique opportunity to see them in a vibrant ecosystem.",
    "Comparing options A, C, and E, both the deep ocean and the Pacific Ocean are broader and not specific to Australia. However, the Great Barrier Reef is a specific, well-known location in Australia where sharks can be commonly observed.",
    "While an aquarium offers sightings of sharks as well, it does not represent their natural habitat. Therefore, it is less relevant to the question of where to see sharks in Australia in a natural setting.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it becomes evident that the Great Barrier Reef (E) uniquely combines the aspect of a natural encounter with sharks along with being a location specifically in Australia."
