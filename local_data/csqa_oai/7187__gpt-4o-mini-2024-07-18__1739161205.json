  "steps": [
    "Identify what a \"fiddle\" is. It is commonly known as a violin, particularly in folk music contexts.",
    "Consider the context in which someone would need a fiddle. This would likely involve contexts where fiddling is prominent, such as folk music, country music, or specific geographic areas known for fiddling.",
    "Examine the choices provided for any that relate to fiddling or the culture around it.",
    "Choice A - dance hall: While dance halls may feature fiddle music, they are not a place to obtain a fiddle.",
    "Choice B - orchestra: Orchestras typically use violins but refer to them in classical music contexts, which is not specifically \"fiddling.\"",
    "Choice C - tennessee: Tennessee is well-known for its folk and country music traditions where fiddling is a prominent feature.",
    "Choice D - rock concert: Rock concerts typically do not feature fiddles as it is not a common instrument in rock music.",
    "Choice E - music store: This would be a place where one could purchase or borrow a fiddle.",
    "Now weigh the significance and appropriate context between Tennessee (which is known for fiddling) and music store (which is a practical location to find a fiddle).",
    "While both Tennessee and a music store can be valid, the question asks specifically \"where would you go if you need a fiddle?\" implying a location to obtain one. A music store directly fulfills this need."
