  "query": "Question: What can you store silicone in?\n\nChoices:\nA: artificial breasts\nB: tube\nC: bag\nD: hardware store\nE: contact lens",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what can be used to store silicone, we should consider the nature of silicone. Silicone is a versatile synthetic material that can be found in various forms, including liquids, gels, and solid products.",
    "Next, we must evaluate the options provided. A: artificial breasts \u2013 these are made from silicone but are not used to store it. B: tube \u2013 a tube could indeed hold liquid silicone. C: bag \u2013 a bag, especially if it is made of silicone or a similar material, could also store silicone. D: hardware store \u2013 this is a location and not a storage medium. E: contact lens \u2013 while some contact lenses contain silicone, they are not a means to store silicone material itself.",
    "Considering storage properties, a tube would typically be suitable for storing liquids, and many silicone products can be stored in a bag as well. However, we are looking for the best option among the given choices.",
    "Examining the options more closely, while A, D, and E do not serve as storage, B (tube) and C (bag) appear more appropriate as storage for silicone. Between the two, a tube is commonly associated with containing liquid materials, including silicone sealants, while a bag could store solid or semi-solid silicone products.",
    "Reviewing the practicality, a tube used specifically for liquids is more frequently connected with silicone products, so it seems to be the better option when focusing on the storage capacity for the material in its most common forms.",
    "While both B and C can technically store silicone, I need to select the option that best aligns with what is conventionally used for silicone storage."
