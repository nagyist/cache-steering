  "query": "Question: Where might a small ball be bounced from?\n\nChoices:\nA: soccer game\nB: street\nC: toy store\nD: child's hand\nE: on the sidewalk",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of each option. A small ball is typically something that can be easily thrown or dropped from a height.",
    "Next, evaluate option A (soccer game). While balls are used in soccer, they are mainly kicked rather than bounced from a stationary position.",
    "Option B (street) is also unlikely unless the street is specifically engaged in a ball game or similar activity, which is not common for just bouncing a ball.",
    "For option C (toy store), small balls may be present, but they wouldn't typically be bounced from there as they are usually still in packaging or being held.",
    "Now consider option D (child's hand). A child can easily bounce a small ball from their hand, making this a plausible scenario.",
    "Lastly, evaluate option E (on the sidewalk). This could also make sense, as a small ball can be bounced on the sidewalk.",
    "Comparing options D and E, option D (child's hand) feels more appropriate because bouncing a ball directly from a hand implies movement and interaction rather than simply being placed on a surface.",
    "Thus, although option E is also a strong candidate, option D provides a more direct action context for bouncing a small ball."
