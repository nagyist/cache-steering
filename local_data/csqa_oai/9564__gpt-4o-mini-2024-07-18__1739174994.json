  "steps": [
    "To determine where endless shelves are likely found, let's consider the function of each option. A kitchen typically has cabinets and shelves, but they are not endless.",
    "A corner is merely a location and does not imply the existence of shelves. Thus, it cannot be the right answer.",
    "A bookstore, by definition, is a place where many books are stored, often on endless or numerous shelves. This aligns well with the concept of \"endless shelves.\"",
    "A refrigerator is designed for food storage and not for books or other items, so it lacks shelves that could be considered endless.",
    "A cupboard also has shelves but does not typically imply the same vastness or number of shelves as a bookstore.",
    "Since options A, B, D, and E do not support the idea of \"endless shelves,\" it further strengthens the likelihood that option C is the best fit.",
    "Given that a bookstore is designed specifically to hold a large number of books across many shelves, it is the most logical choice."
