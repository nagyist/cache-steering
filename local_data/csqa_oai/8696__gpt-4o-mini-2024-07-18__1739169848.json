  "steps": [
    "The prompt mentions that someone might panic during a heart attack.",
    "Panic often arises from fear or anxiety regarding one's health and safety.",
    "When experiencing a heart attack, an individual may feel intense physical symptoms, which could lead to heightened emotional responses.",
    "Considering the choices, \"fear of death\" (D) directly relates to the emotional response during a dramatic health event like a heart attack.",
    "While options A (could die) and B (loss of life) also relate to the seriousness of a heart attack, they do not capture the immediate emotional response of panic as specifically as option D.",
    "Option C (recover) does not align with the initial reaction of someone having a heart attack, as it does not induce panic at that moment.",
    "Option E (health) is too broad and does not specifically address the panic response related to the fear of death during a crisis.",
    "Upon evaluating the options, option D (fear of death) is the most pertinent cause of panic during a heart attack because it precisely reflects the emotional turmoil experienced."
