  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of where families might gather to discuss or decide on dinner. The options given include various places where families might be together or have engagements.",
    "A park (choice A) is typically a recreational area, and while families may enjoy meals there (like picnics), it isn't a primary place for deciding on dinner together, as they might already have brought food.",
    "A funeral (choice B) is a solemn occasion and is not generally a time when families would be discussing dinner plans, making it an unlikely option.",
    "A wedding (choice D) is usually an event where a meal is provided, rather than a situation where families would decide what to eat; they generally have pre-arranged food.",
    "A hotel (choice E) often has dining facilities but is not a typical setting for families to collectively decide on dinner, especially if they are not part of an event there.",
    "Now, consider the supermarket (choice C). This location is unique in that families can go there together to select ingredients or pre-made meals, thereby actively making decisions about what to have for dinner.",
    "Given the function of each location, the supermarket stands out as the place where families can actually discuss and select their dinner options together."
