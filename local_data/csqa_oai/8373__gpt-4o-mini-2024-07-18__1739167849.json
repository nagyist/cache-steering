  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"pawn\" which is a piece used in the game of chess.",
    "The phrase \"hand carved\" suggests an object that is intricately made, likely referring to a piece of a collection or a game related to chess.",
    "Among the options provided, \"chess game\" (C) and \"chess set\" (E) directly relate to chess.",
    "Considering the context of \"pawn,\" it is a specific piece within a chess set rather than a complete game itself.",
    "A \"chess set\" would indeed include a pawn alongside various other pieces such as bishops, knights, and rooks.",
    "The other options\u2014scheme (A), elephant (B), and north carolina (D)\u2014do not logically fit the context of chess or handcrafted items related to it.",
    "A \"chess set\" is the correct term for a collection that includes a pawn, as opposed to \"chess game\" which refers to the play itself.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer that fits the description of a pawn being \"hand carved\" is \"chess set.\""
