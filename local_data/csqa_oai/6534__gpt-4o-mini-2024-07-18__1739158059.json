  "query": "Question: You might find a marmoset in a South American protected what?\n\nChoices:\nA: zoo\nB: burrow\nC: american west\nD: in wild\nE: national park",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand where marmosets are typically found in nature. Marmosets are native to South America.",
    "Next, I should consider the context of \"protected\" areas. Such areas typically include places that are conserved for wildlife, such as national parks and reserves.",
    "Now, looking at the options provided, I can eliminate \"A: zoo\" because while animals can be found in zoos, they are not considered a natural, protected environment in the wild.",
    "The option \"B: burrow\" is also not applicable here since marmosets do not dwell in burrows; they live in trees.",
    "Next, \"C: american west\" refers to a geographical area that is not relevant to the habitat of marmosets, as they are primarily found in tropical areas of South America.",
    "Now, I examine option \"D: in wild\". While this is true for marmosets, it does not specify that it is a protected area.",
    "The best option left is \"E: national park\". National parks are specifically established to protect wildlife and their natural habitats, making it a fitting environment for marmosets.",
    "In conclusion, marmosets would most likely be found in a protected area like a national park in South America."
