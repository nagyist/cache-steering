  "query": "Question: Where could you find a monkey in the wild?\n\nChoices:\nA: friend's house\nB: research laboratory\nC: french government\nD: beach\nE: madagascar",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where monkeys are naturally found in the wild.",
    "Monkeys are generally found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forests.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each choice to see if it could correspond to a natural habitat for monkeys.",
    "Choice A (friend's house) does not relate to a natural habitat but rather a domestic setting.",
    "Choice B (research laboratory) also implies a controlled environment and does not reflect a wild setting.",
    "Choice C (French government) is not a location but an institution, making this choice irrelevant.",
    "Choice D (beach) is sometimes associated with monkeys, but it's more common in specific areas like coastal regions of countries with tropical climates.",
    "Choice E (Madagascar) is renowned for its biodiversity and is home to lemurs, which are monkeys' relatives, as well as other species.",
    "Since Madagascar is a natural habitat for primates and aligns with the requirement of \"in the wild,\" I will choose it as the most appropriate answer."
