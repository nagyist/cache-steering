  "query": "Question: Where would a cat sit to soak up sunlight?\n\nChoices:\nA: barn\nB: house\nC: window sill\nD: humane society\nE: comfortable chair",
  "steps": [
    "Consider where sunlight typically enters in a home or building. Sunlight generally streams in through windows.",
    "Think about the behavior of cats. Cats are known for their love of sunbathing and often seek out sunny spots to relax.",
    "Assessing the choices, \u201cwindow sill\u201d stands out as a specific location where sunlight is likely to be abundant during the day, as it is directly exposed to sunlight.",
    "In contrast, a \u201cbarn\u201d might provide some sunny areas, but it\u2019s not guaranteed that the cat would reliably find a sunny spot to fully bask in sunlight.",
    "A \u201chouse\u201d is a general term and does not specify a place where cats usually sit. It might contain various areas without the specific appeal of sunlight.",
    "The \u201chumane society\u201d is typically a facility for caretaking of animals, and while there may be sunny spots, it isn\u2019t a common spot for a cat to regularly choose to sit.",
    "A \u201ccomfortable chair\u201d could provide a good resting place, but without knowledge of its location in relation to sunlight, it doesn\u2019t specifically imply access to direct sunlight like a window sill would.",
    "Given these considerations, the \u201cwindow sill\u201d option is the most ideal location for a cat seeking a sunny spot, as it directly faces potential sunlight."
