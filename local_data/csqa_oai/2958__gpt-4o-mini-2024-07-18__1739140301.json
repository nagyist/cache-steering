  "query": "Question: If you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, where would you go to get it?\n\nChoices:\nA: doctor\nB: prescribed\nC: pharmacy\nD: medicine cabinet\nE: capsule",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to go in order to obtain an antibiotic that was prescribed by a doctor.",
    "A doctor prescribes medications, but they do not provide the medication directly; rather, they provide a prescription.",
    "The prescription is a written authorization that allows a patient to obtain medication from a pharmacy.",
    "One of the options is \"pharmacy,\" which is the common place where prescriptions are filled and medications are dispensed to patients.",
    "\"Medicine cabinet\" and \"capsule\" do not represent places to acquire a dispensed medication; they refer to storage or the form of medication itself.",
    "The option \"prescribed\" does not indicate a location but rather describes the action of a doctor giving a prescription.",
    "The only suitable option that represents a place to obtain the medication is \"pharmacy.\"",
    "Verifying other options: \"doctor\" is where the prescription originates from but not where the medication is obtained.",
    "Considering all options and reasoning, it confirms that the appropriate location to retrieve antibiotics after a prescription is at the pharmacy."
