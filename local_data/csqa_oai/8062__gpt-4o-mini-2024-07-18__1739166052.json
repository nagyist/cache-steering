    "Identify the time period of interest, which is the 1920s, and the associated social movement of flappers, who were known for their distinct fashion.",
    "Recall that flappers are characterized by their dresses that typically featured a straight silhouette and were often less constricting than previous styles, promoting a sense of freedom.",
    "Consider the term \"thin shoulder straps,\" which indicates a type of garment that would be lightweight and minimalistic.",
    "From the options provided, evaluate each choice against the description of a flapper's garment.",
    "A: \"iPhone\" is a modern device and not a garment.",
    "B: \"baggage\" refers to luggage and is not related to clothing.",
    "C: \"golf bag\" is an accessory for carrying golf clubs, thus irrelevant.",
    "D: \"chemise\" is a type of women's undergarment or dress that typically has thin shoulder straps, making it fitting for the flapper style.",
    "E: \"brassiere\" is a woman's undergarment designed to support the breasts, but it does not match the description of a standalone garment like the chemise.",
    "After assessing all options, the chemise (option D) directly corresponds with the description provided in the question."
