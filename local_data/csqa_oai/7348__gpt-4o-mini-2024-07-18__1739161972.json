  "steps": [
    "The question asks where the filming location might have been recognized by the audience.",
    "The options given include specific places (A, B, E) and broader categories (C, D).",
    "Option A suggests a specific city, New York, which is a prominent filming location and known for its recognizable skyline and landmarks.",
    "Option B is more general, referring to America as a whole, which encompasses many filming locations.",
    "Option C refers to a theatre, which could be a location where films are shown, but is not traditionally where films are filmed.",
    "Option D is about movies, which again refers to the medium and not the location.",
    "Option E suggests a school, which could be a valid filming location for specific types of films but is not as widely recognized as a filming location as New York.",
    "Since the audience recognized the filming location, it would likely be somewhere iconic and well-known, such as New York.",
    "Comparing all options, New York (A) stands out as a highly recognizable filming location, while the other options are either too broad or not actual filming locations."
