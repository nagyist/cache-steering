  "query": "Question: If one wishes to dissolve their marriage by getting a divorce, who should one speak with?\n\nChoices:\nA: legal paperwork\nB: conflict\nC: marriage\nD: being married\nE: lawyer",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks who one should speak with to dissolve a marriage through divorce. This suggests the need for professional guidance.",
    "Legal paperwork alone does not provide a person to speak with; it's a process or requirement in divorce.",
    "Conflict is a potential element in divorce but does not represent a person or entity to consult.",
    "Marriage and being married describe the state of the relationship and do not indicate a party to consult for divorce.",
    "A lawyer is a professional who specializes in legal matters, including divorce, and can provide the necessary guidance and representation.",
    "Out of the given options, the one that directly relates to consulting for a divorce is a lawyer.",
    "Therefore, while other choices do exist (legal paperwork, conflict, marriage, being married), none provide a suitable point of conversation for initiating divorce.",
    "Since the question explicitly asks for someone to speak with regarding divorce, the answer must be the professional necessary to navigate this legal process."
