  "query": "Question: A person doesn't have to keep going to school to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: continue learning\nB: talk to himself\nC: cast shadow\nD: go broke\nE: cross street",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a person doesn't need to continue doing by going to school. This implies that there are alternative means to achieve the stated goal without formal education.",
    "Option A, \"continue learning,\" is a key point here. People can learn through various means other than school, such as self-study, online resources, and practical experiences.",
    "Next, consider option B, \"talk to himself.\" This does not relate to education or the need for school, as talking to oneself is a personal behavior that does not rely on formal learning.",
    "Option C, \"cast shadow,\" refers to a physical phenomenon unrelated to education. Therefore, this option is irrelevant in the context of the question.",
    "Option D, \"go broke,\" also does not connect with the need for schooling. It refers to financial status rather than learning or education.",
    "Finally, option E, \"cross street,\" again does not relate to education. While crossing the street can involve learning in terms of safety, it does not necessitate formal schooling.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that aligns with the theme of not needing school to continue is \"continue learning.\" Thus, the answer must be option A."
