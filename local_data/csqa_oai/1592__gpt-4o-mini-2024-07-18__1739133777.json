  "steps": [
    "The question states that he turned off his phone to avoid every single call.",
    "By turning off his phone, he won't be able to answer calls directly.",
    "Since he wants to avoid communication via his phone, it implies he won't be available for live conversations.",
    "The choices provided include several forms of communication that could convey messages.",
    "An \"office\" typically refers to a physical location and wouldn't be the answer because it's not a message he would relay.",
    "An \"answering machine\" is a device that records messages when someone is unavailable, but it is becoming outdated.",
    "\"Voice mail\" refers specifically to a recorded message left by callers, which aligns with the idea of avoiding direct communication.",
    "\"Telephonelines\" describe the system used to make calls, which doesn't pertain to the question about what anyone would hear from him.",
    "Lastly, \"message\" is vague and could refer to any form of communication but lacks specificity.",
    "Given the context, the best option that describes what anyone would hear from him is \"voice mail\" since it aligns with turning off the phone and avoiding calls."
