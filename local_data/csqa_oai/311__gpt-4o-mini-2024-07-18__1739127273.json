  "steps": [
    "Bob and Boris are standing in a queue, which implies they are waiting for their turn to be served at the grocery store.",
    "The line is described as being fast, meaning they are not experiencing long waiting times.",
    "However, the children in front of them are characterized as loud, which indicates that Bob and Boris might be experiencing some disturbance or distraction.",
    "The loudness from the children could lead to a negative emotional response from Bob and Boris as they are trying to wait in line.",
    "The answer choices present various emotions or states related to Bob and Boris's situation.",
    "\"Frustration\" (A) implies a feeling of annoyance, but it's not as specific to sound disturbances.",
    "\"Being annoyed\" (B) directly addresses a reaction to something bothersome, like loud noises.",
    "\"Delays\" (C) does not apply here since the line is fast.",
    "\"Irritation\" (D) is similar to being annoyed but can refer more broadly to discomfort, which can stem from noise.",
    "\"Out of order\" (E) does not pertain to the emotional state and is irrelevant to the scenario.",
    "Comparing \"being annoyed\" and \"irritation,\" both relate to Bob and Boris's reaction to the loud children, but \"being annoyed\" is more specific to their experience.",
    "Since annoyance is a direct reaction to the kids being loud, I will choose \"being annoyed.\""
