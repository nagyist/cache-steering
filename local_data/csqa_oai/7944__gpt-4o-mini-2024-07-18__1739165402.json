  "query": "Question: What plastic item can you store dairy in?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: freezer\nC: bucket\nD: refrigerator\nE: fridge",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the choices provided. We need to find a plastic item suitable for storing dairy.",
    "Starting with choice A, \"container.\" This is a general term that typically includes plastic items. Containers are commonly used to store various food items, including dairy products.",
    "Next, considering choice B, \"freezer.\" A freezer is not a plastic item; it is an appliance and cannot store dairy on its own. It is used for freezing food, including dairy, but is not what would typically hold dairy.",
    "Now, looking at choice C, \"bucket.\" A bucket can be made of plastic and can hold liquids or solids, but it is not commonly used for storing dairy items in a domestic setting. It's more associated with non-food items or for transport.",
    "Moving to choice D, \"refrigerator.\" Similar to the freezer, this is an appliance that holds dairy products but is not itself a plastic item.",
    "Finally, checking choice E, \"fridge.\" This term is synonymous with refrigerator and also refers to an appliance, not a plastic item, like a container.",
    "Evaluating the choices again, it is clear that \"container\" is the only option that fits the criteria of being a plastic item that can be used to store dairy."
