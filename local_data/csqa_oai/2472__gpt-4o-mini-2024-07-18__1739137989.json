  "query": "Question: The churchyard was the furthest east in all the contiguous states, it was located in which?\n\nChoices:\nA: country side\nB: near the ocean\nC: city\nD: michigan\nE: maine",
  "steps": [
    "Identifying the context of the question, it mentions a churchyard and specifies its location as the \"furthest east in all the contiguous states.\"",
    "The contiguous states refer to the 48 states that are located on the mainland of the United States, excluding Hawaii and Alaska.",
    "The state that is known to be the furthest east in the contiguous United States is Maine.",
    "I recall that most of Maine's geography is characterized by rural areas and portions near the ocean, but I should concentrate on the churchyard's location specifically.",
    "Looking at the options given, \"A: country side\" may refer to Maine, as it is known for its rural areas, but it does not specify the state directly.",
    "\"B: near the ocean\" also fits with Maine, which has a long coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, but again does not specify the exact nature of the location in a manner synonymous with churchyards.",
    "\"C: city\" would indicate an urban area, which is less likely to reflect the concept of a churchyard in the context of the question as churchyards are typically found in more rural settings or smaller towns.",
    "\"D: Michigan\" is not correct, as Michigan is to the west of Maine and not the furthest eastern location.",
    "Reviewing the last option, \"E: maine,\" it is the only one that explicitly names the location as the furthest east in all contiguous states.",
    "Given this elimination process, the best answer tied directly to the context of the furthest east in the contiguous states is simply Maine."
