  "query": "Question: What bounds a book?\n\nChoices:\nA: at least few page\nB: knowledge\nC: many words\nD: cover\nE: staples",
  "steps": [
    "Understanding what binds a book typically refers to its physical structure and how the contents are kept together.",
    "The most direct interpretation of \"bounds\" in the context of a book usually relates to the outer part of the book that encases its pages.",
    "Considering the choices, \"cover\" clearly refers to this outer layer that protects and holds the pages together.",
    "The other options like \"at least few pages,\" \"knowledge,\" \"many words,\" and \"staples\" do not accurately describe what distinctly bounds or encases a book.",
    "\"At least few pages\" is a vague statement, and while a book contains pages, this doesn't capture the concept of binding.",
    "\"Knowledge\" and \"many words\" describe content but do not relate to the physical structure of a book.",
    "\"Staples\" may refer to a method of binding in certain types of books (like booklets), but it's not a defining characteristic of all books.",
    "Thus, the term that best represents what physically bounds a book is \"cover.\""
