  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that both sides are presenting their arguments as if they are facts, but they are in reality expressing something less definitive.",
    "Given this context, the appropriate term to describe what they are voicing is something that reflects personal feelings or interpretations rather than objective truth.",
    "Looking at the provided answer choices, \"opinion\" (A) directly relates to a personal view or assessment, which aligns with them voicing something rather than proven truth.",
    "\"Untrue\" (C) implies that what they voiced is a falsehood, but it does not capture the essence of personal belief or how these arguments were framed as facts.",
    "\"Belief\" (D) could also potentially fit, as beliefs can be strong personal convictions, though they do not strictly refer to arguments presented as facts.",
    "\"Factfile\" (E) does not seem relevant as it refers to a compilation of factual information, whereas that\u2019s not what is happening in the argument.",
    "Both sides presenting their arguments as fact suggests they are not merely spouting objective truths but rather something more subjective; \"opinion\" is the best fit for this context.",
    "Therefore, the best choice that summarizes what they were voicing is \"opinion.\""
