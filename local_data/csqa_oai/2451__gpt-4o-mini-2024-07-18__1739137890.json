  "query": "Question: Fish have fins to move underwater, but can't walk because what?\n\nChoices:\nA: no legs\nB: they're stupid\nC: scales\nD: gills\nE: bones",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the structure of a fish's body. Fish are adapted to an aquatic environment, and this adaptation includes having fins rather than legs.",
    "Next, analyze the options given. Option A states \"no legs,\" which implies a direct reason for why fish cannot walk.",
    "Now look at option B, \"they're stupid.\" This option does not provide a valid biological or anatomical reason for fish not being able to walk and instead makes an illogical assumption about intelligence.",
    "Consider option C, \"scales.\" While fish do have scales, this feature is related to their protection and hydrodynamics, not directly to their ability to walk.",
    "Next, evaluate option D, \"gills.\" Gills are necessary for fish to extract oxygen from water, and while they are essential for life in an aquatic environment, they do not influence the inability to walk.",
    "Lastly, look at option E, \"bones.\" Fish have bones, but the structure of their skeletons, including the absence of legs, is what makes them suitable for swimming rather than walking.",
    "Having considered all the options, it is clear that the reason fish can't walk is primarily due to their anatomical structure, specifically the absence of legs."
