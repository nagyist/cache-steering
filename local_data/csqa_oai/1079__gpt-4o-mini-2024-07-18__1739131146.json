  "query": "Question: What is a computer unable to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: process information\nB: cast shadow\nC: crash\nD: make decisions\nE: become sensible",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the capabilities of a computer. A computer is specifically designed to process information, so option A is not something it is unable to do.",
    "Next, we consider option B - casting a shadow. Since computers are physical objects made of materials that can block light, they can cast a shadow. Therefore, option B is also not something a computer is unable to do.",
    "For option C, crashing refers to a failure in computing where a program or operating system stops functioning correctly. Computers are indeed capable of crashing, making option C something that a computer can do, not something it is unable to do.",
    "Turning to option D, making decisions, we note that while computers can simulate decision-making through algorithms and programming, they do not truly make decisions in the way humans do, as they lack consciousness and subjective understanding. Thus, they are limited in this capacity.",
    "Finally, examining option E, becoming sensible, computers cannot attain sensibility or consciousness, as they operate purely on logic and programming without the ability to have subjective experiences or emotions.",
    "Comparing options D and E, option D (\"make decisions\") indicates that computers can simulate decision-making to some degree, while option E indicates an intrinsic inability since computers cannot develop sensibility. Both seem plausible, but we are looking for the most definitive answer.",
    "Upon further reflection, the more accurate choice would seem to be option E, as no matter what programming or algorithms are utilized, a computer cannot ever \"become sensible\" in any human-like sense."
