  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a location where someone would bring you a cup, implying a social or service-oriented context.",
    "I will consider the purpose of a cup, which is typically to hold beverages, often consumed in a social setting or during a meal.",
    "Among the choices, a \"restaurant\" is a place specifically designed for serving food and drinks, which fits the scenario of bringing a cup.",
    "An \"apartment\" could also be a place where a cup might be brought, but it suggests a more private setting rather than a formal serving scenario.",
    "A \"closet\" is not a suitable option because it is a storage space and does not imply a location for service or social interactions involving drinks.",
    "A \"table\" is a place where cups might be placed after being brought, but it does not indicate where they are brought from, making it less likely to be the answer.",
    "A \"party\" could be a context where cups are served, but it is not definitive and varies widely in setting, making it less specific compared to a restaurant.",
    "Comparing all choices, \"restaurant\" stands out as the most probable location where someone would actively bring you a cup, as it is a common service in restaurants.",
    "Therefore, based on the reasoning, the best option for where someone would bring you a cup is a restaurant."
