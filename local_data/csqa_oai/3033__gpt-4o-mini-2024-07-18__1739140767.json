  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what ballet dancing represents in an artistic context.",
    "Ballet dancing is known for its expressive movements and storytelling through dance.",
    "The term that best fits the description of ballet as an art form involves conveying feelings, emotions, or ideas through performance.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"expression\" relates closely to what ballet communicates artistically.",
    "Choices A (\"swan lake\") and B (\"intercourse\") are not suitable in this context.",
    "Choices D (\"become tired\") and E (\"fatigue\") refer to physical states, not artistic representations.",
    "Thus, the only option that correctly identifies ballet dancing as a form of artistic representation is \"expression.\""
