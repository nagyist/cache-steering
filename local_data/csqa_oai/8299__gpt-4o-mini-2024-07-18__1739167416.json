  "query": "Question: Sam intentionally lost his tickets.  He didn't want to listen to people singing all night. Where was Sam going?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera\nB: movies\nC: train station\nD: race track\nE: work",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the statement about Sam intentionally losing his tickets. This suggests that he had tickets to an event or venue that typically involves people singing.",
    "Next, I should consider the nature of the events associated with each choice. An opera is known for singing, movies typically do not involve live singing, a train station is not an entertainment venue, a race track does not involve singing, and work generally does not involve singing either.",
    "Given that people singing all night is a significant indicator, I can eliminate the options where singing is not a main feature. This includes movies (B), train station (C), race track (D), and work (E).",
    "This leaves me with opera (A) as the sole option that matches the context of people singing, especially for a prolonged period like \"all night.\"",
    "Since Sam intentionally lost his tickets to avoid listening to singing, it aligns perfectly with the nature of an opera, which often features performances that can last several hours.",
    "I will double-check my logic: opera involves singing, and it\u2019s a type of event that may not be appealing to someone who dislikes singing.",
    "All other options have been ruled out based on the context provided and the behavior exhibited by Sam."
