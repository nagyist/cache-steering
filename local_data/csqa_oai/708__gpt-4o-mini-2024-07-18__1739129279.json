  "query": "Question: James used the cannon to shoot at something while seeking lunch. It was overkill.  What did he shoot at?\n\nChoices:\nA: body armor\nB: ungulate\nC: bomber\nD: kill people\nE: animal",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that James used a cannon to shoot at something while seeking lunch.",
    "Using a cannon to shoot at something suggests a significant amount of firepower, typically associated with larger targets rather than smaller ones used for lunch.",
    "The term \"overkill\" indicates that the weapon used was excessively powerful for the task at hand, which is finding lunch.",
    "The options provided include \"body armor,\" \"ungulate,\" \"bomber,\" \"kill people,\" and \"animal.\"",
    "\"Body armor\" does not fit in the context of seeking lunch, as it refers to protective gear rather than a target.",
    "\"Bomber\" typically refers to military aircraft designed to drop bombs, which seems unrelated to seeking lunch.",
    "\"Killing people\" is a vague option that does not provide a specific target and is inappropriate in the context of lunch.",
    "\"Ungulate\" refers to a hoofed mammal, which could be a target for hunting for lunch.",
    "\"Animal\" is also a broad option that could encompass various types of creatures, including ungulates.",
    "Comparing \"ungulate\" and \"animal,\" \"ungulate\" offers a more specific target that fits the context of hunting for food."
