  "query": "Question: When James flew to see his sister across the country, the first thing he looked for was a bar.   Where might Jame's sister have lived?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: salon\nC: michigan\nD: nightclub\nE: public house",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that James flew to see his sister across the country, suggesting a significant distance between him and his sister.",
    "James's choice to look for a bar first implies he is seeking a place to relax or socialize after his flight, which could indicate he is landing in a location that is urban or has nightlife options.",
    "Examining the possible answers, options A, D, and E are all places associated with social or drinking establishments, which might imply a more urban location.",
    "Option A (airport) is less likely since it is not a place where one typically seeks a bar for relaxation as a primary destination; it's a transit point.",
    "Options D (nightclub) and E (public house) suggest social venues but do not point toward a geographical location where someone might live.",
    "Option C (Michigan) is a state that could be considered as having urban areas where bars and nightlife exist, particularly in cities like Detroit or Grand Rapids.",
    "Considering the context and the nature of James's journey, Michigan makes sense as it has a broad geography, accommodating various bar cultures.",
    "Concluding from the choices, C (Michigan) clearly represents a location where James's sister could live while also fitting the context of him searching for a bar after flying."
