  "query": "Question: The cut was deep, the doctor had to use stitches in doing what the sides?\n\nChoices:\nA: joining\nB: put together\nC: paste\nD: heal\nE: paste",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the sentence indicates that the doctor is performing a procedure to close the wound caused by the deep cut.",
    "The phrase \"had to use stitches\" implies a process of connecting the edges of the cut in order to facilitate healing.",
    "The use of the word \"doing what\" suggests that we need to find a term that describes the action of bringing the sides of the cut together.",
    "Now, we evaluate the choices:\n- A: joining - This implies bringing things together, which fits the context.\n- B: put together - This also means to connect, which is relevant.\n- C: paste - Although it implies sticking together, it is not the most accurate term for stitching.\n- D: heal - This describes the process following stitching but does not match the action of stitching itself.\n- E: paste - This is a repeat of option C.",
    "Between the options, A and B specifically imply the action of bringing the sides of the cut together to close it.",
    "Further analysis shows that \"joining\" is a more formal and appropriate term for the medical context than \"put together.\"",
    "Thus, the best choice that best describes the action in the context of stitching a cut is A: joining."
