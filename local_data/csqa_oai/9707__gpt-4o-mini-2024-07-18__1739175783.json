  "query": "Question: Washing hands too often can cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: health\nB: dry skin\nC: pink hands\nD: become wet\nE: wet floor",
  "steps": [
    "Washing hands too often typically refers to a practice where individuals clean their hands more frequently than recommended for hygiene.",
    "Excessive handwashing can strip the skin of its natural oils, which are important for maintaining healthy skin.",
    "This stripping of natural oils can lead to a condition known as \"dry skin,\" which is characterized by flaking, itching, and irritation.",
    "While some might assume that pink hands could be a concern, it usually relates more to temporary redness or irritation, which isn\u2019t as common as dry skin from frequent washing.",
    "The conditions \"wet floor,\" \"become wet,\" and the overall impact on \"health\" are not directly relevant to the primary concern that arises specifically from frequent handwashing.",
    "Considering the impact of excessive washing and its well-known side effect, it seems clear that the most accurate answer is related to skin condition.",
    "Of the options available, \"dry skin\" is the most directly linked to the problem posed in the question.",
    "Thus, I will confirm that frequent handwashing primarily leads to dry skin as a significant and common consequence."
