  "query": "Question: Where do you see signs that give direction while moving fast?\n\nChoices:\nA: freeway\nB: fork in road\nC: demonstration\nD: jogging\nE: state park",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the choices to identify which ones typically exhibit directional signs intended for guiding fast-moving individuals.",
    "The freeway is specifically designed for high-speed travel and has numerous signs indicating directions, exits, and upcoming interchanges, making it a primary candidate.",
    "A fork in the road does provide a decision point, but it is often accompanied by fewer directional signs as compared to a freeway and is not necessarily for fast movement.",
    "A demonstration typically involves a gathering of people and does not commonly provide directional signs for fast movement, so it is unlikely to be the correct option.",
    "Jogging usually takes place on sidewalks or paths where signs might indicate distance or caution but not specifically for navigation in a high-speed context.",
    "A state park may have some informational signs, but they are not oriented toward high-speed travel. Instead, they serve recreational users, making it less likely to be the correct answer.",
    "Given that the freeway is designed for vehicles traveling at high speeds and has many directional signs, this reinforces the idea that it is the best fitting option.",
    "I briefly reassess the other options and confirm that none provide as clear a focus on directional signs for fast-moving traffic as the freeway does.",
    "Thus, based on all these considerations, the freeway stands out as the most appropriate answer."
