  "query": "Question: Where can a person use pencils to keep score?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: cabinet\nC: backpack\nD: bowling alley\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand where pencils are commonly used for scorekeeping.",
    "Pencils are often used in places where people keep track of numerical data, such as scores in games or tests.",
    "Now I'll consider the options one by one to see which locations make sense for scorekeeping with pencils.",
    "A restaurant usually involves ordering food and doesn't typically involve scorekeeping, so A is unlikely.",
    "A cabinet is just a storage space and does not provide a setting where scorekeeping occurs, making B an unlikely choice.",
    "A backpack is a personal item for carrying things and wouldn't generally be used for active scorekeeping, so C doesn't fit well.",
    "A bowling alley is a place where scores are actively kept track of while playing, often using scoresheets and pencils, making D a strong candidate.",
    "Finally, classrooms often involve tests or exercises where pencils are used to keep scores, which could also make E a viable option.",
    "However, since a bowling alley provides a context solely focused on keeping scores with specific games, it stands out compared to a general classroom setting."
