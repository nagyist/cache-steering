    "Next, consider common locations where tools, especially power tools like drills, are usually stored.",
    "A basement may be a potential storage location, but it is not the most common one for tools if a garage is available.",
    "A dentist office is unlikely to store a drill, as it pertains to dental work rather than construction or repairs.",
    "While a bathroom might have small tools or kits, it is not a typical place for storing a drill.",
    "A repair shop is a logical place for a drill, but it is more specific than a general storage location for personal tools.",
