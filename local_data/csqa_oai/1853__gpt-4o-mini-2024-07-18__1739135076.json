  "query": "Question: The person forgot to put a lid on the garbage, raccoons knocked all of it out of the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: composted\nC: nice aroma\nD: smell terrible\nE: smells bad",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a situation where garbage has been knocked out and it specifies that the garbage fell out because the person forgot to use a lid.",
    "The word \"garbage\" typically refers to waste that is often placed in a container for disposal. This suggests that the garbage was in some type of receptacle.",
    "Out of the provided answer choices, \"container\" clearly indicates a receptacle where garbage would be stored, which aligns with the context of the situation.",
    "The other options, such as \"composted\", \"nice aroma\", \"smell terrible\", and \"smells bad,\" do not logically relate to the action of raccoons knocking garbage out since they refer to states or qualities rather than objects.",
    "Considering the context where raccoons are involved, they would realistically be interacting with a \"container\" that holds the garbage, rather than anything regarding smells.",
    "The phrase \"knocked all of it out\" implies that something was indeed holding the garbage, which reinforces that it was a \"container\".",
    "Since we've established what the situation involves, and we've identified that the correct term from the choices is an object where garbage is typically stored, we can confidently assert that the answer is \"container\"."
