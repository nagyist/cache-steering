  "query": "Question: Where might an army captain be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: airplane cabin\nB: basketball team\nC: military\nD: battleship\nE: fleet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the title \"army captain.\" An army captain is a rank within the military, specifically in an army setting.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. The first choice is \"airplane cabin,\" which does not typically relate to the role of an army captain.",
    "The second choice is \"basketball team.\" This context does not relate to military ranks or positions.",
    "The third choice is \"military.\" This is directly related to the army captain's position, as they serve in the military.",
    "The fourth choice is \"battleship.\" While this could relate to a naval context, the term \"army\" specifically refers to land forces rather than naval forces.",
    "The fifth choice is \"fleet,\" which again pertains to naval forces rather than an army; thus, it is less relevant for an army captain.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, \"military\" (choice C) is clearly the most appropriate option where an army captain can be found, as they are part of the military structure."
