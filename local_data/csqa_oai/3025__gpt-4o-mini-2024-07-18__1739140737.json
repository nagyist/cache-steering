  "query": "Question: The eloquent performance was stunning, it left everybody what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stuttering\nB: stumbling\nC: speechless\nD: muttering\nE: astounded",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes an eloquent performance that is described as stunning. This implies it had a significant impact on the audience.",
    "We need to find a word that correctly completes the sentence in a way that reflects the audience's reaction to the performance.",
    "Looking at the options: \n- A: stuttering, suggests difficulty in speaking, which isn't a suitable reaction to a stunning performance.\n- B: stumbling, implies a lack of coordination or understanding, which also doesn't fit well.\n- C: speechless, means being unable to speak, usually due to being overwhelmed, which aligns with a strong emotional reaction.\n- D: muttering, indicates quiet speaking, typically as an expression of dissatisfaction or confusion, not fitting here.\n- E: astounded, means being greatly surprised or impressed, which could fit but doesn\u2019t imply a lack of speech.",
    "Among the choices, 'speechless' conveys the idea that the audience was so impressed that they couldn't find words to express their feelings, which is a common response to a truly stunning performance.",
    "While 'astounded' could also make sense, it does not carry the same implication of silence or inability to speak as 'speechless' does.",
    "Thus, the best option that fits the sentence contextually and thematically is 'speechless.'"
