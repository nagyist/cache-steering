  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what it means for a solution to get warm. In a chemistry context, this can often be related to an exothermic reaction, where heat is released during a chemical process.",
    "Next, we consider the choices given. \"Pleasure\" (A) does not directly relate to a chemical reaction or a physical change. It is more subjective and does not explain the phenomenon of a solution getting warm.",
    "\"Global warming\" (B) refers to a long-term increase in Earth's average temperature and is not specific to the observation of a warm solution in a lab or kitchen context.",
    "\"Starting fire\" (C) suggests an active process that could lead to heat, but this does not necessarily explain the warming of a solution unless combustion is involved, which is not specified in the question.",
    "\"Increase of temperature\" (D) aligns with the observation of a solution becoming warm, as it suggests that the thermal energy within the solution is increasing.",
    "\"Feeling comfortable\" (E) implies a subjective experience which again does not directly relate to the physical property of a solution getting warm.",
    "Given that the question specifically asks for the expected consequence of a solution getting warm, the most direct and accurate answer relates to an increase in temperature.",
    "Therefore, option D clearly explains the expected consequence of the solution warming up, as it defines the process that is happening."
