  "query": "Question: Where would you find a container full of rice?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: pantry\nC: pot\nD: closet\nE: kitchens",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general uses and features of each location given in the choices.",
    "A refrigerator is typically used to store perishable items, so it is unlikely to be a common place for a container full of rice.",
    "A pantry is a storage space specifically designed for non-perishable food items, where rice would likely be stored.",
    "A pot is used for cooking and is not a common storage place for rice unless it is prepared food.",
    "A closet generally holds clothing, household items, or miscellaneous storage, making it an unlikely spot for food storage.",
    "Kitchens are areas where food is prepared and may contain storage spaces like pantries or cabinets.",
    "However, the question specifically asks for a container full of rice, which fits better in a pantry rather than just a kitchen in general.",
    "Analyzing the reasoning, between pantry and kitchen, the pantry directly relates to food storage, specifically for dry goods like rice.",
    "Thus, out of the choices, a pantry is the most appropriate location for finding a container full of rice."
