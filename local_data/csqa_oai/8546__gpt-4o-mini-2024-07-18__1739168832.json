  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a specific type of snack food and ice cream shaped like a mouse.",
    "It's likely that snacks shaped like a mouse would be thematic and possibly found in a place associated with entertainment or children.",
    "Among the options, Disneyland is known for its themed food that often includes character shapes, including Mickey Mouse.",
    "A kitchen could have mice-shaped snacks if someone made them there, but it's not a guaranteed place to find them.",
    "The term \"underground\" does not typically relate to snack food or ice cream.",
    "A space shuttle would not have snack foods specifically formed in the shape of a mouse, as space travel typically focuses on nutrition and practicality rather than themed foods.",
    "A friend's house could potentially have themed snacks, but it would depend on the friend and is less likely than a public place like Disneyland.",
    "Considering all the factors, Disneyland seems like the most appropriate choice for finding mouse-shaped snacks and ice cream."
