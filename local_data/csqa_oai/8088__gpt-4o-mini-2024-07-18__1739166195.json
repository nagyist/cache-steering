  "query": "Question: Where is a jellyfish not likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: pacific ocean\nB: store\nC: atlantic ocean\nD: indian ocean\nE: japanese restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of a jellyfish. Jellyfish typically live in oceanic waters, including regions like the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean.",
    "Next, evaluate the options that represent locations where jellyfish are naturally found. Options A, C, and D are all bodies of water where jellyfish can exist.",
    "Now, look at options B and E, which represent commercial establishments. A store is a place where consumer goods are sold, and a Japanese restaurant is where food is served. These locations are not natural habitats for jellyfish.",
    "Since jellyfish cannot survive outside of water or in environments designed for human activity (like stores or restaurants), we can eliminate choices A, C, and D as locations where jellyfish commonly occur.",
    "Among the remaining options, a store (B) is a general location that specifically does not cater to marine life, whereas, a Japanese restaurant (E) could potentially serve jellyfish as food but does not imply the presence of live jellyfish.",
    "However, a store is the most definitive location where jellyfish are least likely to be found, given that it serves no purpose for their existence.",
    "Thus, comparing the options, B stands out as the most appropriate choice for where a jellyfish is not likely to be."
