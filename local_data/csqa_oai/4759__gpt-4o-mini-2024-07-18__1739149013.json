    "\"Headache\" also refers to a physical condition and does not connect with dietary restrictions.",
    "\"Have no home\" does not relate to dietary conditions at all; instead, it concerns housing or homelessness.",
    "\"Shameful\" is an emotional or moral judgment and is not a term that describes dietary restrictions.",
