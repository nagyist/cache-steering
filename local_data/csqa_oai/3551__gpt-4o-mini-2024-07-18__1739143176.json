  "query": "Question: Why would someone visit many stores before buying products?\n\nChoices:\nA: online shopping\nB: running out of money\nC: debt\nD: comparison shopping\nE: overstocking",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the reasoning behind visiting multiple stores before making a purchase.",
    "One common reason for visiting many stores is to compare prices and products, which suggests the consumer is looking for the best deal.",
    "The options provided include different potential motivations for shopping behavior.",
    "Option A, online shopping, does not fit because the context implies physical store visits, not online transactions.",
    "Option B, running out of money, does not logically explain why someone would visit multiple stores; in fact, it might discourage shopping altogether.",
    "Option C, debt, also does not provide a clear motivation for visiting multiple stores, as it suggests a financial constraint rather than an active shopping behavior.",
    "Option E, overstocking, implies buying too much but does not directly associate with visiting multiple stores before buying.",
    "Option D, comparison shopping, specifically aligns with the behavior of visiting many stores to evaluate different products and prices before making a final decision.",
    "Upon reviewing all the options, comparison shopping (D) is the most reasonable answer to the question asked."
