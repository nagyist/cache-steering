  "query": "Question: Boats that aren't on the ocean travel across the surface of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: lake\nB: ocean\nC: tetrahedron\nD: mirror\nE: object",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the surfaces that boats, which are typically used on water, travel across when they are not on the ocean.",
    "The term \"boats\" generally refers to watercraft that are designed to navigate various bodies of water.",
    "Since the question specifies that these boats are not on the ocean, we need to explore other common types of water bodies where boats might be used.",
    "The choices given allow us to consider various surfaces: lakes, oceans, a tetrahedron (which is a geometric shape), mirrors, and objects in general.",
    "Choice B (ocean) can be eliminated because the question specifies \"not on the ocean.\"",
    "Choice C (tetrahedron) does not make sense as it's not a body of water where boats travel.",
    "Choice D (mirror) also does not fit because a mirror does not represent a body of water.",
    "Choice E (object) is vague; almost anything is an object, and it's not indicative of a water surface.",
    "This leaves us with choice A (lake), which is a common type of water body where boats can travel.",
    "Lakes are indeed suitable surfaces for boats when they are not in the ocean."
