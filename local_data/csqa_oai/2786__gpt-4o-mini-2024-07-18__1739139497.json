  "query": "Question: They prided themselves on being a wealth of knowledge, and that's why many chose to attend their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: book store\nB: university\nC: meeting\nD: class\nE: encyclopedia",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"wealth of knowledge\" suggests that the entity in question is associated with learning or education.",
    "This hints at a setting where knowledge is shared or taught, which would not likely refer to a bookstore or encyclopedia, as those are more static sources of information.",
    "Among the given choices, \"university,\" \"meeting,\" and \"class\" are all potential venues for the sharing of knowledge.",
    "A \"university\" is a large institution focused on higher education, which aligns well with the concept of a wealth of knowledge.",
    "A \"class\" also serves as a venue for knowledge, typically focused on a specific subject and taught in smaller settings.",
    "A \"meeting,\" while it can involve the sharing of knowledge, is usually more about discussion and decision-making than structured learning.",
    "Comparing the two educational options, the term \"wealth of knowledge\" implies a broader, more extensive form of learning typically associated with universities rather than classes.",
    "Thus, the most fitting choice is \"university,\" as it implies a significant source of knowledge and education.",
    "While \"class\" could also fit, it doesn\u2019t capture the full breadth suggested by \"wealth of knowledge.\""
