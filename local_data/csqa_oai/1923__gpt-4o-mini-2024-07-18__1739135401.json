  "query": "Question: Justin couldn't dance long because he experienced what?\n\nChoices:\nA: meeting people\nB: having fun\nC: fatigue\nD: manual\nE: become tired",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the reason Justin couldn't dance for a long time. We need to identify which option suggests a limitation related to physical ability or energy.",
    "A: \"meeting people\" does not correlate with a limitation to dancing; it's more of a social activity.",
    "B: \"having fun\" implies enjoyment rather than a reason for stopping; it suggests he is engaged, not hindered.",
    "C: \"fatigue\" indicates a lack of energy, which is a direct reason one might not be able to dance for an extended period.",
    "D: \"manual\" does not seem relevant at all to the context of dancing or a limitation.",
    "E: \"become tired\" also indicates a lack of energy, which is similar to fatigue. However, it is more of a description rather than an absolute reason for not being able to dance long.",
    "Now I need to compare options C and E. While both indicate reasons related to energy levels, \"fatigue\" is more specific and commonly used to describe the inability to continue physical activity.",
    "Evaluating the options, \"fatigue\" (C) accurately covers Justin's inability to dance for a long time due to energy depletion."
