  "query": "Question: He felt embarrassed he spilled his soup bowl, he knew the waiter who had to clean it up because he was at his favorite what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: restaurant\nC: apartment\nD: dishwasher\nE: washing machine",
  "steps": [
    "The situation describes a person feeling embarrassed about spilling soup, which suggests a social setting where such an incident could be awkward.",
    "The fact that the person knows the waiter indicates familiarity, which is commonly found in places with repeated patronage, such as a restaurant.",
    "The mention of a soup bowl further supports a dining context, which aligns with eating establishments like restaurants rather than a cabinet, apartment, or kitchen appliances.",
    "I should analyze each of the options: \n- A: cabinet doesn\u2019t fit as it\u2019s not a place for eating or serving food. \n- B: restaurant makes sense as a place where one might spill soup and be served by a waiter.\n- C: apartment could be a private space but doesn\u2019t typically involve a waiter unless it's a specific scenario, which is less common.\n- D and E: dishwasher and washing machine are not relevant to the context of spilling soup and feeling embarrassed.",
    "Given the context of spilling soup, feeling embarrassment, and the presence of a waiter, the most logical answer is related to dining out.",
    "The repeated references to social interactions with the waiter strongly suggest that the favorite place he was at is indeed a restaurant."
