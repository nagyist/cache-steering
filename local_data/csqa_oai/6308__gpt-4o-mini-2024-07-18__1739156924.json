  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the choices provided to identify what commonly has holes in it.",
    "Choice A: Cookies can sometimes have holes (like if they are broken), but it's not a defining characteristic.",
    "Choice B: Notebook paper can have holes, especially if it's perforated or three-ring binder paper, but again, not all types have holes.",
    "Choice C: Walls typically do not have holes, unless they are damaged or intentionally created (like for windows or doors).",
    "Choice D: Swiss cheese is famously known for having holes as part of its characteristic.",
    "Choice E: The ground can have holes (like in the case of burrows or pits), but this depends on the specific area and is not a constant.",
    "Among these, the one that consistently has holes as a defining characteristic is Swiss cheese.",
    "I will conclude that Swiss cheese (choice D) is the best answer based on the evidence."
