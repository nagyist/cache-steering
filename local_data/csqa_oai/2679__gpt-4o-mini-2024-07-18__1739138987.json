  "query": "Question: What do most people often feel before meeting new people?\n\nChoices:\nA: being bored\nB: making new friends\nC: love\nD: anxiety\nE: happy",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotions people typically experience in social situations, especially ones that are new or unfamiliar.",
    "Many individuals feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension before meeting new people. It's essential to identify which of these emotions is more prevalent.",
    "Evaluate the feeling of excitement; while it can be present, it often doesn't dominate pre-meeting feelings for everyone.",
    "Anxiety is a common and natural response to uncertainty and the possibility of social judgment when meeting someone new.",
    "Think about how anxiety can manifest: sweaty palms, increased heart rate, and may make individuals second-guess their social skills or how they will be perceived.",
    "In contrast, feelings like love or happiness may occur, but they are less common before an initial meeting.",
    "Being bored typically doesn\u2019t apply to the situation of meeting new people, as this scenario is generally perceived as engaging or stimulating.",
    "Among the choices, A (being bored) and C (love) do not align with the usual pre-meeting emotions.",
    "B (making new friends) could be an outcome but does not capture the emotional state before the meeting itself and is more future-oriented.",
    "After analyzing these emotions and their relevance to meeting new people, anxiety stands out as the most commonly felt emotion before such encounters."
