  "query": "Question: Joe crossed the half court boundary and focused on 3 pointers.  What game is his playing?\n\nChoices:\nA: society\nB: sporting event\nC: football\nD: atlas or map\nE: basketball",
  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that crossing the half court boundary is a term commonly associated with basketball, as it is a critical part of the rules of the game.",
    "Next, I notice that Joe is focusing on 3-pointers. In basketball, a 3-pointer is a shot taken from beyond the three-point line, which is another specific element of the game.",
    "I consider the other choices provided. \"Society\" does not pertain to a specific game, and \"sporting event\" is a broad term that does not specify which type is being referred to.",
    "The choice \"football\" refers to a different sport that does not use the half court boundary or 3-pointers.",
    "The choice \"atlas or map\" also does not relate to any type of athletic game at all.",
    "Having eliminated options A, B, C, and D, I am left with option E: basketball.",
    "The specific terms used (half court and 3-pointers) confirm that the context is indeed basketball.",
    "After carefully considering all options and reasoning through each one, I affirm that the only applicable game to Joe's actions is basketball."
