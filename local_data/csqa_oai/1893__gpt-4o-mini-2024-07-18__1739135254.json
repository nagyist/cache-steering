  "query": "Question: The horse had given so many rides that day, that they didn't know where to find him except where his favorite toy was next to his dinner and bed?\n\nChoices:\nA: found in stall\nB: farmhouse\nC: doing farm work\nD: ridden\nE: found on ranch",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes a horse that has given many rides and notes the location of his favorite toy in relation to his dinner and bed.",
    "The horse's favorite toy being next to his dinner and bed suggests that he is likely in a comfortable and familiar environment.",
    "Since horses are usually kept in stalls or barns near their food and toys, this indicates that the horse is probably resting or staying close to home rather than out doing tasks or rides.",
    "Exploring the options provided: \n- A: found in stall - aligns with the context of a resting horse.\n- B: farmhouse - not the best match since the main focus is on where the horse is, not a building.\n- C: doing farm work - contradicts the idea of the horse resting as he has given many rides already.\n- D: ridden - means the horse is actively being used, which doesn't align with the description of the horse\u2019s state.\n- E: found on ranch - while possible, it is less specific than the stall option.",
    "The most logical and specific option that directly correlates with the horse being nearby where he eats and plays is option A."
