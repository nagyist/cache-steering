  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a way to look up a business number without electricity.",
    "Given that electricity is not available, using electronic devices such as smartphones or computers is not an option.",
    "A telephone book is a physical directory that contains business contact information and can be used without any electronic device.",
    "The other options can be analyzed to rule them out:",
    "A power grid refers to the electrical system, and thus, is irrelevant when there is no electricity.",
    "An equation or math problem involves calculations and requires logical reasoning or electronic help to solve, which is not applicable here.",
    "A roulette wheel is a gambling device and does not serve as a resource for looking up business information.",
    "Since the only viable option that allows for looking up business numbers in a non-electrical scenario is the telephone book, this must be the correct answer."
