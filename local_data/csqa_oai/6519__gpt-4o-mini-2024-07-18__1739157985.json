  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider where humans typically spend most of their time. This includes places like homes, workplaces, and various modes of transport such as buses.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices that involve specific types of locations: \n- A bus is a common mode of transportation.\n- An apartment building is a common type of residence.",
    "Continuing the evaluation, consider the space shuttle. While it is designed for human travel, few humans actually travel in space compared to the population that uses buses or lives in apartment buildings.",
    "Now look at the solar system. It is not a physical location one travels to directly, but rather the area encompassing various celestial bodies, and humans do not go there presently.",
    "Next, consider the possibility of going \"inside Earth.\u201d While humans have dug deep into the Earth, actual exploration or habitation is extremely limited compared to other locations.",
    "Reflecting on the frequency of travel, suggest that most people do not go to space shuttles often, as this requires special circumstances such as space missions which are rare for the general public.",
    "Now, compare the more common locations (bus and apartment building) against the less commonly accessed locations (space shuttle, solar system, and inside Earth).",
    "Among these, the space shuttle and solar system stand out as locations humans do not access frequently. However, a space shuttle is an actual vehicle used for transport to space, while the solar system is more of an expansive area that we typically don't visit.",
    "Deciding between the space shuttle and solar system, while acknowledging both are infrequently traveled, it is clear that the solar system represents a broader concept and we do not \"go\" there directly.",
    "Thus, we conclude that humans do not often go to the solar system as it is beyond current travel capabilities for regular human activity."
