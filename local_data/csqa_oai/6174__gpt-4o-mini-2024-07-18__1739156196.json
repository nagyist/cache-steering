  "query": "Question: Where do you change lanes while in a car?\n\nChoices:\nA: bowling alley\nB: street\nC: highway\nD: grocery store\nE: rural countryside",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what changing lanes means in the context of driving. Changing lanes typically occurs on roads where there are multiple lanes of traffic moving in the same direction.",
    "Next, I examine each option given to see where lane changes are most commonly appropriate.",
    "Option A: bowling alley is not a location where cars drive or change lanes; it is a recreational facility.",
    "Option B: street may involve changing lanes, especially in urban environments, as streets often have multiple lanes.",
    "Option C: highway is specifically designed for high-speed travel with multiple lanes, making changing lanes a common action for vehicles merging, overtaking, or positioning themselves for exits.",
    "Option D: grocery store primarily involves parking lots and internal driveways, where lane changes are not applicable in the same sense as on a street or highway.",
    "Option E: rural countryside can have roads, but these are often one-lane or unmarked, making lane changes less common compared to highways.",
    "Based on my analysis, the ideal location to change lanes among all these options is the highway, as it directly involves multiple lanes intended for this purpose."
