    "The question asks about a common characteristic of people who wrestle.",
    "Wrestling generally requires physical attributes and skills.",
    "Among these attributes, physical strength is a significant factor in wrestling.",
    "Each choice can be analyzed to find the most relevant answer.",
    "Choice A, \"train yourself,\" is more about a process than a characteristic.",
    "Choice B, \"have strength,\" is somewhat vague and not a complete statement.",
    "Choice C, \"choke hold,\" refers to a technique rather than a descriptive characteristic of wrestlers.",
    "Choice D, \"strong,\" directly indicates the physical strength of wrestlers, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Choice E, \"take lessons,\" refers to the learning aspect, which is also important, but not as direct as strength.",
    "Comparing the most relevant options, \"strong\" (D) provides a clear and concise description of many wrestlers."
