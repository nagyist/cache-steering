  "query": "Question: Where are student likely to utilize a parking structure?\n\nChoices:\nA: college campus\nB: mall\nC: big city\nD: behind the garage.\nE: chicago",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider where students typically attend classes. A college campus is a common environment for students.",
    "Next, parking structures are often placed near educational institutions to accommodate the parking needs of students who drive to campus.",
    "Shopping centers like malls can also have parking structures, but they are more frequented by shoppers than students specifically.",
    "In big cities, there are usually parking structures available, but they may not be specifically utilized primarily by students; various groups may use them.",
    "\"Behind the garage\" does not refer to any public parking structure and is quite specific, which makes it less relevant to students.",
    "Looking at \"Chicago,\" while it is a big city with parking structures, the question asks about general cases, not a specific location.",
    "Considering the best collective option where students are likely to specifically utilize a parking structure, a college campus clearly stands out.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer focusing solely on the pattern of student parking tendencies points to a college campus."
