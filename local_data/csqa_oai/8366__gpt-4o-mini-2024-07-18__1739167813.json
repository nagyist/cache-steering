  "query": "Question: What would you use to see a clip?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk drawer\nB: woman's hair\nC: scissors\nD: television show\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that can help you see a clip, which suggests it should be related to viewing or video content.",
    "Looking at the options, A: desk drawer, B: woman's hair, and E: office building do not relate to viewing content directly.",
    "Next, consider option C: scissors. Scissors do not help you see something; they are used for cutting.",
    "Now evaluate option D: television show. A television show can include clips, and you would watch it on a television or a streaming service.",
    "Since option D pertains directly to viewing clips, it seems to be the most logical choice.",
    "No other options come close to providing the ability to see a clip in a conventional sense.",
    "Thus, I will choose option D as the final answer."
