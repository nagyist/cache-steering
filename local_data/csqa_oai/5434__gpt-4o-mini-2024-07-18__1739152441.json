  "query": "Question: Where would you find teeth whitening bleachers?\n\nChoices:\nA: gymnasium\nB: soccer game\nC: sporting event\nD: pharmacy\nE: soccer game",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"teeth whitening bleachers\" refers to. The term \"bleachers\" typically refers to a type of seating found in sports venues, but combined with \"teeth whitening,\" it suggests that this might be a product related to dental care.",
    "Next, I will consider the context in which teeth whitening products are commonly available. Typically, items related to personal care and dental hygiene can be found in pharmacies or stores that sell health and beauty products.",
    "Now, let's analyze the given choices. A gymnasium (A) and sporting events (C and E) are not typically associated with dental care products and do not usually sell such items.",
    "Next, I will look at choice D, which is a pharmacy. It is common for pharmacies to stock dental care products, including teeth whitening kits or bleachers.",
    "Considering all the options, \"gymnasium,\" \"soccer game,\" and \"sporting event\" imply places where sports are played, not products for dental care.",
    "Since the only option that suggests a place where health and beauty products, including dental items, can be sold is \"pharmacy,\" I can conclude that this is likely the correct answer.",
    "After confirming that other choices (A, B, C, and E) do not fit the context of finding teeth whitening products, I will finalize my answer."
