  "query": "Question: What term would be used when a student is taught by their family?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: university\nC: homeschool\nD: parents school\nE: ask questions",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a term that describes the situation where a student is taught by their family.",
    "The term should reflect an educational context provided by family members, rather than a traditional educational setting.",
    "Option A, \"classroom,\" refers to a physical space where formal education occurs, typically not within the family.",
    "Option B, \"university,\" indicates a higher education institution attended by students after secondary education, again not related to family teaching.",
    "Option C, \"homeschool,\" directly refers to an educational practice where parents or family members educate their children at home, fitting the description perfectly.",
    "Option D, \"parents school,\" is not a commonly accepted term; \"homeschool\" is the standard terminology.",
    "Option E, \"ask questions,\" describes an action rather than a learning method or setting.",
    "Upon evaluating all options, \"homeschool\" clearly stands out as the correct term denoting family-based education."
