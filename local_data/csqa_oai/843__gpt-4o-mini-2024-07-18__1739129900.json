  "query": "Question: A beaver builds structures to block what sort of feature?\n\nChoices:\nA: books\nB: zoo\nC: body of water\nD: wooded area\nE: animals",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a beaver is known for in terms of its behavior and environmental interactions. Beavers are primarily known for building dams and lodges.",
    "Next, identify the purpose of the structures that beavers build. Beavers build these structures to create a habitat for themselves and to block water flow.",
    "Reflect on the choices given. \"A: books\" does not relate to natural features. \"B: zoo\" also does not relate, as it refers to a man-made structure for animals.",
    "Consider \"C: body of water.\" This choice directly relates to what beavers do, as they build dams across streams and rivers, effectively blocking and backing up water.",
    "Next, review options \"D: wooded area\" and \"E: animals.\" While beavers do inhabit wooded areas, they don't specifically block these areas; rather, they change the water landscape. \"E: animals\" is not correct since beavers do not block animals.",
    "After evaluating all choices, only \"C: body of water\" directly links to the beaver's activity of building dams to block or regulate water flow.",
    "Thus, upon final reflection on the choices regarding what features beavers block, the correct answer is clear."
