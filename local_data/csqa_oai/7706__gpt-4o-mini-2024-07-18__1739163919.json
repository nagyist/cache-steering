    "Long-term excessive consumption of unhealthy foods can lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for various health problems.",
    "Obesity is commonly associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.",
    "Health problems related to continuous poor dietary habits can also include digestive issues, liver disease, and certain types of cancer.",
    "While consuming excess hamburgers can potentially lead to immediate discomfort, such as gas or nausea, these are not long-term effects.",
