  "query": "Question: Where would I go to see the most brands of oboe?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: case\nC: guitar center\nD: band\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the best location to find a variety of oboe brands.",
    "Looking at the choices, an orchestra (A) would typically have a limited number of instruments, mainly the ones owned by musicians or the ensemble itself, rather than a variety of brands.",
    "A case (B) is simply a protective covering for an instrument and would not offer any oboes.",
    "A guitar center (C) specializes primarily in guitars and related accessories, so it's unlikely to have a wide selection of oboes.",
    "A band (D) would also have limited brands available, as it would mainly consist of the instruments owned by band members.",
    "A music store (E), on the other hand, typically carries a wide range of musical instruments, including woodwinds like the oboe, and often stocks multiple brands.",
    "Given that music stores are designed to provide a variety of instruments for musicians and aspiring players, they are the most likely to have the greatest selection of oboes.",
    "Therefore, the best choice for finding the most brands of oboe is the music store."
