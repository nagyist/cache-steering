  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"signs for falling rock\" indicates they were in a mountainous or hilly area, suggesting that the terrain was previously steep and rugged.",
    "As they stopped seeing these signs, it implies they were leaving a region known for steep rocks and entering a different type of environment.",
    "The term \"surroundings were getting less steep\" suggests a transition to a flatter landscape, which is characteristic of open areas like plains or fields.",
    "Considering the listed choices, \"countryside\" fits the description of a flatter area compared to a mountain range or volcano which would still be steep.",
    "A mountain range would still have elevated terrains and hills, which does not align with the description of \"less steep.\"",
    "A volcano also typically has a steep slope, especially near its lava flow or crater, so it\u2019s unlikely they would stop seeing falling rock signs and enter a volcanic area.",
    "Choosing \"ground\" or \"bridge\" doesn\u2019t convey a change in the type of landscape, as they are more vague and could apply to various contexts without characterizing an area.",
    "Thus, the 'countryside' is the only term that accurately represents an open and less steep area compared to those previously mentioned."
