  "query": "Question: What is a good thing for farmers to have to start off?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm land\nB: raise cattle\nC: grow corn\nD: supply food\nE: raise horses",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what farmers generally need to start their work effectively.",
    "Farmers typically require land to cultivate crops or raise animals. Without land, they cannot operate.",
    "Next, I should evaluate the significance of each choice. \"Farm land\" is essential because it provides a physical space for agricultural activities.",
    "While raising cattle, growing corn, supplying food, and raising horses are all important aspects of farming, they usually depend on having land first.",
    "Raising cattle or horses requires appropriate land as well, and growing corn also needs a cultivated area.",
    "Supplying food is a result of farming activities and not a prerequisite to start farming.",
    "Considering the other choices do not provide a foundation for farming, it reinforces that land is the starting point.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that \"farm land\" is the most critical and fundamental thing for farmers to have to start off."
