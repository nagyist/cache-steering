  "query": "Question: The poet was being analyzed by younger people, where was this happening?\n\nChoices:\nA: book store\nB: university\nC: home\nD: classroom\nE: speakeasy",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question involves a poet being analyzed by \"younger people.\" This implies an academic or educational setting where students or younger individuals might engage in literary analysis.",
    "A book store could host discussions on poetry, but it is less likely to be a formal analysis setting involving younger people specifically analyzing a poet.",
    "Home suggests a personal setting, which is unlikely for a formal analysis by a group of younger people. It's more about personal enjoyment or informal discussion.",
    "A classroom is a traditional environment for teaching and analyzing literature. It is specifically designed for younger individuals, such as students, to engage deeply with texts.",
    "A university could also be a setting where younger students analyze poets, but this typically involves older students rather than the impression of \"younger people.\"",
    "Speakeasy refers to a place related to illegal drinking during Prohibition, and it does not seem relevant to a literary analysis context.",
    "Given the emphasis on younger people and analytical settings, a classroom is the most fitting location for this activity.",
    "Thus, based on the process of elimination and reasoning about suitable environments for analyzing a poet, the most appropriate answer is classroom."
