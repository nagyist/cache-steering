  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where people typically store their medicine at home.",
    "Medicine is often stored in places that are convenient for access and appropriate for the environment.",
    "The kitchen is a common place where people might keep medicine, especially over-the-counter medicine, as it is often accessible when needed.",
    "The doctor\u2019s office is not a location where people store their personal medicine; it\u2019s a place to receive prescriptions or get consultations.",
    "Similarly, a hospital is also not a location for storing personal medicine; it's where treatment occurs.",
    "The bathroom is frequently used to store medicines. Its temperature and humidity can affect the shelf life of some medications but many people keep them there for convenience.",
    "A jar might be a generic reference for storage, but it doesn't specify a common location for medicine.",
    "Now, I need to compare the options: The kitchen and bathroom are the primary locations for keeping medicine at home.",
    "Between the kitchen and bathroom, the bathroom is likely more common for personal items like medications, particularly those related to health and hygiene.",
    "I will choose the option that best represents where people often have medicine accessible to them at home."
