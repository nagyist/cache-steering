  "query": "Question: A shark is stuck in a lake, where does it need to go provided it isn't a bull shark?\n\nChoices:\nA: medium\nB: saltwater\nC: sea world\nD: atlantic ocean\nE: seawater",
  "steps": [
    "First, we establish that sharks are primarily marine animals and require saltwater environments to survive, as they are not built for freshwater habitats.",
    "Next, we note that the question specifies the shark is not a bull shark, which is one of the few species that can tolerate both saltwater and freshwater.",
    "Since the shark is not a bull shark, it cannot survive in the lake's freshwater and must find its way back to a saltwater environment.",
    "We examine the choices given to determine which options pertain to saltwater environments.",
    "Choice A, \"medium,\" is too vague and does not specify an appropriate environment for the shark.",
    "Choice B, \"saltwater,\" directly refers to the type of water the shark needs to survive.",
    "Choice C, \"sea world,\" is a man-made environment and while it could house a shark, it doesn't provide the natural environment the shark needs to thrive.",
    "Choice D, \"atlantic ocean,\" is a saltwater body and could be a proper habitat for the shark, but it is a specific locale.",
    "Choice E, \"seawater,\" is synonymous with saltwater, suggesting a broad category that would include oceans and other saltwater bodies.",
    "Both choices B and E refer to saltwater, but B is the most direct and simplest answer. The shark needs saltwater, which directly refers to the condition necessary for its survival."
