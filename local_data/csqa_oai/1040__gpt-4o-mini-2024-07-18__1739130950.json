  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where to keep a fire extinguisher in a house if it's really big.",
    "Out of the options given, I need to identify the places that could reasonably be associated with a house or a residential setting.",
    "Options A (school bus), B (car), and E (hospital) are not relevant as they do not relate to a typical house environment.",
    "This leaves us with options C (garage) and D (stairwell).",
    "A garage is often equipped with tools, chemicals, and equipment that could pose fire risks, making it an appropriate place to keep a fire extinguisher.",
    "A stairwell, while it may be a location where people pass through, is not typically a designated storage area for heavy or large items like a big fire extinguisher.",
    "Considering the practicality and accessibility for using a fire extinguisher, the garage stands out as the best option.",
    "In case of an emergency, having the fire extinguisher in the garage allows for relatively easy access while also keeping it out of the way.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer based on the provided options and reasoning is C: garage."
