  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for locations in a city where box offices are commonly found. Box offices are typically associated with venues that sell tickets for events.",
    "First, I'll consider what kinds of places typically have box offices. Historically, venues like theatres, concert halls, and sports arenas often have box offices.",
    "Looking at the options given, A (opera), B (ballpark), C (theatre), D (theater district), and E (movie theater), I need to assess which venues are most related to box offices.",
    "Option A (opera) could have a box office, but it's not as common or widespread as other venues.",
    "Option B (ballpark) does have a box office, but it is more specific to sports events rather than a broader variety of performances.",
    "Option C (theatre) definitely has box offices as they are commonly the venues for plays and performances.",
    "Option D (theater district) suggests a concentrated area where many theatres and similar venues are located, which generally would have multiple box offices.",
    "Option E (movie theater) also has box offices since it sells tickets for films, and these are very common in many cities.",
    "Out of these options, both C (theatre) and E (movie theater) are strong contenders, but a theatre typically offers a wider range of performances such as plays, musicals, and operatic events, which broadens the type of box office activity.",
    "Given that the question suggests a general location where one would find many box offices, the theater district (D) is indeed a good choice, as it encompasses multiple theatres with their respective box offices."
