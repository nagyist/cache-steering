  "query": "Question: Sarah didn't even know that she was fertile. He doctor told her that procreating was impossible for her.  So she was extremely surprised when she learned that she was having what?\n\nChoices:\nA: animals\nB: children born\nC: twins\nD: population increase\nE: venereal disease",
  "steps": [
    "The passage indicates that Sarah was unaware of her fertility and was previously told by her doctor that procreation was impossible for her. This suggests a significant surprise regarding her ability to conceive.",
    "The context implies that the surprise relates to the biological capability of giving birth, which narrows down the choices to those related to offspring.",
    "Choice A (animals) does not fit the context of human fertility and procreation.",
    "Choice D (population increase) is also too broad and does not specifically pertain to Sarah\u2019s personal experience with fertility.",
    "Choice E (venereal disease) is irrelevant to the concept of fertility and procreation.",
    "Choices B (children born) and C (twins) both directly relate to birthing. However, C specifically suggests that she could be having twins, which would be an unexpected surprise, especially given her previous beliefs.",
    "If Sarah was told procreation was impossible, the notion of having twins (which implies successful conception and pregnancy) would be particularly astonishing.",
    "While choice B could still be applicable, the specific nature of the surprise leans toward the extraordinary, which twins would represent due to the circumstance.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating all options, twins is the most fitting answer given the context of both her surprise and the prior misconceptions about her fertility."
