  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to keep a wagon meant for work?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: kitchen cabinet\nC: backyard\nD: field\nE: toy store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a wagon meant for work. It is typically used for carrying heavy loads or materials, which suggests that it needs to be stored in a place that accommodates such use.",
    "Next, evaluate option A, the garage. Garages are commonly used for storing tools, equipment, and vehicles, which means it's a suitable location for keeping a work wagon.",
    "Now, assess option B, the kitchen cabinet. This option is impractical as kitchen cabinets are not designed for bulky items or outdoor equipment like a work wagon.",
    "Then, consider option C, the backyard. While a backyard could potentially be a place to store a wagon, it may not provide protection from the elements and could lead to deterioration over time.",
    "Next, look at option D, the field. This option is unsuitable as it lacks security and protection, making it inappropriate for storing equipment like a work wagon.",
    "Finally, examine option E, the toy store. This location is irrelevant for a work wagon, which is not a toy and would not belong in a toy store.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the garage emerges as the most logical and practical choice for storing a work wagon due to its intended use and protection from the weather."
