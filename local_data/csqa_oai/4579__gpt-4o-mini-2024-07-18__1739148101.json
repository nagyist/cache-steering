  "query": "Question: If you're releasing energy through running, what will you likely find on your skin?\n\nChoices:\nA: sweat\nB: movement\nC: exercising\nD: sex\nE: moist",
  "steps": [
    "When engaging in a strenuous physical activity like running, the body generates heat as a byproduct of energy expenditure.",
    "To regulate body temperature, the body initiates the process of sweating, which is the release of moisture from the sweat glands.",
    "Sweat serves the purpose of cooling the body down through evaporation, which helps prevent overheating during exercise.",
    "Since the question specifically mentions releasing energy through running, it aligns with this physiological response, indicating the presence of sweat.",
    "The other options do not directly relate to the physical response of the body during and after running.",
    "Choice B (movement) simply describes the action of running but does not capture the byproduct of that action on the skin.",
    "Choice C (exercising) is broad and doesn't specifically target what would be found on the skin.",
    "Choice D (sex) is unrelated to the act of running or releasing energy.",
    "Choice E (moist) could describe sweat but is not as specific or direct in capturing the phenomenon of sweating itself."
