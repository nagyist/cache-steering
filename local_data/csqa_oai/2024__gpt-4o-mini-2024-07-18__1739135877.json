  "steps": [
    "Identify what kind of machine typically takes quarters. A common example is a washing machine found in a laundromat.",
    "Consider the context of the statement, which suggests a location where one might use a machine that takes quarters. The laundromat fits this context perfectly.",
    "Review the other options. An assembly line does not usually operate with quarters, but rather uses machinery or labor for production processes.",
    "Examine the option \u201cstreet.\u201d While there might be machines like parking meters on streets that accept quarters, it's not a location typically associated with a load.",
    "Analyze the \"white house\" and \"house\" options. Neither of these locations would reasonably be associated with a machine that takes money for a single load; a house would typically imply a home context, which does not align with the phrase \"only enough for one load.\"",
    "Narrow the focus. The phrase \"only had enough for one load\" strongly suggests a single-use scenario, which is very fitting for a laundromat, where a load of laundry would be the direct outcome of putting quarters into a washing machine.",
    "Conclude that the most logical and relevant option, based on the reasoning and context, is the laundromat."
