  "steps": [
    "The question states that the teen was required to go to school.",
    "A typical requirement to attend school implies a role or status related to education.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"student\" (A) directly relates to someone who attends school.",
    "The word \"register\" (B) refers to the action of signing up for something, not a status or role.",
    "\"Old enough\" (C) is a description of age, which does not define the teen's role in school.",
    "\"Put on shoes\" (D) is an action unrelated to the context of going to school.",
    "\"Grouchy\" (E) describes a mood, which does not relate to the requirement of going to school.",
    "Since the most fitting choice that describes the teen in the context of going to school is \"student,\" this is the correct answer."
