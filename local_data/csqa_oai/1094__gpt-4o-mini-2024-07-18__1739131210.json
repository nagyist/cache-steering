  "query": "Question: Where is a bicycle likely to be safe?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: sidewalk\nC: schoolyard\nD: toy store\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the locations provided and their relationships to bicycle safety.",
    "The garage is typically a secure and enclosed space, which minimizes the risk of theft or damage.",
    "The sidewalk is a public area where bicycles may be at risk from pedestrians and vehicles nearby.",
    "A schoolyard is often fenced and monitored, making it a potentially safe place for a bicycle when children are present during school hours.",
    "A toy store may not provide a secure place for a bicycle; it is accessible to the public, increasing the risk of theft.",
    "The street is also dangerous for bicycles because of the presence of vehicles and traffic, leading to accidents.",
    "Now, compare the safety of the garage and schoolyard; the garage is obviously more secure than a schoolyard.",
    "Both the sidewalk and street present dangers from traffic, while the toy store does not provide a secure location either.",
    "Therefore, the garage stands out as the safest option mentioned."
