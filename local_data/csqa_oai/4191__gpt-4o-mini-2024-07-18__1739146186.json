  "query": "Question: If you're about to reach a stop sign in your car what must you do?\n\nChoices:\nA: slow down\nB: go fast\nC: roll over\nD: crash\nE: fly",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves a traffic situation where a stop sign is present, which typically indicates that a driver must come to a complete stop before proceeding.",
    "Option A suggests slowing down, which is relevant as drivers often reduce speed as they approach a stop sign.",
    "Option B suggests going fast, which contradicts the rules of the road concerning stop signs, as you must stop at it.",
    "Option C suggests rolling over, which is not applicable to driving behavior at a stop sign and also implies a dangerous action.",
    "Option D suggests crashing, which is certainly not an appropriate or legal response to a stop sign situation.",
    "Option E suggests flying, which is not possible in a car and irrelevant to the situation at hand.",
    "Among the options presented, slowing down (Option A) makes the most sense as it aligns with the appropriate action at a stop sign.",
    "To summarize, the correct behavior at a stop sign is not just to slow down but to eventually come to a complete stop, which begins with slowing down."
