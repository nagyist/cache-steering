  "steps": [
    "The question asks about vessels in Alaska that are looking for crabs.",
    "In Alaska, crabbing is a common fishing activity, particularly in the Bering Sea and surrounding waters.",
    "The term \"vessels\" typically refers to boats and ships involved in commercial or recreational activities.",
    "Tidepools are natural pools of seawater and not vessels searching for crabs; they are a habitat where crabs may be found but not searched for.",
    "Cruise ships cater to tourists and do not engage in crabbing activities.",
    "The Seychelles are an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, not related to Alaska or crabbing there.",
    "Underpants are clothing items and have no association with vessels or crabbing activities.",
    "Fishing boats are specifically designed for catching fish and crabs, making them the most logical choice in this context.",
    "Thus, the activities of crabbing are typically associated with fishing boats.",
    "No other options appropriately describe vessels that would be searching for crabs in Alaska."
