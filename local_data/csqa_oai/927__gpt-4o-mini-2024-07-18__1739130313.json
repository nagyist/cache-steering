  "query": "Question: Where would you dispose of a broken icebox?\n\nChoices:\nA: antique store\nB: in the graveyard\nC: kitchen\nD: junk yard\nE: ice",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to analyze the options provided and their relevance to disposing of a broken icebox.",
    "The icebox is a large appliance, so it isn't suitable for a graveyard (B) or an antique store (A) where valuable items are placed for resale.",
    "Considering the nature of the item, option E (ice) is also irrelevant since we are looking for a place to dispose of an appliance rather than a product related to it.",
    "Now evaluating options C (kitchen) and D (junk yard). The kitchen is where the icebox is used but is not a place for disposal.",
    "A broken appliance like an icebox should ideally be disposed of in a location meant for junk or large waste, which points to option D (junk yard).",
    "In a junk yard, broken items can be salvaged for parts or recycled, making it a more appropriate disposal site compared to the kitchen or any other option.",
    "Confirming each option: Antique stores typically receive only collectible items, graveyards are for burial, kitchens are for functioning appliances, and ice does not relate to disposal of the broken icebox.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only reasonable place to dispose of a broken icebox is the junk yard."
