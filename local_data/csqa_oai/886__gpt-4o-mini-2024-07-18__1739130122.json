  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider where a clipboard is typically kept. A clipboard is often used for organizing papers and taking notes, which suggests it should be in a location that requires regular access to such items.",
    "Next, we can evaluate each option based on common usage scenarios for clipboards. Starting with option A (shelf), while a shelf could hold a clipboard, it may not provide the ease of access that James requires.",
    "For option B (place of work), this is a valid option as James may need a clipboard for work-related tasks. However, it is somewhat vague and does not specify a personal space.",
    "Then, evaluating option C (desk), this is a strong candidate. A desk is a personal workspace, and keeping a clipboard on the desk would provide easy access while working.",
    "Now, considering option D (office supply store), this is not a viable option as it is a place to purchase supplies rather than a place to keep them.",
    "Next, we look at option E (school). While students typically use clipboards at school, this option does not guarantee that James, as an individual, would keep his clipboard there unless he is a student.",
    "Comparing options B and C, while a place of work can be a suitable location for a clipboard, a desk within that workspace offers a more practical and personal touch for easy access.",
    "Finally, since the question emphasizes easy access, option C (desk) stands out as the most logical choice because it is a specific place where one might typically keep a clipboard for regular use."
