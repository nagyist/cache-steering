  "steps": [
    "The situation describes the end of a marriage to someone no longer loved. One possible initial reaction could include a complex mix of emotions, ranging from sadness to liberation.",
    "Depression (Choice A) is a possible emotion, as the end of a significant relationship can lead to feelings of sorrow, particularly if the marriage was long or if the individual struggles with change.",
    "Grief (Choice B) might also be experienced as it involves mourning the loss of the relationship and the dreams associated with it. This is particularly true if the marriage was meaningful at some point.",
    "Relief (Choice C) could be another response, especially if the individual felt trapped or unhappy in the marriage. This could represent a release from tension or distress associated with staying in a loveless relationship.",
    "Anger (Choice D) may arise, particularly if there were feelings of betrayal or hurt connected to the end of a relationship. This can come from unresolved feelings about the relationship's breakdown.",
    "Now considering which of these emotions is most likely immediately following the end of a marriage when someone no longer loves their partner, relief seems particularly significant, as it reflects a sense of freedom from a situation that was no longer desired.",
    "While feelings of depression, grief, and anger are also valid responses, relief stands out as an emotion that might be felt most immediately and strongly after the decision is made to leave a loveless marriage.",
    "Comparing all the options, relief (C) provides a perspective that emphasizes the positive outcome of breaking free from a situation that is no longer fulfilling."
