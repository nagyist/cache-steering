  "query": "Question: A flea made the dog itch, this is because to feed it can do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: suck blood\nB: bite\nC: jump\nD: lay eggs\nE: attack",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what it means for a flea to feed on a dog. Fleas are ectoparasites whose primary sustenance comes from blood, specifically that of their host, which in this case is the dog.",
    "Next, we know that to feed on a host, a flea must first penetrate the skin of the host, which is accomplished through biting.",
    "While it's true that a flea can jump, this jumping action does not directly correlate with the act of feeding but rather helps the flea reach its host.",
    "Laying eggs is a reproduction action and does not relate to the immediate action of feeding.",
    "An attack implies aggression, while feeding is more about sustenance. Although a flea does cause discomfort, the term 'attack' would not accurately describe its feeding behavior.",
    "Thus, considering the actions involved specifically in the act of feeding, the most appropriate choice is the act of biting.",
    "We can conclude that the reason the dog itches is primarily due to the flea biting it to suck blood and obtain nourishment."
