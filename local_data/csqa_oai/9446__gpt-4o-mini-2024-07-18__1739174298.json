  "query": "Question: He enjoyed attending lecture, it was his favorite way of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: applaud\nB: take notes\nC: learning\nD: going online\nE: taking notes",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the sentence. The key phrase is \"He enjoyed attending lecture,\" which indicates that attending lectures is a positive experience for him.",
    "Next, we need to determine what attending a lecture typically involves. Lectures are primarily educational events where information is conveyed to students.",
    "The word \"favorite\" suggests that this activity is associated with something he values, which is likely related to gaining knowledge or skills.",
    "Now, let's examine each of the choices given:\n- A: applaud \u2013 This does not logically relate to attending lectures as it does not represent a way of receiving or processing information.\n- B: take notes \u2013 Although taking notes can happen during lectures, it is a method rather than the overall activity he enjoys.\n- C: learning \u2013 This directly ties into the purpose of attending lectures, which is typically to acquire knowledge.\n- D: going online \u2013 This is unrelated to the direct experience of attending a lecture, as it implies a different activity.\n- E: taking notes \u2013 Similar to B, this is a method involved in lectures, not the main enjoyment he derives from them.",
    "Considering that \"learning\" is the primary goal and benefit of attending lectures, option C stands out as the best fit.",
    "Thus, the most logical interpretation of the initial sentence with regards to the choices provided is that his favorite way is related to acquiring knowledge through lectures."
