  "query": "Question: What were southern institutions where slaves do the labor called?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm\nB: ancient rome\nC: history book\nD: poor countries\nE: plantation",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which refers to institutions where slaves were involved in labor in the southern United States.",
    "Consider the historical context of slavery in the southern U.S., particularly from the 17th to the 19th century.",
    "Analyze the term \"plantation,\" which refers specifically to large farms that specialized in the production of cash crops like cotton, tobacco, and sugar.",
    "Evaluate the other options in the list to see if they fit the context: \n- \"farm\" could apply but is less specific than \"plantation.\"\n- \"ancient rome\" is clearly not relevant to southern U.S. slavery.\n- \"history book\" does not refer to a physical location or institution.\n- \"poor countries\" does not pertain to the labor system involving slaves.",
    "Confirm that the term \"plantation\" is indeed widely recognized and historically accepted in describing the agricultural estates that relied on enslaved labor in the southern states.",
    "Conclude that the most accurate answer relating to the question is \"plantation.\""
