  "query": "Question: The dairy cow farm was special, it provided all the milk for the big chocolate company from where?\n\nChoices:\nA: ranch\nB: tennessee\nC: barnyard\nD: switzerland\nE: antarctica",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question: It discusses a dairy cow farm that provides milk for a chocolate company.",
    "Consider the nature of dairy farming: Typically, dairy cows are found on farms, and such farms produce milk.",
    "Evaluate the options for their relevance to a dairy cow farm's location or characteristic: \n- A: ranch - typically associated with farms and agriculture, relevant to dairy cows. \n- B: tennessee - a state known for agriculture, including dairy farming.\n- C: barnyard - refers to an area where livestock are kept, but does not denote a specific location.\n- D: switzerland - known for dairy products, especially cheeses and chocolates, relevant to the chocolate company.\n- E: antarctica - not suitable for dairy farming due to the extreme climate.",
    "Analyze the options: \n- Option A (ranch) is a general term and does not indicate a specific location.\n- Option B (tennessee) could potentially house a dairy farm, but it is not exclusively associated with chocolate production.\n- Option C (barnyard) describes a place, but again lacks specificity regarding location.\n- Option D (switzerland) has a strong association with quality chocolate and dairy products and could logically be related to the question.\n- Option E (antarctica) is not viable for dairy farming or chocolate production.",
    "Since the chocolate company needs milk, prioritize the options that connect dairy farming to the company's location. This links Switzerland more directly than the other options.",
    "Based on the analysis, Switzerland is known for both chocolate and dairy products, making it a suitable answer."
