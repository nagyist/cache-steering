  "query": "Question: What can happen to water at different temperatures?\n\nChoices:\nA: melts\nB: wet clothes\nC: move mountains\nD: thin blood\nE: take several forms",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the physical states of water: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam or vapor). These states change with temperature.",
    "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, turning from liquid to solid, meaning it \"melts\" into its liquid form at higher temperatures.",
    "At 100 degrees Celsius, water boils and becomes steam, which highlights its ability to change into a gas at this temperature.",
    "Water can be present in various forms: ice, liquid water, and water vapor. Thus, it can take several forms depending on the temperature.",
    "The option \"wet clothes\" relates to how water interacts with fabrics but does not directly address temperature-related changes in water itself.",
    "\"Move mountains\" and \"thin blood\" do not pertain to the physical properties and states of water with temperature changes.",
    "Only the choice that encapsulates the various physical states of water as temperature changes is relevant: solid, liquid, gaseous states.",
    "Reviewing all options indicates that \"take several forms\" clearly aligns with the concept of water transitioning between its states when influenced by temperature changes."
