  "query": "Question: John wasn't in his right mind.  His brain did what to him?\n\nChoices:\nA: tended\nB: play tricks on\nC: picture experience\nD: form images\nE: manual",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"wasn't in his right mind\" suggests that John was experiencing some form of confusion or altered mental state.",
    "In this context, the brain can be understood as influencing behavior and perceptions due to this altered state.",
    "The phrase \"play tricks on\" suggests deception, which is often associated with a mind that isn't functioning properly.",
    "Now, examining the choices: \n- A \"tended\" does not logically fit the context of mental confusion.\n- B \"play tricks on\" fits well as it conveys how the mind can mislead someone who isn\u2019t in their right mind.\n- C \"picture experience\" and D \"form images\" both imply mental activity but do not directly convey the sense of confusion or manipulation.\n- E \"manual\" is irrelevant in this context as it suggests physical control rather than mental confusion.",
    "Therefore, based on the reasoning that John's mental state leads to the likelihood of his brain misleading him, \"play tricks on\" is the most fitting choice."
