  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the options provided to determine what responsibilities are commonly associated with adulthood.",
    "Option A, \"drink beer,\" is more of a leisure activity rather than a responsibility of adults. Although some adults might choose to drink beer, it is not a necessary responsibility.",
    "Option B, \"drive train,\" refers to operating a train, which is a specialized job that not all adults are responsible for. This is also not a common responsibility.",
    "Option C, \"sweeping the floor,\" could be considered a responsibility as it relates to maintaining cleanliness at home or in work environments; however, it is more of a task than an overarching responsibility of adulthood.",
    "Option D, \"work,\" is a significant responsibility for many adults, as it relates to earning a living, being productive members of society, and fulfilling familial and personal obligations.",
    "Option E, \"marry,\" while it can be a responsibility for some adults, it is not a universal requirement for adulthood and varies widely by individual choice and culture.",
    "Given these evaluations, the option that most broadly encompasses a common responsibility of many adults is \"work.\""
