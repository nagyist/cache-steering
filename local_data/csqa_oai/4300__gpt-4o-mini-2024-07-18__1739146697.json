  "query": "Question: What kind of flight cannot be taken to s foreign country?\n\nChoices:\nA: imaginary flight\nB: american\nC: native\nD: indigenous\nE: domestic",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what a \"flight\" means in this context. A flight typically refers to an air travel journey from one location to another.",
    "Next, we need to consider what constitutes a foreign country. A foreign country is any country that is not the one in which the person currently resides.",
    "Now, let\u2019s consider each option in terms of whether it can involve travel to a foreign country.",
    "Option A is \"imaginary flight.\" This refers to a concept or thought rather than a physical journey and cannot be taken to any country.",
    "Option B, \"american flight,\" could refer to flights that are international or domestic within the United States, but it doesn\u2019t clarify whether it\u2019s specifically a type that cannot go to foreign countries.",
    "Option C is \"native flight,\" which doesn\u2019t have a clear definition related to travel or whether it can go to foreign countries.",
    "Option D is \"indigenous flight,\" which similarly lacks a defined context relating specifically to travel.",
    "Option E is \"domestic flight.\" Domestic flights are defined as flights that operate within a single country. Therefore, they cannot take you to a foreign country.",
    "After analyzing all options, it is clear that \"domestic flight\" is the only one that cannot be taken to a foreign country, while the other options either don\u2019t refer to actual travel or have unclear definitions regarding foreign travel."
