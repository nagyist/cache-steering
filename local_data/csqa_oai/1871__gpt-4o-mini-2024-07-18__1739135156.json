  "query": "Question: If you want to find a star you'd have to look in space, but if you wanted to find one from the screen you should travel to where?\n\nChoices:\nA: outer space\nB: uganda\nC: constellation\nD: solar system\nE: hollywood",
  "steps": [
    "The question is focusing on finding a star, but specifies that it should be one that can be found from a screen, indicating a reference to film or entertainment rather than astronomy.",
    "The term \"star\" in the context of a screen typically refers to movie stars or celebrities, rather than astronomical stars. Therefore, I should look for a connection to the film industry.",
    "Among the given options, I should analyze where film stars are commonly associated with. Hollywood is famously known as the center of the film industry.",
    "\"Outer space\" (A) and \"solar system\" (D) relate to astronomical stars, which are not applicable in this question.",
    "\"Uganda\" (B) does not have a significant connection to film stars or the entertainment industry.",
    "\"Constellation\" (C) refers again to the stars in astronomy, which is not relevant here since the context is about movie stars.",
    "Therefore, by elimination and by rational deduction, the best choice that aligns with where one could travel to find a movie star is Hollywood."
