  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the possible outcomes when an event did not end in a tie while competing.",
    "In a competitive event, the outcomes can typically be winning, losing, or sometimes encountering emotions such as fear or anger.",
    "Since it is stated there was no tie, this suggests that there must have been one competitor who won and one who lost.",
    "Thus, the two possible results when there is no tie would be winning and losing.",
    "Out of the given options, \"winning\" and \"losing\" are explicitly articulated as outcomes resulting from competition without a tie.",
    "Now let's analyze the answer choices to identify which matches the conclusion that we reached.",
    "Options A (fear), C (anger), D (enemies), and E (wins) do not encapsulate the direct outcomes of the event based on the principle of winning or losing.",
    "Therefore, the only answer that directly reflects the two possible results in a no-tie scenario is B (winning or losing)."
