  "query": "Question: There are many natural landmarks that need to be protected at what locations?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: city\nC: national park\nD: special place\nE: forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze what natural landmarks are. They include mountains, rivers, forests, and unique geographical features that are often found in specific locations.",
    "I consider where natural landmarks are most commonly located. They are typically situated in natural, undeveloped areas rather than urban settings.",
    "Next, I evaluate the provided choices. The 'countryside' (A) includes regions outside urban areas but may not represent areas with formal protection or conservation status.",
    "The term 'city' (B) suggests a largely urban environment, which is not conducive to the preservation of natural landmarks as urban development tends to obscure or eliminate them.",
    "'National park' (C) is a designated protected area established to conserve the natural environment and wildlife. Such areas are specifically set up to protect natural landmarks from development and human impact.",
    "'Special place' (D) is vague and does not specifically denote a location with protection or conservation status for natural landmarks.",
    "Finally, while 'forest' (E) is important, not all forests are protected or recognized as national landmarks; thus, they do not fit as well as 'national park.'"
