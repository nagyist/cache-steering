  "steps": [
    "To determine what a bald eagle is likely to avoid, we should consider the natural behavior and habitat preferences of bald eagles.",
    "Bald eagles typically thrive in habitats near large bodies of open water with abundant food supplies, such as fish, and they prefer areas with tall trees for nesting and perching.",
    "Next, we can analyze the given choices. Option A, 'mountainous area', could potentially provide suitable habitats if there are water sources nearby, so it's not something they would avoid outright.",
    "Option B, 'soup', is not part of a bald eagle's natural diet. Eagles are carnivorous and do not consume human food like soup, so they would likely avoid areas where food like this is present.",
    "For option C, 'in Washington', while there are bald eagles in Washington, it's not something they avoid by nature as Washington does have natural habitats suitable for them.",
    "Option D, 'nature preserve', usually signifies a protected area which could be ideal for bald eagles to hunt and nest, so they wouldn't avoid it.",
    "Finally, for option E, 'trees', bald eagles actively seek out trees as nesting sites, so they would not avoid them.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only option a bald eagle would likely avoid based on its dietary preferences and natural behaviors is option B, 'soup'."
