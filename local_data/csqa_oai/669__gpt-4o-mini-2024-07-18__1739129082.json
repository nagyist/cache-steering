  "query": "Question: James drove his niece to her father.  Where did he drive?\n\nChoices:\nA: great granddad's house\nB: family picture book\nC: brother's house\nD: family tree\nE: family reunion",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James drove his niece to her father. This indicates that the destination is related to the niece\u2019s dad.",
    "Since the father of the niece is also James' brother, it is reasonable to conclude that the drive was to James' brother's house.",
    "The choices involve various family-related options, but only one is explicitly a direct familial relationship: brother's house.",
    "The other options (great granddad's house, family picture book, family tree, family reunion) do not correlate directly with the context of driving to a father.",
    "Thus, the logical conclusion is that James drove to his brother\u2019s house, as that is where his niece's father would be located."
