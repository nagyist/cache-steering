  "steps": [
    "To find a way out of a cave, one generally needs to follow cues or signs that lead towards the exit.",
    "In a cave, one of the most significant indicators of where to go is the presence of light, as caves are typically dark and the exit is usually where light is present.",
    "The other options do not represent feasible choices for navigation in a cave: \n- A: \"deepfelt\" does not provide any directional guidance.\n- C: \"high\" does not indicate a specific direction or cue that would help in navigation.\n- D: \"frivolous\" has no relevance to finding a way out.\n- E: \"mountain\" could apply geographically, but it does not directly help in a cave situation.",
    "Since light is a natural indicator of an exit and is a common feature when exiting from a cave, it stands out as the best option to follow."
