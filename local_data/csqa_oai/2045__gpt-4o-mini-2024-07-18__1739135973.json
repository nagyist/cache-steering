  "query": "Question: what color are rose flowers typically?\n\nChoices:\nA: vase\nB: pink\nC: red\nD: blue\nE: fragrant",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what colors are commonly associated with rose flowers in general.",
    "Roses are known to come in a variety of colors, but the most iconic or traditional color is often considered to be red.",
    "Next, I can think about other popular colors for roses, such as pink, but I need to determine how they compare to red in terms of typical association.",
    "In floral arrangements and symbolisms, red roses are especially associated with love and romance, making them very prominent culturally.",
    "While there are blue roses, they are not naturally occurring and are less common in general discussions about roses.",
    "Vase is not a color, and while roses can be put in vases, it does not answer the question about the color of the flowers themselves.",
    "Fragrance, while a characteristic of many roses, is also not a color and thus not applicable.",
    "Comparing the options again, the choice that reflects the most common association is red, as many people think of red roses first when considering the color of roses.",
    "I also acknowledge that pink roses exist and are popular, but they do not surpass the traditional expectation of red roses.",
    "Thus, after analyzing the available choices in the context of the question about typical colors of rose flowers, red stands out as the strongest answer."
