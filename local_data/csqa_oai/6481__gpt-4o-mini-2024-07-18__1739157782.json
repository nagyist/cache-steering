  "query": "Question: The spout was producing hardly a dribble, so fearing germs he began to look for another what?\n\nChoices:\nA: kettle\nB: teapot\nC: water fountain\nD: garage\nE: gasoline can",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the context of the sentence. The mention of \"the spout was producing hardly a dribble\" suggests that the spout is related to something that dispenses liquid, likely water.",
    "Next, we consider the implications of fearing germs. This indicates a concern for cleanliness, particularly regarding drinking water. Therefore, the object he is looking for should provide a reliable source of clean water.",
    "Now, we examine the choices provided. \n- A kettle is typically used for boiling water, which may not directly address the concern for immediate drinking water.\n- A teapot is used for serving tea, but it does not primarily serve as a source of drinking water.\n- A water fountain dispenses drinking water directly and would be a suitable alternative to a faulty spout.\n- A garage is unrelated to the context of water dispensing.\n- A gasoline can is primarily used for storing fuel, which is not relevant to the concern of germs or drinking water.",
    "Among the options, the water fountain (C) stands out as directly addressing the need for clean drinking water, especially in light of the concern about germs from the unreliable spout.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice based on the reasoning above is the water fountain."
