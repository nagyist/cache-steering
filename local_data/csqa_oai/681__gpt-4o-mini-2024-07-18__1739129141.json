  "steps": [
    "The question is about what God wants people to do concerning money, suggesting a moral or ethical perspective.",
    "Option A suggests that God wants people to work in life, which typically aligns with many religious teachings that emphasize the importance of hard work and diligence.",
    "Option B, which says \"speak to people,\" does not directly relate to earning money but may pertain to communication and relationships.",
    "Option C, \"everywhere,\" is vague and does not specifically address the context of earning money.",
    "Option D states \"sitting ideal,\" which implies inactivity, contradicting the general belief that God encourages effort and stewardship of resources.",
    "Option E, \"care for people,\" relates to altruism and charity but does not specifically address the concept of earning or managing money.",
    "Of the options, \"work in life\" (A) is the most direct and plausible answer as it reflects the idea of being productive and contributing, which is often advocated in various religious contexts.",
    "I can eliminate Options B and C for their vagueness and Options D and E for their indirect relation to money.",
    "Thus, focusing on A, which aligns with beliefs commonly found in multiple faiths."
