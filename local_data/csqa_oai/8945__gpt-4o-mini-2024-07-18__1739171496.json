  "query": "Question: If you live by the shore than you probably live in a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: desert\nB: picture of sea side\nC: california\nD: seaside town\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "Living by the shore implies being close to a large body of water, typically the ocean or a sea.",
    "The phrase \"by the shore\" usually refers to the land that directly borders a body of water, which suggests a specific type of location.",
    "Out of the given options, \"seaside town\" suggests a community that is situated right next to the sea, which is a direct correlation to living by the shore.",
    "The option \"California\" is a state that has shorelines, but it is not guaranteed that all regions in California are close to the ocean.",
    "\"Desert\" is the opposite of a coastal environment and does not fit with the idea of living by the shore.",
    "\"Picture of sea side\" does not represent an actual place where someone can live; it is merely an image.",
    "\"Ocean\" refers to the body of water itself, not a place where one might reside.",
    "Considering the meanings of all the options, the only one that represents a place where someone would live if they were by the shore is \"seaside town.\"",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer aligns directly with the condition of living by the shore."
