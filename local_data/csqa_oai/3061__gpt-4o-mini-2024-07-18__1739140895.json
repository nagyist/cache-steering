  "query": "Question: Where might I find a bowl nestled among other bowls in the kitchen?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: kitchen top\nC: cupboard\nD: dishwasher\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify locations in a kitchen where bowls are typically stored or found.",
    "Bowls are usually stored in cabinets or cupboards when not in use, which makes \"cupboard\" a promising option.",
    "Considering the other choices, the refrigerator is commonly used for food storage, not for storing bowls.",
    "The kitchen top is a place where bowls might be used or set down, but it is not a location where they would be \"nested\" among other bowls.",
    "The dishwasher is used for cleaning utensils and dishes, but it is not a storage location for bowls.",
    "The term \"apartment\" refers to a living space and not a specific location for storing bowls, making it less relevant to the question.",
    "Now, comparing \"cupboard\" with the other options, it clearly stands out as the most logical location for finding bowls stored together.",
    "Therefore, the best answer is \"cupboard\"."
