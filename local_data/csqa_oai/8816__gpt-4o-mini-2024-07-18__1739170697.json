  "query": "Question: What would cooks do when they are almost finished cooking?\n\nChoices:\nA: prepare meals\nB: season with salt\nC: mix in bowl\nD: brown meat\nE: better food",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"almost finished cooking\" means. It suggests that the cooks are nearing the end of the cooking process.",
    "Next, I will consider what actions cooks typically take when they are close to finishing. Common actions include finalizing the dish's flavor and presentation.",
    "I will evaluate each option based on typical cooking processes. \n- \"prepare meals\" (A) seems too general and likely refers to an earlier stage.\n- \"season with salt\" (B) is a specific action that many cooks perform towards the end to enhance flavor. \n- \"mix in bowl\" (C) doesn\u2019t fit a typical final step for most cooked dishes unless preparation is still taking place.\n- \"brown meat\" (D) is often done earlier on and not usually a final action unless specifically aiming to finish a particular component.\n- \"better food\" (E) is vague and does not represent an actionable step in cooking.",
    "Among the options, \"season with salt\" (B) directly relates to final seasonings a cook would perform to adjust flavor just before serving.",
    "I note that while cooks might add sauces or other seasonings, salt is a fundamental flavor enhancer often used at the end of cooking.",
    "Given that flavor enhancement is crucial and \"season with salt\" is a recognizable cooking practice, I can conclude that this process fits well in the context of finishing a dish.",
    "Overall, I will eliminate options A, C, D, and E based on why they\u2019re less likely to happen at the end of the cooking process compared to adding salt for flavor enhancement."
