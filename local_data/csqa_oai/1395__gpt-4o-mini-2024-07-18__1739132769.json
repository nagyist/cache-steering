  "query": "Question: It seemed weird to have a dental office located next to a candy store and fast food location at the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: medical building\nB: hospital\nC: school\nD: strip mall\nE: urban area",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context: we have a dental office that is typically associated with health and wellness.",
    "Next, we note that it is located next to a candy store and a fast food location, which are generally not aligned with dental health.",
    "Now, we should consider the environments where a dental office, a candy store, and a fast food location might coexist.",
    "A medical building usually houses various health-related facilities, making it less likely to have a candy store or fast food restaurant next to a dental office.",
    "A hospital would also focus on health services, similar to a medical building, making this location unlikely for such food establishments.",
    "Turning to a school, while students may have access to candy and fast food, this combination doesn\u2019t typically suggest the presence of a dental office nearby.",
    "A strip mall often features a mix of businesses, including dental offices, fast food restaurants, and retail shops, making it a plausible location for all three types of establishments.",
    "An urban area could encompass a variety of businesses, but it might not specifically imply the close proximity necessary for this situation.",
    "Since the combination of a dental office, candy store, and fast food location is most likely found in a strip mall, I conclude this is the best choice."
