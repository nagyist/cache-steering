  "steps": [
    "The context of the situation involves air conditioning going out during a film, indicating that this event is likely happening in a location where films are shown.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"movie theatre\" is the only option that directly relates to the context of \"a film.\"",
    "The other options\u2014house, offices, book store, and car\u2014do not typically have films being shown as their primary purpose.",
    "We can also consider that the clientele walking out due to discomfort suggests a place where many people gather, which further supports the idea of a movie theatre as being crowded.",
    "In environments like offices and homes, discomfort might lead to people leaving, but they are less commonly associated with a collective viewing experience like watching a film.",
    "Having a shared viewing experience, combined with discomfort due to a lack of air conditioning, fits well in a movie theatre scenario.",
    "Thus, we conclude that the most logical answer, given the air conditioning issues during a film, is that the clientele were leaving a movie theatre."
