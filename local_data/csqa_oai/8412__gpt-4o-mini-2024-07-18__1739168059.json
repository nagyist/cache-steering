  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural behavior of birds when it comes to reproduction and laying eggs.",
    "Birds typically require a safe and secure place to lay their eggs to protect them from predators and environmental threats.",
    "Nests are specifically constructed or chosen by birds for this purpose, offering shelter and safety for the eggs and future chicks.",
    "While some birds might lay eggs in different locations depending on their species, the majority have a common practice of using nests.",
    "The forest is a habitat that might contain nests, but it is not where the eggs are specifically placed; rather, nests are built within the forest.",
    "A cage could be a place where birds are kept by humans, but it is not a natural habitat for most birds in terms of laying eggs.",
    "A store does not serve any purpose for birds' egg-laying habits.",
    "The sky is not an appropriate location for laying eggs, as eggs need a stable and safe location to develop.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer, considering all the reasons about birds and their egg-laying behavior, is that they put eggs in nests."
