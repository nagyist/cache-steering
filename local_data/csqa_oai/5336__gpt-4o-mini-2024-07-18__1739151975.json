  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"if you're human, or even if you aren't\" suggests that the scenario applies broadly, possibly to dangerous or threatening situations.",
    "The phrase \"you'll want to stay out of this\" indicates that the subject is something from which one should keep away or avoid.",
    "Looking at the options provided: \nA: hotel - generally safe; people would likely want to be in a hotel.\nB: school - typically safe and beneficial; not something people want to avoid.\nC: society - could be complex and problematic, depending on circumstances, but not inherently a place to stay away from.\nD: house - normally a safe location, where people typically want to be.\nE: harm's way - suggests a situation of danger from which everyone, including humans and non-humans, would want to stay clear.",
    "Considering the implications of \"harm's way,\" it aligns with the idea of wanting to avoid danger.",
    "Among the other options, none present a clear reason to avoid them as strongly as \"harm's way\" does.",
    "Therefore, the one option that fits the criteria of being something to stay out of, whether you're human or not, is \"harm's way.\""
