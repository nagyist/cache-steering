  "query": "Question: If you say farewell to a group of children what gesture might they make?\n\nChoices:\nA: wave goodbye\nB: rub their head\nC: experience fear\nD: watch television\nE: spring into action",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of saying farewell to a group of children. This typically involves a sense of parting or leaving.",
    "Next, think about common gestures that children might make when someone is leaving. Waving is a common social gesture used to express goodbye.",
    "Now, analyze the remaining choices. \"Rub their head\" does not correlate with saying farewell. It's more of an action children might do when confused or pondering something.",
    "Evaluate \"experience fear.\" While some children might feel sad or apprehensive about a departure, it is not a direct or typical response related to saying goodbye.",
    "Next, consider \"watch television.\" This is an action unrelated to the act of saying goodbye; children would not typically engage in this gesture as a response to someone leaving.",
    "Finally, \"spring into action\" does not directly relate to farewells and seems more fitting for a situation requiring urgency or excitement, not a goodbye.",
    "After eliminating the options and closely examining the context, the most fitting gesture when saying farewell to a group of children would be to wave goodbye."
