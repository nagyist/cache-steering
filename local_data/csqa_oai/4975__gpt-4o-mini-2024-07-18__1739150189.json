  "query": "Question: what does skin cover?\n\nChoices:\nA: body\nB: good health\nC: tent\nD: fruit\nE: people",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what skin covers.",
    "Skin is an organ that serves as a protective barrier for living organisms.",
    "In humans and most animals, skin covers the outer layer of the body.",
    "Out of the provided choices, the options include \"body,\" \"good health,\" \"tent,\" \"fruit,\" and \"people.\"",
    "\"Good health\" does not represent a physical entity that can be covered by skin.",
    "\"A tent\" is an inanimate object and is not covered by skin.",
    "\"Fruit\" is also an inanimate object; while it has a skin, it is not what the term \"skin\" conventionally refers to in the context of the question.",
    "\"People\" refers to human beings who have skin covering their body.",
    "\"Body\" directly refers to the entirety of an organism, which includes the skin.",
    "Both \"body\" and \"people\" appear valid as skin covers both, but since \"body\" is more general and encompasses all types of organisms, it seems like the best choice."
