  "steps": [
    "The phrase indicates surprise about the blowfish's edibility, suggesting a context where fish are expected to be found.",
    "The mention of the blowfish is relevant to settings related to seafood rather than land-based settings like a desert or books.",
    "Among the options, \"sea water\" (B) represents the natural habitat of fish but does not imply a marketplace context.",
    "\"Fish market\" (C) directly associates with the idea of buying and selling fish, including blowfish, making it a logical fit.",
    "\"Books\" (D) does not relate to the context of edibility or fish at all, thus can be excluded.",
    "\"France\" (E) could be associated with culinary experiences, including seafood, but lacks the direct implication of a surprising location for a fish being edible.",
    "With \"fish market\" standing out as the place where one would be surprised to see an edible blowfish, it is the most fitting answer."
