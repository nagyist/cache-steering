  "steps": [
    "We need to identify what kind of objects require a light skeleton to achieve flight.",
    "Among the options provided, 'building' is not something that flies, as it is a stationary structure.",
    "'Closet' is also a stationary piece of furniture and does not have any relation to flight.",
    "'Ship' refers to watercraft, which also does not fly and therefore does not require a light skeleton for flight.",
    "Now considering 'aircraft', it is specifically designed to fly and typically employs a lightweight construction to enhance its ability to take off and remain airborne.",
    "Since 'aircraft' is the only option that directly relates to flight and involves a lightweight design to facilitate movement through the air, it stands out as the correct answer.",
    "We can further confirm that aircraft often use light materials such as aluminum and composite materials to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency.",
    "Considering all the options, the only suitable choice that meets the criteria of needing a light skeleton for flight is 'aircraft'."
