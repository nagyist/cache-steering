  "query": "Question: What does every person have that not every wolf has?\n\nChoices:\nA: human intelligence\nB: hide\nC: name\nD: mouth\nE: heart",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the key difference mentioned in the question: \"every person\" versus \"every wolf.\"",
    "Next, I consider the characteristics that are unique to humans compared to wolves.",
    "Now, I look at the options provided one by one:\n- A: human intelligence - This suggests a cognitive ability that is unique to humans.\n- B: hide - Both humans and wolves have skin, although the texture may differ.\n- C: name - Typically, humans are given names, while wolves do not have names in the same way.\n- D: mouth - Both humans and wolves have mouths for eating and communicating.\n- E: heart - Both humans and wolves have hearts as part of their anatomy.",
    "Next, I analyze each choice for uniqueness. While \"human intelligence\" is a strong candidate, it may be considered a spectrum rather than an absolute.",
    "The concept of a \"name\" stands out because names are a social construct specific to humans, reflecting identity and culture, which wolves do not possess.",
    "I double-check to ensure that names are explicitly tied to human identity and are not a notion applicable to wolves.",
    "In summary, while options A, D, and E relate to physical attributes or cognitive abilities that have parallels in the animal kingdom, option C (name) is distinctly attributed to humans and presents a clear differentiation."
