  "query": "Question: Where would you put condiments to stop them from combining with other condiments?\n\nChoices:\nA: cup\nB: refrigerator\nC: table\nD: pantry\nE: container",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what condiments are and how they are typically stored. Common condiments include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc.",
    "Next, I will look at the problem of condiments combining. This suggests a need for some kind of separation or containment method.",
    "Now, I will evaluate each choice. A \"cup\" (A) could hold condiments but doesn't necessarily stop them from combining in a larger space unless each condiment is in its own cup.",
    "Looking at \"refrigerator\" (B), it is a storage area that keeps condiments fresh but does not provide a solution to stop them from combining while stored.",
    "The \"table\" (C) is typically a serving area. This option wouldn't prevent condiments from mixing unless they are kept in separate containers on the table.",
    "Evaluating \"pantry\" (D), condiments could be stored there, but similar to the refrigerator, it does not address the combination issue.",
    "Finally, I look at \"container\" (E), which implies a specific storage solution where each condiment can be kept separate from others. Containers can be designed to hold individual condiments separately and prevent mixing.",
    "Therefore, the best choice for preventing condiments from combining is \"container\" since it offers a deliberate method of separation."
