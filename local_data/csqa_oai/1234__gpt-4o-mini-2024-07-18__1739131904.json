  "query": "Question: A shark isn't something you have to worry about at the lake in the woods, but there are plenty of dangers in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: great oceans\nB: great outdoors\nC: tropical waters\nD: pacific ocean\nE: gulf of mexico",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that a shark is not a concern in a lake, which indicates that we are considering environments where sharks typically exist.",
    "Sharks are known to inhabit oceanic waters, implying that the safety concerns related to them are typically found in large bodies of saltwater.",
    "The word \"dangers\" in the question suggests looking for an area that embraces the concept of risks associated with natural environments, potentially including wildlife or other inherent hazards.",
    "The phrase \"the great outdoors\" commonly refers to natural settings outside of urban areas, which can include forests, lakes, mountains, and also the ocean.",
    "Among the options given, \"great oceans,\" \"tropical waters,\" \"pacific ocean,\" and \"gulf of mexico\" specifically refer to oceanic environments but do not encompass the broad idea of outdoor dangers beyond just water-related risks.",
    "While the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean could present dangers, \"the great outdoors\" encapsulates the broader threats associated with various environments, including forests, lakes, and oceans.",
    "Given this reasoning, the option that best aligns with the concept of various dangers present in an expansive natural environment is \"the great outdoors.\""
