  "steps": [
    "To determine who is likely to use too much salt, I will analyze each choice provided and its relevance to salt consumption.",
    "Choice A: \"shaker\" refers to a device for dispensing salt. However, a shaker itself cannot use salt; it is just a tool.",
    "Choice B: \"fast food restaurant\" serves food that often contains higher amounts of salt to enhance flavor, and it's known for its heavier use of seasonings.",
    "Choice C: \"kitchen cupboard\" is a storage area for food and spices but does not indicate actual use of salt.",
    "Choice D: \"people\" refers to individuals who can vary greatly in their salt consumption habits, making it a broad category. However, some people do consume too much salt.",
    "Choice E: \"table\" is a surface where food is placed but does not directly relate to the usage of salt.",
    "From the analysis, the most relevant choices regarding excessive salt use are B (fast food restaurant) and D (people).",
    "Among these two, a fast food restaurant is more directly linked to the concept of using too much salt as a standard practice in its food preparation.",
    "While individuals can also use too much salt, it is more nuanced and varies by personal dietary choices, making B the stronger answer."
