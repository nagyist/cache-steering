  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a specific term that refers to flowers that have long-lasting qualities.",
    "Firstly, I should analyze the answer choices provided and see if any of them relate to the concept of flowers that last forever.",
    "Choice A, \"yellow,\" is a color and does not pertain to longevity or type of flower.",
    "Choice B, \"perennial,\" refers to plants that live for more than two years, often returning seasonally, which implies some form of lastingness.",
    "Choice C, \"orange,\" like choice A, is strictly a color and does not relate to long-lasting flowers.",
    "Choice D, \"pink,\" also a color, provides no relevant insight into the longevity of flowers.",
    "Choice E, \"never,\" does not pertain to flowers or their characteristics, but suggests the absence of lasting qualities.",
    "Considering the definitions, the term \"perennial\" aligns most closely with the concept of flowers that last multiple seasons or years, effectively suggesting a form of lasting nature.",
    "Thus, out of all the choices, \"perennial\" makes the most sense as an answer to the question."
