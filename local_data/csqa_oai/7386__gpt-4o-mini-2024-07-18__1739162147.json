  "query": "Question: The bird is young and still nesting, what is it likely to do soon?\n\nChoices:\nA: spread wings\nB: learn to fly\nC: squawk\nD: swim\nE: attempt to fly",
  "steps": [
    "The bird is described as young and still nesting, which indicates it is in the early stages of development.",
    "Typically, young birds that are nesting are preparing to leave the nest and become independent.",
    "One of the key activities that young birds engage in as they prepare to leave the nest is learning how to fly.",
    "While it is possible for a young bird to squawk, spread its wings, or even attempt to swim, these actions are less indicative of the bird's immediate next steps related to growth and independence.",
    "Since the bird is still in the nesting stage, it has not yet mastered flying, which means it would still be in the process of learning.",
    "Attempting to fly is a critical step in a young bird's development after it leaves the nest.",
    "Therefore, among the choices given, \"attempt to fly\" most accurately describes what the young bird is likely to do soon."
