  "query": "Question: Billy is an animal, but he is alergic to trees. He hates them very much.  Still, he wants to have a picnic and can't stand the idea of buying food from a restaurant.  Where would he have his picnic?\n\nChoices:\nA: addidas\nB: north america\nC: cafe\nD: outside\nE: woodland",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze that Billy is an animal, which implies he could be a person or represent a personification of an animal. However, despite him being allergic to trees, he is planning a picnic.",
    "Next, I note that he hates trees very much, which suggests he would avoid places with many trees, leading me to eliminate options that are directly associated with wooded areas.",
    "The options given are: A (addidas), B (north america), C (cafe), D (outside), and E (woodland).",
    "Option A (addidas) does not seem relevant for a picnic location since it refers to a brand and not an outdoor space.",
    "Option B (north america) is too broad and doesn't point to a specific location suitable for a picnic.",
    "Option C (cafe) could be a place to buy food, but Billy doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. Cafes are generally indoors, which may not constitute a traditional picnic.",
    "Option D (outside) suggests a wide range of possible locations but does not specify further and seems like a viable candidate since picnics are typically held outside.",
    "Option E (woodland) can be ruled out because of his allergy to trees and his strong dislike of them.",
    "Since the picnic must be outside but away from trees, the most logical choice from the remaining options is 'outside,' as this does not imply a specific location prone to trees."
