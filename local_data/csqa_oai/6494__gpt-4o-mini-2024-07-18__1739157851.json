  "query": "Question: The deep fryers used gallons and gallons of oil a week, the location was the busiest what in town?\n\nChoices:\nA: service station\nB: restaurant\nC: street\nD: ground\nE: auto parts store",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the clues given in the question. It mentions \"deep fryers\" and \"oil,\" which are typically associated with food preparation.",
    "Next, \"the location was the busiest\" suggests a place with high foot traffic or high demand for services, which aligns more with a food service location than an auto-related business or a street.",
    "Considering the options, a \"service station\" primarily deals with fuel and minor vehicle repairs, not deep frying.",
    "The option \"auto parts store\" also does not relate to food or deep frying and caters to mechanics and car enthusiasts rather than public food consumption.",
    "The choice \"street\" is too vague and does not specifically indicate a location that would use deep fryers or oil in a way that meets the context of the question.",
    "Now, looking at \"restaurant,\" this is a common establishment where deep frying is prevalent, especially in fast food or diners, which also attracts significant customer traffic.",
    "Given that deep fryers and oil are heavily used in restaurants, it makes sense that such a place could be \"the busiest location in town.\"",
    "Thus, comparing all the options, a restaurant fits perfectly with the context provided."
