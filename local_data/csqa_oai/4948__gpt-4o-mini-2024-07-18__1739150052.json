  "query": "Question: What do you put around a garden to keep animals out?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: fence\nC: ground\nD: vines\nE: full bloom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what is typically used to keep animals out of a garden.",
    "A \"park\" is not a structure meant to keep animals out; it's a recreational area.",
    "The term \"ground\" refers to the surface of the earth and does not imply a barrier or enclosure.",
    "\"Vines\" are plants that may grow around a garden, but they do not serve as a solid barrier against animals.",
    "\"Full bloom\" refers to plants or flowers at their peak growth, which again does not relate to creating a barrier.",
    "A \"fence\" is specifically designed to enclose an area and can effectively prevent animals from entering a garden.",
    "Considering all options, only the fence serves the purpose of keeping animals out of the garden.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer, given the choices, is to use a fence around a garden to prevent animals from entering."
