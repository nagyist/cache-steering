  "query": "Question: What is the natural instinct of someone not known as a fighter when filled with fear?\n\nChoices:\nA: commit perjury\nB: fight enemy\nC: run\nD: urinate\nE: sing off-key",
  "steps": [
    "The question addresses the natural instinct of someone who typically is not known to engage in fighting behaviors when experiencing fear.",
    "Common psychological responses to fear can often be categorized into three main instincts: fight, flight, or freeze.",
    "Individuals who are not fighters are less likely to engage in the \"fight\" response when afraid.",
    "Given that the instinctive \"flight\" response involves running away from danger, this is often the response chosen by those not inclined to physically fight.",
    "The answer choices include \"run,\" which clearly aligns with this \"flight\" instinct.",
    "Examining the other choices: \"commit perjury\" seems irrelevant and does not fit the context of a natural instinct related to fear. \"Fight enemy\" contradicts the idea that the person is not known as a fighter. \"Urinating\" could occur due to fear (known as fright), but it's not a primary instinctual response like fleeing. \"Sing off-key\" is inappropriate in the context of fear responses.",
    "Since the dominant instinct among the listed choices for someone filled with fear\u2014not identified as a fighter\u2014is to escape, this further solidifies \u201crun\u201d as the most suitable answer."
