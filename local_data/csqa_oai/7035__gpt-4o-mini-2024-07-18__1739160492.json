  "steps": [
    "First, identify the role of the equipment manager, which is to oversee and manage sports equipment for the team.",
    "Next, consider the context of the scenario where a team arrives for an away game. This implies they are traveling to a different location to play.",
    "The equipment manager took the equipment off the bus. This suggests he is responsible for transporting the equipment to the game location.",
    "Reflect on typical locations where a sports team would play an away game. Common venues include gyms, stadiums, or arenas.",
    "Analyze the options provided. The choices include school, sears, fair, arena, and mall.",
    "Eliminate \"school,\" as they are away from their home base. Likewise, \"sears,\" \"fair,\" and \"mall\" do not align with typical sports venues.",
    "That leaves \"arena.\" An arena is a fitting location for sports competitions and fits with the described scenario.",
    "Thus, it is logical to conclude that the equipment was taken to the arena for the game."
