  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the sentence. The phrase \"gave a good hands on\" suggests that the person is showing how to do something practically.",
    "Next, I will consider the choices provided. They could relate to methods of showing or places where work might be done.",
    "Looking at the choice \"A: demonstration,\" this term directly aligns with the idea of showing someone how to do something through practical examples, which fits perfectly in this context.",
    "Now, I will examine the other options. \"B: garage\" refers to a place for vehicles, which is unrelated to demonstrating work.",
    "The option \"C: building\" could relate to constructing something but is vague and doesn't specifically indicate showing how to do work.",
    "\"D: barn\" is similar to garage, relevant to agricultural context, and does not correlate with the action of demonstrating.",
    "\"E: synagogue\" refers to a place of worship and does not relate to hands-on demonstrations at all.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"A: demonstration\" clearly stands out as the most relevant choice for the context of giving practical guidance on how to perform work."
