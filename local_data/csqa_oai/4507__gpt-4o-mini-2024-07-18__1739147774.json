  "query": "Question: Charlie had a desire to learn, but didn't live near a school, so what did he do?\n\nChoices:\nA: attend school\nB: understand better\nC: memorize\nD: work in cafe\nE: read book",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Charlie had a desire to learn but did not live near a school. This implies that traditional schooling is not an option for him.",
    "Since Charlie cannot attend a regular school, we need to consider other methods he might use to pursue his desire for learning.",
    "Among the choices provided, we should look for alternatives that facilitate learning without formal schooling.",
    "Choice A, \"attend school,\" is not valid because Charlie does not live near a school.",
    "Choice B, \"understand better,\" is vague and does not specify an action he could take to learn.",
    "Choice C, \"memorize,\" suggests a method of learning but does not indicate a proactive approach to gaining knowledge.",
    "Choice D, \"work in cafe,\" does not relate to learning; it suggests employment rather than education.",
    "Choice E, \"read book,\" is a clear and accessible method of learning that Charlie could pursue since books require no formal schooling or special location.",
    "So, after evaluating all the options, the most logical action Charlie could take to learn without proximity to a school is to read a book."
