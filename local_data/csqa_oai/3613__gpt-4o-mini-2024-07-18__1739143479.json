  "query": "Question: What does there need to be for a shadow to appear?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: bright light\nC: bridge\nD: sunshine\nE: beam",
  "steps": [
    "To form a shadow, there needs to be an obstruction that blocks a light source.",
    "The most important factor for shadow formation is the presence of a light source.",
    "Among the choices provided, options such as \"bright light,\" \"sunshine,\" and \"beam\" refer to types of light sources.",
    "The option \"ground\" does not contribute to the creation of a shadow but merely provides a surface for the shadow to land on.",
    "The option \"bridge\" also does not inherently relate to the light source and is not necessary for shadow formation.",
    "Thus, we need to evaluate which choice best represents a requirement for a shadow, focusing on the light source.",
    "Both \"bright light\" and \"beam\" suggest a source of illumination, but \"bright light\" is more commonly understood as a source for shadows.",
    "The term \"sunshine\" is also a valid source of light capable of creating shadows, but it is more specific to sunlight.",
    "Therefore, although multiple options relate to the concept of light, \"bright light\" encompasses the generality without being specific to the sun.",
    "Ultimately, I will choose \"bright light\" as the best and most general answer that signifies the requirement for shadow creation."
