    "The question asks for a location to buy an icebox that was built a hundred years ago.",
    "Since the icebox is a historical item, it is unlikely to be found in a typical modern retail store, such as Walmart.",
    "Kitchens (choice A) do not sell items; they are rooms in houses where food is prepared.",
    "Homes (choice E) might have old iceboxes, but typically, individuals do not sell their personal belongings regularly unless they are actively trying to sell them.",
    "A junk yard (choice C) may have old items, but it is more associated with discarded materials rather than antique or collectible items.",
    "An antique store (choice B) specifically specializes in selling old or vintage items, including historical artifacts like a century-old icebox.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate location for purchasing an icebox built a hundred years ago would be an antique store."
