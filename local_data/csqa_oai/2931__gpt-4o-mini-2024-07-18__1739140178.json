  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify who typically keeps their cars in a designated parking area.",
    "Parking areas are commonly found in various locations such as apartment complexes, schools, amusement parks, and buildings.",
    "Among the choices provided, \u201cpeople\u201d is a general term that refers to individuals who may use parking areas.",
    "Although \"apartment complex\" and \"apartment building\" could refer to specific places where people park their cars, these terms denote the physical structure rather than the act of keeping a car.",
    "\u201cSchool yard\u201d typically refers more to an open area where school activities occur, not specifically to a parking area.",
    "\"Amusement park\" does have parking areas, but it is also a place where people go for entertainment.",
    "The term \"people\" encompasses all individuals who might park their cars in any of these parking areas.",
    "Thus, \"people\" is the most inclusive and accurate choice for the question of who keeps their cars in a parking area."
