    "The scenario involves laser light, which is typically intense and can be harmful to the eyes.",
    "The word \"hurt\" indicates that the experience was unpleasant or painful, likely due to the intensity of the light.",

    "Choice A, \"forceful,\" suggests something that has a strong effect, which may apply to intense light.",
    "Choice B, \"darkness,\" is not suitable since laser light is the opposite of darkness.",
    "Choice C, \"cumbersome,\" generally refers to something that is unwieldy or difficult to manage, which doesn't apply to light.",
    "Choice D, \"crucial,\" refers to something of great importance or critical necessity, which does not relate to the harmful effect of laser light.",
