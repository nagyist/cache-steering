  "query": "Question: Joe was a horse.  He lived in an American State. The environment was too cold for his taste.  Where did he probably live?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm yard\nB: arizona\nC: texas\nD: race track\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the characteristics of the environment mentioned in the question. Joe, being a horse, likely prefers warmer climates rather than cold ones.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided. The environments associated with each option can be evaluated based on their typical climates.",
    "Option A is a \"farm yard,\" which could be anywhere and varied in climate, but does not specify a cold environment.",
    "Option B is \"Arizona,\" which is known for its hot and arid climate. It does not fit the description of being too cold.",
    "Option C is \"Texas,\" which has a diverse climate, with some parts being warm to hot. However, northern Texas can be cold in winter.",
    "Option D is \"race track,\" which again does not point to a specific geographic location and could like farms be in various climates.",
    "Option E is \"Michigan,\" which is known for its cold weather, especially in winter. This fits the description of an environment that is too cold for Joe.",
    "Considering all options, Michigan is the most likely candidate for a cold environment. Arizona and Texas don't fit the description of being cold.",
    "Re-evaluating the options: since Joe lived in an American State, Michigan is a specific state that is particularly known for its cold weather conditions, more so than Texas, Arizona, or a generic farm or racetrack."
