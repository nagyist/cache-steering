  "query": "Question: What happens to most living things after death but not to mummies?\n\nChoices:\nA: rebirth\nB: last forever\nC: sadness\nD: burial\nE: decomposition",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what generally happens to living things after they die. Most biological organisms undergo a process known as decomposition, where their bodies break down due to the action of microorganisms and other environmental factors.",
    "Next, analyze the concept of mummies. Mummification is a process that preserves the body of the deceased, often by drying it out and inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi that would normally cause decomposition.",
    "Now, compare the post-death processes of typical organisms versus mummies. While most living things decompose and return to the ecosystem, mummies remain relatively intact and preserved for long periods of time due to the techniques employed during mummification.",
    "Evaluate the possible answers based on the reasoning so far. The process that does not happen to mummies but does happen to most living things is decomposition.",
    "Consider the choice options. \n- A (rebirth) does not fit, as it relates to a new life rather than what happens to a body after death.\n- B (last forever) is misleading as nothing lasts forever, but mummies do last longer than biological decomposition. \n- C (sadness) is a feeling, not a process that happens after death.\n- D (burial) refers to the act of putting a body underground, which is not specific to mummies.\n- E (decomposition) aligns with the understanding that most living things decompose, whereas mummies are preserved.",
    "Thus, the best answer that reflects what happens to most living organisms after death but not to mummies is indeed decomposition, as it is directly contradicted by the preservation of mummies."
