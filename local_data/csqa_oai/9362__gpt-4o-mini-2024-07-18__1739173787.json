  "query": "Question: Where would you find a dustbin that is being used?\n\nChoices:\nA: utility closet\nB: ground\nC: cupboard\nD: broom closet\nE: kitchen",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a dustbin is typically used for. A dustbin is a receptacle for waste or trash.",
    "Next, evaluate the probable locations where a dustbin would be placed based on its purpose. Common areas include places where waste is generated.",
    "Among the choices provided, the utility closet and broom closet are not primary locations for trash disposal as they are usually for cleaning supplies and tools.",
    "A cupboard could potentially store a dustbin, but it is not a practical or common place to find one being used.",
    "The ground is a plausible option, but it is not a typical or organized location for a dustbin. Dustbins are usually meant to be contained within a specific receptacle.",
    "The kitchen is a common area where waste accumulates, and it is typical to find a dustbin there for food scraps and other waste.",
    "Compare the likelihood of each option based on general usage patterns. The kitchen stands out as the most frequent site for a regularly used dustbin.",
    "By process of elimination, the kitchen is the only location on the list where a dustbin would clearly be in use, as it receives frequent waste throughout the day."
