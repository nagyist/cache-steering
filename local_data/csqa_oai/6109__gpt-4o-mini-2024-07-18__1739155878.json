  "query": "Question: Trains tend to come on time, airplanes on the other hand tend to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stall\nB: take off\nC: arrive late\nD: catch on fire\nE: carry freight",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we first need to identify the context: the comparison of the timeliness of trains versus airplanes.",
    "Trains are generally known for being relatively punctual, while airplanes have a reputation for having inconsistencies in their arrival times.",
    "Next, we evaluate the provided choices in relation to the notion of timeliness, particularly focusing on common perceptions about airplanes.",
    "Choice A, \"stall,\" does not directly relate to the timely arrival or schedule adherence of airplanes.",
    "Choice B, \"take off,\" implies that airplanes are operational but does not address the context of being on time or late.",
    "Choice C, \"arrive late,\" refers specifically to the frequent delays associated with airplane arrivals, which matches common public experiences and perceptions.",
    "Choice D, \"catch on fire,\" is an extreme and unrelated event that does not connect to timeliness or the norm of flight operations.",
    "Choice E, \"carry freight,\" is a function of airplanes but does not pertain to the issue of punctuality.",
    "Given the analysis, choice C is the only one that logically corresponds with the idea of the tendency of airplanes compared to trains."
