  "query": "Question: Lying can cause what when trying to find accurate information?\n\nChoices:\nA: distrust\nB: hurt feelings\nC: confusion\nD: good things\nE: unhappiness",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what lying can cause when trying to find accurate information.",
    "Lying typically undermines trust between individuals, which is crucial for accurate information exchange.",
    "When trust is broken, individuals may become skeptical and question the information they receive from others.",
    "This skepticism can lead to confusion, as people may find it hard to discern what is true and what is false.",
    "Next, I consider the other options: \"hurt feelings\" could occur, but it's not the primary consequence of lying when seeking accurate information.",
    "\"Good things\" is not a plausible outcome when discussing the effects of lying in this context.",
    "\"Unhappiness\" may be a result of interpersonal issues caused by lying, but it is also less direct than confusion regarding information.",
    "The strongest candidate for an outcome directly related to \"finding accurate information\" and the act of lying is confusion.",
    "You can infer that confusion specifically relates to misunderstanding information due to dishonesty."
