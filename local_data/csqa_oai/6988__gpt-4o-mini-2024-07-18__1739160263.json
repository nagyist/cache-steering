  "query": "Question: If there is a grocery store nearby it is in your what?\n\nChoices:\nA: neck of the woods\nB: town\nC: shopping center\nD: neighborhood\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the meaning of \"nearby.\" It indicates that the grocery store is close to a specific location, likely related to a community or area.",
    "Next, evaluate the potential choices. \"Neck of the woods\" suggests a specific area or region, often used informally to refer to someone's local neighborhood.",
    "Then, consider the term \"town.\" A grocery store could be located in a town, but it is less specific than other options.",
    "Examine \"shopping center.\" While grocery stores are often found in shopping centers, the question suggests a broader term related to locality rather than commercial structure.",
    "Next, evaluate \"neighborhood.\" This term directly refers to a residential area where people live and where a nearby grocery store would commonly be found.",
    "Lastly, consider \"street.\" This refers to a specific road and does not imply a broader area where a community gathers.",
    "Comparing all choices, \"neighborhood\" seems the most appropriate as it encompasses the concept of being nearby in a residential context."
