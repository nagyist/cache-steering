  "steps": [
    "Identify if tomato sauce is typically associated with certain locations or uses.",
    "Tomato sauce is a common ingredient in various dishes rather than a location.",
    "Consider where tomato sauce is often enjoyed\u2014dishes like pizza and pasta are prime examples.",
    "Among the options, \"pizza\" stands out as a specific dish that is well-known for its delicious use of tomato sauce.",
    "The other options, such as \"market,\" \"refrigerator,\" \"grown in vegetable garden,\" and \"cake,\" do not represent a dish or context where tomato sauce would be deemed delicious.",
    "Review that \"grown in vegetable garden\" refers to where tomatoes can be grown, not where sauce is consumed.",
    "A \"refrigerator\" may be where tomato sauce is stored but does not relate to its deliciousness.",
    "Additionally, while a \"market\" may sell tomato sauce, it is not where it is consumed.",
    "Thus, considering all options, \"pizza\" is the clear answer regarding where tomato sauce is delicious."
