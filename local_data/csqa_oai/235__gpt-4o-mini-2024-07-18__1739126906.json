  "query": "Question: The camper looked up at the vast night sky, it left him feeling mighty what?\n\nChoices:\nA: unimportant\nB: insignificant\nC: stellar\nD: somewhat\nE: helpless",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the emotional response of the camper when viewing the vast night sky. We need to determine which option best captures that feeling.",
    "The word \"vast\" suggests something large or extensive, which may evoke feelings of awe or smallness in the observer.",
    "Option A, \"unimportant,\" implies a feeling of not mattering in the grand scheme of things. This could be a possible response to a vast sky.",
    "Option B, \"insignificant,\" also conveys a sense of being small compared to the universe, which aligns with the feelings of the camper when looking at the night sky.",
    "Option C, \"stellar,\" refers to something related to stars, which could evoke a positive feeling associated with the beauty of the sky but does not directly express any emotional response.",
    "Option D, \"somewhat,\" is vague and does not provide a clear emotional reaction.",
    "Option E, \"helpless,\" could suggest a feeling of powerlessness, yet it's not as connected to the beauty of the night sky as the other options.",
    "The most suitable feelings that directly relate to looking at a vast night sky are \"unimportant\" and \"insignificant,\" as they reflect a sense of smallness. However, \"insignificant\" carries a stronger connotation of feeling overwhelmed by the vastness of the universe.",
    "Considering the context and emotional depth, \"insignificant\" seems to resonate more as it conveys a profound sense of being dwarfed by the night sky."
