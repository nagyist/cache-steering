  "query": "Question: What do people try to avoid?\n\nChoices:\nA: suffer pain\nB: talk to each other\nC: believe in god\nD: bank money\nE: wait in line",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what people generally seek to avoid in various contexts such as emotional, physical, and social situations.",
    "Next, analyze each of the options provided to determine if they represent something typically avoided by people.",
    "Looking at option A, \"suffer pain\" is something that many individuals actively try to avoid in order to maintain well-being and comfort.",
    "Evaluating option B, \"talk to each other,\" this is typically not something people avoid; in fact, many seek social interaction and communication.",
    "Considering option C, \"believe in god,\" the avoidance of belief varies by individual but is not a universal avoidance behavior.",
    "Assessing option D, \"bank money,\" while individuals may choose to avoid certain financial practices, generally, people do not avoid banking money outright.",
    "Finally, looking at option E, \"wait in line,\" this is a situation that many people dislike and try to avoid when possible.",
    "Comparing options A and E, both represent situations that people try to avoid, but \"suffer pain\" is a more fundamental and universal experience that people aim to eliminate in their lives compared to waiting in line.",
    "Since the aim is to identify the primary thing that people try to avoid, \"suffer pain\" stands out as the most significant on a broad scale."
