  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a location where animals commonly play or interact freely, which is the meaning of \"frolick.\"",
    "Fairgrounds (Choice A) are typically associated with human activities, such as fairs and carnivals, rather than a natural setting for animals.",
    "A kennel (Choice B) is a place for dogs to be kept, usually not a place where they frolick freely as they are confined.",
    "The surface of the earth (Choice C) is very broad and vague; it encompasses all habitats but does not specifically imply playful behavior of animals.",
    "A meadow (Choice D) is an open area of grassland which is a known natural habitat where many animals can play freely, making it a strong candidate for the answer.",
    "Zoos (Choice E) are places where animals are kept for public display, but the animals there are often confined and do not frolick in the same sense as in the wild.",
    "Comparing the choices, a meadow (D) is clearly a location where animals are free to frolick in their natural environment, unlike the other options.",
    "While the surface of the earth (C) includes meadows, it is not specific enough to be the best answer.",
    "After considering all the options and their meanings, the best choice for where animals frolick is clearly a meadow."
