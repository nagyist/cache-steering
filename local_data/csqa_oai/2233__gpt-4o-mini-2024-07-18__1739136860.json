  "query": "Question: When the woman was thinking about her failures in life, what did she feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: depression\nB: knowledge\nC: confused\nD: fatigue\nE: figure out",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context provided in the question. The woman was reflecting on her failures, which often leads to negative emotions and feelings of inadequacy.",
    "Second, I will consider the emotional responses commonly associated with reflecting on failures. These responses may include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, confusion, or being overwhelmed.",
    "Third, I will evaluate each choice in the context of the emotional responses to failures:\n- A: depression - This is a common emotional response to failures and setbacks.\n- B: knowledge - Reflecting on failures could lead to increased understanding, but it does not align with a feeling.\n- C: confused - It is possible for someone to feel confused about their failures and the path forward.\n- D: fatigue - While reflecting on failures can be exhausting, fatigue isn't necessarily a direct emotional response to thoughts of failure.\n- E: figure out - This is an action, not a feeling.",
    "Fourth, I should weigh the most fitting emotional response based on common psychological insights. Depression and confusion are both reasonable outcomes of contemplating failures.",
    "Fifth, I will consider the strength of the emotions. Depression (A) suggests a deeper emotional impact, while confusion (C) indicates uncertainty.",
    "Sixth, I will assess which choice is more likely to capture the woman's emotional state. Reflection on failures commonly leads to feelings of depression over confusion.",
    "Seventh, I need to consider the potential for both options being valid responses, but which one more directly aligns with the emotional weight of reflecting on failures.",
    "Eighth, by comparing the emotional states, I prioritize feelings associated with deeper sadness over uncertainty.",
    "Ninth, I will finalize my evaluation by confirming that depression reflects a more profound struggle with the concept of failure than confusion, which may be more superficial.",
    "Finally, I select the strongest candidate based on these reflections."
