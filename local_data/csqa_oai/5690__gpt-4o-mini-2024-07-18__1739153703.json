  "query": "Question: If there is something you have to accomplish in a short amount of time, how could you be successful?\n\nChoices:\nA: make haste\nB: make trouble\nC: make lunch\nD: make war\nE: make progress",
  "steps": [
    "The goal is to accomplish something in a short amount of time, so I need to consider what actions will lead to success quickly.",
    "\"Make haste\" suggests doing something quickly, which aligns with the need to act fast to complete the task.",
    "\"Make trouble\" does not contribute to accomplishing a task; rather, it could hinder progress, so this option is unlikely to be successful.",
    "\"Make lunch\" typically does not correlate with accomplishing a task, unless the task itself is making lunch, which is not stated as such.",
    "\"Make war\" is not relevant to accomplishing tasks in a general sense and would likely lead to more complexity and time consumption.",
    "\"Make progress\" focuses on forward movement towards a goal, but does not necessarily imply speed; success can also be achieved without urgency.",
    "Evaluating all options, \"make haste\" is the most directly related to acting quickly to ensure the task is completed in a short timeframe.",
    "Therefore, among the options presented, \"make haste\" clearly emphasizes the urgency needed to succeed within a brief time limit."
