  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the action taken when analyzing a subject at great length.",
    "The phrase \"at great length\" suggests that the action involves a comprehensive and deep exploration of the subject.",
    "Option A, \"look at,\" implies merely observing or viewing the subject, which does not necessarily involve deep analysis.",
    "Option B, \"use calculator,\" relates more to numerical calculations and doesn\u2019t address the broader concept of analyzing a subject.",
    "Option C, \"come to conclusion,\" involves a result of analysis but does not refer to the process of analysis itself.",
    "Option D, \"learn new,\" suggests acquiring new information, which could be part of analysis, but doesn't fully capture the essence of deep analysis.",
    "Option E, \"think about,\" aligns with the notion of contemplating and reflecting on the subject, which is essential for analysis.",
    "Among the options, considering the depth of thought and contemplation needed, \"think about\" seems the most relevant to analyzing a subject thoroughly.",
    "Thus, the action of thinking deeply and critically aligns with the definition of analyzing a subject at great length."
