  "query": "Question: Where can a vegetarian restaurant be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: san francisco\nB: anywhere\nC: downtown\nD: most cities\nE: in the country",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the definition of a vegetarian restaurant. A vegetarian restaurant is a place that primarily serves food without meat, and it can exist in various settings.",
    "Next, assess the options given. \"A: san francisco\" is a specific location, but it may not encompass all possible vegetarian restaurants.",
    "Then, \"B: anywhere\" suggests that vegetarian restaurants can be found in any location, which appears to be a strong possibility since they can exist in diverse settings, from urban to rural.",
    "After that, analyze \"C: downtown.\" While many cities have vegetarian restaurants in downtown areas, this is still too specific compared to the broader possibilities.",
    "Next, evaluate \"D: most cities.\" This option implies that a majority of cities have vegetarian restaurants, which is likely true but doesn\u2019t account for every potential location.",
    "Then, look at \"E: in the country.\" Though vegetarian restaurants can be in rural areas, saying they exist \"in the country\" is still too limiting compared to the global presence of such restaurants.",
    "Compare the broadness of \"B: anywhere\" with other potential options. It covers the existence of vegetarian restaurants without restriction.",
    "Confirm that all other options are either too specific or not comprehensive enough compared to \"B: anywhere.\"",
    "Conclude that \"B: anywhere\" encompasses the notion that vegetarian restaurants can be found in any location, making it the best answer."
