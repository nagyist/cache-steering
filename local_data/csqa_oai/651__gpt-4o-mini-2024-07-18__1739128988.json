  "query": "Question: What is a parents primary duty?\n\nChoices:\nA: speak freely\nB: happiness of a child\nC: care for children\nD: school child\nE: control children",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a parent's primary duty is, which requires an understanding of parental responsibilities.",
    "Option A, \"speak freely\", does not specifically relate to the responsibilities of a parent and can apply to anyone.",
    "Option B, \"happiness of a child\", although important, is an outcome rather than a direct duty. Parents aim for the happiness of their children but cannot control it fully.",
    "Option C, \"care for children\", directly relates to the fundamental responsibility of parents, including providing for their physical, emotional, and psychological needs.",
    "Option D, \"school child\", while education is a duty of parents, it is more specific than the general care parents are expected to provide.",
    "Option E, \"control children\", implies a restrictive approach rather than the nurturing that is typically associated with parental duties.",
    "Comparing all options, Option C seems to encompass the most significant and broad responsibility that parents have towards their children.",
    "Thus, the primary duty of a parent encapsulates more than just one aspect, but the act of caring for children includes love, support, guidance, and upbringing."
