  "query": "Question: What indoor facility would hold an airplane?\n\nChoices:\nA: hanger\nB: propellers\nC: sky\nD: military base\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "To understand which facility could hold an airplane, I need to consider what kind of structure is capable of housing large vehicles.",
    "An airplane is a large aircraft, and housing it requires a significant amount of space.",
    "A \"hanger\" (often spelled \"hangar\") is a structure specifically designed for sheltering aircraft, providing enough room for maintenance and storage.",
    "Next, I evaluate the other options: \n- \"propellers\" are parts of an airplane, not a facility.\n- \"sky\" is an open space and cannot hold anything.\n- A \"military base\" could potentially have a hangar but isn't specifically a facility designed solely for housing airplanes.\n- A \"garden\" is an outdoor area for plants and does not accommodate aircraft.",
    "Since \"hangar\" directly denotes a facility for housing aircraft, it is the most appropriate answer."
