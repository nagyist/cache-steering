  "query": "Question: The man on the street corner was showing off a wristwatch, he was trying to what it for drug money?\n\nChoices:\nA: jewelry store\nB: case\nC: hock\nD: watch store\nE: pawn",
  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a man trying to sell or obtain money for his wristwatch.",
    "\"Hocking\" something means to pawn it or sell it, usually in a way that implies a temporary transaction where the item could be reclaimed later.",
    "The context of needing drug money suggests that the man is in urgent need of cash, which aligns with the idea of pawning a valuable item.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"hock\" specifically refers to the act of pawning an item, which fits the context of the scenario.",
    "The other choices do not directly relate to obtaining cash for the watch in the same manner:\n- A (jewelry store) doesn\u2019t imply a need for urgent cash.\n- B (case) seems unrelated.\n- D (watch store) indicates selling but lacks the pawning connotation.\n- E (pawn) is close but isn\u2019t a verb and doesn\u2019t fit as well as hock in this case.",
    "Therefore, considering the need for immediate cash and the action of pawning, the best fit is \"hock.\""
