  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what you might see in the air at night that has blinking lights.",
    "The choices provided include various scenarios, but not all of them realistically involve blinking lights in the air.",
    "Option A (\"carnival\") generally refers to a fair or festival on the ground, where lights are typically fixed to rides and tents, not blinking lights in the air.",
    "Option B (\"plane\") is a likely candidate since airplanes have blinking lights on their wings and tails that are visible at night.",
    "Option C (\"concert\") might involve lights, but they would usually be spotlights or stage lights directed at the crowd and not blinking lights in the air.",
    "Option D (\"turned at night\") does not provide a relevant context to blinking lights; it seems nonsensical in this scenario.",
    "Option E (\"a penguin's bum\") is obviously irrelevant and does not relate to the concept of blinking lights at night in the air.",
    "Considering only the relevant options, the only choice that directly relates to seeing blinking lights in the air at night is option B.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the most logical answer is associated with seeing airplanes which have blinking lights."
