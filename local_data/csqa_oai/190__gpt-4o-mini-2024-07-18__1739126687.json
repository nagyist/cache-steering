  "query": "Question: After his mother saw his report card he knew he was going to be doing housework, what could have prevented this?\n\nChoices:\nA: sneezing\nB: fatigue\nC: house clean\nD: feeling satisfied\nE: getting good grades",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves a scenario where a student received a bad report card and as a consequence, he will be assigned housework by his mother.",
    "To determine what could have prevented this situation, I need to identify the root cause of the consequence, which is the poor performance reflected in the report card.",
    "The implication is that if the student had performed better academically, he would not face consequences like having to do housework.",
    "Now, I analyze the available choices to find one that could logically prevent receiving a bad report card.",
    "Choice A: sneezing \u2013 This does not relate to academic performance or the report card at all.",
    "Choice B: fatigue \u2013 While fatigue can affect performance, it doesn't directly improve the situation leading to the poor grades.",
    "Choice C: house clean \u2013 This refers to the consequence itself rather than a preventive measure.",
    "Choice D: feeling satisfied \u2013 This pertains to emotional state but does not influence report card performance.",
    "Choice E: getting good grades \u2013 This is directly related to the scenario as achieving good grades would prevent the negative consequences from occurring, such as doing housework.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the best answer is that getting good grades could have prevented the situation from arising."
