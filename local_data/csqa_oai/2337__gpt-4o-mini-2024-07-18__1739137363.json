  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where a person might seek urgent care for a wound.",
    "A wound typically requires immediate medical attention, particularly if it is serious.",
    "Possible locations for urgent care include various medical facilities designed to treat injuries.",
    "The choices presented are A: body, B: injury, C: patient, D: emergency room, and E: hospital.",
    "A: body and B: injury do not represent places where care can be provided; they describe conditions or states rather than locations.",
    "C: patient describes a person receiving care but is not a location for urgent treatment.",
    "D: emergency room is specifically designed for urgent and emergency cases, making it a suitable place for treating wounds.",
    "E: hospital encompasses a broader range of services, including emergency rooms.",
    "While both the emergency room (D) and hospital (E) are viable options, the urgency implied in the question leads one to prefer the emergency room specifically over the hospital in general.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer, which directly corresponds to urgent care for a wound, is the emergency room."
