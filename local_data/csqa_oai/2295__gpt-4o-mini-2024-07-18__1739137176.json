  "query": "Question: I am looking for a gift for someone I barely know, where do I look?\n\nChoices:\nA: specialty store\nB: christmas tree\nC: lost and found\nD: department store\nE: party",
  "steps": [
    "The gift is intended for someone I barely know, which suggests that I need a location where I can find a wide variety of neutral or general gifts.",
    "A specialty store may have unique items, but it may not have something universally appealing or suitable for someone I don't know well, which decreases its viability.",
    "A Christmas tree implies a specific holiday context, and gifts placed under it are likely personalized or themed for that occasion, which might not suit my situation since I barely know the person.",
    "A lost and found typically contains lost items that are not intended as gifts for someone, making it an unsuitable choice for finding a gift.",
    "A party is a social event rather than a shopping location, so it wouldn't be a feasible option for purchasing a gift.",
    "A department store provides a large selection of general merchandise, ranging from clothing to home goods, which can cater to various tastes and needs without the requirement of personal insight into the individual's preferences.",
    "Since a department store offers accessibility to a wide range of suitable gifts, it stands out as the best option among the choices provided."
