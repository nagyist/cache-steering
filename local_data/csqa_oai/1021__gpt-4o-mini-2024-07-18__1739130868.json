  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where mail is typically stored after being brought inside.",
    "The options given are a neighbor's house, post office, fridge, table, and bathroom.",
    "A neighbor's house (option A) is not appropriate because I likely wouldn't put my own mail there.",
    "The post office (option B) is also not suitable, as I brought the mail in, meaning it is already in my possession.",
    "The fridge (option C) does not make sense as a place to store mail; it's primarily for food items.",
    "The bathroom (option E) is not a logical place for mail storage either.",
    "The only option remaining is the table (option D), which is a common location for sorting or temporarily placing mail.",
    "Since the other options do not fit the context of where mail would typically be placed upon entry, the logical choice is to put it on the table."
