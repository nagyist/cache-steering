  "query": "Question: Sam tried to go to sleep, but he couldn't.  He suffered from what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stay awake\nB: exhausted\nC: being awake\nD: wakefulness\nE: bed",
  "steps": [
    "Sam attempted to go to sleep but was unable to do so. This suggests that there is a reason preventing him from falling asleep.",
    "The reason provided in the statement indicates that he is not falling asleep but is instead remaining in a state of consciousness.",
    "The options provided must reflect a state or condition related to his inability to sleep.",
    "Option A (\"stay awake\") implies a desire to sleep but failing to do so, which is somewhat relevant but not a term for his condition.",
    "Option B (\"exhausted\") refers to a state of being tired, which could be true, but it doesn't directly describe the inability to sleep itself.",
    "Option C (\"being awake\") describes his current state; however, it\u2019s quite general and doesn\u2019t specifically address the inability to sleep.",
    "Option D (\"wakefulness\") refers specifically to the state of being awake, which directly correlates with the fact that he cannot fall asleep.",
    "Option E (\"bed\") relates to the location where sleep typically occurs, but it does not describe Sam's condition of not being able to sleep.",
    "Among the options, \"wakefulness\" (D) is the most accurate term to describe the state Sam is in when he can't fall asleep."
