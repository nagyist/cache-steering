  "query": "Question: Where could someone find a blue apple tree?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden center\nB: washington state\nC: coloring book\nD: florida\nE: math problem",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the choices to determine where a blue apple tree can logically be found.",
    "A blue apple tree is not a naturally occurring phenomenon, as apples do not grow blue in reality. Thus, choices that imply a natural setting must be scrutinized.",
    "Choice A, \"garden center,\" is a place where various types of plants are sold, but it does not guarantee the presence of a blue apple tree, as it doesn't exist in nature.",
    "Choice B, \"Washington state,\" and D, \"Florida,\" refer to geographical locations known for apple orchards and agriculture, but again, apples are not naturally blue.",
    "Looking at choice C, \"coloring book,\" this is a medium where illustrations can depict anything artistically, including trees with blue apples. This is a plausible option for finding a blue apple tree in a non-literal sense.",
    "Choice E, \"math problem,\" does not relate to physical objects and thus cannot contain a blue apple tree, as math problems focus on numerical concepts.",
    "Given the previous analysis, the only option where one could reasonably find a blue apple tree is in a creative or imaginative context\u2014namely in a coloring book.",
    "I will affirm that choice C is the correct answer based on the consideration that blue apple trees exist only in fictive contexts."
