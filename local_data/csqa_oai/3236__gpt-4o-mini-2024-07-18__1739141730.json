  "query": "Question: Where do you keep perishable food for a longer time?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: trash can\nC: store\nD: freezer\nE: home",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what perishable food is. Perishable food refers to items that can spoil or decay quickly, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and meats.",
    "Next, we need to identify the environments where perishable food can be stored effectively to extend its shelf life.",
    "A table typically does not provide any temperature control, which means perishable food would spoil quickly if left there.",
    "A trash can is generally used for disposal, and while it may contain some spoiled food, it does not preserve food for a longer time.",
    "A store could mean a retail environment where food is kept, but it is not a personal method of storing food at home. It's meant for selling rather than preserving for personal use.",
    "A freezer, however, is designed specifically for keeping food at lower temperatures to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life significantly.",
    "While a home may contain various methods of food storage, the question specifically asks for which option keeps perishable food for a longer time.",
    "Among the choices, the freezer clearly stands out as the best option for prolonging the freshness and safety of perishable food items."
