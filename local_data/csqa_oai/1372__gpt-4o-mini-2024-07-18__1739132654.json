  "query": "Question: Where can you find cord along side nails and bolts?\n\nChoices:\nA: delivery room\nB: garage\nC: sporting goods store\nD: office\nE: hardware store",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where cord can typically be found alongside nails and bolts.",
    "First, I consider what types of places typically sell or store items related to construction or repairs, as nails and bolts are commonly associated with such tasks.",
    "A delivery room is generally associated with non-construction-related items, so it can be ruled out.",
    "A garage might contain tools, but it is usually a place for parking vehicles rather than a retail space, so while it can have these items, it is not a primary location to find them for sale.",
    "A sporting goods store focuses on equipment for sports and outdoor activities, which generally would not include nails, bolts, or cord.",
    "Offices typically contain office supplies and equipment, nowhere near nails or bolts, so it can be eliminated as well.",
    "This leaves the hardware store, which is specifically designed to sell a wide array of hardware items, including nails, bolts, and cords for various projects.",
    "Since the question asks for a place where they can all be found together, the hardware store is the most appropriate option as it is known for carrying all these items."
