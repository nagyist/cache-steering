    "Anger (Choice A) can occur in competitive situations, but it is typically more about frustration at one's own performance or at the opponents, rather than admiration leading to anger.",
    "Wins (Choice B) isn't a feeling; it's an outcome. The question is about emotions, making this option irrelevant.",
    "Jealousy (Choice C) is a common reaction when one observes others succeeding while oneself is failing. It encompasses feelings of envy and longing for what the opponents have achieved.",
    "Seeing work (Choice D) does not represent an emotional response but rather an observation; it's also irrelevant in the context of feelings associated with competition.",
    "Hatred (Choice E) indicates a strong negative sentiment but would not typically stem from merely admiring an opponent's score. Thus, while possible, it is likely too extreme compared to jealousy.",
