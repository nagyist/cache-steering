  "steps": [
    "The question presents a college student who is interested in meeting people.",
    "However, it specifies that the student has a limitation or dislike that affects his ability to meet people.",
    "The choices provided reflect different activities or behaviors that could relate to meeting people.",
    "I will evaluate each option to see which one makes the most sense in the context of not wanting to meet people.",
    "Option A: \"take class\" - While it's possible that taking classes could help the student meet people, it\u2019s not inherently a social setting. Dislike for this could still allow for socializing in other areas.",
    "Option B: \"friendly\" - This option is not a verb or action the student is avoiding; therefore, it doesn\u2019t fit.",
    "Option C: \"go to parties\" - This is a clear social setting where meeting people is a goal. Disliking to go to parties would directly hinder the student from meeting people.",
    "Option D and E: both state \"go outside.\" This could relate to outdoor social activities, but it\u2019s broad and doesn\u2019t directly connect to meeting people specifically.",
    "After careful consideration, option C stands out as it directly addresses the student\u2019s desire to meet people while indicating a specific aversion that would prevent that from happening."
