  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of a dictionary. It is a reference book that provides definitions, word origins, and usage examples.",
    "Next, think about where dictionaries are typically placed in a house. Common locations include shelves, desks, or tables where it can be easily accessed.",
    "Now evaluate the options: A shelf could hold multiple books, including a dictionary. It\u2019s a common place for storage.",
    "The library usually contains numerous books and could also house a dictionary, but it is not a singular location in a typical house setting.",
    "A classroom would generally be a place for dictionaries used by students rather than personal use in a home setting.",
    "A table is a surface where the dictionary could temporarily be placed but is not a designated storage area.",
    "A desk is a functional location where dictionaries might be kept for easy access, especially if one is working or studying.",
    "Comparing the most appropriate places, a shelf can store it best, while a desk is also suitable but suggests more personal use.",
    "The library is less applicable since it refers more to shared spaces and not typically a house.",
    "Between A (shelf) and E (desk), placing a dictionary on a shelf seems the most logical as it provides a dedicated space for the book."
