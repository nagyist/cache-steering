  "query": "Question: Where could you find out about a cow that does not exist?\n\nChoices:\nA: story book\nB: great outdoors\nC: field\nD: toy store\nE: barnyard",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the phrase \"a cow that does not exist.\" This implies that the cow is fictional or imaginary.",
    "Evaluate option A: story book. This is a plausible choice because storybooks often contain fictional characters, including imaginary animals like cows.",
    "Evaluate option B: great outdoors. This option suggests a real environment where actual animals can be found, but it wouldn't contain non-existent cows, as they wouldn't be present in reality.",
    "Evaluate option C: field. Similar to the great outdoors, a field would typically have real cows, not non-existent ones.",
    "Evaluate option D: toy store. This could be a potential option since toy stores sell toy cows, which could represent fictional or non-existent cows in a playful sense.",
    "Evaluate option E: barnyard. This option refers to a real-life setting typically associated with actual cows, so it would not be a suitable place to find information about a non-existent cow.",
    "Among the considered options, the storybook (A) and toy store (D) stand out as places that could contain information about a fictional cow.",
    "Between these two, a storybook is more directly associated with narratives about imaginary animals, while a toy store focuses more on tangible products and less on the narrative aspect.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the best answer is option A, a story book, as it is specifically designed for storytelling, which includes non-existent characters."
