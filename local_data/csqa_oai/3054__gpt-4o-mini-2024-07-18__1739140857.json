  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the question, which states that the person wanted to make money. The primary motivation is clear: they are seeking to increase their financial assets.",
    "Next, we look at the choices provided and their relevance to making money. \"Mint\" (A) could relate to creating currency, but it is not a practical or feasible action for an individual.",
    "Then, we consider \"selling things\" (B). This is a direct method individuals often use to generate income, aligning well with the intent to make money.",
    "We can disregard \"cross street\" (C) since merely crossing a street does not inherently relate to earning money.",
    "Next, we evaluate \"feel resentful\" (D). Feeling resentful does not contribute to making money; it is an emotional state and does not lead to financial gain.",
    "Lastly, we consider \u201cmachine part\u201d (E). While this could be sold, it does not represent an action towards making money but rather an item that one might sell.",
    "Thus, among the options, the most direct action that a person would take to make money is by selling things (B), which is a common and straightforward method."
