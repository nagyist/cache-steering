  "query": "Question: What can go on a football field?\n\nChoices:\nA: oklahoma\nB: university\nC: college campus\nD: players\nE: yard",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what is commonly found on a football field.",
    "A football field is primarily used for playing the sport of football, which involves players.",
    "Now, looking at the choices, \"players\" is a crucial element of any game played on the field.",
    "\"Yard\" refers to a unit of measurement used in the context of football (for example, yard lines) but it's not something that physically \"goes on\" the field in the sense of being a participant or an item.",
    "\"Oklahoma,\" \"university,\" and \"college campus\" are not directly something that occupies or goes on the field itself but may refer to institutions or locations where football is played.",
    "Since \"players\" directly engages with the activity of playing on a football field, it stands out as the most relevant choice.",
    "I will now confirm that out of the options, \"players\" is indeed a fundamental component of a game played on a football field.",
    "Thus, after reviewing all options and their relevance to the football field, the only fitting answer is \"players.\""
