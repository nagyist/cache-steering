  "query": "Question: John plays brass instruments in a band that has a lot of diverse people in it and many different instruments.   They mostly play at clubs.  What sort of band might he be in.\n\nChoices:\nA: rubber band\nB: annoy mom\nC: brass band\nD: marching band\nE: jazz band",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question. John plays brass instruments, which suggests that the band he is in may focus on brass music.",
    "Next, we need to consider the type of bands associated with brass instruments. The most obvious types of bands that feature brass instruments include brass bands and jazz bands.",
    "We are told the band has a lot of diverse people and instruments. A jazz band typically includes a variety of instruments beyond just brass, including woodwinds and rhythm instruments, which fits the description of diversity.",
    "On the other hand, a brass band primarily focuses on brass instruments, which might not encompass the diversity indicated in the question.",
    "We also have \"marching band\" as an option, but marching bands usually have a set structure and do not primarily play in clubs, which contradicts the scenario described where they mostly play at clubs.",
    "The option \"rubber band\" is irrelevant as it is not a type of musical band and has nothing to do with brass instruments.",
    "The option \"annoy mom\" does not apply to a musical group context and is not a valid answer.",
    "Given the informality of club performances and the presence of diverse instrumentation, we lean towards jazz as a fitting genre.",
    "Thus, analyzing the choices against the criteria given (brass instruments, diversity, club performances), we conclude that the most appropriate answer is \"jazz band.\""
