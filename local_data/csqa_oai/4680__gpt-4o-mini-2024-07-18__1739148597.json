  "query": "Question: Where in a house can you find toilet paper?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: cabinet\nC: bathroom\nD: kitchen\nE: rest area",
  "steps": [
    "Identify where toilet paper is typically stored or found in a household setting.",
    "Consider common areas of the house and their associated items. Toilet paper is primarily used in restrooms.",
    "Evaluate each choice provided to determine the most likely location for toilet paper.",
    "A grocery store is an incorrect choice, as it is a retail location where you purchase toilet paper, not where it is commonly stored.",
    "A cabinet could potentially hold toilet paper, but it is not the most direct or common place to find it in everyday use.",
    "The bathroom is the primary location where toilet paper is stored and used. This makes it a strong candidate.",
    "The kitchen typically does not have toilet paper as it is associated with food-related items.",
    "A \"rest area\" is a general term and could refer to various locations; it is not specific enough to pinpoint toilet paper's typical placement.",
    "Contrasting all the options, the bathroom stands out as the simplest and most direct answer for where toilet paper is commonly found."
