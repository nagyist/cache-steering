  "query": "Question: An expressway can suffer from traffic, this traffic gets worse the closer you get to any what?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: map\nC: american city\nD: rest stops\nE: country",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what the traffic on an expressway worsens towards, we should consider common traffic patterns and causes. Typically, traffic congestion increases as one approaches areas with higher population densities or points of interest.",
    "Next, we evaluate the answer choices in relation to this observation. Choices like \"michigan\" and \"country\" are too vague and likely pertain to larger or less specific areas rather than specific zones where traffic typically spikes.",
    "We also need to consider \"map\" in this context. A map is a representation and does not contribute to or cause traffic, so this choice is not relevant.",
    "Next, looking at \"rest stops,\" while they may cause localized traffic, they are not locations where traffic worsens significantly compared to approaching more congested areas.",
    "Then, we consider \"american city.\" American cities are typically populated areas with a high concentration of vehicles, businesses, and residents, leading to worse traffic when approached.",
    "Based on the evaluations, \"american city\" makes the most sense, as cities often serve as traffic magnets due to their urban density and activity, causing expressway traffic to increase as one nears them.",
    "Thus, after eliminating the other options, we can confidently conclude that traffic gets worse the closer you get to an \"american city.\""
