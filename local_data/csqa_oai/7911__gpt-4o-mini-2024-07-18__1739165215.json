  "query": "Question: Where is a blanket useful to cover a horse?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: hospital\nC: michigan\nD: backpack\nE: shoe",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context in which a blanket would be used for a horse. Horses may need blankets for protection from cold weather or for comfort in other situations.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided: A: bedroom, B: hospital, C: michigan, D: backpack, E: shoe.",
    "I can rule out options A (bedroom) and B (hospital) as these are not relevant locations for a horse.",
    "Option D (backpack) is not suitable because a backpack is not an environment where a horse would be covered with a blanket.",
    "Option E (shoe) does not relate to where a blanket is useful for a horse, as it\u2019s not a relevant context.",
    "The only option left is C (Michigan). Michigan can be an environment where horses are kept and could need blankets due to the colder weather during certain seasons.",
    "I will double-check the connection between horses and the need for blankets in Michigan specifically. Michigan has a climate that requires horses to be blanketed during cold weather.",
    "After evaluating all choices and considering the context, it is clear that a blanket could be useful to cover a horse in Michigan due to the state's climate conditions."
