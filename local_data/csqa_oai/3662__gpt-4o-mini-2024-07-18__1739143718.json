  "query": "Question: Where would you find a monitor wall that is used for visualizing sounds?\n\nChoices:\nA: cinema\nB: studios\nC: tv station\nD: department store\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the role of a monitor wall in various environments. A monitor wall can display visualizations and data related to sound, which is useful in fields that require audio analysis or broadcasting.",
    "Next, consider each of the choices. A cinema primarily focuses on video content for entertainment and might not have extensive audio visualization tools.",
    "Then, examine the option of studios. Studios, particularly music and audio production studios, often use monitor walls to visualize sound and audio waves during recording and mixing sessions.",
    "Now, evaluate the option of a TV station. TV stations often require sound monitoring and might use monitor walls to visualize audio for live broadcasting or production purposes.",
    "Next, consider the department store. Department stores do not typically have sound monitoring tools or visualizations as their focus is on retail rather than audio production or broadcasting.",
    "Finally, look at the option of hospitals. While hospitals may use sound for various monitoring devices, they do not typically use monitor walls for visualizing sounds like those found in studios or TV stations.",
    "After analyzing the roles of each option, both B (studios) and C (TV stations) are likely candidates. However, studios are specifically designed for sound manipulation and visualization, making it the most likely place for a monitor wall used for visualizing sounds."
