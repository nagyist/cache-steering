  "query": "Question: Where should a human go if they have a full feeling in their bladder?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: outside\nC: restroom\nD: cornfield\nE: star trek",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves a physiological condition, specifically a feeling of fullness in the bladder, which typically indicates the need to urinate.",
    "The most logical place for a person to relieve themselves when they have this feeling is an appropriate facility designed for that purpose.",
    "Among the given options, the one that is specifically designed for urination is the restroom.",
    "School and outside could be options if no restroom is available, but they are not ideal for immediate relief.",
    "A cornfield is not a conventional or polite option for relieving oneself, even if it might be possible in a secluded area.",
    "Star Trek is irrelevant as it has no connection to the physiological need being addressed.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice that directly relates to the need to relieve bladder pressure is the restroom."
