  "query": "Question: If people are bowing before a statue, what are they likely doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: believe in god\nB: worship idols\nC: knees\nD: hope for peace\nE: form opinions",
  "steps": [
    "The action of bowing typically indicates a gesture of respect or reverence toward something or someone.",
    "When people bow before a statue, it often signifies they are acknowledging the significance of that statue, which could be a representation of a deity or a revered figure.",
    "Given that many statues are associated with religious or spiritual beliefs, this action is commonly interpreted as worship.",
    "The term \"worship idols\" is closely aligned with the idea of showing reverence toward statues, especially in the context of certain religions where statues represent gods or spiritual figures.",
    "While other options (like hoping for peace) could loosely relate to actions taken in some spiritual contexts, they don't pertain directly to the specific act of bowing before a statue.",
    "The choice \"believe in god\" is too broad, as not every instance of bowing before a statue directly relates to a belief in a deity, particularly since some traditions do not emphasize formal worship of gods.",
    "The option \"knees\" does not relate directly to the action but rather describes a part of the body, making it irrelevant to the question.",
    "The choice \"form opinions\" does not connect to the act of bowing before a statue, as this is more about contemplation rather than direct action.",
    "Thus, the most accurate interpretation of people bowing before a statue is that they are engaged in the act of worshiping that statue, which can be summarized by the option \"worship idols.\""
