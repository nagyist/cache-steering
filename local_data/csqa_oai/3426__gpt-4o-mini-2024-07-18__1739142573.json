  "steps": [
    "I start by understanding the context of the question, which mentions \"more people getting in line.\"",
    "If more people are entering a line, it affects the overall experience and dynamics of the line.",
    "One immediate consequence of having more people in line is that individuals will have to wait longer to be served or reach their destination.",
    "This delay in reaching the front of the line can lead to feelings of impatience or frustration, but that is an emotional response, not a direct result.",
    "Thinking specifically about the structure of the line itself, more people mean that the line physically extends further than it would with fewer people.",
    "Longer queues tend to develop which lengthens the wait times for everyone involved.",
    "Looking at the options provided, I can begin eliminating some.",
    "Option A (anxiety) and C (late) are more related to emotional responses or outcomes rather than direct results of more people in line.",
    "Option B (wait turn) describes an action people need to do, not a direct physical result.",
    "That leaves us with option D (longer lines) and E (have to wait for). I need to evaluate which one better fits as a direct result.",
    "\"Longer lines\" is a clear, direct result of more people getting in line, as it describes the physical state of the queue itself.",
    "\"Have to wait for\" implies a necessity or requirement but is less definitive than stating the line is longer."
