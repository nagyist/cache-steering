  "query": "Question: Where would you find a pot with something alive in it?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen drawer\nB: closet\nC: greenhouse\nD: cupboard\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where you would find a pot with something alive in it, we should consider the typical environments associated with pots and living things.",
    "A kitchen drawer is usually for utensils and cutlery, not for pots with living things. So option A is unlikely.",
    "A closet is generally a storage space for clothes and other household items, which also doesn't typically include pots with living things. Thus, option B is also unlikely.",
    "A greenhouse is specifically designed for growing plants, meaning it's quite possible to find pots with live plants in them there. This makes option C a strong candidate.",
    "A cupboard is usually meant for storage of food items or dishes, not specifically for pots that contain living things. Therefore, option D seems less probable.",
    "A restaurant may have live ingredients, but they are usually not found in pots in a traditional sense, as they would be prepared or stored in a different way. Hence, option E is less likely than C.",
    "Considering the primary purpose and likelihood of finding a pot with something alive, the greenhouse (option C) stands out among the choices.",
    "Since greenhouse environments are tailored for nurturing living plants and often contain pots, I can conclude that option C is the best answer."
