  "query": "Question: Fabric is cut to order at what type of seller?\n\nChoices:\nA: curtains\nB: tailor shop\nC: clothing store\nD: sewing room\nE: hardware store",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a type of seller that cuts fabric to order.",
    "We need to analyze each option to see which one typically involves cutting fabric specifically for a customer.",
    "Option A, curtains, might imply cutting fabric, but curtains are generally sold pre-made in stores or custom-made through specific services, not necessarily by a curtain seller alone.",
    "Option B, tailor shop, is known for altering and creating clothing items to fit customers. Tailors often work with fabric and frequently cut it to fit a particular order, such as bespoke garments.",
    "Option C, clothing store, generally sells pre-made garments and does not typically cut fabric to order. It may offer some alterations, but new items are not cut to order.",
    "Option D, sewing room, is a space for sewing rather than a seller in itself. It may involve cutting fabric, but it isn't a type of seller that sells fabric.",
    "Option E, hardware store, does not sell fabric and is unrelated to fabric cutting.",
    "The most logical choice among all options is B (tailor shop), as they are known for cutting fabric to create custom clothing."
