  "query": "Question: If you fell in front of people while going public store how might you feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: problems\nB: sorrow\nC: embarrassment\nD: happy\nE: panic",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of falling in front of people. This is typically an unexpected event that can draw attention.",
    "Next, falling in public is often associated with vulnerability and losing control, which can be an uncomfortable experience.",
    "Now, analyze the emotional responses commonly associated with such events. Feelings of shame or self-consciousness often emerge.",
    "Embarrassment is a common reaction to making a mistake or being the center of attention for the wrong reasons, such as stumbling or falling.",
    "Evaluate the other choices: \n- A (problems) is too vague and does not directly convey an immediate emotional response.\n- B (sorrow) suggests deep sadness, which may not directly correlate to this situation.\n- D (happy) is contrary to the expected feelings in this scenario.\n- E (panic) could be a response but not as fitting as embarrassment.",
    "Out of all the choices, embarrassment aligns best with how one might feel after a public tumble.",
    "Hence, based on the analysis of emotional responses in such situations, the most fitting answer is found."
