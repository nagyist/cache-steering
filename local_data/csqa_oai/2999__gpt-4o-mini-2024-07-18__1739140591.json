  "steps": [
    "Firstly, we need to identify places where birds can clean themselves.",
    "Birds typically clean themselves by preening, which helps to remove dirt, parasites, and loose feathers.",
    "Preening can occur in various locations; however, water plays an important role in cleaning for many bird species.",
    "Let\u2019s evaluate each option in relation to this cleaning behavior:",
    "Option A (outside) could refer to many locations, such as trees or fields where they might clean themselves naturally.",
    "Option B (nest) is primarily for resting and raising chicks, and while birds may occasionally clean themselves in their nest, it is not a primary location for this activity.",
    "Option C (birdhouse) is similar to a nest and does not typically provide a significant area for cleaning compared to other options.",
    "Option D (roof) does not offer any practical way for birds to clean themselves as it is not a natural environment for bathing or washing.",
    "Option E (water fountain) provides a clear and accessible source of water, making it an excellent choice for birds to bathe and clean themselves.",
    "After evaluating all options, water fountains are specifically designed for such purposes, while other options are less suitable."
