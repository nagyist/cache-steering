  "steps": [
    "The question states that the large container caught rain water, which implies that the water it contained was primarily for external use rather than human consumption.",
    "The phrase \"hardly potable\" suggests that the water is not suitable for drinking but may still have practical uses, particularly in non-potable applications.",
    "The context of rainwater collection typically aligns with irrigation purposes since rainwater is often used to water plants and gardens.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"garden\" stands out as the most likely option where non-potable water could be utilized effectively for watering plants.",
    "The other options (A, B, C, E) either do not typically involve the use of water in a way that is commonly associated with casual watering or do not represent an area where rainwater would be applied for nurturing plants.",
    "Given that a garden is primarily made for growing plants and can benefit from collected rainwater, it is reasonable to conclude that it is the most appropriate choice here.",
    "I will consider the remaining options again briefly to confirm: supermarkets and warehouses do not benefit directly from rainwater in a way that would justify watering them; driveways would not need irrigation at all.",
    "Thus, narrowing it down to the uses of rainwater shows that watering a garden is the most logical choice."
