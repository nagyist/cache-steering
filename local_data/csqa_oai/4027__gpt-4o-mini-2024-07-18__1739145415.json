    "The core task of a detective is to uncover the truth surrounding a case, which often involves multiple methods of information gathering.",
    "Gathering witnesses is a fundamental part of a detective's job as it provides firsthand accounts of events related to the case.",
    "After gathering witnesses, detectives typically proceed to elicit more detailed information from them to clarify facts and events.",
    "Asking questions is a direct method to engage with witnesses, allowing detectives to delve deeper into their observations or experiences.",
    "The other choices also have relevance to the detective's work, but they do not fit the context as explicitly as asking questions does.",
    "\"Investigate\" is somewhat broad and can encapsulate various activities, but it doesn\u2019t specifically emphasize the interaction with witnesses.",
    "\u201cSearch for\u201d implies a broader action that doesn't necessarily involve engaging with witnesses directly.",
    "\u201cFind facts\u201d suggests arriving at conclusions but lacks the interactive component essential for witness gathering.",
    "\u201cWonder\u201d doesn't fit in the investigative context at all, as it is more about curiosity than action.",
    "Given that asking questions directly pertains to the interaction with witnesses and leads to better clarifications, it stands out as the most fitting choice."
