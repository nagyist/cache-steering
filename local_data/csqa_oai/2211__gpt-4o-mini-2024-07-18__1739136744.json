  "query": "Question: Where do you find spirits on Halloween?\n\nChoices:\nA: liquor cabinet\nB: haunted house\nC: graveyard\nD: cemetary\nE: funeral",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand what \"spirits\" refers to in the context of Halloween. While it can mean alcoholic beverages, on Halloween, it more commonly refers to ghosts or supernatural entities.",
    "Next, let's analyze each choice in light of this understanding. \n- A: liquor cabinet relates to alcoholic spirits but doesn't pertain to the Halloween theme of ghosts or supernatural beings. \n- B: haunted house is associated with spooky themes and often features representations of spirits. \n- C: graveyard is a place where spirits are often said to rest and is a traditional setting for ghost stories. \n- D: cemetery, like graveyard, is also associated with the resting places of the deceased and thus the potential presence of spirits. \n- E: funeral refers to the rituals surrounding death, not a location where spirits can be found.",
    "Now, comparing options B (haunted house), C (graveyard), and D (cemetery), we see that they all can be places where one might encounter spirits in the Halloween context.",
    "Since a haunted house is specifically designed to be spooky and often includes activities related to ghosts and spirits, it stands out as a direct answer to the question.",
    "However, graveyards and cemeteries are also well-known places associated with spirits and Halloween.",
    "Considering that graveyards and cemeteries are generally regarded as similar, they could be interchangeable in some contexts.",
    "Thus, if we had to choose the most fitting location where spirits are traditionally found on Halloween, the haunted house, as the most thematic option, stands out clearly.",
    "Given all of these observations, I have eliminated choices A and E, and while B, C, and D have merit, B resonates the most with the themes of Halloween and \"spirits.\""
