  "query": "Question: Why would you be unable to use a basketball?\n\nChoices:\nA: full of air\nB: punctured\nC: popular in america\nD: round\nE: not tall",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider the primary function of a basketball, which is to be used in the game of basketball. To effectively use a basketball, it needs to retain its shape and function properly.",
    "Next, evaluate the condition of the basketball. If it is punctured, it would lose air and become flat, making it unsuitable for playing basketball.",
    "On the other hand, an inflated basketball (full of air) would be functional, so option A does not limit usability.",
    "Additionally, basketballs are inherently round in shape, which is required for rolling and bouncing. Therefore, option D does not indicate an inability to use a basketball.",
    "The popularity of basketball (option C) in America does not affect the usability of a basketball. It simply reflects cultural significance.",
    "Lastly, the height of the basketball (option E) has no bearing on its ability to be used in the game since it is designed to be the same size universally.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that directly suggests a failure in usability is option B (punctured), as it would prevent the basketball from being functional."
