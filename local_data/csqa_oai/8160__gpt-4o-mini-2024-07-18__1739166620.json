  "query": "Question: Where do young people have to follow the rules during the day?\n\nChoices:\nA: football game\nB: everything\nC: classroom\nD: family situation\nE: schoolbus",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of each choice provided and relate it to the typical activities of young people during the day.",
    "Next, I will analyze each choice to see where rules are often strictly enforced for young people.",
    "A football game is generally structured with rules, but it is not a place where young people must follow rules all the time during the day.",
    "The option \"everything\" is too broad and doesn't specify a particular setting where rules are enforced during the day.",
    "In a classroom, young people are generally required to follow specific rules regarding behavior, participation, and academic conduct.",
    "Considering \"family situation,\" while there may be rules at home, they are often not as formally structured throughout the day.",
    "The \"schoolbus\" is another place where rules apply, but it is more of a transport-related scenario rather than a structured environment for learning or academics which is ongoing during the day.",
    "Given that \"classroom\" is a place dedicated to education during the day where rules are formally established and followed, it stands out among the other options.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the \"classroom\" appears to be the most fitting answer since it signifies a learning environment essential for young people's daily routines."
