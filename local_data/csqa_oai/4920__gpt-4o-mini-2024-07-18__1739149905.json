  "steps": [
    "To determine where people might leave a car for an extended period, I need to consider the purpose of parking in these different locations.",
    "A shopping center typically has shorter visits as people generally shop for a couple of hours or so.",
    "An airport is a common place for long-term parking as travelers often leave their cars for extended trips.",
    "A business district can see varying parking durations. However, most people are likely to park for work hours, not for extended periods.",
    "Parking in a city can depend on the type of visit, but usually does not imply extended leave compared to designated long-term options like those at an airport.",
    "A swimming pool is likely to see shorter visits as people usually spend a few hours there, making it an unlikely location for extended parking.",
    "After evaluating all options, the airport stands out as the prime candidate for extended parking since people often leave their vehicles for days or weeks while traveling.",
    "Considering all reasoning steps, the airport is the most logical choice for extended car parking."
