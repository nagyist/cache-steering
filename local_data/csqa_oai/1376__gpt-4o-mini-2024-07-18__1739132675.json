  "steps": [
    "To shop, an individual must obtain items or services that are available for purchase.",
    "Typically, shopping involves an exchange where money is used to pay for goods or services.",
    "Reviewing the choices, having money (Choice A) seems directly related to the ability to buy items while shopping.",
    "The other options, such as sleeping (Choice B), bringing flowers (Choice C), or going to the market (Choice D), do not directly enable the act of shopping by themselves.",
    "Getting money (Choice E) indicates a necessary step but implies a need to obtain it first before shopping can occur.",
    "Thus, the most straightforward option indicating what one must have in order to shop is simply to have money."
