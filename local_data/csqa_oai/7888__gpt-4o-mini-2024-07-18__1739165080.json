  "query": "Question: What would you need for running in the Olympics but not for running outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: legs\nB: more energy than walking\nC: agility\nD: movement\nE: speed",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what it takes to run in the Olympics. Olympic runners typically need to meet very high standards of performance and skill.",
    "Next, identify whether any of the choices are necessary for general outdoor running. For instance, legs (A), movement (D), and speed (E) are necessary for all forms of running, including casual outdoor running.",
    "More energy than walking (B) is also relevant, as running inherently requires more energy than walking, whether it's in the Olympics or outside.",
    "Look more closely at agility (C). While it can enhance performance, it is not strictly required for running; an Olympic runner might be more agile due to training, but most outdoor running does not necessitate agility.",
    "Based on this analysis, agility seems to be the quality that is most likely to be emphasized in Olympic contexts but is not generally needed for casual outdoor running.",
    "Thus, evaluate other options in terms of relevance to Olympic-level competition versus general outdoor running. All other options (A, B, D, E) apply to both scenarios.",
    "Final assessment shows that agility (C) relates strongly to the competitive nature of Olympic running, while other options apply broadly to both contexts."
