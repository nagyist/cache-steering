  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the role of a business leader. A business leader typically oversees a company or an organization.",
    "Consider the given choices and their relevance to the responsibilities of a business leader.",
    "Choice A, \"army\", is unrelated as a business leader does not manage military forces.",
    "Choice B, \"country\", implies a political leader, which does not align with the business context.",
    "Choice C, \"micromanagement\", refers to a management style rather than an area of responsibility.",
    "Choice D, \"pack\", is not relevant as it does not relate to business leadership or organization contexts.",
    "Choice E, \"organization\", directly relates to the core responsibilities of a business leader, as they manage and lead an organization.",
    "Now confirm that out of all the options, \"organization\" is the most fitting for what a business leader is responsible for.",
    "Re-evaluate the other options to confirm that none of them effectively represent what a business leader oversees.",
    "Decide that \"organization\" is the best choice as it captures the essence of a business leader's role."
