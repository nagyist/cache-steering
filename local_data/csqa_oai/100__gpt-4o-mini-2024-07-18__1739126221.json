  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that the accountant kept one calculator at home. This suggests there is a second location where another calculator is kept.",
    "The options provided are specific locations or items where a second calculator could logically be kept.",
    "A \"desk drawer\" (A) is a possibility, but it is typically not referred to as a primary place to keep a calculator for regular use.",
    "The term \"desktop\" (B) may imply a location but lacks the context of regular usage for the accountant in question.",
    "The \"office\" (C) is a very common place for an accountant or professional to have a calculator on hand for regular calculations and business tasks.",
    "A \"wristwatch\" (D) wouldn\u2019t logically accommodate a calculator and is more of an accessory.",
    "\"City hall\" (E) is unlikely as it refers to a governmental building and does not directly relate to the accountant's personal or professional needs for a calculator.",
    "Among the options, the most suitable and practical place to keep the second calculator, considering the accountant's profession, is the office."
