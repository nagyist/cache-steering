  "query": "Question: The baker got a new delivery of sugar, he opened the bag and poured it in the storage what?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: neighbor's house\nC: kitchen\nD: coffee\nE: pancake mix.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the baker received a delivery of sugar.",
    "Since sugar is typically used in baking and cooking, the baker would need to store it properly.",
    "The storage mentioned is likely where he keeps his baking supplies.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"container\" seems to fit as a general term for where sugar could be stored.",
    "\"Neighbor's house\" does not make sense as a logical place to pour sugar.",
    "\"Kitchien\" is a location associated with the baker's work but does not specify storage.",
    "\"Coffee\" would not be an appropriate choice, as sugar is not stored in coffee.",
    "\"Pancake mix\" is a product that might use sugar but is not where sugar would be stored.",
    "Thus, \"container\" is the most logical choice for where the sugar would be poured for storage."
