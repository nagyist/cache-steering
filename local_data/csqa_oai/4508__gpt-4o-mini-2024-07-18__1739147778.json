  "query": "Question: Celebrating sports teams sometimes start what when they get out of hand?\n\nChoices:\nA: dashing each others\nB: intimacy\nC: riots\nD: happiness\nE: headaches",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of sports celebrations and their potential outcomes when they become excessive or uncontrollable.",
    "Celebrating sports teams usually involves fans expressing their excitement and joy, but sometimes these celebrations can escalate and turn chaotic.",
    "When fans get overly enthusiastic, misbehavior can occur, which may lead to public disturbances or unrest.",
    "I should think about common terms associated with out-of-control celebrations, especially in a sports context.",
    "The word \"riots\" often refers to situations involving large crowds that erupt into violent behavior, which fits a scenario where celebrations go too far.",
    "Looking through the other options, \"dashing each others,\" \"intimacy,\" \"happiness,\" and \"headaches\" do not inherently relate to chaotic celebrations or public disturbances in sports contexts.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer, based on common occurrences in sports culture, is \"riots,\" as they refer specifically to the negative outcomes of excessively wild celebrations."
