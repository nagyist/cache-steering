  "query": "Question: Where are adults likely to be paid to to sit at a desk?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: office building\nC: library\nD: garage sale\nE: schoolroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where adults typically work or engage in pay-related activities that involve sitting at a desk.",
    "Identify common environments for white-collar jobs, which often require desk work and are places where adults are paid.",
    "Analyze each choice to determine its relevance to adults being paid to sit at a desk.",
    "A \"bathroom\" is not a professional or work-related environment, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "An \"office building\" is specifically designed for work, often involving desk jobs where adults are paid for their labor.",
    "A \"library\" is often a place for studying or researching, but it typically does not involve adults being paid to sit there in a desk job context.",
    "A \"garage sale\" involves selling items, usually not a paid desk job, so this option can also be eliminated.",
    "A \"schoolroom\" is generally a place for teaching or learning rather than a formal workspace where adults get paid to sit at a desk.",
    "Having analyzed all the available choices, the most relevant and appropriate option for an environment where adults are likely to be paid to sit at a desk is the office building."
