  "query": "Question: When it came to sex the couple were very strict, they were going to what the wedding to do it?\n\nChoices:\nA: see art\nB: run away\nC: wait for\nD: eat breakfast\nE: love another",
  "steps": [
    "The couple is described as very strict regarding sex. This implies they have specific rules or beliefs about when it is acceptable to engage in sexual activity.",
    "The phrase \"they were going to what the wedding to do it\" indicates that the wedding is a significant event for them concerning the timing of engaging in sex.",
    "We need to analyze the answer choices given to see which one logically follows the context of being strict about sex and waiting for an appropriate time.",
    "Choice A: \"see art\" does not relate to their strictness about sex or the significance of timing, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice B: \"run away\" does not make sense in the context of a planned wedding and the timing of sexual activity, so it can also be eliminated.",
    "Choice C: \"wait for\" aligns well with the concept of being strict and suggests that they are waiting for the wedding to engage in sex, fitting the context of their rules.",
    "Choice D: \"eat breakfast\" does not relate to the timing of sexual activity, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice E: \"love another\" is vague and does not specifically denote the timing in relation to the wedding context, which makes it less appropriate.",
    "Reviewing the choices again, \"wait for\" is the only option that correctly fits both the context about their strictness and the timing of sexual activity specifically in relation to the wedding."
