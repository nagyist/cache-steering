  "query": "Question: Someone who gets nervous and doesn't know how to dance might do what when they attempt to start dancing?\n\nChoices:\nA: wallflower\nB: stand down\nC: sitting still\nD: stand still\nE: standing still",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes someone who feels nervous and lacks dancing skills.",
    "When a person is nervous, they may seek to avoid being in a performing situation, such as dancing.",
    "The options provided generally relate to remaining in a stationary position.",
    "\"Wallflower\" (A) indicates someone who stays on the sidelines and avoids social dance situations, which may be relevant.",
    "\"Stand down\" (B) suggests a withdrawal, but it doesn't imply a physical position while trying to dance.",
    "\"Sitting still\" (C) implies being seated, which is not typically an attempt to dance.",
    "\"Stand still\" (D) suggests a physical stance but does not explicitly indicate stillness in the context of dancing.",
    "\"Standing still\" (E) also conveys a similar meaning to \"stand still\" but may imply a broader, more generalized state of being stationary.",
    "Both \"stand still\" and \"standing still\" essentially communicate the same idea of remaining in one place without attempting to dance.",
    "However, \"standing still\" (E) can be interpreted as a continuation of being static rather than a conscious choice like \"stand still\" (D).",
    "Given the social context, a person feeling nervous may be more inclined to either stand still or exhibit behavior similar to a wallflower.",
    "After evaluating the definitions and relevance of the choices, \"wallflower\" provides a more specific social behavior in contrast to the options D and E.",
    "Therefore, considering the context of nervousness while trying to dance and maintaining a physical posture, both \"D\" and \"E\" are viable, but option \"D\" seems to best represent the situation of attempting to dance while staying put."
