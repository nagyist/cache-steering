  "query": "Question: The man picked from an apple tree outside of Chicago, where did the apple come from?\n\nChoices:\nA: washington state\nB: illinois\nC: indiana\nD: swamp\nE: woods",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the man picked an apple from an apple tree located outside of Chicago.",
    "Chicago is in the state of Illinois.",
    "If the apple tree is located outside of Chicago, this indicates that the apple comes from Illinois, assuming it is from a local apple tree.",
    "The option 'B' represents Illinois, which is where Chicago is located.",
    "Option 'A' (Washington State) is known for its apples, but the question specifically mentions Chicago.",
    "Options 'C' (Indiana), 'D' (swamp), and 'E' (woods) do not logically apply, as they do not indicate a typical source for apples that were picked from a tree.",
    "Since the apple was picked from a tree specifically located outside of Chicago, it is most credible to conclude that it comes from Illinois."
