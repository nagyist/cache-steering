  "query": "Question: When you shake a can of spray paint you'll hear a bead do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: nod\nB: stay still\nC: rattle\nD: be still\nE: stir",
  "steps": [
    "When you shake a can of spray paint, you create movement within the can.",
    "Inside the can, there is typically a small metal bead or ball that helps mix the paint and propellant.",
    "This bead is designed to move freely within the can to help mix the contents effectively.",
    "As you shake the can, the movement causes this bead to collide with the sides of the can.",
    "The collisions between the bead and the can create a rattling sound.",
    "Because the can is sealed, the bead cannot escape; it will only rattle within the confines of the can.",
    "Thus, the primary sound you hear is that of the bead rattling against the interior surfaces of the can.",
    "Considering the options, \"rattle\" most directly corresponds to the sound made by the bead during shaking.",
    "The other options (nod, stay still, be still, stir) do not accurately describe the motion of the bead."
