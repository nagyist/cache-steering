  "query": "Question: Where is a automobile likely to go after an accident?\n\nChoices:\nA: corner store\nB: driveway\nC: repair shop\nD: exit ramp\nE: freeway",
  "steps": [
    "After an accident, an automobile is typically not in a condition suitable for continued driving or immediate use.",
    "Considering the options, a 'repair shop' is a designated location where damaged vehicles are taken for assessment and repair.",
    "The option 'corner store' does not relate to automobile repair and involves a completely different purpose, making it an unlikely destination.",
    "A 'driveway' usually signifies parking space that is not specifically related to addressing vehicle damage, and thus is also an unlikely choice.",
    "An 'exit ramp' and 'freeway' are locations where vehicles may travel but they do not fit as destinations for a vehicle that has just been involved in an accident.",
    "Overall, the context suggests that after an automobile accident, the most logical destination, considering the need for repair and evaluation, is the repair shop."
