  "query": "Question: What place could have one back garden?\n\nChoices:\nA: police station\nB: city\nC: town\nD: england\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what a \"back garden\" typically refers to; it's usually an area associated with a residential property where plants, flowers, or recreational space are found.",
    "Next, we need to analyze each of the choices provided to see which one is most likely to have a back garden.",
    "Choice A: \"police station\" - This is a public service building and is not typically associated with individual back gardens.",
    "Choice B: \"city\" - A city is a large and densely populated area which generally consists of multiple buildings and infrastructure. A city as a whole does not have back gardens, although individual houses or apartments within a city might.",
    "Choice C: \"town\" - A town is generally smaller than a city and often consists of residential areas where houses might have back gardens.",
    "Choice D: \"england\" - This is a country and encompasses many types of places, including towns and cities. The term itself does not specify anything about having back gardens.",
    "Choice E: \"house\" - A house is a residential structure and is typically associated with a back garden, as houses often include yards or gardens.",
    "Now comparing the potential options, both \"town\" and \"house\" could have a back garden. However, \"house\" specifically denotes a residential building, which makes it more strongly associated with having a back garden than \"town\" which includes multiple properties.",
    "Thus, the best choice that directly alludes to having a back garden is \"house.\""
