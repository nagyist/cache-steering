  "steps": [
    "The student mentioned that he left his writing instrument at his \"last place of study\".",
    "The term \"last place of study\" suggests a location where the student frequently engages in learning activities, implying it is a formal setting.",
    "Among the provided options, a classroom is a typical place for studying.",
    "A desk drawer is a specific location within a classroom or other study area, but it does not represent the entire last place of study.",
    "A bathroom is not a typical place for leaving a writing instrument, it is more of a facility than a study location.",
    "A pocket is part of clothing and not a location where studying occurs, making it an unlikely choice for leaving a writing instrument while studying.",
    "A stationery store is a place where writing instruments can be purchased, but it is not a place where the student might leave one.",
    "Based on the context and the likelihood of where a writing instrument would be left, the classroom is the most logical choice."
