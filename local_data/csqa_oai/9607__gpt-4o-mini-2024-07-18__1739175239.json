  "steps": [
    "The person signed up for a dating website, implying that they are seeking to meet new people, potentially for romantic purposes.",
    "Among the options provided, 'good relationship' (E) aligns most closely with the general purpose of joining a dating site, which typically focuses on building connections and relationships.",
    "'Financial security' (A), 'quick marriage' (B), 'live well' (C), and 'own house' (D) are specific goals that may not necessarily correlate with the act of signing up for a dating site.",
    "While some might use a dating site with the hope of finding a future partner for marriage or financial reasons, the more immediate goal is often to build a personal connection or a romantic relationship.",
    "Therefore, the primary focus tends to be on establishing a 'good relationship' rather than prioritizing financial or living conditions.",
    "I can also consider the context; dating sites promote connecting individuals rather than addressing their financial or housing situations.",
    "Based on the intent and common motivations for using a dating website, a desire for a 'good relationship' is a significant aspect.",
    "I will confirm that other options do not fit the context of dating websites as closely as 'good relationship' does."
