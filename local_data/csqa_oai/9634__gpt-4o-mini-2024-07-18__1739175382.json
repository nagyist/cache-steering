  "query": "Question: A person surrounded by tools and oil cans would probably be found in a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: white house\nC: synagogue\nD: hospital\nE: demonstration",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a person surrounded by tools and oil cans. This hints at a location where mechanical work or maintenance is performed.",
    "The term \"tools\" commonly indicates an environment related to repair, maintenance, or building, and \"oil cans\" suggests a setting involving engines or machinery, such as in automotive work.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the options provided: \n- A: garage - typically a place where vehicles are parked and maintenance work is performed, making it a likely candidate.\n- B: white house - generally refers to the residence of the President, which does not commonly involve tools or oil cans.\n- C: synagogue - a place of worship, which would not have tools and oil cans.\n- D: hospital - primarily involved in health care delivery; tools here are medical, not mechanical.\n- E: demonstration - can refer to a public display, which does not suggest a permanent location for tools and oil cans.",
    "Among all the options, only \"garage\" directly aligns with the scenario presented in the question regarding tools and oil.",
    "Furthermore, garages are often found in residential areas, where people might keep tools for personal maintenance or hobbies.",
    "The other options do not support the idea of having tools and oil cans as a standard feature of their environment.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most fitting answer is \"garage.\""
