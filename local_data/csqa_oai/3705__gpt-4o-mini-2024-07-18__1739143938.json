  "query": "Question: Where would you find water that is not visible?\n\nChoices:\nA: crushed ice\nB: north\nC: tidal waves\nD: surface of earth\nE: steam room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what \"not visible\" means in this context. It implies water that is not in a form that can be seen easily or recognized.",
    "Next, I will look at each option and determine if the water in that option is typically visible or not.",
    "Option A, crushed ice, consists of visible ice particles, so it does not fit the criteria of water being \"not visible.\"",
    "Option B, north, is a direction and does not pertain to any specific form of water, so it can be eliminated as well.",
    "Option C, tidal waves, are large, visible moves of water during tides, making this option not suitable since the water is definitely visible.",
    "Option D, surface of earth, would generally contain visible bodies of water like lakes and rivers, thus this option does not align with \"not visible.\"",
    "Finally, option E, steam room, is a space filled with steam, which is water in its gaseous form. Steam is typically not visible in the same way as liquid water is.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is the steam room because the water present in that environment is not visible as it exists in the form of steam."
