  "query": "Question: What could a real estate agent do if his or her customer wants to get a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: misrepresent\nB: cover up\nC: offer price\nD: deceive\nE: leave town",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the options provided in relation to the actions a real estate agent can take for a customer wanting to purchase a house.",
    "Next, I should consider the ethical and legal responsibilities of a real estate agent, which typically include acting in the best interests of their clients.",
    "Option A, \"misrepresent,\" suggests dishonesty, which is not aligned with a real estate agent's duty to their client.",
    "Option B, \"cover up,\" also implies unethical behavior, as covering up issues with a house would violate disclosure laws.",
    "Option C, \"offer price,\" makes sense as an action a real estate agent can take to help their customer in the home-buying process. They would typically advise on pricing by presenting offers.",
    "Option D, \"deceive,\" is similar to options A and B, indicating a form of dishonesty, which is contrary to the real estate agent's responsibilities.",
    "Option E, \"leave town,\" is an impractical and unprofessional response to a customer's request for assistance in purchasing a house.",
    "Among all the options, \"offer price\" is a legitimate action a real estate agent would take to assist a buyer, making it the most viable answer."
