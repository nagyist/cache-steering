  "query": "Question: Sometimes playing game means losing, he wasn't good at losing though and showed lots of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: having fun\nB: entertain\nC: injury\nD: enjoying\nE: anger",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes someone who struggles with losing in games.",
    "This implies that losing is an emotional experience for him, rather than just a neutral outcome.",
    "We need to consider how this individual might express his emotions when he loses.",
    "The choices provided are: A (having fun), B (entertain), C (injury), D (enjoying), and E (anger).",
    "Having fun (choice A) and enjoying (choice D) seem less likely because losing in a game typically does not lead to feelings of enjoyment or fun.",
    "Entertain (choice B) does not directly correlate to an emotional response to losing.",
    "Injury (choice C) is not a typical emotional response to losing in a game.",
    "This leaves us with choice E (anger), which is a common reaction for those who do not handle losing well.",
    "Therefore, it is logical to conclude that he likely showed anger when faced with losing in games."
