  "steps": [
    "Identify the main issue Sarah is facing according to the problem statement.",
    "The problem states that Sarah had trouble beginning work, indicating she may be experiencing a blockage or difficulty in starting.",
    "Consider the choices provided and their relevance to Sarah's trouble beginning work.",
    "Choice A: \"computer\" does not directly relate to her inability to start work and seems contextually irrelevant.",
    "Choice B: \"momentum\" could refer to the lack of progress or energy to start, but it is not something that she is not doing.",
    "Choice C: \"panic\" suggests an emotional state that could prevent her from starting work, but it's unclear if she is panicking.",
    "Choice D: \"accomplishing\" implies she is not achieving tasks which aligns with having trouble beginning.",
    "Choice E: \"excitement\" suggests a positive feeling that would likely motivate her to start rather than hinder it.",
    "After evaluating, the choice that best represents what Sarah is not doing, contributing to her trouble beginning work, is related to accomplishment.",
    "Thus, since she is having trouble starting, it can imply that she is not accomplishing any tasks at that moment."
