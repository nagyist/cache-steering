  "query": "Question: The competition was to see who would be the last one the drop the object, the hard part was you had to have your arm extended straight out while what the object?\n\nChoices:\nA: holding\nB: lift up\nC: pick up\nD: lifting\nE: hold onto",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the competition involves dropping an object while keeping the arm extended straight out.",
    "To understand the correct word to complete the sentence, I need to analyze the context: \"you had to have your arm extended straight out while ___ the object.\"",
    "The key word is \"while,\" which indicates that the action occurring must be simultaneous with the arm being extended.",
    "Now, let\u2019s examine each choice in relation to the context:\n- A: \"holding\" suggests maintaining a grip on the object, which seems directly relevant.\n- B: \"lift up\" implies raising the object, which isn\u2019t compatible with the context of dropping it.\n- C: \"pick up\" denotes the action of lifting or taking the object, but again, would usually precede the dropping action.\n- D: \"lifting\" also implies raising it and conflicts with the dropping aspect.\n- E: \"hold onto\" means to grasp it firmly but is a bit more passive and not the best fit for the prompt.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, \"holding\" makes the most sense because it denotes keeping the object in one's hand while the arm is extended, which matches the requirement of the scenario.",
    "Since \u201cholding\u201d is the only choice that fits seamlessly into the sentence without altering the meaning, it would be the best answer."
