  "query": "Question: If you raise vegetables where would you put a shed?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm yard\nB: backyard\nC: coalshed\nD: outside\nE: ranch",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where vegetables are commonly raised. This can be on a farm, in a backyard garden, or on a ranch.",
    "Next, I analyze the shed's purpose. A shed is used for storage, tools, or equipment related to gardening or farming.",
    "Looking at choice A (farm yard), a farm yard is a practical location for a shed, as it is typically located close to where farming activities take place.",
    "Choice B (backyard) is also a reasonable location for a shed if someone is growing vegetables at home; sheds in backyards can house gardening tools.",
    "For choice C (coalshed), this location is not suitable since coalsheds are primarily for storing coal, not for gardening tools or vegetables.",
    "Choice D (outside) is vague. While a shed is indeed placed outside, this lacks specificity and doesn\u2019t pinpoint a productive location for vegetable raising.",
    "Choice E (ranch) could be relevant since ranches can also involve crops. However, it is less common than farms for vegetable cultivation.",
    "Comparing A and B, I note that while both can work, a farm yard is specifically designed for agricultural purposes, offering better utility for a shed meant for vegetable growing.",
    "Therefore, while several options are suitable, I determine that the most appropriate and specific location according to common practices would be the farm yard."
