  "query": "Question: Where are trees safest?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: rainforest\nC: zoo\nD: state park\nE: san francisco",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environments where trees are typically found. Each option presents different scenarios for tree safety.",
    "A university may have a few trees but also has a lot of human activity that could pose risks to their safety, such as construction or foot traffic.",
    "A rainforest is a natural habitat known for its dense vegetation and diverse ecosystem, suggesting a high level of protection from human interference, though it has risks like extreme weather.",
    "A zoo, while having some trees for aesthetic purposes, controls its environment tightly, often for the safety of animals and visitors. Thus, risks to trees might be heightened.",
    "A state park typically aims to preserve nature, and trees in these parks are often protected by regulations, making them safer from development and destructive human activities.",
    "San Francisco, as an urban area, has numerous trees but also faces threats from pollution, urban development, and human activities, which can compromise tree safety.",
    "Comparing the options - rainforests and state parks are the most protective environments for trees due to limited human interaction.",
    "Between rainforests and state parks, state parks are designed specifically for conservation and protection, thus are likely safer than rainforests in terms of human threats.",
    "So, the safest location for trees among all the options is likely the state park."
