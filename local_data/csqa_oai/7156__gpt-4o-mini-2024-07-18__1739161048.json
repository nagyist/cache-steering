  "query": "Question: Where might a vacuum be stored?\n\nChoices:\nA: space\nB: container\nC: orbit\nD: dyson\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the nature of a vacuum. In this context, a vacuum refers to a vacuum cleaner, which is a household appliance that is used for cleaning purposes.",
    "Next, I think about common storage locations for household appliances. These are usually places where they can be easily accessed when needed for cleaning tasks.",
    "Looking at the choices given, I can eliminate \"space\" (A) and \"orbit\" (C) as they do not pertain to reasonable storage locations for a vacuum cleaner.",
    "I also consider option \"Dyson\" (D). While Dyson is a brand of vacuum cleaners, it does not represent a storage location but rather a specific type of vacuum cleaner.",
    "This leaves us with \"container\" (B) and \"closet\" (E). While a vacuum could theoretically be stored in a container, it is impractical as vacuums are typically larger and not stored in typical containers.",
    "On the other hand, closets are well known storage spaces for various household items, including brooms, mops, and vacuum cleaners, making them a very plausible location to store a vacuum cleaner.",
    "Given that closets are commonly used for storage of cleaning appliances, I conclude that a vacuum cleaner is most likely to be stored in a closet.",
    "Finally, I double-check the reasoning against each option and confirm that \"closet\" is the most appropriate answer."
