  "steps": [
    "The question states that the soldier was a great candidate for the job, which implies that there are specific skills or attributes that make the soldier suitable.",
    "The hiring officer's perception of the soldier's capabilities is crucial in determining what the soldier could do well.",
    "Among the choices, \"fight enemy\" (A) suggests a direct engagement role but doesn't specifically relate to broader job suitability.",
    "\"Report for duty\" (B) indicates a basic expectation but doesn't reflect skill or effectiveness in a role.",
    "\"Amuse oneself\" (C) tends to disassociate from job relevance, as it does not relate to military duties or responsibilities.",
    "\"Follow instructions\" (D) aligns strongly with military training, which emphasizes discipline and the ability to adhere to commands.",
    "\"Wait for orders\" (E) is similar to \"follow instructions\" but suggests passivity rather than the proactive skills needed for a job.",
    "Evaluating the context of military service, a soldier's ability to follow instructions is critical for operational success and is a common trait emphasized in recruitment.",
    "Therefore, out of all the choices, \"follow instructions\" (D) stands out as the most relevant skill that makes the soldier an excellent candidate."
