  "query": "Question: The scientist sought endangered toucans in the forest, where was he looking?\n\nChoices:\nA: temperate zone\nB: south america\nC: countryside\nD: africa\nE: earth",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the scientist is seeking endangered toucans.",
    "Toucans are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America.",
    "Options A (temperate zone), C (countryside), D (africa), and E (earth) do not specifically align with the natural habitat of toucans.",
    "Option B (south america) aligns directly with the known habitat where many toucan species thrive.",
    "Considering that the question refers specifically to endangered toucans, it is most logical to look for them in regions where they are naturally found and where conservation efforts may be focused.",
    "Since toucans are not endemic to the temperate zone, countryside (a vague term that could refer to many areas), or Africa, and since \"earth\" is too broad, these choices can be eliminated.",
    "Therefore, the only appropriate answer which specifies a region where endangered toucans can be sought is South America."
