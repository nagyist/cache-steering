  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"the automobile was left outside\" when the man got home. This indicates that the car was not parked inside a building or enclosed space.",
    "Since the car was outside, we must eliminate options that suggest the car is inside a structure, such as a garage or a repair shop. Therefore, options B (repair shop) and E (garage) can be dismissed.",
    "Now, we have three remaining options: A (exit ramp), C (driveway), and D (front yard).",
    "An exit ramp typically refers to a part of a highway and is not commonly associated with a place where someone would leave their own car, thus option A can also be eliminated.",
    "This leaves us with options C (driveway) and D (front yard). Both are plausible places for a car to be left outside.",
    "A driveway is a designated area for parking vehicles typically adjacent to a house, whereas the front yard is more generally an open space in front of the house.",
    "Given the context of the question, it's more common for someone to leave their car in the driveway rather than in the front yard, especially when returning home.",
    "Thus, option C (driveway) seems the most logical choice as a place where the car would be left when the man got home."
