  "steps": [
    "To determine where to take a comforter for warmth while watching television, I need to consider common places where one typically watches TV.",
    "The living room is the most common place to watch television in a household, making it a likely candidate for where the comforter should go.",
    "The world is too vague and encompasses too many locations; it does not specifically relate to watching television.",
    "The washing machine is where laundry is done, not a place where you would take a comforter for warmth while watching TV.",
    "A fire could provide warmth, but it is not a place; it is more of a source of heat. Typically, a comforter would be used away from direct heat sources for safety reasons.",
    "A cedar chest may be where one stores blankets or comforters, but it is not where you would take a comforter to use while watching television.",
    "The most logical conclusion is that if I am watching television, I would want to take the comforter to the living room to stay warm."
