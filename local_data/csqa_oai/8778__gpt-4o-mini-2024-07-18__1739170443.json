  "steps": [
    "The question asks how to ensure everyone hears the speaker's voice. Each choice presents a different aspect of voice communication.",
    "Choice A, \"being heard,\" suggests a state rather than a method of speaking. It implies wanting to be listened to but does not provide a method.",
    "Choice B, \"loud,\" indicates a volume level that typically helps with being heard by a larger audience. Speaking loudly is a direct way to capture attention.",
    "Choice C, \"upwards,\" relates to pitch but does not necessarily equate to everyone hearing the voice. It might suggest raising the voice in pitch rather than volume.",
    "Choice D, \"beautiful,\" focuses on the quality of the voice rather than volume or audibility. A beautiful voice may engage listeners but doesn\u2019t ensure everyone hears it.",
    "Choice E, \"sound,\" is a more general term and does not specify how to speak for maximum audibility; it encompasses all aspects of vocalization.",
    "Among the choices, \"loud\" is the most effective strategy for ensuring that everyone can hear the speaker's voice."
