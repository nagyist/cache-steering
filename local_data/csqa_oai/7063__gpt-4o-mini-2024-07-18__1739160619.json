  "steps": [
    "The question states that the peanuts were being sold at stalls by the ferris wheel.",
    "A ferris wheel is commonly found at amusement parks, fairs, or carnivals, which implies a festive environment.",
    "Let's consider the choices provided. A barn is not associated with stalls for selling snacks like peanuts.",
    "A ballpark could have peanuts sold, but it\u2019s not specifically linked to a ferris wheel.",
    "A carnival is a perfect fit since it typically includes rides, games, and stalls selling food items.",
    "The choice of a jar is irrelevant, as it does not align with selling peanuts at a stall, and a plane does not relate to the context of selling peanuts by a ferris wheel.",
    "Among the choices, \"C\" for carnival directly connects to the imagery of stalls and ferris wheels.",
    "I will cross-verify: stalls are meant for selling at venues that entertain, which aligns well with a carnival atmosphere.",
    "Other choices do not correlate with the presence of a ferris wheel in their respective contexts."
