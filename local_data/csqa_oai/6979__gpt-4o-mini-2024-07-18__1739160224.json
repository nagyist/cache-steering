  "steps": [
    "The question is about a person's motivation behind studying constantly.",
    "We consider the implications of constant study, which suggests a dedication to acquiring knowledge.",
    "Analyzing each option based on the motivation for constant study:\n- Option A (own house) does not directly relate to studying.\n- Option B (know everything) aligns well with the idea of constant study.\n- Option C (make more money) could be a secondary effect of education, but may not be the primary reason.\n- Option D (spare time) seems unrelated, as studying often takes up time rather than spares it.\n- Option E (show off) could be a possible but unlikely motivation for constant studying.",
    "Continuing to narrow it down, the core idea behind someone who studies constantly would primarily focus on knowledge acquisition.",
    "Thus, option B (know everything) stands out as the most appropriate reasoning since the act of studying is fundamentally linked to the pursuit of knowledge.",
    "While making money can be an end result of knowledge, the initial reason for studying would largely be to know more."
