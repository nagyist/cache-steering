  "query": "Question: After getting high his memory seemed shot, he felt practically what?\n\nChoices:\nA: dead\nB: forgotten\nC: brainless\nD: forgetting\nE: forgetfulness",
  "steps": [
    "The question suggests that after getting high, the person's memory is affected negatively.",
    "\u201cSeemed shot\u201d implies that the memory is either impaired or significantly diminished.",
    "The options provided include various states related to memory loss and cognition: dead, forgotten, brainless, forgetting, and forgetfulness.",
    "Option A: \"dead\" does not logically fit since it implies a complete lack of life or consciousness, which is not directly related to memory.",
    "Option B: \"forgotten\" could imply being overlooked or not remembered, but it does not convey a direct feeling or state of mind.",
    "Option C: \"brainless\" suggests a state of lacking intelligence or thought, which can reflect the effects of being high on someone's cognitive ability.",
    "Option D: \"forgetting\" indicates the process of not being able to remember, but it does not describe a feeling.",
    "Option E: \"forgetfulness\" implies an inability to remember, but again does not carry a personal state or feeling.",
    "Considering option C: \"brainless\" fits best with the idea that the person feels a significant reduction in cognitive function after getting high, directly correlating to the memory being impaired.",
    "Other options either don't address the state of feeling or relate to memory in a less direct way than \"brainless.\""
