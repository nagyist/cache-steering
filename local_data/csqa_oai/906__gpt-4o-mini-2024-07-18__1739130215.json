  "steps": [
    "First, consider what isopropyl alcohol is typically used for. It is a common antiseptic, solvent, and cleaning agent often found in households and laboratories.",
    "Next, consider the use of safety glasses. Safety glasses are protective eyewear typically used in environments where there is a risk of eye injury, such as laboratories or industrial settings.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices provided. A pub primarily serves alcoholic beverages and food, which is unlikely to be a location for isopropyl alcohol or safety glasses.",
    "Next, consider restaurants. While they may use some cleaning agents, isopropyl alcohol and safety glasses are not commonly required or found within the area dedicated to food preparation and service.",
    "The option of a park does not make sense either, as parks are outdoor recreational spaces where neither isopropyl alcohol nor safety glasses would typically be found or needed.",
    "A supermarket might have isopropyl alcohol in the cleaning supplies aisle, but safety glasses are not a standard item you would typically find there.",
    "The chemistry lab is the most likely option as it is an environment specifically designed for experiments and chemical use, where isopropyl alcohol might be a frequent necessity and safety glasses are essential for eye protection.",
    "Reviewing all locations, the chemistry lab aligns perfectly with the presence of both isopropyl alcohol and safety glasses due to its nature and purpose."
