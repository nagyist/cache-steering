  "query": "Question: Some horses are white others are black, but many are this color which might lead some people to think their milk would taste like chocolate?\n\nChoices:\nA: big but gentle\nB: kept in stables\nC: cuddly\nD: brown\nE: running in herd",
  "steps": [
    "The question hints at a color that some horses can be, as they mention that many horses fall into this category.",
    "The reference to \"this color\" suggests that it is a specific color that is commonly associated with horses.",
    "The hint about the milk tasting like chocolate indicates a color that is commonly connected to chocolate.",
    "Thinking of colors associated with horses, the most notable colors are black, white, brown, and gray.",
    "Chocolate is often associated with the color brown.",
    "The phrase \"some horses are white others are black\" suggests that the color in question is neither white nor black, thereby narrowing it down.",
    "Among the choices given, the only color explicitly mentioned is \"brown,\" which fits the description of the color that may lead to assumptions about chocolate-flavored milk.",
    "Options A, B, C, and E do not directly relate to a color, and thus cannot be linked to the milk tasting like chocolate.",
    "Since brown is the only color option present, it is reasonable to conclude that it is the color referred to in the question."
