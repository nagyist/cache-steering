  "query": "Question: Where can you keep your binder on your person between periods of instruction?\n\nChoices:\nA: class room\nB: car\nC: office supply store\nD: backpack\nE: bookcase",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which asks for a place to keep a binder on your person between periods of instruction.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice based on accessibility to the person during instructional time.",
    "Choice A (classroom): While you can keep a binder in the classroom, it is not on your person as you would leave the classroom between periods.",
    "Choice B (car): Keeping a binder in the car means it is not on you, making it inaccessible during the time between classes.",
    "Choice C (office supply store): This choice does not relate to a personal carrying option for the binder as it refers to a location to purchase supplies, not to keep it on your person.",
    "Choice D (backpack): A backpack is typically carried on your person, meaning a binder can be kept in it and accessed easily between classes.",
    "Choice E (bookcase): Similar to the classroom, a bookcase is a stationary object and would not keep the binder on your person.",
    "With the evaluations above, the only option that allows for carrying a binder directly on you is the backpack."
