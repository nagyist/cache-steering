  "query": "Question: John and James spent most of their time communicating with each other on their project.  The time required to communicate slowed their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: static\nB: train of thought.\nC: progress\nD: transfer of information\nE: collaboration",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John and James spent a lot of time communicating regarding their project, suggesting that the time spent on communication might impact something related to their work.",
    "I consider what could be affected by the time spent communicating. Static doesn't seem to apply here as it doesn't relate to any of the processes involved in their project.",
    "The phrase \"train of thought\" refers to the flow of ideas and cognition. It\u2019s possible that extensive communication could disrupt or slow down their individual thought processes.",
    "I also evaluate the option \"progress.\" If they are communicating too much, it could indeed lead to slower progress on their project since time spent communicating may take away from the time spent actually working.",
    "Next, I think about \"transfer of information.\" While communication is intended to transfer information, spending excessive time on it could potentially cause delays or mistakes in how information is conveyed.",
    "Then, I consider \"collaboration.\" Communication is a key component of collaboration, but if it's too much, it may not necessarily mean collaboration is slowed, rather that they might be collaborating very actively.",
    "I decide to compare \"progress\" and \"train of thought.\" Progress is usually the most directly impacted by time management and could indicate a failure to accomplish tasks efficiently.",
    "Since they were communicating a lot, it makes sense that this would interfere with how fast they can make real advancements in their project\u2014this directly points to progress being slowed.",
    "Thus, while \"train of thought\" is impacted too, the most logical impact from their extensive communication seems to be their actual progress on the project."
