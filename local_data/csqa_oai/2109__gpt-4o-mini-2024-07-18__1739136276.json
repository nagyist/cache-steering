  "query": "Question: Everyone is special. Everyone has what?\n\nChoices:\nA: feelings\nB: unique personality\nC: values\nD: experiences\nE: different standards",
  "steps": [
    "The statement \"Everyone is special\" implies that there is something intrinsic and distinguishing about each individual.",
    "The phrase \"Everyone has what?\" suggests we are looking for a characteristic or attribute that everyone possesses.",
    "Let's analyze each option to see which is most universally applicable to all people.",
    "Option A: \"feelings\" \u2014 Everyone does have feelings, but this may not fully encapsulate the notion of being \"special.\"",
    "Option B: \"unique personality\" \u2014 This directly relates to individuality and uniqueness, which fits well with the idea of being special.",
    "Option C: \"values\" \u2014 While everyone has values, they can vary greatly from person to person and may not fully represent the essence of being special.",
    "Option D: \"experiences\" \u2014 People's experiences are indeed varied, but not everyone\u2019s experiences are necessarily seen as making them special.",
    "Option E: \"different standards\" \u2014 This implies a comparison and may not universally convey what makes someone special.",
    "Comparing the strongest candidates, \"unique personality\" captures the essence of 'specialness' better than 'feelings', 'values', 'experiences', or 'different standards'.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer that embodies the concept that everyone has something that makes them special is option B."
