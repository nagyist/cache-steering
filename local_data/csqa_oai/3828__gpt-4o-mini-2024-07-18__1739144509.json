    "The scenario involves Dad putting away folding chairs after a party.",
    "Folding chairs are usually stored in places that are convenient for future use and typically do not take up much space.",
    "Let's analyze each option to determine where it would be most logical to store folding chairs.",
    "Option A (church) is unlikely, as it's not a personal storage area for Dad's chairs unless they are specifically meant for use at the church.",
    "Option B (garage) is quite plausible since garages often serve as storage areas for various items, including furniture like folding chairs.",
    "Option C (attic) also seems reasonable, as attics are common storage spaces for items that are not in regular use, such as seasonal or occasional furniture.",
    "Option D (room) is vague and does not specify which room, making it less likely as a distinct storage location.",
    "Option E (closet) is another valid option; closets can hold folding chairs, especially if they are compact and can be stored vertically.",
    "Now, considering practicality, a garage can accommodate larger items and is often used for storing outdoor or party-related items.",
    "While both the garage and closet are plausible options, the garage is generally more suitable for items like folding chairs that are used occasionally."
