  "steps": [
    "The question asks what you do in a situation where you're standing in a queue and cannot change the course of events.",
    "Option A suggests becoming impatient, which is a feeling or state of mind but does not indicate an action taken in the queue.",
    "Option B presents \"impatience,\" which is also a state of feeling rather than an action.",
    "Option C implies an action that is likely inappropriate and does not align with a typical response to waiting in a queue.",
    "Option D states that you will have to wait, which seems to be a straightforward and accurate description of what happens when you cannot change a situation and are in a queue.",
    "Option E suggests looking around, which can be a passive action but does not encapsulate the overall situation of being in a queue for something beyond your control.",
    "Considering all the options, the only answer that directly reflects the reality of the situation when you are in a queue is that you \"will have to wait\" (Option D)."
