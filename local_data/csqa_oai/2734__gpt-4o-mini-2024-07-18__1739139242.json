  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you are most likely to hear bells on Sunday morning.",
    "Consider the choices provided. A church typically has bells that ring on Sunday mornings for services.",
    "A stove, school, and front door do not commonly have bells associated with them in this context.",
    "Checking the last option, \"reindeer collier,\" seems irrelevant, as it is not a common building type associated with bells.",
    "Since churches are known for their bell chiming during services, they are the most suitable choice among the options.",
    "None of the other options provide a context where bells would be sounded on a Sunday morning.",
    "Therefore, the only logical answer is that you would be likely to hear bells at a church."
