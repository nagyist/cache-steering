  "query": "Question: Walking to much with poorly fitting shoes can cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: weight gain\nB: blisters\nC: exercise\nD: locomotion\nE: lose weight",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the effects of walking, particularly when done excessively and with poorly fitting shoes.",
    "Poorly fitting shoes can lead to discomfort when walking, which may ultimately result in skin issues.",
    "One of the most common skin issues caused by friction from improperly fitting shoes is blisters.",
    "Blisters occur when the skin is irritated and repeatedly rubbed, a situation likely to arise from poor footwear.",
    "Next, evaluate the other options. Weight gain (A) and losing weight (E) are more associated with overarching lifestyle and diet factors rather than just the effects of wearing improper shoes.",
    "Exercise (C) is a positive outcome of walking but does not align with the adverse effects of poorly fitting shoes.",
    "Locomotion (D) refers to movement in general and is not specifically a consequence of poorly fitting shoes.",
    "Having ruled out the other options and confirmed that blisters are a direct result of excessive walking in poorly fitting shoes, I can determine the most appropriate answer."
