  "query": "Question: If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: house\nC: cupboard\nD: space shuttle\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates there is an unpleasant stale smell specifically coming from the kitchen. This implies that the source of the smell is likely located somewhere within that area of the house.",
    "Among the provided choices, we need to focus on options that relate directly to the kitchen.",
    "Choice A (bathroom) is not a logical option since the smell originates from the kitchen, not the bathroom.",
    "Choice B (house) is too broad and does not specify a particular area where one would check for the source of the smell.",
    "Choice D (space shuttle) and choice E (surface of earth) are completely unrelated to the domestic context of the kitchen and can be ruled out.",
    "This leaves us with choice C (cupboard), which is a specific part of the kitchen where food items may be stored and could potentially be causing a stale smell if something has spoiled.",
    "It is reasonable to check the cupboard first as it commonly contains food items that may lead to odors when they go bad.",
    "Therefore, the source of the stale smell in the kitchen is most likely located in the cupboard."
