  "query": "Question: Which horseman of the apocalypse is often depicted next to death?\n\nChoices:\nA: battlefield\nB: the healer.\nC: funeral\nD: war\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the horseman of the apocalypse that is depicted next to Death.",
    "In the biblical context, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are War, Famine, Pestilence (or Conquest), and Death.",
    "Death is often associated with the end of life and the consequences of warfare and conflict.",
    "Among the choices provided, I need to identify which option relates closely to Death in the context of the horsemen.",
    "\"Battlefield\" and \"war\" both relate to conflict, but they do not directly indicate a character depicted alongside Death.",
    "\"The healer,\" \"hospital,\" and \"funeral\" suggest contexts related to death but do not directly correlate with a horseman of the apocalypse.",
    "In the context of the Four Horsemen, the horseman often depicted next to Death is War, as the consequences of war lead to death.",
    "I consider \"war\" to be the best fit since it is directly involved in the sequence of events leading to death.",
    "Thus, my final reasoning concludes that War is the horseman depicted alongside Death from the options given."
