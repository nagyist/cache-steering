  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to sore a wind instrument in you home?\n\nChoices:\nA: under bed\nB: symphony\nC: music room\nD: band practice\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the nature of wind instruments, which are delicate and often require specific conditions for proper storage to avoid damage.",
    "Second, we need to consider options that provide a controlled environment for the instrument, such as avoiding humidity and extreme temperature changes.",
    "Next, option A (under bed) is generally not a suitable place because it may expose the instrument to dust and lack of airflow, potentially damaging it.",
    "Then, option B (symphony) refers to a performance setting rather than a storage solution, making it impractical for storing an instrument at home.",
    "Looking at option D (band practice), it is more of a rehearsal venue than a storage option, thus not suitable for storing an instrument at home.",
    "Option E (music store) is a place where instruments can be stored for sale or repair, but it is not a personal home storage solution.",
    "Finally, option C (music room) stands out as it implies a designated area specifically meant for music activities, which would typically have appropriate storage solutions for instruments."
