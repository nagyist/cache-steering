  "query": "Question: what are the kind of transport that is used underwater in the atlantic ocean?\n\nChoices:\nA: earth\nB: basin\nC: whales\nD: submarines\nE: planet",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about types of transport that are used underwater specifically in the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "The term \"transport\" indicates a means of conveyance or movement through water.",
    "The choices provided include animals (whales), geological features (earth, basin, planet), and vehicles (submarines).",
    "Whales, while they do move through the water, are not typically categorized as \"transport\" in the conventional sense.",
    "Earth, basin, and planet are not relevant as forms of transport; they refer to geological or astronomical concepts instead.",
    "Submarines are engineered vessels designed for underwater navigation and transport in oceans, including the Atlantic.",
    "Considering the operational definition of \"transport\" and evaluating the choices, submarines clearly fit as vehicles used for underwater movement.",
    "None of the other options replicate the functional characteristics of transport as defined in the context of the ocean.",
    "Thus, out of the choices, submarines are the only applicable form of transport underwater."
