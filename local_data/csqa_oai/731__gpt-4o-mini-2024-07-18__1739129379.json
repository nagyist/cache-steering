  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that there are computers in cubicles, which suggests a work environment.",
    "Typically, computers in office cubicles are used by employees to perform tasks related to their jobs.",
    "Option A \"teach\" is not relevant, as the primary function of computers in an office isn't for teaching but for doing work.",
    "Option B \"cost money\" describes a characteristic of computers but does not indicate their use.",
    "Option D \"be productive\" resonates with the general goal of using computers, but it is not the direct action employees perform with them.",
    "Option E \"help people\" is too vague and doesn't specifically connect to the use of computers in a workplace.",
    "Option C \"do work\" is the most accurate choice because the main purpose of having computers in cubicles is for employees to complete their tasks and responsibilities."
