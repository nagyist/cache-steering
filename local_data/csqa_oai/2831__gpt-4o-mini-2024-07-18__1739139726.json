  "query": "Question: John knew that the snake probably wasn't real because he lived in the Midwest, and anacondas live in what regions?\n\nChoices:\nA: nightmare\nB: wyoming\nC: tropics\nD: ditch\nE: pet shops",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John lives in the Midwest, and he knows that the snake he encountered is likely not real. To understand why, I need to consider where anacondas are native to.",
    "Anacondas are not found in the Midwest; they are primarily found in tropical regions. This includes areas like the Amazon rainforest in South America.",
    "By knowing that anacondas live in tropical regions, it supports John's belief that the snake he saw is probably not real since it wouldn't typically inhabit his location in the Midwest.",
    "Next, I will look at the provided answer choices and see if any of them correlate with the regions where anacondas are found.",
    "The choice \"C: tropics\" aligns with what I have learned about the habitat of anacondas, confirming that they prefer warm, wet climates.",
    "The other choices (A, B, D, E) do not relate to the natural habitat of anacondas. They do not signify the warm regions where these snakes naturally live.",
    "Thus, the answer that best reflects the region where anacondas are native is \u201cC: tropics\u201d."
