  "query": "Question: He was applying for a job, what did he promise to do when he spoke with the manager?\n\nChoices:\nA: frustration\nB: working hard\nC: over time\nD: stress\nE: employment",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of applying for a job. Generally, applicants make promises or commitments regarding their work ethic or availability to the manager.",
    "Thinking of the possible choices, \"A: frustration\" does not make sense as a promise \u2013 an applicant would not promise to experience negative emotions.",
    "\"B: working hard\" aligns with common promises applicants make to assure potential employers of their dedication and effort.",
    "Next, I look at \"C: over time.\" While some may be willing to work overtime, it is not a promise typically stated during the initial conversation about applying.",
    "\"Stress,\" found in option \"D,\" is again unrelated to a promise; applicants wouldn't highlight stress as an intention or commitment.",
    "Finally, \"E: employment\" does not sound like a promise but rather an outcome. An applicant would not promise employment; it depends on the hiring decision.",
    "The most logical and typical statement of promise in a job application context is \"B: working hard.\" This is a commitment to the manager indicating diligence and responsibility."
