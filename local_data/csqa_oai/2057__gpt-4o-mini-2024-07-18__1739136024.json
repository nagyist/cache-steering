  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that some people play poker in tournaments, which suggests a structured and serious environment.",
    "Tournaments typically involve a level of seriousness that goes beyond casual play, indicating the presence of competition.",
    "The mention of \"prizes\" further emphasizes the incentive of competing against others for rewards, distinguishing it from merely playing for fun or social engagement.",
    "While \"fun\" could be a reason for playing, it does not capture the essence of tournaments, which are focused on competition.",
    "\"Casinos\" are venues where poker is played, but the question asks about the challenge involved in tournaments, not the location.",
    "A \"social event\" could apply to casual poker games, but tournaments are primarily about the competitive aspect.",
    "The option \"losing money\" is generally a fear or consequence of gambling, not a reason for the challenge of playing in tournaments.",
    "Considering all candidates, \"competition\" best summarizes the prime reason players engage in poker tournaments."
