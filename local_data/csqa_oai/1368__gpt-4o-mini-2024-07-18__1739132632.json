  "steps": [
    "The question states that he was competing for a prestigious prize that had no monetary value. This suggests that the prize is not about financial gain, but rather about something else of significance.",
    "Since the prize is described as prestigious, it likely represents a high level of achievement or recognition in a particular field or endeavor.",
    "The absence of money indicates that the pursuit is likely related to personal fulfillment, social status, or validation rather than financial benefit.",
    "Looking at the choices, option D: \"accomplishment\" aligns well with the idea of seeking recognition and validation for one\u2019s efforts, which is common in competitive environments.",
    "The other options can be analyzed: \n- A: \"enemies\" suggests conflict, which does not fit the context of seeking a prize.\n- B: \"rivalry\" could imply competition, but it does not directly relate to what is being sought.\n- C: \"bad blood\" indicates animosity and further implies conflict, which is also not relevant here.\n- E: \"game\" does not clearly relate to what he is seeking either.",
    "Considering all of this, the term that best encapsulates the aim of competing for a prestigious prize without financial incentive is indeed accomplishment."
