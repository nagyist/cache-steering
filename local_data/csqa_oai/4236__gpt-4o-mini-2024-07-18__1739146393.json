  "query": "Question: What does someone experience after eating lunch?\n\nChoices:\nA: numb\nB: farts\nC: late for work\nD: feel full\nE: feel sleepy",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about common experiences after eating lunch.",
    "One common experience is feeling full after consuming food.",
    "Feeling sleepy is also a common experience after lunch due to post-lunch dip in energy levels.",
    "Numbness is not typically associated with eating as a direct result.",
    "Farting can occur after eating, but it is not universally experienced by everyone.",
    "Being late for work is a situational outcome and not a direct effect of eating lunch.",
    "Between feeling full and feeling sleepy, both can be valid, but feeling full is usually more immediate.",
    "After considering all options, feeling full (D) and feeling sleepy (E) are the strongest candidates.",
    "Since the question asks for what one typically experiences immediately after eating lunch, feeling full is the most straightforward answer."
