  "steps": [
    "The question states that the person has been driving for 10 hours, which is a long time to be engaged in such activity.",
    "Driving for such an extended time can lead to physical and mental fatigue, commonly referred to as tiredness.",
    "Given that the individual is \"sick of driving,\" it suggests a sense of boredom or exhaustion, further implying negative feelings toward the experience of driving for too long.",
    "Evaluating the choices:\n- A: \"death\" does not directly correlate with feelings after a long drive.\n- B: \"wreak\" does not make sense in this context.\n- C: \"pollution\" is unrelated to personal feelings.\n- D: \"getting tired\" aligns well with the feelings of exhaustion and being sick of the long drive.\n- E: \"happy\" contradicts the statement about being sick of driving.",
    "Among the choices, D: \"getting tired\" directly captures the sentiment of feeling fatigued after such an extensive period of driving.",
    "No other option provides a clear match to the context of feeling tired and fed up with driving for a long time."
