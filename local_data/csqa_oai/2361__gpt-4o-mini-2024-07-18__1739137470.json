  "query": "Question: She would only buy things on sale as to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: selling\nB: get money\nC: save money\nD: steal\nE: spend money",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the reason why she would only buy things on sale.",
    "Buying items on sale typically indicates a desire to reduce expenses.",
    "If the purpose is to buy items only when they are discounted, it implies she wants to minimize her spending.",
    "This aligns with the concept of saving money rather than engaging in activities like selling or stealing.",
    "The other options do not directly relate to buying things on sale; for instance, \"selling\" (A) and \"steal\" (D) are not relevant motivations for purchasing on sale.",
    "\"Get money\" (B) is an action unrelated to buying items, and \"spend money\" (E) contradicts the intent of buying on sale to save.",
    "Thus, the most fitting choice, which directly corresponds to the motivation behind buying only on sale, is to save money."
