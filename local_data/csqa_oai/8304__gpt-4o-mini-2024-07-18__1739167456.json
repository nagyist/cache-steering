  "query": "Question: The belief that we don't choose what happens in life is called what?\n\nChoices:\nA: force\nB: undecided\nC: serendipity\nD: reject\nE: predetermination",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the fundamental concepts related to control over life events. The idea that we don't have a say in what happens suggests a lack of agency.",
    "Next, I will examine the choices provided to identify which ones relate to this lack of agency.",
    "Choice A: \"force\" does not specifically indicate a belief regarding choice or agency; it seems unrelated.",
    "Choice B: \"undecided\" implies a state of not having made a decision but does not refer to an overarching belief about life events.",
    "Choice C: \"serendipity\" refers to the occurrence of events by chance, but it does not imply a definitive belief about the absence of choice or control.",
    "Choice D: \"reject\" generally means to refuse something; this term doesn't pertain directly to a belief about life's events or choices.",
    "Choice E: \"predetermination\" refers to the idea that events are determined in advance, implying that outcomes are fixed and we lack control over them. This aligns closely with the belief that we do not choose what happens in life.",
    "Now, comparing the significance of \"predetermination\" with other options, it seems to best match the concept of a lack of control over life events.",
    "Finally, I've considered all options and their meanings, confirming that \"predetermination\" captures the belief in a predetermined course of events in life without personal choice."
