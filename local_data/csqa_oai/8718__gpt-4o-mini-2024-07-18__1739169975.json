  "query": "Question: Bobby was doing housework when he became sick.   He thought he worked too hard, but the doctor said what it was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sneezing\nB: exhaustion\nC: itchy\nD: cleanliness\nE: allergies",
  "steps": [
    "To solve the problem, I need to identify what the doctor likely told Bobby about his condition after he became sick while doing housework.",
    "Bobby thought he worked too hard, which suggests he may be attributing his sickness to physical fatigue or overexertion.",
    "However, the doctor's perspective is necessary to understand the exact nature of Bobby's illness.",
    "The options given are: A: sneezing, B: exhaustion, C: itchy, D: cleanliness, and E: allergies.",
    "Sneezing (A) typically relates to respiratory issues, which might not be suggested solely by physical labor.",
    "Exhaustion (B) could be a reasonable conclusion considering Bobby felt he worked too hard, but the doctor's role implies he would point to a clear diagnosis rather than fatigue.",
    "The term \"itchy\" (C) does not directly link to Bobby's physical activity and is less likely to be a doctor's diagnostic conclusion.",
    "Cleanliness (D) is not a medical diagnosis and would not be something a doctor tells in response to someone feeling sick.",
    "Allergies (E) could feasibly be triggered by dust or allergens encountered during housework, making it a plausible cause for his sickness.",
    "After considering each option critically, it appears that the most reasonable diagnosis by the doctor, given Bobby's situation, is allergies."
