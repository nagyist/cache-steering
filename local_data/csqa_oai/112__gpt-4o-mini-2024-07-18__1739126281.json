  "steps": [
    "First, I need to clarify the context of the question, which is about the causes of death related to someone who is very depressed.",
    "Next, I consider the relationship between depression and suicidal thoughts or actions. Depression can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.",
    "I then evaluate the provided answer options to see which are directly connected to the consequences of severe depression.",
    "The first option, A: suicide, is often associated with severe depression, as individuals may see it as a way to escape their pain.",
    "The second option, B: overdosing, can also be connected to depression, as some individuals might abuse medication or drugs, which could result in death.",
    "The option C: sadness, while a symptom of depression, is not a direct cause of death.",
    "The option D: murder is unrelated to the context of personal depression and its consequences on the individual.",
    "Lastly, the option E: cyanide, while it could technically cause death, is not a direct consequence of depression but rather a specific method.",
    "Considering all of the options, A: suicide is the most direct and common cause of death related to severe depression."
