  "query": "Question: If you need an item is it a good idea to wait for a sale before what?\n\nChoices:\nA: buying\nB: clothing store\nC: k mart\nD: overpriced\nE: expensive",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"If you need an item,\" indicating that there is an urgency to acquire something.",
    "The phrase \"wait for a sale\" suggests that the speaker is considering delaying their purchase in hopes of a better price.",
    "The word \"before\" implies that the waiting for a sale should happen in relation to the action of purchasing the item.",
    "Therefore, the logical action that comes after needing an item and before purchasing is to wait for the sale.",
    "Among the options provided, we need to identify the one that best completes the phrase \"waiting for a sale before.\"",
    "The options are A: buying, B: clothing store, C: K Mart, D: overpriced, and E: expensive.",
    "Option A: \"buying\" fits perfectly, as it directly follows the need for an item and the idea of waiting for a sale.",
    "Options B (clothing store) and C (K Mart) are locations and not actions, so they do not fit well in the sentence context.",
    "Options D (overpriced) and E (expensive) are descriptions of prices, but they do not relate directly to the act of waiting for a sale before making a purchase.",
    "Thus, the correct action after considering all reasoning is indeed A: buying, as this aligns with the process of waiting for the sale to occur before completing the purchase."
