  "query": "Question: Where will you find an automobile that has broken down?\n\nChoices:\nA: fast lane\nB: for sale\nC: racetrack\nD: side of road\nE: freeway",
  "steps": [
    "An automobile that has broken down cannot operate as expected and is unable to continue driving.",
    "The fast lane is typically reserved for vehicles that are moving at higher speeds, so it would not be suitable for a broken-down car.",
    "'For sale' implies that the automobile is being sold, not that it is broken down at that moment.",
    "A racetrack is specifically designed for racing, and a broken-down vehicle would not remain there for long, as it would impede the race.",
    "A freeway, similar to a fast lane, is intended for vehicles that are in motion, thus not a common spot for a broken-down vehicle to remain.",
    "The side of the road is a common location where broken-down vehicles pull over to stop safely away from moving traffic.",
    "In many scenarios, when a vehicle breaks down, the driver will try to steer it to the side of the road to avoid accidents.",
    "Considering all options, the side of the road is the most reasonable place to find a car that has encountered mechanical troubles."
