  "query": "Question: Which state are you in if you're at a tennis court in a mitten-shaped state?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: country club\nC: health club\nD: florida\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which state is described as a \"mitten-shaped state,\" I think of the geographical shape of states in the United States.",
    "The state that is widely referred to as \"mitten-shaped\" is Michigan, particularly because of the way its two peninsulas resemble a mitten when viewed on a map.",
    "Next, I analyze the other choices to see if \"tennis court\" aligns with any specific locations. However, I focus primarily on the geographical aspect of the question, which is about the state itself.",
    "The tennis court is a common feature in many locations, but the question specifically highlights a certain state's distinctive shape.",
    "The choice of \"Florida\" (D) does not fit, as Florida is not described as a mitten-shaped state; rather, it has a unique, elongated shape akin to a peninsula.",
    "As I consider the other options (A: town, B: country club, C: health club), they indicate places rather than states, so they are unlikely answers in this context.",
    "Since I have correctly identified Michigan as the only state that fits the description of being \"mitten-shaped,\" it stands out among all the choices.",
    "I ensure that I have double-checked my reasoning about the geographical shape of Michigan and dismissed other options that don't align with the question."
