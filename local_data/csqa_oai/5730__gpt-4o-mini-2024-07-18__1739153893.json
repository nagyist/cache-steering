  "steps": [
    "Identify the typical habitat of snakes. Snakes are often found in warm environments with sufficient cover and water sources.",
    "Consider what type of swamp is being referenced. Swamps can be found in various climates, including temperate and tropical regions.",
    "Evaluate the options provided against the characteristics of swamps. Oregon has some wetlands, but they tend to be cooler, which may not be optimal for all snake species.",
    "Mud is a common component of swamps, but it does not directly indicate a location where one might find snakes.",
    "Tropical forests can have swampy areas but they are broader than just swamps. They're not specific to \"where in a swamp\" we might find snakes.",
    "A pet store may have snakes, but they are not found in a natural swamp environment.",
    "Louisiana is renowned for its swamps, such as the bayous, which are habitat-rich areas for many snake species.",
    "Compare Louisiana with other options based on the likelihood of finding snakes in a swamp. Given the warmth and biodiversity of Louisiana swamps, it is the most probable answer.",
    "Reconfirm that snakes are indeed prevalent in swampy areas, especially in Louisiana.",
    "Select Louisiana as the most logical choice based on its swamp ecology and snake habitat."
