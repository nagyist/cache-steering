  "query": "Question: Sarah went to school to be a nurse.  She loved giving assistance to people in need. To better help people, she had to constantly do something.  What might she do to better help people?\n\nChoices:\nA: people helped\nB: learning new skills\nC: better circumstances\nD: practice\nE: happiness",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Sarah went to school to be a nurse and loves assisting people in need, which implies she is proactive about improving her ability to help others.",
    "The phrase \"constantly do something\" suggests that there is an ongoing process or action that she can engage in to enhance her skills and abilities.",
    "Looking at the options provided, A (people helped) does not fit because it does not describe an activity or process that Sarah would undertake.",
    "Option B (learning new skills) is relevant because nurses often need ongoing education and training to stay current with medical practices and improve their ability to help patients.",
    "C (better circumstances) appears more abstract and does not represent an actionable step that Sarah can take in her role as a nurse.",
    "Option D (practice) is another possibility, as practicing would help her refine her skills and improve her performance as a nurse directly.",
    "E (happiness) is also not applicable as it doesn\u2019t relate to an action Sarah could take to improve her vocational skills.",
    "Now, I need to determine which of the options B (learning new skills) and D (practice) is more aligned with the idea of \"constantly doing something\" to better help others.",
    "While both B and D are valuable actions for a nurse, \"learning new skills\" often encompasses both acquiring new knowledge and the application of practice.",
    "Thus, \"learning new skills\" represents a broader and more versatile approach than simply practicing, as it also includes the gaining of fresh knowledge necessary for nursing."
