  "steps": [
    "The question asks what happens when clothing is submerged in water.",
    "When clothing is submerged in water, the water interacts with the fabric.",
    "One of the primary effects of this interaction is that the water soaks into the fibers of the clothing.",
    "This soaking process causes the clothing to become wet.",
    "The term that best describes the result of clothing being submerged in water is \"drenching,\" which implies that the clothing is thoroughly soaked.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"drenching\" (C) directly relates to the act of soaking something in water.",
    "None of the other choices (A, B, D, E) describe the effect of submerging clothing in water.",
    "Therefore, I can conclude that the correct answer to the question is the one that describes the soaking process of clothing submerged in water."
