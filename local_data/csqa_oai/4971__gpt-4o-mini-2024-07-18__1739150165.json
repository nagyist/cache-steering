  "query": "Question: South America is in winter when North America is in summer, this is because it is located where?\n\nChoices:\nA: occident\nB: america\nC: southern hemisphere\nD: far\nE: western hemisphere",
  "steps": [
    "To determine why South America experiences winter when North America is in summer, we should consider the Earth's axial tilt and how it affects seasons in different hemispheres.",
    "The Earth is tilted on its axis at an angle of about 23.5 degrees, which causes different hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.",
    "In the Northern Hemisphere, summer occurs when the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in longer days and more direct sunlight.",
    "Conversely, during this same time period, the South Pole is tilted away from the Sun, leading to shorter days and less direct sunlight in the Southern Hemisphere, where South America is located.",
    "Thus, when it is summer in North America (Northern Hemisphere), it is winter in South America (Southern Hemisphere).",
    "Now we need to relate this information to the provided answer choices, focusing on geographical regions.",
    "The term \"southern hemisphere\" specifically refers to the half of the Earth that is south of the equator, which includes South America.",
    "None of the other choices (A: occident, B: america, D: far, E: western hemisphere) accurately captures the concept that South America is located in the southern hemisphere where winter occurs when it is summer in the northern hemisphere.",
    "Thus, the correct answer that directly relates to the geographical location of South America in context to the seasons is \"southern hemisphere.\""
