    "First, I need to evaluate what the question is asking for. It wants to know specific locations where a person can keep a small notepad on their body.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option considering practicality and common usage of clothing or accessories for carrying small items like a notepad.",
    "Option A: Back pocket - This is a viable location for a small notepad as many people use back pockets to store small items.",
    "Option B: Meeting - This is an event or situation, not a physical location on a person. It does not directly answer the question.",
    "Option C: Drug store - Similar to option B, this is a place and not a way to store something on your person.",
    "Option D: Home - While you can store a notepad at home, it is not on your person. Thus, it does not qualify.",
    "Option E: School - Like options B and C, this is a location, not on a person. It does not fulfill the criteria of the question.",
