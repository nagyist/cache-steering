  "steps": [
    "Johnny sat on a bench, which suggests he is in a place designed for sitting and relaxing.",
    "The fact that he relaxed after doing a lot of work on his hobby implies he is in a peaceful environment, likely outdoors.",
    "The choices include several locations: state park, bus depot, garden, gym, and rest area.",
    "A state park typically has benches and is a place for relaxation, fitting his activity.",
    "A bus depot generally is a busy location for transportation and not typically associated with relaxation.",
    "A garden also has benches and is designed for aesthetics and relaxation, making it a compatible location.",
    "A gym focuses on workout and activity, which does not align with Johnny\u2019s state of relaxation.",
    "A rest area can also have benches and be a place to relax, often found alongside highways for travelers.",
    "Considering the characteristics of a state park and a garden, both seem likely; however, the mention of \"hobby\" may suggest a more natural, serene environment like a garden.",
    "While both the state park and garden are valid options, the garden often is more specifically associated with hobbies like gardening, thus making it more fitting as per the context."
