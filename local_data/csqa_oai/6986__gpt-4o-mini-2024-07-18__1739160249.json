  "query": "Question: Where will my kid put their coin in their room?\n\nChoices:\nA: piggy bank\nB: wishing well\nC: parking meter\nD: under pillow\nE: change purse",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common places where children typically store coins. A piggy bank is a traditional option for kids to save money.",
    "Next, examine the other options. A wishing well is often used in fairy tales and may not be an actual item in a child's room.",
    "Evaluate the parking meter option. It is unlikely that a child would have a parking meter in their room to deposit coins.",
    "Look at the option of placing coins under the pillow. While children may hide things under their pillow, it is generally not a standard place for storing coins.",
    "Lastly, consider a change purse. This is also a viable option for holding coins, particularly if the child has one.",
    "Now let's compare the two most viable options: piggy bank and change purse. A piggy bank is more commonly associated with coin storage for children.",
    "While both the piggy bank and change purse are reasonable choices, the piggy bank stands out as the most traditional and likely choice for children.",
    "After evaluating all options and their suitability, the piggy bank emerges as the best answer based on common practices."
