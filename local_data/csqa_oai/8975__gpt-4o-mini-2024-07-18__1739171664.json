    "The question asks where humans go in space, which suggests looking for an answer that involves space travel or being located in space.",
    "Choice A, \"anywhere on earth,\" is incorrect because it refers to locations on Earth rather than in space.",
    "Choice B, \"ufos,\" does not correspond to a location humans travel to but rather refers to unidentified flying objects, which may not have human presence associated with them.",
    "Choice C, \"strip club,\" does not relate to space and is not a location humans travel to into space.",
    "Choice D, \"international space station,\" is known as a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit, where humans frequently go for scientific research and experiments.",
    "Choice E, \"school,\" is also unrelated to space, as schools are located on Earth.",
    "After reviewing all the options, choice D stands out as the only relevant answer where humans actively travel and stay in space."
