  "steps": [
    "The teacher emphasizes individuality among the students while also recognizing the common traits they share.",
    "The important part of her explanation is the desire for each student to feel valued or distinguished as an individual despite being part of a group.",
    "The phrase \"each student was an individual\" suggests that the teacher wants every student to understand their unique worth.",
    "The options provided include terms that might relate to individuality or specific feelings each student might experience.",
    "Option A (specific) implies a distinction but does not quite capture the emotional aspect of feeling valued.",
    "Option B (particular) is similar to specific, focusing on distinction but lacking an emotional connotation.",
    "Option C (special) directly conveys a positive emotional state, suggesting that each student should feel unique and valued.",
    "Option D (advance forces to city) does not relate to the context of feelings or individuality.",
    "Option E (particular) is a repeat of option B and carries the same implications without emotional depth.",
    "Given these considerations, \"special\" stands out as the most appropriate option since it captures the essence of the teacher's message about individual worth."
