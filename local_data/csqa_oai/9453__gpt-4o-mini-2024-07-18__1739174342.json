  "query": "Question: What do police do when getting ready to work?\n\nChoices:\nA: arm themselves\nB: force law\nC: pull someone over\nD: help people\nE: direct traffic",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the actions police take when preparing to begin their work duties.",
    "The first option, \"arm themselves\", suggests that police officers prepare by ensuring they have their weapons ready, which is a common practice in law enforcement.",
    "The second option, \"force law\", seems vague; it could imply enforcing laws but doesn\u2019t specify a particular action that indicates preparation for work.",
    "The third option, \"pull someone over\", implies an action taken during the performance of their duties rather than a preparatory step.",
    "The fourth option, \"help people\", is a broader goal of police work but does not specifically reference a preparatory action.",
    "The fifth option, \"direct traffic\", is typically done after officers are already actively engaged in their duties, hence it does not represent a preparatory action.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, \"arm themselves\" is the most fitting action when police get ready to work, as it is a standard preparatory step."
