  "query": "Question: If I had more than one steel pen (e.g. 100,000), where would I store it?\n\nChoices:\nA: hand\nB: warehouse\nC: tv stand\nD: back of farm\nE: desk drawer",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a suitable storage location for a large quantity of steel pens, specifically over 100,000.",
    "First, consider the physical size and space required to store such a large quantity of steel pens. A typical hand, desk drawer, and TV stand would not provide sufficient space.",
    "Option A (hand) is not viable since it can hold only a limited number of pens, far fewer than 100,000.",
    "Option C (TV stand) is also inadequate, as it is generally not designed for storage of such large quantities.",
    "Option E (desk drawer) would likely be much too small as well, given that a standard desk drawer may hold only a few dozen pens comfortably.",
    "Now evaluating Option D (back of farm), while it is a large space, it does not convey a secure or organized solution for storing such a quantity.",
    "Option B (warehouse) is specifically designed for storage and can accommodate large volumes of inventory like 100,000 steel pens effectively.",
    "Considering the other options and the need for both space and safety, a warehouse would be the most logical choice for storing a large quantity of steel pens.",
    "Thus, based on the reasoning, the most suitable storage location among the options provided for a high volume of steel pens would be a warehouse."
