  "query": "Question: What can you put in a parking lot?\n\nChoices:\nA: car\nB: town\nC: circus\nD: city\nE: business district",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that can be put in a parking lot; we need to identify which option relates directly to a physical entity that fits within the confines of a parking lot.",
    "Looking at option A, \"car,\" it is a vehicle specifically designed for use on roads and typically parked in a parking lot, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Option B, \"town,\" does not fit because a town is a larger geographical and administrative area, not something that can occupy a parking lot.",
    "Option C, \"circus,\" represents an event or entertainment, but it is not a physical object or entity that can fit into a parking lot.",
    "Option D, \"city,\" like option B, refers to a large geographical area and cannot be placed within the confines of a parking lot.",
    "Option E, \"business district,\" also refers to a larger area with various businesses and does not represent a singular object or entity that can be parked or placed in a parking lot.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all the options, the only appropriate answer that refers to something that can indeed be parked in a parking lot is option A, \"car.\""
