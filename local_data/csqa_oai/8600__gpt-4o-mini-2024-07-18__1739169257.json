  "query": "Question: Billy was a very creative person but he wasn't very social. He wanted to meet new people. What would he have to do to accomplish that?\n\nChoices:\nA: talk to each other\nB: go out\nC: sing\nD: make art\nE: come home",
  "steps": [
    "Billy wants to meet new people, which implies he needs to engage in activities where social interactions can occur.",
    "Considering that he is not very social, he may need to step out of his comfort zone to interact with new individuals.",
    "Going out generally refers to attending social events or places where interaction with others is more likely to happen.",
    "Talking to each other is a component of meeting new people but simply existing in a space doesn\u2019t guarantee interaction.",
    "Singing could involve social interaction, but it is less directly related to meeting new people compared to going out.",
    "Making art alone does not inherently include any social interaction unless it\u2019s shared with others, which is not implied directly.",
    "Coming home does not involve meeting new people; it is the opposite of the objective.",
    "The most direct and effective way for Billy to meet new people is to go out to places where social interaction is facilitated."
