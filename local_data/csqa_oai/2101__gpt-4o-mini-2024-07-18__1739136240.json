  "query": "Question: Where is the closest place you would cook bbq?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: backyard\nC: work\nD: summer\nE: louisiana",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of cooking BBQ. BBQ is typically associated with informal settings where you can have a grill and enough space to cook outdoors.",
    "Next, I analyze the options provided. A restaurant typically has a designated kitchen and may not allow individuals to cook BBQ unless it's specialized BBQ restaurant, which limits its accessibility.",
    "Then, I evaluate \"backyard\". A backyard is commonly used for grilling, making it a popular spot for BBQ cooking.",
    "Considering \"work\", while some workplaces may have grills for social events, it is not a standard place to cook BBQ on a regular basis.",
    "The option \"summer\" does not refer to a specific location but rather a season when BBQ might take place. Thus, it is not a direct place to cook BBQ.",
    "Lastly, examining \"louisiana\", while it is known for its cuisine, it does not specifically indicate a personal cooking location. BBQ can occur in Louisiana, but it doesn\u2019t clarify where closest to the question posed.",
    "Comparing all options, \"backyard\" remains the most logical location for closely cooking BBQ regularly and freely."
