  "query": "Question: Where would you find a shark that is not alive?\n\nChoices:\nA: great barrier reef\nB: deep ocean\nC: maritime museum\nD: ocean\nE: pool hall",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the premise of finding a shark that is not alive. This implies looking for a shark that is either a preserved specimen or a representation, rather than a live shark.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll examine each choice to see where a non-living shark might be located.",
    "Choice A: the Great Barrier Reef is a natural habitat for live sharks, so it wouldn't be a place to find a non-living shark.",
    "Choice B: the deep ocean is also a habitat for live sharks; therefore, it's not suitable for finding a non-living shark.",
    "Choice C: a maritime museum is a place where marine life, including sharks, can be preserved and displayed, making it a potential candidate for where to find a non-living shark.",
    "Choice D: the ocean refers mainly to the living marine environment, so it would not be a place to find a non-living shark.",
    "Choice E: a pool hall has no relation to marine life, let alone to preserved sharks; thus, it is not a relevant choice.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, the only plausible location for finding a shark that is not alive is the maritime museum."
