  "query": "Question: Johnny was looking for cookies that his mom had hid from him.  Where might he look for them?\n\nChoices:\nA: dessert\nB: evercookie\nC: evercookie\nD: store\nE: jar",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where mothers typically hide cookies to keep them away from children.",
    "Often, cookies are stored in a place that's accessible but also somewhat concealed, like a pantry or cupboard.",
    "The options provided include: dessert, evercookie, store, and jar.",
    "\"Store\" refers to a place to buy cookies but not where they would be hidden.",
    "\"Evercookie\" appears to be a repeated option and is not a common term related to hiding cookies.",
    "\"Jar\" is a reasonable location since mothers often store cookies in jars to keep them fresh and away from prying eyes.",
    "Considering the nature of the other options, \"jar\" stands out as the most logical hiding spot for cookies.",
    "Since I have determined that jars are common hiding spots for cookies, I conclude this is where Johnny might look."
