  "query": "Question: Where would you find a horse in the desert?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: american southwest\nC: state fair\nD: central park\nE: texas",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the natural habitats for horses. Horses can typically thrive in various environments, but certain regions are more common for them, particularly those that are open and have sufficient food and space.",
    "Next, I need to consider what kinds of environments deserts are. Deserts are characterized by low rainfall, extreme temperatures, and sparse vegetation, which are not ideal for most domestic animals, including horses.",
    "Then, I should look at the options provided. Canada is known for colder climates, which are not desert-like. The state fair is an event rather than a location where horses would live. Central Park is an urban park in New York City, which isn't a desert environment.",
    "Now, examining the option \"American Southwest,\" it is recognized for its desert regions, including parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Horses can be found in this area, especially since it is a region where equestrian activities are popular.",
    "Next, I look at \"Texas.\" Texas includes desert areas (for example, parts of West Texas) and there are many ranches and horses in Texas, making it plausible for horses to be found there as well.",
    "Comparing options B (American Southwest) and E (Texas), both can be desert-like and support horses. However, the term \"American Southwest\" more directly refers to areas that define the desert climate.",
    "Ultimately, while both B and E are acceptable, the most direct and clear choice that captures a specific desert environment associated with horses is B, the American Southwest."
