    "The question states that \"the knowledge was expensive to get,\" which implies that acquiring this knowledge involves significant investment, likely in terms of time and resources.",
    "Let's analyze each choice in terms of where valuable knowledge is typically obtained and the cost associated with it.",
    "Option A: University. Higher education institutions often have high tuition fees and offer extensive knowledge, making this a strong candidate.",
    "Option B: Book. While books can be costly, they are generally not considered as expensive as the other options because of their accessibility and varying price ranges.",
    "Option C: Field. \"Field\" suggests practical experience or hands-on knowledge, which might not necessarily be costly in the same way as formal education.",
    "Option D: Meeting. Meetings typically do not require significant financial investment solely for the knowledge gained, so this is less likely.",
    "Option E: Class. While classes can also be expensive, they generally take place in institutions like universities, which means this is a less direct option compared to choosing university specifically.",
    "After considering the nature of the knowledge and the context, university stands out as the most significant and specific source of expensive knowledge acquisition."
