  "query": "Question: Where can you buy material for making a pillow?\n\nChoices:\nA: construction\nB: toy store\nC: factory\nD: fabric store\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what materials are typically needed to make a pillow. Common materials include fabric for the cover and stuffing material like polyester or down.",
    "Next, I evaluate the options. A construction site would likely not have the specific materials needed for a pillow; its focus is on building materials.",
    "Then, I look at a toy store. While they might have soft toys, they typically do not stock fabrics or stuffing intended for pillow making.",
    "Next, I consider a factory. However, it depends on the type of factory. A pillow factory might have materials, but generally, factories are not retail locations where individuals can buy supplies.",
    "Now, I examine a fabric store. Fabric stores specialize in selling various fabrics, often including materials for crafting items such as pillows. They also usually provide options for stuffing.",
    "Next, I think about whether a house could provide these materials. While someone can make a pillow at home, it's less likely they would have all necessary materials unless they are specifically a crafting home.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the fabric store stands out as the best place to buy fabric and stuffing for making a pillow."
