  "query": "Question: Why might someone have a hard time seeing through a clear medium?\n\nChoices:\nA: obscure\nB: see-through\nC: opaque\nD: thick\nE: misunderstood",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what a clear medium typically is. A clear medium usually allows light to pass through, making it easier to see through it.",
    "Next, we need to identify reasons why someone might struggle to see through a medium that's supposed to be clear.",
    "One possibility is that the medium could be obstructed by something, thus causing issues with visibility.",
    "We could also think about the thickness of the medium. A thick clear medium can sometimes distort or obscure vision, making it harder to see through.",
    "Another factor could include imperfections or impurities within the medium itself that could scatter or absorb light, affecting visibility.",
    "Considering the provided options, 'A: obscure' suggests that something is hidden, which aligns with issues seeing through something.",
    "However, 'C: opaque' indicates that something does not allow light to pass through at all, which contradicts the idea of a clear medium.",
    "Also, 'D: thick' is a valid consideration because a clear medium being thick may hinder visibility.",
    "Next, let's assess 'E: misunderstood.' It doesn't seem relevant because misunderstanding does not relate to the physical properties of visual clarity.",
    "Lastly, of the options remaining, 'D: thick' could accurately describe why one might struggle to see through a clear but physically thick medium."
