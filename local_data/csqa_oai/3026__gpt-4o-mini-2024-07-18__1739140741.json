  "steps": [
    "Firstly, children are often confronted with new and complex information about the world, which can lead to confusion as they try to understand concepts that are unfamiliar to them.",
    "Secondly, the emotional responses of children when finding it hard to learn can frequently include frustration, as they may struggle to comprehend topics or manage tasks that seem daunting.",
    "Thirdly, while sadness can be an emotional response in some learning contexts, it is not a predominant or consistent problem linked specifically to children's learning about the world.",
    "Fourthly, anger can arise in some situations due to frustration, but it isn't a direct problem related to all children's learning experiences; it is more situational depending on the child's temperament.",
    "Fifthly, loss of innocence can occur as children learn about harsher realities of the world, but it is more of a consequence of maturation rather than a direct problem they face when learning.",
    "Lastly, considering common and broad challenges in learning, confusion and frustration are prominent problems; however, confusion stands out as a more fundamental issue affecting their grasp of new knowledge."
