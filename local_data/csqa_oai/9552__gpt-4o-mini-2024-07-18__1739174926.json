  "steps": [
    "I need to identify places or structures where a large door is typically found.",
    "A \"van\" usually has smaller doors suitable for vehicle entry and exit.",
    "An \"apartment\" often has standard-sized doors rather than large ones, as apartments usually are enclosed within buildings.",
    "A \"neighbor's house\" includes residential doors that may vary in size but typically are not large doors.",
    "A \"wall\" itself doesn't have a door unless it is part of a building or an enclosed area.",
    "Now, considering \"building,\" large doors are commonly found in commercial or public buildings for entryways and freight access.",
    "Comparing all options, the building is the most likely option to have large doors.",
    "I also considered the alternatives but they either have smaller standard-sized doors or none at all."
