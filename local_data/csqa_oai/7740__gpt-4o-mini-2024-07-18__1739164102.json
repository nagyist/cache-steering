  "query": "Question: Where would you see a conductor and performers singing in German?\n\nChoices:\nA: subway\nB: listen to music\nC: orchestra\nD: broadway\nE: opera",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the keywords in the question: \"conductor,\" \"performers,\" and \"singing in German.\"",
    "A conductor typically leads a musical ensemble, usually found in formal music settings.",
    "Performers singing in German suggests a setting where the language is emphasized in the performance.",
    "Consider the choices given: \nA: subway - typically not a setting for formal music with a conductor.\nB: listen to music - too broad and doesn't involve live performances.\nC: orchestra - involves a conductor and may feature performances in various languages.\nD: broadway - predominantly features English-language performances and generally lacks a conductor.\nE: opera - often includes a conductor and has many performances in German (e.g., works by composers like Wagner and Mozart).",
    "Among the choices, both C (orchestra) and E (opera) involve a conductor, but E explicitly aligns with singing in German.",
    "An orchestra could perform in multiple languages, whereas operas like \"Die Fledermaus\" or \"The Magic Flute\" are specifically in German.",
    "The context of the question leans towards classical music, where operas are most directly associated with a specific thematic use of language.",
    "Also, operas typically feature dramatic performances, which might not be the primary focus of an orchestra.",
    "Therefore, while both orchestras and operas feature conductors, the specific mention of performers singing in German indicates that the answer is likely an opera."
