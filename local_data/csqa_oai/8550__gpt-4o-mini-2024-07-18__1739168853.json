  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question, which asks about a country that has a large amount of trophy hunters.",
    "Next, I should consider what \"trophy hunting\" means\u2014it's a practice where hunters seek to hunt and collect trophies (like animal horns, heads, or skins) from certain species.",
    "Many people engage in trophy hunting for various reasons, including sport or recreation, and certain countries have regulated it as a part of wildlife management.",
    "I will review the provided choices (A: bears, B: Africa, C: region, D: great outdoors, E: Asia) to identify which could relate to trophy hunting in a country context.",
    "Choice A (bears) refers specifically to a type of animal, not a country or region. Therefore, it doesn't fit.",
    "Choice C (region) is too vague and nonspecific, as it doesn't refer to a distinct country.",
    "Choice D (great outdoors) refers to nature in general and again does not specify a country.",
    "Choice E (Asia) includes several countries, but as a continent, it doesn't pinpoint a specific country with high trophy hunting activity.",
    "Choice B (Africa) is known for trophy hunting, particularly for specific animals like elephants and big cats. Many of the countries in Africa have regulated trophy hunting practices.",
    "In conclusion, while other options do mention animals or nature, they do not relate to a country or region known for trophy hunting as specifically as Africa does."
