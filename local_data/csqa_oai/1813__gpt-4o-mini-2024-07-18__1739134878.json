  "steps": [
    "To determine what Mary never allowed her animal friend to do without a leash, I need to analyze the choices provided.",
    "The first choice, A: leave home, suggests that Mary was protective and did not allow her animal to wander freely outside, which could be plausible.",
    "The second choice, B: vomit, seems unlikely as the act of vomiting isn't typically something one would manage with a leash.",
    "The third choice, C: eating, also seems unlikely because animals usually need to eat, and it wouldn't make sense to put a leash on them for that.",
    "The fourth choice, D: hunt for food, fits well if the animal is a hunting dog or similar; however, it's more common for pets to be leashed to prevent them from roaming freely.",
    "The fifth choice, E: fight for life, is a dramatic phrasing and also doesn't conventionally connect with the idea of needing a leash.",
    "Considering typical behaviors and actions of pet owners, it's common to use a leash to prevent an animal from leaving home or wandering off.",
    "Among the relevant choices, \"leave home\" (A) aligns well with common pet management practices, while \"hunt for food\" (D) might also apply but is less likely given the context of a pet.",
    "Thus, the strongest and most logical answer that aligns with the idea of leashing an animal for safety and control is A."
