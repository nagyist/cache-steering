  "query": "Question: What happens when you eat hamburger too fast without swallowing?\n\nChoices:\nA: get full\nB: drink\nC: choking\nD: hungry\nE: getting fat",
  "steps": [
    "When you eat a hamburger too fast, it's likely that you are not chewing properly.",
    "Not chewing properly can lead to larger pieces of food being swallowed whole.",
    "Swallowing large pieces of food increases the risk of them getting lodged in your throat.",
    "When food gets stuck in the throat, it can block the airway.",
    "If the airway is blocked, it can lead to choking, which is a serious situation.",
    "Drinking liquids can sometimes help clear the blockage, but if the airway is severely blocked, it may not be effective.",
    "Getting full, feeling hungry, or gaining weight do not directly result from the act of eating too fast without swallowing, but choking is an immediate and dangerous consequence.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate result of eating a hamburger too quickly without swallowing is choking."
