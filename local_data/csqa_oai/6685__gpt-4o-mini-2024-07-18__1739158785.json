  "query": "Question: The man pleaded for peace between the two sides, but their what towards each other was too much to abide?\n\nChoices:\nA: hostility\nB: turmoil\nC: fights\nD: fighting\nE: love and understanding",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that there is a conflict between two sides, and the man is asking for peace.",
    "To understand what made it difficult for these sides to achieve peace, we should consider the type of behavior or attitude that could make reconciliation challenging.",
    "\"Hostility\" implies a strong dislike or opposition, which could indeed make peace difficult to achieve.",
    "\"Turmoil\" refers to a state of confusion or disorder; while it suggests a lack of peace, it does not specifically denote the interaction between the two sides.",
    "\"Fights\" could refer to instances of conflict, but it is more of an action rather than an underlying sentiment.",
    "\"Dancing\" as an option is irrelevant in the context of the sentence about conflict and peace, as it does not relate to the disagreement at all.",
    "\"Love and understanding\" would actually promote peace rather than hinder it, so it's not the correct choice.",
    "Among the options, \"hostility\" stands out as the most fitting word, as it captures the idea of mutual animosity which would hinder the possibility of peace.",
    "Thus, the correct word that describes what was too much to abide between the two sides is \"hostility.\""
