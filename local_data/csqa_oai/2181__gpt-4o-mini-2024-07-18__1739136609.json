  "steps": [
    "The question asks where someone goes when they are about to board a vehicle that operates on rails.",
    "Vehicles that operate on rails are typically trains or trams.",
    "To board a train or tram, passengers usually go to a designated area where the vehicles stop.",
    "A railway station is a specific location designed for boarding trains, equipped with platforms and ticketing facilities.",
    "The other options, such as \"deck,\" \"flight of stairs,\" \"porch,\" and \"bus station,\" do not specifically refer to locations for boarding rail vehicles.",
    "A \"deck\" might refer to a ship or another transport but is not applicable for rail boarding.",
    "A \"flight of stairs\" is a structural feature and not a boarding location.",
    "A \"porch\" is a type of entrance and does not pertain to transport boarding.",
    "A \"bus station,\" while it involves boarding a vehicle, refers specifically to buses and is not applicable to rail vehicles.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most appropriate choice that aligns with boarding a vehicle on rails is a railway station."
