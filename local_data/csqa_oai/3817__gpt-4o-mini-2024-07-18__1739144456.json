  "query": "Question: John and James wanted to eat hot dogs but weren't sure where they could by some.  They asked a costumed person for directions.  This was their first trip where?\n\nChoices:\nA: costume shop\nB: park\nC: bowling alley\nD: disneyland\nE: sporting event",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the scenario. John and James are looking for hot dogs, which are commonly sold in places like parks, sporting events, and theme parks.",
    "Consider the significance of a \"costumed person.\" This typically implies a location that attracts visitors or families, where characters or mascots are likely present.",
    "Evaluate the choices based on where costumed characters are commonly found. Disneyland is known for having many costumed characters interacting with guests.",
    "Analyze the other options: a costume shop would not have hot dogs for sale, a park could have food vendors but is less likely to have costumed characters, a bowling alley typically doesn\u2019t feature costumes or hot dogs prominently, and a sporting event might have vendors but usually doesn't include costumed characters.",
    "Conclude that Disneyland is the most probable location for John and James's first trip because it fits best with the presence of a costumed person and offers hot dogs as food options."
