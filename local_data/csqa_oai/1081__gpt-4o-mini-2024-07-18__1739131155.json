  "query": "Question: Where would you put a teaspoon if you are not using it?\n\nChoices:\nA: in mouth\nB: eating\nC: kitchen drawer\nD: cup of coffee\nE: coffee cup",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the function of a teaspoon\u2014it is typically used for stirring or measuring ingredients and not usually for resting in one's mouth or while actively eating.",
    "Option A (in mouth) is impractical since putting a teaspoon in your mouth is not a conventional way to store it after use.",
    "Option B (eating) indicates an action rather than a resting place for the spoon; thus, it does not fulfill the requirement for storage.",
    "Option D (cup of coffee) suggests placing the spoon in a liquid, but this could lead to it being dirty or submerged, which is not suitable for storage.",
    "Option E (coffee cup) has similar reasoning as option D; it suggests placing it in a liquid, which isn\u2019t an effective storage method.",
    "Option C (kitchen drawer) provides a practical and conventional storage solution for utensils like a teaspoon, making it the most appropriate choice.",
    "Among all the options, C is the only choice that adheres to typical kitchen practices for storing utensils that are not in use."
