  "steps": [
    "The company is named \"Big Sky Excavation,\" which suggests it may relate to outdoor work or construction.",
    "The term \"Big Sky\" is often associated with vast, open landscapes, which is a characteristic of certain regions.",
    "Montana is famously known as the \"Big Sky Country\" due to its expansive skies and natural beauty.",
    "Excavation work typically takes place in areas where there are land development projects, which are common in rural or wide-open spaces.",
    "Considering the name \"Big Sky,\" it implies a region with significant land and less urban congestion.",
    "Among the choices, only Montana directly relates to the concept of \"Big Sky.\"",
    "The other options (forest, city, Egypt, and desert) do not have a direct strong connection to the name \"Big Sky\" in the same way Montana does.",
    "Therefore, it is logical to conclude that a company named Big Sky Excavation would likely operate in Montana due to its association with open land and excavation work."
