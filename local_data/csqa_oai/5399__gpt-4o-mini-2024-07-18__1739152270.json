  "query": "Question: If you see materials surrounded by workers you may be in what zone?\n\nChoices:\nA: hazardous waste\nB: construction\nC: fabric store\nD: science lab\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions materials surrounded by workers, indicating an environment where workers are likely focused on managing or handling those materials.",
    "Considering the options, I need to evaluate which environment commonly involves workers surrounding various materials.",
    "Option A, hazardous waste, might involve workers, but typically this would be in a regulated and less visible environment, often behind barriers for safety.",
    "Option B, construction, is a very plausible choice, as construction sites are characterized by many workers and various materials (like wood, steel, etc.) being handled and surrounded by workers.",
    "Option C, a fabric store, does involve materials, but it typically has fewer workers actively handling items compared to a busy construction site.",
    "Option D, a science lab, could involve materials and workers, but the term \"surrounded\" doesn't strongly apply here, as labs might not have as many materials spread out.",
    "Option E, a house, is a general choice and doesn\u2019t have a strong correlation with workers deliberately surrounding materials; it's more of a living space.",
    "By evaluating these options, construction (Option B) stands out as the environment where workers are likely to be surrounded by a variety of materials in a busy and organized manner."
