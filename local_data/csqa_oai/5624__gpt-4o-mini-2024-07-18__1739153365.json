  "query": "Question: When John turned on the light he saw a severed gazelle head.  Where was John?\n\nChoices:\nA: ball gown\nB: zoo\nC: ivory coast\nD: trophy room\nE: kalahari desert",
  "steps": [
    "We are trying to determine where John is based on the context that he saw a severed gazelle head when he turned on the light.",
    "The presence of a severed gazelle head suggests a scenario related to hunting or a trophy display, as this is not an everyday occurrence in most environments.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, a \"trophy room\" is a place where hunters often display their trophies, including heads of animals they have hunted.",
    "A zoo typically wouldn't have a severed animal head on display, which makes it an unlikely choice.",
    "A ball gown setting does not relate to the context of a severed head or hunting at all.",
    "The \"ivory coast\" and \"Kalahari desert\" refer to geographical locations, and while they might have wildlife, they are not specific locations where one would expect to find a severed head in the context given.",
    "By process of elimination, the \"trophy room\" aligns best with the scenario described.",
    "Since a trophy room is a recognized area for displaying such items and matches the context of John seeing a severed gazelle head, this reinforces our conclusion.",
    "Final confirmation that no other choices adequately explain the scenario as well as a trophy room does."
