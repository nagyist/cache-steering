  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Jason appeared calm outwardly but was experiencing recent losses. This suggests an internal struggle or emotional turmoil that is not visible on the surface.",
    "We need to evaluate the provided options in the context of his internal state given his external calmness and recent losses.",
    "Option A is \"anxious,\" which could be a possible feeling stemming from losses, but the word does not directly imply a state that contrasts with calmness.",
    "Option B is \"frustrated.\" This could be a likely emotion resulting from losses and can coexist with seeming calmness on the outside.",
    "Option C is \"flustered.\" This suggests a state of being agitated or overwhelmed, contrasting with calmness, making it a plausible internal response to losses.",
    "Option D is \"excited.\" This seems unlikely as losing would typically not make someone feel excited.",
    "Option E is \"calmness,\" which is directly stated as his exterior state and does not apply to his internal feelings.",
    "Now we have narrowed down our options to A (anxious), B (frustrated), and C (flustered).",
    "Considering the context of \"recent losses\" and how they typically affect a person, the emotional response is likely frustration or a flustered state due to disappointment.",
    "Between \"frustrated\" (B) and \"flustered\" (C), \"frustrated\" aligns closely with a reaction to repeated losses, while \"flustered\" suggests more of a panic or emotional overload, which might not fit as well compared with the more common reaction of frustration."
