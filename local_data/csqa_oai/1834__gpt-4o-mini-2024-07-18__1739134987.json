  "query": "Question: What container does peanut butter come in?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: pantry\nC: jar\nD: bottle\nE: supermarket",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the type of packaging typically used for food items like peanut butter.",
    "Peanut butter is a spread, and spreads are generally stored in containers that can seal the product and preserve its freshness.",
    "Next, evaluate the given options for what a container would be specifically used for peanut butter.",
    "Assess option A: \"cupboard.\" A cupboard is not a container, but rather a storage space for food items.",
    "Assess option B: \"pantry.\" Similar to a cupboard, it is a space used for storing food and not a specific container.",
    "Now evaluate option C: \"jar.\" A jar is commonly used to package spreads like peanut butter, providing a secure seal.",
    "Evaluate option D: \"bottle.\" While bottles can hold some food products, peanut butter is not typically packed in a bottle.",
    "Finally, assess option E: \"supermarket.\" A supermarket is a place where you can buy peanut butter, but it does not refer to the actual container.",
    "Therefore, the only choice that specifically refers to a container used for peanut butter is C: jar."
