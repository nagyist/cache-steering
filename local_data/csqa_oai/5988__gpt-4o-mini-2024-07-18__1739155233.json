  "query": "Question: Indoor cats versus outdoor tend to what longer?\n\nChoices:\nA: walk on two legs\nB: meow\nC: live many years\nD: cast shadow\nE: see king",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question. It compares indoor cats and outdoor cats regarding their lifespan.",
    "Next, I recall general knowledge regarding pet care. Indoor cats tend to have longer lifespans than outdoor cats due to fewer risks, such as accidents, diseases, predators, and harsh weather conditions.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices provided: \n- A (walk on two legs) is unrelated to the lifespan of cats.\n- B (meow) is also unrelated to lifespan.\n- C (live many years) is directly related to the lifespan of cats.\n- D (cast shadow) is not relevant in the context of lifespan.\n- E (see king) has no logical connection to the question about cats.",
    "Now, I confirm that among the choices, only C addresses the concept of living longer and aligns with what I know about indoor versus outdoor cats.",
    "I cross-verify and find no ambiguities or misleading information in choice C regarding indoor cats having a longer lifespan.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating all options and confirming my reasoning, I conclude that the correct answer must relate to the lifespan."
