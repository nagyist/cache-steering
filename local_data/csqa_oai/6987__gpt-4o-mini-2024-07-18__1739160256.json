  "query": "Question: Science is a difficult subject.  What's a purer subject?\n\nChoices:\nA: faith\nB: astronomy\nC: discovery\nD: arts\nE: math",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"purer\" means in this context. It could refer to a subject that is more theoretical or less influenced by subjective interpretation.",
    "Next, I'll consider the options given: faith, astronomy, discovery, arts, and math.",
    "Faith generally encompasses belief systems and personal interpretations, making it subjective and less \"pure\" in a scientific sense.",
    "Astronomy is based on scientific observation and mathematics, which involves empirical data and theories. Although it's scientific, it may not be considered \"purer\" than math.",
    "The term \"discovery\" refers more to the process of finding out new information or insights rather than a specific subject. It's more about methodology than a topic of study.",
    "The arts involve creativity and subjective expression. This makes the arts less \"pure\" compared to subjects based on objective analysis.",
    "Math is often considered one of the most abstract and pure subjects because it relies on logical deduction and has a universal language. It stands apart from subjective interpretations compared to other options.",
    "I will now evaluate if any of the other options could potentially be regarded as purer. Faith and arts have subjective elements, while astronomy, although scientific, incorporates real-world phenomena that can be interpreted. Discovery is a process, not a subject.",
    "Math, due to its foundational logical structure, is widely recognized as the purest form of study in comparison to the subjective nature of the other options."
