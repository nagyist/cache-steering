  "query": "Question: When people get older what happens to their hair?\n\nChoices:\nA: long or short\nB: curled\nC: very thin\nD: coloured\nE: lightweight",
  "steps": [
    "To begin with, I need to consider what generally occurs to hair as people age.",
    "It's known that with aging, various changes can happen to hair, including thickness and color changes.",
    "One common observation is that many older adults experience hair thinning or loss.",
    "This thinning can lead to hair appearing sparse compared to when they were younger.",
    "Another observation is that hair often changes color, usually graying, but this is not the same as becoming \"thin.\"",
    "The option \"long or short\" (A) does not necessarily relate to aging, as hair length can vary for other reasons.",
    "The option \"curled\" (B) is also not typical as a direct result of aging.",
    "The option \"colored\" (D) can also apply to aging, but it references dyeing rather than natural changes due to age.",
    "The option \"lightweight\" (E) is ambiguous and does not specifically refer to hair density or volume changes.",
    "Thus, based on the evidence and common knowledge, hair becoming \"very thin\" (C) seems to be the most accurate choice that encompasses a typical change in older adults."
