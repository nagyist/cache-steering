  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that a group decided to sit down on stools, which commonly suggests they are settling in for a period of rest or socializing.",
    "The phrase \"each order a\" implies that they are likely ordering something that can be consumed or enjoyed while seated.",
    "Option A: \"mindset\" does not fit as it is not something one can order.",
    "Option B: \"fart\" is not a suitable option either, as it does not represent an item that can be ordered.",
    "Option C: \"relax\" is more of an action than an item to order, so it does not fit well either.",
    "Option D: \"find seat\" does not make sense in the context of ordering something.",
    "Option E: \"drink\" is the only option that makes sense as it is common for people sitting down at a social gathering to order drinks."
