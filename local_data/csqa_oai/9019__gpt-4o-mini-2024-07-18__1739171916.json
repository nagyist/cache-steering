  "query": "Question: Where would you find a dentist office along side other such providers?\n\nChoices:\nA: medical center\nB: metropolitan city\nC: patient\nD: main street\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a dentist's office is and where it is typically located.",
    "Dentist offices are usually found in areas where healthcare facilities and providers are located together.",
    "I will analyze the given options to see which one is most appropriate for housing a dentist office alongside other providers.",
    "Option A: A medical center usually houses multiple healthcare providers, including dentists, so this could be a plausible location.",
    "Option B: A metropolitan city may have many healthcare providers, but it is not specific; thus, it isn't the best answer.",
    "Option C: \"Patient\" is a person receiving care and is not a location; hence it cannot be the answer.",
    "Option D: A main street could have various offices, including a dentist, but it might not always be a central hub for healthcare providers.",
    "Option E: A bathroom is not relevant for the context of healthcare providers, so it is not a viable answer.",
    "Given my analysis, the best option that aligns with the presence of a dentist office among other healthcare providers is a medical center."
