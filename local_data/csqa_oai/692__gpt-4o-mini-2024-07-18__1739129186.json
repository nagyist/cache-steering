  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location where one might find a stray small dog.",
    "A stray dog typically means a dog that is wandering without an owner, which might not be found in a controlled or domesticated environment like a living room.",
    "A living room is a personal space in someone's home and would not be a likely place to find a stray dog.",
    "An animal shelter is specifically designed for abandoned or stray animals, including dogs. It would be a logical place to find a stray small dog in need of a home.",
    "Georgia refers to a state, and while it could have stray dogs, it is too broad of a location and does not specifically indicate an action or a place.",
    "A pet shop usually sells domesticated animals and would not be a place where one would find stray dogs, as they are meant to sell animals that have owners or are meant for adoption in a controlled environment.",
    "A dog show is an event where dogs are displayed and judged based on their breed standards, and would not be a place to find stray dogs.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the best and most logical location to find a stray small dog is in an animal shelter."
