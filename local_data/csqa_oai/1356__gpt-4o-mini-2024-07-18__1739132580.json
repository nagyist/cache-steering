  "query": "Question: Before the game some players knelt to pray, they did this because they what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being watched\nB: you're scared\nC: were religious\nD: god hears\nE: talk to god",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of players kneeling to pray before a game. The act of kneeling to pray is often associated with a personal or collective expression of faith or spirituality.",
    "Evaluate the possible motivations behind this action, focusing on the nature of prayer. People typically pray to communicate with a deity, seek guidance, and express devotion or gratitude.",
    "Analyze each choice in relation to this understanding of prayer. The choices suggest various reasons: being watched may indicate a desire to show a public image rather than a genuine act; being scared implies fear rather than a specific intention related to faith.",
    "Option C (were religious) implies a belief system that naturally encourages prayer, which is a significant reason to kneel and pray before an event such as a game.",
    "Consider option D (god hears) and option E (talk to god). While both suggest a desire to communicate with a higher power, they do not encapsulate the broader reason of possessing a religious inclination.",
    "Among the options, C provides a foundational explanation for the action of praying before the game; it suggests a deep-rooted belief system that prompts such behavior.",
    "Finally, compare the strength of C against other choices. The other options focus more on specific feelings or outcomes rather than the underlying reason for the act of prayer itself."
