  "query": "Question: If I want to do a math problem in a proper way, what should I check for?\n\nChoices:\nA: books\nB: incomplete\nC: incorrect\nD: impolite\nE: inappropriate",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify what it means to do a math problem in a \"proper way.\" This typically involves ensuring that the problem is approached correctly and the solution is accurate.",
    "I consider the key aspects that ensure a math problem is done properly, such as checking the mathematical logic, calculations, and methodology used.",
    "I think about what might go wrong in the process of solving a math problem. Common issues include mistakes in calculations or logic.",
    "I analyze the provided choices. \"Books\" seems to pertain more to resources and not a check for correctness in the context of solving the problem.",
    "The term \"incomplete\" might imply that a math solution is missing steps or details, however, it doesn't specifically address correctness.",
    "\"Incorrect\" directly refers to errors in the solution or approach, indicating that there might be mistakes that need to be verified.",
    "Next, I evaluate the terms \"impolite\" and \"inappropriate.\" These do not relate to math at all and focus instead on behavior and context rather than accuracy.",
    "Given the focus on accuracy and correctness in math, the key term that stands out as essential to solving a math problem effectively is \"incorrect.\"",
    "I reconfirm that checking for correctness is pivotal when solving math problems, as identifying incorrect solutions is crucial in achieving the right answer."
