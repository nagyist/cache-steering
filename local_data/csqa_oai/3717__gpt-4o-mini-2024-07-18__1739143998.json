  "query": "Question: The farmer wanted to grow cotton near Florida, where should he plant his cotton?\n\nChoices:\nA: orlando\nB: fabric\nC: north carolina\nD: georgia\nE: medicine cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the agricultural suitability of regions near Florida for growing cotton. Cotton generally requires a warm climate with plenty of sunlight and well-drained soil.",
    "Florida itself has a suitable climate for cotton production. However, the question asks where the farmer should plant his cotton specifically.",
    "I will evaluate the provided options to determine which one is geographically close to Florida and is known for cotton farming.",
    "Option A is Orlando, which is in Florida and has a suitable climate. It could be a viable option.",
    "Option B is \"fabric,\" which is irrelevant since it is not a physical location for planting cotton.",
    "Option C is North Carolina, which, while it does grow cotton, is not immediately next to Florida. Its climate may not be as ideal as Florida for cotton farming.",
    "Option D is Georgia, which is directly adjacent to Florida and is known for being a major cotton-producing state.",
    "Option E is \"medicine cabinet,\" which, like option B, is irrelevant and not a location at all.",
    "Now, assessing the two most relevant options: Orlando (A) and Georgia (D), I note that although both are suitable, Georgia has a stronger reputation for large-scale cotton farming.",
    "Therefore, the best choice among the options given, focusing on cotton production while being near Florida, is Georgia."
