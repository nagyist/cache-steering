  "query": "Question: What is likely heard by those going to a party?\n\nChoices:\nA: smoking pot\nB: happiness\nC: laughter\nD: babies\nE: meet new people",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of a party, which is generally a social gathering where people come together to have fun and enjoy each other's company.",
    "Think about the various sounds or expressions one might commonly associate with a lively gathering such as a party.",
    "Laughter is a common sound heard at parties as it typically signifies enjoyment, humor, and social interaction among guests.",
    "While \"happiness\" (choice B) can be an overall feeling, it isn't necessarily a sound, unlike laughter which is a distinct auditory presence.",
    "\"Smoking pot\" (choice A) is less about socializing and more about a specific activity, and not something universally associated with the sounds heard at a party.",
    "\"Babies\" (choice D) are not typically present at adult parties, which makes this choice less relevant to the sounds one would hear.",
    "\"Meet new people\" (choice E) indicates an activity but doesn\u2019t directly correlate to a sound that would be universally heard at a party.",
    "After considering the choices, laughter aligns best with the sounds likely heard at a party, as it embodies the essence of social enjoyment."
