  "steps": [
    "Consider the phrase \"hundreds of sporting goods store.\" This suggests a location that can accommodate many retail establishments.",
    "The term \"city\" typically refers to a large human settlement with various businesses, including sporting goods stores.",
    "The term \"town\" also refers to a populated area but generally indicates a smaller community compared to a city. It might not have hundreds of stores.",
    "\"ESPN\" is a media company focused on sports broadcasting and does not fit the description of a physical place with stores.",
    "\"Buy athletic equipment\" refers to the action of purchasing rather than a location, eliminating it as a valid answer.",
    "\"Jerseys\" refers to a type of sports apparel and again does not represent a location.",
    "Between the two places mentioned (city and town), a city is more likely to have hundreds of sporting good stores due to its larger population and economic activity.",
    "Therefore, we conclude that \"city\" is the most suitable place for having hundreds of sporting goods stores."
