  "query": "Question: What is a speed bump likely to cause a vehicle to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: travel\nB: slow down\nC: feel impact of accident\nD: carry\nE: fly",
  "steps": [
    "A speed bump is designed to alter the speed of vehicles traveling over it.",
    "The presence of a speed bump typically requires the driver to decelerate in order to safely navigate over it.",
    "If a vehicle approaches a speed bump at high speed, it can cause the vehicle to experience a jolt or a rough ride.",
    "However, the primary purpose of a speed bump is to encourage vehicles to reduce their speed.",
    "Analyzing the multiple choices, we need to identify which one aligns best with the function of a speed bump.",
    "Choice A, \"travel,\" does not specifically reflect the action caused by the presence of a speed bump.",
    "Choice C, \"feel impact of accident,\" is unrelated to the design purpose of a speed bump.",
    "Choice D, \"carry,\" does not correlate with the behavior prompted by a speed bump.",
    "Choice E, \"fly,\" implies an unrealistic response to a speed bump for most vehicles.",
    "Choice B, \"slow down,\" directly corresponds with the intended response of drivers encountering a speed bump."
