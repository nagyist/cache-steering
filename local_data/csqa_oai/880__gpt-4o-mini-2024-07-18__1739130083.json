  "query": "Question: The wind tore off the shingles, what was the wind like?\n\nChoices:\nA: dry hair\nB: spreading\nC: blowing hard\nD: change direction\nE: wave wheat",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the wind tore off the shingles\" indicates that the wind had enough force to remove roofing materials. This suggests the wind was quite strong.",
    "Considering the choices, \"dry hair\" (A) does not relate to wind strength; it implies a different context, possibly related to dryness.",
    "The term \"spreading\" (B) does not fit the context of wind strength or action related to tearing off shingles.",
    "\"Blowing hard\" (C) directly describes a strong wind, which aligns well with the scenario of shingles being torn off.",
    "The choice \"change direction\" (D) could describe wind behavior but does not specifically indicate strength; it also does not help explain the action of tearing off shingles.",
    "\"Waving wheat\" (E) refers to how crops might react to wind but does not imply the force of the wind; it\u2019s more visual than descriptive of intensity.",
    "After evaluating all choices, option (C) \"blowing hard\" clearly denotes the wind's strength required to tear off shingles, making it the most suitable answer."
