  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a container can that is used for draining oil, which suggests a location appropriate for handling oil, typically associated with cars or machinery.",
    "The options provided include different areas within a house, which should be evaluated based on their typical use and function.",
    "Option A (liquid) does not refer to a location; rather, it describes a state or substance, so it can be ruled out.",
    "Option B (store) is vague and does not specify a location within the house; it could refer to numerous contexts but is not typically used for oil storage.",
    "Option D (pantry) is generally reserved for food storage, and it is inappropriate for storing oil or handling oil-related activities.",
    "Option E (gutter) is an external feature of a house, usually associated with drainage but not for storing or draining oil.",
    "Option C (garage), on the other hand, is commonly used for parking vehicles and storing tools and automotive supplies, making it a logical choice for keeping a container can used for draining oil.",
    "Considering all the options, the only suitable location that aligns with the purpose of draining oil is the garage."
