  "steps": [
    "To determine what a person chatting with friends is hoping to accomplish, I first consider the nature of chatting itself. Chatting typically involves exchanging messages or having conversations with others.",
    "I will evaluate each choice to see how well it aligns with the purpose of chatting. The first choice is \"gathering of information.\" While this might happen occasionally during conversations, it is usually not the main goal of casual chatting with friends.",
    "Next is \"communication.\" This is a broad term that covers any interaction where information is exchanged. However, the intent of chatting goes beyond just the act of communication.",
    "The option \"feel relaxed\" is relevant. Many people chat with friends to unwind and relieve stress, suggesting that relaxation could be a goal.",
    "The choice \"kill boredom\" also seems plausible. Chatting can be a way to engage oneself and pass the time when there is nothing else to do.",
    "Now considering \"social bonding,\" this option highlights the importance of relationships and connections between friends. Social bonding often happens through interactions like chatting, which can strengthen those relationships.",
    "Comparing the options, both \"feel relaxed\" and \"social bonding\" stand out because they align more with the emotional and interpersonal aspects of chatting.",
    "Analyzing further, while feeling relaxed might be a personal benefit, social bonding more directly reflects the intention behind most casual chats with friends, which often focus on strengthening relationships and maintaining connections.",
    "Therefore, the option that most encapsulates the common goal someone has while chatting with friends is social bonding."
