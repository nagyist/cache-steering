  "query": "Question: Sometimes when people think some wrongdoing has ocurred in government, how do they react?\n\nChoices:\nA: talk to each other\nB: cook food\nC: demand justice\nD: learn from each other\nE: share food",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of the question, which deals with reactions to perceived wrongdoing in government.",
    "Next, analyze the provided choices for how people may react under such circumstances.",
    "Choice A: \"talk to each other\" suggests communication but lacks a strong response to the wrongdoing.",
    "Choice B: \"cook food\" appears unrelated to the context of government and wrongdoing.",
    "Choice C: \"demand justice\" indicates a strong and active response to perceived wrongdoing, aligning well with typical reactions to corruption or misconduct.",
    "Choice D: \"learn from each other\" implies a passive educational approach, which may not be strong enough in response to wrongdoing.",
    "Choice E: \"share food\" is again unrelated or passive and does not reflect a response to governmental wrongdoing.",
    "From the analysis, choice C stands out as the most appropriate reaction to perceived wrongdoing in government."
