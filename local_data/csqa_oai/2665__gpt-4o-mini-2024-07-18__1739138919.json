  "query": "Question: Where is a white mouse likely to be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: research laboratory\nB: field\nC: old barn\nD: computer lab\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical environments where white mice are commonly found. White mice are often used in laboratory research.",
    "Next, evaluate the option of a research laboratory. Research laboratories have conditions suited for breeding and studying lab mice, including white mice.",
    "Now, look at the second option, the field. While it is possible for mice to be present in fields, they would usually not be specifically white mice, which are more associated with laboratories and domestication.",
    "Assess the next option, an old barn. Barns may contain various animals, including wild mice, but they are less likely to have white mice specifically bred for research purposes.",
    "Consider the option of a computer lab. This is typically not an environment where one would find mice, particularly since it is not conducive for them to thrive.",
    "Lastly, evaluate the option of a cupboard. Mice, including white mice, may find shelter in cupboards, but it is unlikely to be where they are predominantly found or where they thrive.",
    "Given the analysis of each option, the most logical and probable place for a white mouse to be found is in a research laboratory where they are commonly kept for studies and breeding."
