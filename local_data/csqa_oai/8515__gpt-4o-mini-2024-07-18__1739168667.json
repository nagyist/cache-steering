  "query": "Question: What separates a bay from the water?\n\nChoices:\nA: shoreline\nB: coast\nC: coastal area\nD: lake\nE: manhattan",
  "steps": [
    "A bay is a body of water partially enclosed by land but having a wide opening to the sea or ocean.",
    "The area that separates a bay from the ocean or another body of water is typically land that acts as a boundary.",
    "'Shoreline' refers to the boundary between land and water, which is typically the edge of the bay.",
    "The term 'coast' generally describes land along a sea or ocean but does not specifically represent the separation of a bay.",
    "'Coastal area' is a broader term that includes regions along the coast but is not specific to the boundary of a bay.",
    "A 'lake' is a distinct body of water and is not related to defining what separates a bay from water.",
    "'Manhattan' is a specific geographical area and does not pertain to the general concept of bays or bodies of water.",
    "Among all the choices, the most accurate term that describes the boundary separating a bay from the surrounding water is 'shoreline'."
