  "query": "Question: James punched a man again and again. His nose bled, and some blood covered Jame's what?\n\nChoices:\nA: hands\nB: fingers\nC: fists\nD: anger\nE: hitting",
  "steps": [
    "To start with, we need to identify what typically happens when someone punches another person and blood is involved.",
    "When someone punches a person, especially repeatedly, it's likely that some of that person's blood will splatter onto the attacker.",
    "Blood can realistically end up on various parts of the attacker's body, such as their hands, fingers, or fists, depending on how the punches were thrown.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"hands\" (A), \"fingers\" (B), and \"fists\" (C) are all parts that could come into contact with blood when punching someone.",
    "\"Anger\" (D) and \"hitting\" (E) are not physical parts of the body that blood could cover, making those choices irrelevant to the question.",
    "Among the choices of hands, fingers, and fists, we consider which of these would most likely be covered by blood when punching.",
    "When a punch is thrown, it is primarily the fists that make contact with the person being punched.",
    "While it\u2019s true that blood could get on hands or fingers too, if we consider the act of punching, it makes most sense for blood to cover the fists as they are the direct point of impact.",
    "Therefore, out of the options provided, the most logical answer given the context of punching someone and resulting blood would be fists."
