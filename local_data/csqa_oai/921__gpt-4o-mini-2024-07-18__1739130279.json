  "steps": [
    "The question states that she was bad at dancing which implies she lacked fundamental skills necessary for dancing.",
    "Dancing typically involves certain basic skills that can be taught to improve one's ability.",
    "Among the choices, \"rhythmic movement\" is closely related to the fundamental aspects of dancing, as it involves moving in sync with music.",
    "\"Music\" itself is not a skill, but rather the medium through which dancing occurs.",
    "\"Moving body\" is too vague to be considered a specific skill integral to dancing.",
    "\"Having fun\" is an emotional state rather than a skill or technique that can be taught in dancing.",
    "Therefore, the most logical choice that represents a basic skill that the instructor would teach is \"rhythmic movement.\""
