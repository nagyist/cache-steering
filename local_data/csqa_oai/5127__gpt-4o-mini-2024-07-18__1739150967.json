  "query": "Question: People used to write with a quill dipped in ink that was made from what part of a bird?\n\nChoices:\nA: feather\nB: peacock\nC: porcupine\nD: hedgehog\nE: calligraphy",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the part of a bird that was used to make quills for writing.",
    "Quills are specifically made from the feathers of birds.",
    "Among the answer options, the only one that directly relates to a bird is \"feather.\"",
    "Since peacocks are birds, the term \"peacock\" refers to a specific type of bird but does not answer the question about what part is used for quills.",
    "Porcupines and hedgehogs are not birds; they are mammals.",
    "The term \"calligraphy\" refers to a style of writing rather than a part of a bird.",
    "Evaluating the choices: A (feather) is related to the writing instrument, while B (peacock), C (porcupine), D (hedgehog), and E (calligraphy) are not relevant as parts of a bird for quill-making.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer that directly answers the question, \"What part of a bird was used for quills?\" is clearly \"feather.\""
