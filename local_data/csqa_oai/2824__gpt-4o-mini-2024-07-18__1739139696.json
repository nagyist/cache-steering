    "Option B (at hotel): Many hotels, especially in certain types of luxury suites or themed rooms, may have mirrors on the ceiling as part of the decor.",
    "Option C (bedroom): Some bedrooms might have mirrors on the ceiling, especially in more extravagant or romantic setups, but this is less common.",
    "Option D (dressing room): Dressing rooms often have mirrors for trying on clothes, but these mirrors are generally on walls or free-standing rather than on the ceiling.",
