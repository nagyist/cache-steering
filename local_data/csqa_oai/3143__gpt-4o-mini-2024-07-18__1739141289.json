  "query": "Question: In any city you usually see a high rise where?\n\nChoices:\nA: residential area\nB: san francisco\nC: downtown\nD: suburbs\nE: detroit",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general characteristics of high-rise buildings. High-rises are typically found in urban areas where space is limited and there's a demand for vertical living or working spaces.",
    "Next, analyze the possible choices. A high-rise is less likely to be located in a residential area that is primarily made up of single-family homes due to space and zoning constraints.",
    "Now evaluate the option \"downtown.\" Downtown areas in cities are usually the commercial and business hubs, where high-rises are common due to high demand for office space and apartments.",
    "Review the other choices: \"san francisco\" and \"detroit\" are specific cities but do not inherently indicate that high-rises are generally located there compared to downtown areas which are common to most cities.",
    "Consider \"suburbs.\" Suburban locations tend to have more low-rise buildings and detached homes, making high-rises less common compared to urban centers.",
    "Having eliminated residential areas, suburbs, and focusing more closely on specific downtown areas, it becomes clear that high-rises are almost universally found in downtown locations, regardless of the specific city.",
    "Reflect on what was analyzed: Since neighborhoods can vary from city to city but downtown areas consistently house high-rises, it solidifies the reasoning that the correct answer would pertain to the concept of downtown locations in general."
