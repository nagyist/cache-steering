  "query": "Question: The weather was nice, but Sean didn't count on that. He knew it could do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: look beautiful\nB: storm for days\nC: change quickly\nD: start raining\nE: surprise us",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the statement indicates that Sean had a sense of uncertainty regarding the weather, despite it being nice at the moment.",
    "The phrase \"didn't count on that\" suggests that Sean was not fully trusting or expecting the weather to remain nice indefinitely.",
    "In weather forecasts, a common expectation is that nice weather can quickly shift to something less favorable.",
    "Out of the choices provided, \"change quickly\" reflects this understanding often associated with weather patterns.",
    "The other options like \"look beautiful\", \"storm for days\", \"start raining\", and \"surprise us\" do not fully capture the uncertainty and the rapid nature of weather changes.",
    "While \"start raining\" is plausible, it implies a specific event rather than the broader concept of variability in weather.",
    "\"Surprise us\" is vague and doesn't specifically reference the nature or behavior of weather.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice that aligns with Sean\u2019s caution about the weather is that it can indeed \"change quickly\"."
