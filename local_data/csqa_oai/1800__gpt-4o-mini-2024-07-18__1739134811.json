  "query": "Question: The car was overheating, where was it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: neighbor's house\nC: in phoenix\nD: repair shop\nE: street corner",
  "steps": [
    "The car was overheating, which typically indicates a mechanical issue. This leads to the need for a location where such a problem could occur or be addressed.",
    "An airport would not be a common location for a car to overheat, as it is primarily focused on aircraft activities, making option A less likely.",
    "A neighbor's house could imply that the car was parked or potentially being worked on, but it is not a typical scenario for a car overheating on its own, thus making option B less plausible.",
    "Phoenix is known for its hot weather, which can contribute to cars overheating. Therefore, the geographical aspect makes option C a reasonable location.",
    "A repair shop is a logical place for an overheating car because that is where mechanical issues are typically addressed; however, the question specifically asks about where the car was located when it was overheating, not where it was taken. Thus, option D is not the immediate location.",
    "A street corner is feasible, as cars can overheat while idling or if there is traffic, leading to situations of overheating. This makes option E a potential location as well.",
    "Comparing options C and E, both show plausible scenarios where a car could be overheating. However, given that Phoenix's climate could directly contribute to the issue, option C appears more relevant to the context of the question.",
    "I should consider the likelihood of each option once more: while overheating can happen anywhere, the extreme heat in Phoenix is a significant factor that could lead to more frequent occurrences of overheating.",
    "Thus, after weighing the geographical influence and the context given, I conclude that the most fitting answer is where the overheating was likely caused and most relevant to the question's setting."
