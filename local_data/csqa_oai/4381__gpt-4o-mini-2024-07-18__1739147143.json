  "steps": [
    "The question asks how John's feet touched the ground while running very fast.",
    "\"Very fast\" implies that his running was energetic and quick, rather than slow or delayed.",
    "The options given include descriptors that can detail physical movement.",
    "Option D (\"slowly\") contradicts the idea of running \"very fast,\" so it can be eliminated.",
    "Option A (\"behind\") does not provide a suitable description of how feet contact the ground during fast running.",
    "Option B (\"loose\") implies a lack of control, which is less likely when running very fast.",
    "Option C (\"feverishly\") suggests a frantic manner, but does not specifically describe the manner of foot contact.",
    "Option E (\"lightly\") suggests a gentle touch, which aligns well with fast running, often characterized by quick, efficient foot placement.",
    "Considering all the options, \"lightly\" best depicts how someone's feet would touch the ground when running very fast."
