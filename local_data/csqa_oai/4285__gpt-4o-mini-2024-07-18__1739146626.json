  "steps": [
    "The question asks for reasons why someone would light a fire. The context of the situation matters, and various motivations can be considered.",
    "Option A suggests lighting a fire to burn down a house, which is generally seen as a destructive act rather than a common reason for lighting a fire.",
    "Option B mentions helping people. While it's possible to light a fire for safety or cooking, the phrasing is vague and not direct.",
    "Option C states warming hands. This is a valid reason as people often light small fires for personal comfort in cold weather.",
    "Option D indicates warming a room. This is another practical use of fire, as many people use fireplaces or stoves for this purpose.",
    "Option E refers to cleansing, which can relate to cultural practices or controlled burns, but it's less common as a general reason for lighting a fire compared to warming.",
    "I need to weigh the practicality and commonness of the options. Warming hands (C) and warming a room (D) are similar in nature, focusing on comfort and utility.",
    "Among options C and D, warming hands might be a reason for a very focused smaller fire, while warming a room indicates a larger, more sustained fire.",
    "Nonetheless, both C and D are valid, but the question asks for a reason that is possibly more common or immediate. Personal comfort (C) tends to be a more direct intent.",
    "Considering the reasoning, D is broader and can cover various situations, including C. I need to choose one that is direct but also common."
