  "query": "Question: Where can you find the tallest skyscraper in the mid-western U.S.?\n\nChoices:\nA: high population\nB: manhattan\nC: new york city\nD: chicago\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the location of the tallest skyscraper in the mid-western U.S.",
    "The tallest skyscraper in the U.S. is known to be located in Chicago.",
    "Manhattan is not part of the mid-western U.S., so it cannot be the answer.",
    "New York City is also located on the East Coast and not in the mid-western U.S.",
    "While \"high population\" and \"large city\" are general characteristics, they do not specifically refer to a location.",
    "The tallest skyscraper in Chicago is the Willis Tower, which is specifically located in Chicago.",
    "Therefore, the only option that fits the criteria of being in the mid-western U.S. and housing the tallest skyscraper is Chicago."
