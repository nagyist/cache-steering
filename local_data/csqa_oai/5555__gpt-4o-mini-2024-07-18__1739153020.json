  "query": "Question: what does a human have on their upperbody?\n\nChoices:\nA: processing power\nB: one body\nC: two arms\nD: stupidity\nE: muscles",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the anatomical structure of a human's upper body. The upper body includes the chest, shoulders, arms, and neck.",
    "Next, analyze the choices one by one for relevance to the upper body.",
    "Choice A (processing power) refers to cognitive abilities, which are not physical attributes of the upper body.",
    "Choice B (one body) is true but does not specifically describe an aspect of the upper body; it refers to the entire human form.",
    "Choice C (two arms) describes a physical feature that is indeed part of the upper body structure.",
    "Choice D (stupidity) is a subjective trait and does not anatomically relate to the upper body.",
    "Choice E (muscles) is also relevant, as the upper body does contain muscles, but this is a broader term that does not specify a distinct feature.",
    "Among the relevant options, Choice C clearly identifies a distinct and specific physical feature of the upper body: the presence of two arms, which is a definitive trait for humans.",
    "The other choices either do not specifically describe part of the upper body or are not relevant to the physical description."
