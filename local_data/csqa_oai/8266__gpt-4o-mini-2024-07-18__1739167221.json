  "query": "Question: Sam wanted a permanent way to stop the Crimson King from destroying the universe, but the only solution he could find was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: changeable\nB: sometimes there\nC: transparent\nD: transient\nE: temporary",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of the question, which involves Sam looking for a permanent solution to a significant threat from the Crimson King.",
    "Since the question explicitly states that he wanted a \"permanent way,\" I should evaluate the provided options to see which one implies an inability to provide a permanent solution.",
    "Option A, \"changeable,\" suggests a lack of permanence, but does not directly imply a solution related to stopping destruction.",
    "Option B, \"sometimes there,\" also indicates inconsistency and does not align with a permanent solution.",
    "Option C, \"transparent,\" does not relate to permanence or effectiveness in stopping destruction.",
    "Option D, \"transient,\" means temporary or short-lived, which clearly corresponds to something that cannot provide a permanent solution.",
    "Option E, \"temporary,\" also indicates a lack of permanence.",
    "Both options D and E seem viable, but I need to determine which is a better fit for what Sam \"found.\" The key word here is \"temporary,\" as it describes a solution that is not meant to last.",
    "Since the question highlights Sam's struggle for a \"permanent way,\" the best-fitting answer is the one that serves as the opposite of that permanence.",
    "Thus, I conclude that Sam found a solution that is temporary."
