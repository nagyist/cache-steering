    "To practice writing, one effective method is to engage in formats that are simpler and more personal, which relates to considering people he knows.",
    "Among the choices provided, writing a letter or personal notes would be more directly connected to the concept of knowing people, as these forms of writing typically address someone specific.",
    "Writing novels, advertising, and poems may not effectively connect to the personal experiences and knowledge of the people around him in a similar way.",
