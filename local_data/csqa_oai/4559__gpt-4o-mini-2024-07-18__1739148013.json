  "query": "Question: She knew what presents she was getting, none of them were what she wanted and so she felt what?\n\nChoices:\nA: excited\nB: ownership\nC: satisfaction\nD: being happy\nE: disappointment",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a person who knows the presents she is receiving.",
    "It is mentioned that none of the presents are what she wanted.",
    "Knowing that she will not receive what she desires typically leads to a negative feeling.",
    "The term \"disappointment\" refers to the sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.",
    "Since she is aware that the gifts do not align with her desires, it is logical to infer that she feels let down.",
    "The other answer choices such as excited, ownership, satisfaction, and being happy do not fit well with the context of not getting what one wants.",
    "Disappointment is a direct emotional response to the contrast between expectations and reality in this scenario.",
    "Thus, in the context provided, disappointment is the most appropriate feeling she would experience."
