  "query": "Question: Where are the seats frequently covered in popcorn and soda?\n\nChoices:\nA: movies\nB: opera\nC: show\nD: auditorium\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a location where seats are frequently found covered in popcorn and soda.",
    "Popcorn and soda are commonly associated with events where people watch films or shows.",
    "The term \"movies\" specifically refers to films, where it is traditional for audiences to consume popcorn and soda.",
    "Although \"auditorium\" and \"show\" could relate to watching something, they are more generic and don't specifically imply popcorn and soda consumption.",
    "The \"opera\" generally does not involve popcorn; it is a formal performance event.",
    "A \"classroom\" also does not fit, as it is primarily an educational space and does not typically involve food like popcorn.",
    "Given the context of popcorn and soda, the best fit is \"movies.\"",
    "Thus, the answer must be \"movies,\" as it directly ties to the question about seats covered in these snacks."
