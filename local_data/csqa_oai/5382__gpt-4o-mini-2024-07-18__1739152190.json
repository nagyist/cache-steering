    "The options presented should relate to the idea of improvement in health or recovery from sickness.",
    "Option A (relaxation) describes a state of being calm but does not indicate any specific improvement in health.",
    "Option B repeats the same as option A and also does not denote recovery from illness.",
    "Option C (feeling better) directly correlates with the concept of an improved state following sickness and resting.",
