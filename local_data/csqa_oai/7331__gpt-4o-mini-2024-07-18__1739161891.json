  "query": "Question: Where would you get a chain if you do not have one?\n\nChoices:\nA: tow truck\nB: bicycle\nC: motorbike\nD: chain link fence\nE: jewelry store",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to consider what type of chain is being referred to. The term \"chain\" can refer to various types of chains, including those used for towing, bikes, jewelry, and fencing.",
    "Looking at the options, I need to determine where I can acquire a chain that is not already owned. A tow truck may carry chains for towing, but that doesn't imply one can get a chain there.",
    "A bicycle has a chain as an integral component, but if I do not have one, I cannot obtain a chain from it.",
    "A motorbike also has a chain, usually for the drive, but similarly, if I do not have one, I cannot expect to get a chain from it either.",
    "A chain link fence is constructed with chains linked together, but again, I cannot acquire a separate chain from a fence if I do not already possess it.",
    "However, a jewelry store specializes in chains made of precious metals such as gold or silver. If I am looking to acquire a new chain, a jewelry store is an appropriate place to visit.",
    "Considering all options, the only location where one can reliably obtain a chain without already possessing one is a jewelry store, which sells chains as products.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the best choice for getting a chain, when there is none, is indeed the jewelry store."
