  "query": "Question: What is likely to happen from eating too much regularly?\n\nChoices:\nA: getting full\nB: getting fat\nC: gas\nD: satisfaction\nE: gaining weight",
  "steps": [
    "Eating too much regularly leads to an increased calorie intake.",
    "When more calories are consumed than the body can burn, the excess calories are stored as fat.",
    "Regularly consuming excess calories can lead to long-term weight gain.",
    "Gaining weight is commonly referred to as \"getting fat,\" although the two terms are not always interchangeable in medical or technical contexts.",
    "Feeling full may occur immediately after eating, but it's not a long-term effect of over-consuming food regularly.",
    "Gas can be a result of eating certain foods or overeating, but it is not the main or likely outcome of consistently eating too much.",
    "Satisfaction may be felt temporarily after a large meal, but it doesn't reflect the long-term consequences of regular overeating.",
    "The effects of regular overeating are more significant than just feeling full or experiencing gas; they relate to body weight changes over time.",
    "Thus, the most accurate reflections of the consequences of eating too much regularly are gaining weight and getting fat.",
    "Since both \"getting fat\" (B) and \"gaining weight\" (E) are closely related, we need to choose the best representative answer."
