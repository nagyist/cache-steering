  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location of John's parking space in relation to the building. Therefore, I need to identify the options that represent spatial relationships or locations.",
    "The choices provided are A: jar, B: front, C: universe, D: box, and E: answer.",
    "Out of these options, \"front\" (B) stands out as a word indicating a relative position, specifically in relation to another object (the building).",
    "The other options (A, C, D, and E) do not denote a location that would make sense in relation to a building. For example, \"jar\" and \"box\" are containers and do not imply any spatial relationship, \"universe\" refers to an immense space beyond individual locations, and \"answer\" does not indicate a location at all.",
    "Considering the context, when someone refers to a parking space and its positive qualities (great position), it usually suggests it is located conveniently close to the building, typically at the front.",
    "Therefore, the most logical and relevant answer regarding the position of John's parking space in relation to the building is \"front\"."
