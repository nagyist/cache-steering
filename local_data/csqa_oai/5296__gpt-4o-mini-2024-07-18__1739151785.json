  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question which involves a lead character who is described as \"cocky\" and likely has a humorous or witty personality.",
    "Consider the phrase \"ever rule having its\" as it suggests a common or popular saying, typically implying something about rules and their limitations or exceptions.",
    "Recall the familiar expression \"every rule has its exception.\" This phrase aligns well with the given context of a character who might make a quip or witty remark regarding rules.",
    "Examine the answer choices given: A (capsulize idea), B (train), C (suck), D (exception), E (anarchy). Focus on the choice that fits best with the expression identified in the previous steps.",
    "Determine which of the answer choices can logically complete the phrase \"every rule has its ____\". The choice \"exception\" fits perfectly.",
    "Verify that \"exception\" relates to the humor and cocky nature of the character, as it suggests a clever observation about the nature of rules.",
    "Eliminate other options: A does not relate, B is irrelevant, C introduces negativity which doesn't match the likely intention, and E suggests chaos rather than a rational comment.",
    "Reaffirm that the best fit both contextually and logically is \"exception,\" as it succinctly captures the essence of the saying and the character's quip."
