  "query": "Question: After the bald eagle was caught, where did it spend the rest of its life?\n\nChoices:\nA: cliff\nB: captivity\nC: colorado\nD: texas\nE: utah",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the context of the question, which involves the fate of a bald eagle after being caught.",
    "Next, consider the most likely scenario for a wild animal like a bald eagle after being caught, which typically leads to captivity, rehabilitation, or release.",
    "Examine the options provided: cliff, captivity, Colorado, Texas, and Utah. A cliff may not be a suitable long-term destination for a captured eagle.",
    "Captivity is a strong option, as many captured eagles are taken to wildlife centers, sanctuaries, or zoos.",
    "The geographic options (Colorado, Texas, Utah) could be places where it could live if released, but they aren't as immediate as captivity.",
    "Review any known cases or stories about bald eagles being caught, focusing on whether they were released or placed in captivity.",
    "Consider the overall purpose of the question: it asks where the eagle spent the rest of its life after being caught, which implies a permanent situation.",
    "From the analysis, captivity stands out as the most plausible answer since the eagle likely couldn\u2019t return to the wild safely after being caught.",
    "Verify that captivity is an option that matches the context of the question, aligning with wildlife practices for rehabilitating injured or caught animals.",
    "Conclude that the rest of its life, after being caught, was most likely spent in captivity."
