  "query": "Question: The man spent big money and time maintaining his lawn, it was part of keeping up with the Joneses where?\n\nChoices:\nA: front yard\nB: suburbia\nC: neighborhood\nD: back yard\nE: golf course",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"keeping up with the Joneses\" typically refers to the social competition between neighbors to appear as affluent and successful as one another.",
    "This kind of competition is most commonly associated with residential areas where people live in close proximity to each other, like neighborhoods or suburbia.",
    "The man spent both money and time on his lawn, indicating that he is taking significant steps to enhance his home\u2019s exterior appearance to impress others.",
    "The context suggests that the competition plays a role in the exterior, visible aspect of his home rather than the more private areas like the back yard or specialized locations like a golf course.",
    "Considering the options, the \"front yard\" is accessible and visible to neighbors and thus serves as a prominent display of one\u2019s efforts in maintenance.",
    "However, while \"front yard\" could be a part of the answer, it is limited to just one area of the home. \"Neighborhood\" encompasses the broader context of social comparison among residents.",
    "\"Suburbia\" also implies a residential community characterized by houses with lawns, which aligns with the idea of maintaining a home to keep up appearances.",
    "When weighing \"neighborhood\" versus \"suburbia,\" I consider that \"suburbia\" has a broader connotation of community living and competition among residents compared to just a neighborhood.",
    "In conclusion, while both \"neighborhood\" and \"suburbia\" fit the concept, \u201csuburbia\u201d signifies a cultural context where maintaining one's lawn is particularly emphasized in keeping up with neighbors."
