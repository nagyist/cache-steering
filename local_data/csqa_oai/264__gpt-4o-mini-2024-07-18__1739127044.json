  "query": "Question: Blood isn't usually spilled during what sport that doesn't allow the use of hands?\n\nChoices:\nA: soccer game\nB: capillaries\nC: ball\nD: animals\nE: person",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the sport mentioned in the question. The question implies a sport that doesn't use hands and is typically played without blood being spilled.",
    "Consider popular sports that don't involve the use of hands. Commonly known sports in this category include soccer, which is played with feet.",
    "Now examine the answer choices provided. We have options A (soccer game), B (capillaries), C (ball), D (animals), and E (person).",
    "Evaluate each option: Option A (soccer game) is a sport that fits the description but typically can have instances of injury. Option B (capillaries) is not a sport; instead, it refers to the small blood vessels in the body. Option C (ball) is an object used in various sports, not a sport itself. Option D (animals) does not refer to a sport, and option E (person) is also unrelated to sports.",
    "Analyze the question's requirement of finding a sport where blood isn't usually spilled. While soccer can sometimes lead to blood-spilling incidents, it is less common than combat sports or those involving aggressive contact.",
    "No other sports mentioned in the options seem to meet the criteria of not normally spilling blood. This leads us back to option A as the closest likely answer.",
    "Conclude that while soccer (option A) can occasionally result in injuries, it is recognized as a sport predominantly played without the use of hands where blood is not usually spilled."
