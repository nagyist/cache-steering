  "steps": [
    "The question mentions large trucks flinging rocks, which suggests the context is related to the potential damage those rocks can cause.",
    "Rocks hitting other vehicles could lead to damage of various parts of those vehicles.",
    "The options presented are windows, seat belts, trunks, diesel engines, and exhaust pipes.",
    "Out of these options, the damage caused by rocks would most likely impact exterior parts of the vehicle.",
    "Seat belts are internal safety features, trunks are storage compartments, diesel engines are power sources, and exhaust pipes are part of the vehicle's emission system, which are less likely to be directly impacted by flying rocks.",
    "Thus, the most vulnerable parts to impacts from flying rocks would be the windows, as they are directly exposed to external elements.",
    "Considering the nature of the damage rocks can do when flung by trucks, focusing on windows aligns with common issues reported by drivers.",
    "The other parts listed do not have the same level of risk associated with them when considering the context of being struck by road debris."
