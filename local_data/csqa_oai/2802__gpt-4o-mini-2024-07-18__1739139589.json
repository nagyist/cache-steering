  "query": "Question: The planned sky scraper was still years away from completion, but excavation had begun where?\n\nChoices:\nA: cemetary\nB: mountain\nC: desert\nD: construction site\nE: archeological site",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that excavation had begun in preparation for a planned skyscraper, which implies an area needing to be cleared for construction.",
    "I think about locations where excavation is typically done for construction purposes; those locations usually do not include cemetaries, mountains, or deserts.",
    "A cemetery would generally not be a place for constructing a skyscraper due to ethical and legal reasons.",
    "A mountain site likely would require extensive engineering and is generally more complex to excavate for skyscraper construction than on flat land.",
    "A desert could be a viable location, as such areas often have less existing infrastructure, but it's less common to find skyscrapers built there compared to more urban areas.",
    "A construction site typically implies that some form of building or infrastructure is already being worked on, making it the most logical option for beginning excavation for a skyscraper.",
    "An archeological site usually involves careful excavation efforts that are aimed at preserving history, making it an unlikely candidate for a skyscraper development.",
    "Therefore, of all the listed options, a construction site would be the most appropriate location for the start of excavation work related to a skyscraper."
