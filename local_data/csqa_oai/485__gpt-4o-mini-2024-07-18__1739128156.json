  "steps": [
    "The man spends a significant amount of time (3 hours) every morning on grooming.",
    "This indicates that grooming is a priority for him, suggesting he values his appearance.",
    "Considering the time spent on grooming, he may have less time available for commuting or starting his work tasks on time.",
    "The potential lack of time for travel to his job might lead to arriving late.",
    "While he may look good as a result of his grooming, the question specifically asks about the \"likely result with his job.\"",
    "Looking good (option B) and neatness (option E) are positive outcomes, but they do not directly address the impact on his job performance or attendance.",
    "Additionally, option C (injury) and option D (vacation) are not typically related to grooming time and have no direct correlation to the scenario.",
    "Focusing on the primary impact of spending so much time grooming, tardiness (option A) becomes a strong candidate for the likely job-related consequence.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice that addresses the likely negative outcome in relation to his job due to the time spent on grooming is tardiness."
