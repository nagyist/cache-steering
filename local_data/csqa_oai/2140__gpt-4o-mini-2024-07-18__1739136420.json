  "query": "Question: Where is liquor usually stored in a home?\n\nChoices:\nA: fraternity house\nB: cabinet\nC: bar\nD: soft drink\nE: night stand",
  "steps": [
    "Identify common areas in a home where liquor might be stored.",
    "Consider the context of a household setting and typical furniture or storage options available.",
    "Evaluate each option: a fraternity house is not a typical storage location for an individual's home; it is more of a drinking venue.",
    "Consider \"cabinet\": many households have a liquor cabinet where alcoholic beverages are stored.",
    "Evaluate \"bar\": some homes may have a bar area where liquor is displayed and served, but it is not as common as a simple cabinet.",
    "Consider \"soft drink\": this option is unrelated to liquor storage.",
    "Evaluate \"night stand\": while night stands may store various personal items, they are not commonly associated with storing liquor.",
    "After considering all options, \"cabinet\" stands out as the most common and appropriate answer for liquor storage in a home setting."
