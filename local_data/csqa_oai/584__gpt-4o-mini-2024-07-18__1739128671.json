  "query": "Question: Where can you buy a fishing rod?\n\nChoices:\nA: furniture store\nB: fishing camp\nC: hardware store\nD: sporting goods store\nE: engine",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what types of stores typically sell fishing rods.",
    "Fishing rods are generally considered sporting equipment, thus places that sell sports gear are likely candidates.",
    "A sporting goods store specializes in outdoor and sporting equipment, including fishing rods.",
    "A hardware store can sometimes carry basic outdoor equipment, but it is not primarily focused on sporting goods.",
    "A furniture store is unlikely to carry fishing gear since it specializes in household furnishings.",
    "A fishing camp may provide gear for rent during a fishing trip but is not meant for permanent purchase.",
    "An engine shop would focus on engines and related parts, making it an unlikely place to find fishing rods as well.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best choice for purchasing a fishing rod among the options is the sporting goods store."
