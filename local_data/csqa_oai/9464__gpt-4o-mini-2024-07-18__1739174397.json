  "query": "Question: Where will a book being read by one person be kept?\n\nChoices:\nA: school room\nB: university\nC: bedside table\nD: pantry\nE: discount store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical locations where a book is usually kept while being read by an individual.",
    "Next, evaluate the environments that are conducive to reading a book. A school room and a university are places of learning but not specifically for ongoing personal reading.",
    "The options of 'pantry' and 'discount store' do not match well with the concept of personal reading, as they are not typical places for reading.",
    "Now, focus on the option 'bedside table.' This is a common place for individuals to keep books they are currently reading or want to read before bed.",
    "Consider the practicality of keeping a book on a bedside table, where it is readily accessible for nighttime reading.",
    "Evaluate the evidence against other options: A school room and university imply shared spaces with multiple learners, while a pantry and discount store do not support the act of reading.",
    "Confirm that 'bedside table' is where individuals often keep books, allowing for a comfortable and personal reading experience."
