    "The question asks for a type of antibiotic prescription that has a gel coating.",
    "Antibiotics can come in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and topical applications.",
    "A gel coating is often associated with capsules to aid in swallowing and to control the release of the medication.",
    "Option A refers to the effect of the antibiotic, not its form.",
    "Option B is a location where medicines may be kept, not a form of medication.",
    "Option D is a verb describing the action of prescribing, without reference to the type or form of medication.",
    "Option E refers to a place where medications are dispensed, rather than indicating a specific form of antibiotic.",
