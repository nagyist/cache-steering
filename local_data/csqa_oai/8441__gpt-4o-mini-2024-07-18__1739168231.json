  "query": "Question: If you were Greek and saw a shark here, where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: pool hall\nB: mediterranean sea\nC: seafood restaurant\nD: gulf of mexico\nE: south pacific",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to understand the context of the question. The phrase \"If you were Greek and saw a shark here\" implies a location where sharks are commonly found in relation to Greece.",
    "Next, consider which locations from the choice options are geographically relevant to Greece. The Mediterranean Sea is a prominent body of water that borders Greece and is known to contain sharks.",
    "Evaluate the other options. A pool hall is an indoor entertainment venue and highly unlikely to have sharks. A seafood restaurant may have shark dishes but doesn't represent the location where one might actually see a shark.",
    "Next, the Gulf of Mexico is not directly related to Greece, although it does have sharks, making it a less likely answer. The South Pacific is even further away from Greece, thus making it a less relevant option too.",
    "Since the Mediterranean Sea is the only option directly associated with Greece and is known for marine life, including various species of sharks, it is important to emphasize this location.",
    "Reassess the other choices one last time for any possible shark sightings in relation to being Greek. The seafood restaurant could be misleading, but it doesn't align with the context of \"seeing a shark\" in natural waters.",
    "Conclude that the initial inference about the Mediterranean Sea being the correct answer likely holds as it is the most geographic and logical connection with Greece regarding sharks."
