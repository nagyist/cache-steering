  "query": "Question: Where are seats most likely bleachers?\n\nChoices:\nA: movies\nB: opera\nC: theater\nD: lecture hall\nE: hockey game",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"bleachers\" are. Bleachers are typically rows of bench-like seating, often found in outdoor areas, commonly used for viewing sports and other events.",
    "Next, I will analyze the provided choices to see which are more likely to have bleacher-style seating.",
    "A: Movies - Movie theaters usually have individual seats rather than bleachers, so this choice is unlikely.",
    "B: Opera - Opera houses tend to have rows of traditional seating that are more comfortable and individual, rather than bleachers.",
    "C: Theater - While some theaters may have bleachers, many traditional theaters prioritize comfort with individual seats.",
    "D: Lecture hall - Lecture halls typically have rows of seats but are designed for comfort rather than the informal bench-style of bleachers.",
    "E: Hockey game - Hockey games are often played in arenas with sections of bleacher seating for spectators, where people can sit together in a row.",
    "Now, I will summarize my findings: Bleachers are most commonly associated with sporting events, and hockey games specifically feature these kinds of seating arrangements.",
    "Finally, based on the reasoning above, the correct answer to the question of where seats are most likely bleachers is at hockey games."
