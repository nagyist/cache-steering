  "steps": [
    "The question asks what is done to wood to attach something to it, indicating we need a method of fastening or connecting objects to wood.",
    "Out of the provided options, \"nailed\" clearly suggests a method of attaching two materials, where nails are used to fasten an object to a wooden surface.",
    "\"Carved\" refers to shaping or cutting the wood, which does not inherently relate to attaching something to it.",
    "\"Polished\" implies making the surface smooth and shiny, which again does not connect to the concept of attaching items.",
    "\"Eat cake\" does not relate at all to actions performed on wood, and can be disregarded.",
    "\"Petrify\" means to turn into stone, which is irrelevant in the context of attaching something to wood.",
    "Thus, the only option that fits the action of attaching something to wood is \"nailed.\""
