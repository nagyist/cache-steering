  "query": "Question: What does a farmer wanting to make a maze do?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm land\nB: grow chinese gooseberries\nC: grow corn\nD: raise cattle\nE: supply food",
  "steps": [
    "To create a maze, a farmer would typically need to use a crop that is tall enough or dense enough to form walls or barriers that make up the paths of the maze.",
    "Considering the available choices, \"farm land\" refers to the area of land itself, which is not an action that would specifically pertain to creating a maze.",
    "\"Grow Chinese gooseberries\" does not seem practical for making a maze, as they are low-growing and wouldn't create significant barriers or paths.",
    "\"Raise cattle\" does not involve growing crops or forming mazes, so it is irrelevant in this context.",
    "\"Supply food\" is also a general activity but does not specify any particular method or crop that would be used to create a maze.",
    "\"Grow corn\" is a viable choice because corn plants can grow quite tall and can create a natural structure suitable for a maze.",
    "The most logical option for a farmer intending to create a maze would be to grow corn, as it is often used in many corn mazes.",
    "Therefore, the activity of creating a maze is most directly related to the action of growing corn among the options given."
