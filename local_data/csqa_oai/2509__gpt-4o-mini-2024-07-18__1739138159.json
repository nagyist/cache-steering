  "query": "Question: Jane was a human who had to poop really bad.  But she couldn't because her ride was about to come in and she didn't want to miss it.  Where might she be?\n\nChoices:\nA: bed\nB: airport\nC: mall\nD: homes\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, we understand Jane is in a situation where she has a strong urge to use the restroom but is unable to do so because she is waiting for a ride.",
    "Next, we consider where she might typically wait for a ride. Common places include an airport, mall, or even outside one's home.",
    "Option A (bed) is unlikely because one would not typically wait for a ride at bed.",
    "Option D (homes) could be a possibility, but the scenario reflects urgency and a likely need to be somewhere public or out of the home waiting for a ride.",
    "Option E (bathroom) is not feasible as the question states she is unable to go and is waiting for her ride; she would not be in the bathroom.",
    "This leaves options B (airport) and C (mall) as the most probable locations for someone waiting for a ride and needing to use the restroom.",
    "Airports are often busy places with many people waiting for rides, thus they provide a more immediate urgent element which fits Jane\u2019s situation.",
    "Conversely, while malls are also public and could fit the scenario, they do not have the same connotation of urgency typically associated with catching a ride like an airport.",
    "Therefore, after processing the scenarios, an airport stands out as a highly appropriate location for Jane's situation."
