  "query": "Question: What type of moistener might someone who uses sanitizer frequently use?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: closet\nC: drug store\nD: hand lotion\nE: zamboni",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which involves someone who frequently uses sanitizer.",
    "Sanitizers are generally drying to the skin because they often contain alcohol, which evaporates and strips moisture away.",
    "This means that frequent use of sanitizer can lead to dry or irritated skin.",
    "Now, think about potential solutions to address dry skin arising from sanitizer use.",
    "Options could include lotions, creams, or other products designed to moisturize the skin.",
    "Look at the provided choices: A (bathroom), B (closet), C (drug store), D (hand lotion), E (zamboni).",
    "A, B, and C do not directly relate to moisturizing products; A relates to a location, B is a storage space, and C is a type of shop.",
    "D (hand lotion) is a direct product used to moisturize hands, which would be useful for someone experiencing dryness from sanitizer.",
    "E (zamboni) is unrelated and refers to an ice-cleaning machine, so it doesn't fit in this context.",
    "Therefore, the most suitable option for a moistener that someone who uses sanitizer frequently would use is D (hand lotion)."
