  "query": "Question: What could happen when beginning work after it is too late?\n\nChoices:\nA: panic\nB: deadlines\nC: accomplishing\nD: momentum\nE: sitting down",
  "steps": [
    "Starting work too late may lead to an immediate feeling of panic due to the pressure of finishing tasks on time.",
    "This panic can stem from the realization that deadlines are approaching rapidly, and there isn't enough time to complete the work.",
    "When deadlines are imminent, they create a sense of urgency which can either motivate a person to work faster or induce stress.",
    "Accomplishing tasks might be less feasible if the work is started too late, as there may not be enough time to complete them properly.",
    "Momentum is often hindered when starting late because it takes time to get into a productive rhythm.",
    "Sitting down to begin work when it\u2019s already late may not lead to effective work if there\u2019s no clarity on how to approach the tasks, further complicating the situation.",
    "Given the context, the feelings and consequences of starting late lead prominently toward panic, which characterizes the immediate response to time pressure.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer relates to the emotional response that is likely to occur when one begins working under such circumstances."
