    "The question is about the type of booking office used for planning a trip.",
    "We need to consider the main functions of each option provided in the choices.",
    "Option A (England) refers to a country and does not represent a booking office.",
    "Option B (police station) is primarily for law enforcement and public safety, not for trip planning or booking.",
    "Option C (airport) is a transportation hub but primarily focuses on air travel, rather than comprehensive trip planning.",
    "Option D (travel agency) specializes in helping clients plan trips, offering services such as booking flights, hotels, and providing travel information.",
    "Option E (city) is a general term and does not represent a specific type of booking office for planning trips.",
