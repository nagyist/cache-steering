  "query": "Question: The homeowner wanted new flooring installed, where did they want it specifically?\n\nChoices:\nA: home depot\nB: bundle\nC: house\nD: mansion\nE: loft",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which revolves around where the homeowner wants new flooring installed.",
    "Consider that the options given are locations or types of buildings that could potentially have flooring installed.",
    "Evaluate option A (home depot) - this is a store where flooring can be purchased rather than an installation location.",
    "Evaluate option B (bundle) - this suggests a grouping of items, not a location for flooring installation.",
    "Evaluate option C (house) - this is a common term that refers to a place where flooring can certainly be installed.",
    "Evaluate option D (mansion) - while this refers to a type of house, it is not explicitly mentioned that the homeowner lives in a mansion.",
    "Evaluate option E (loft) - similar to the mansion, this refers to a specific type of living space but does not directly indicate the homeowner's intention regarding the flooring.",
    "From the options, the most straightforward and general response regarding the location where flooring would be installed is \"house.\"",
    "Determine that C is likely the most appropriate answer based on the typical context where flooring installation occurs. There is no indication the homeowner has any other locations in mind from the given options."
