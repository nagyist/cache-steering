  "steps": [
    "The question states that the machine was very intricate, indicating that it is complex or detailed in design.",
    "Based on the intricate nature of the machine, I need to consider options that appropriately describe a complex or detailed object linked to machinery.",
    "Option A, \"box,\" does not convey any complexity and is too general; a box is typically a simple storage item.",
    "Option B, \"apparatus,\" implies a mechanical device or equipment that can be complex and might fit well with the description of the machine.",
    "Option C, \"appliance,\" typically refers to a device designed to perform a specific task, which can also be complex but may not suggest intricacy as much as \"apparatus.\"",
    "Option D, \"wash dishes,\" is a phrase that describes an action rather than an object. Therefore, it is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Option E, \"implement,\" generally refers to a tool or device used for a specific purpose, which may not carry the same weight of intricacy as \"apparatus.\"",
    "Comparing the relevant options: \"apparatus\" and \"appliance\" both convey complexity, but \"apparatus\" has a stronger connotation of intricate machinery.",
    "Thus, among options B (apparatus) and C (appliance), \"apparatus\" seems to fit better given the context of describing the machine."
