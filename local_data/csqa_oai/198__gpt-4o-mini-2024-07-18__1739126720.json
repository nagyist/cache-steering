  "query": "Question: James chose to not to print the cards, because he wanted to be more personal. What type of cards did he choose, instead?\n\nChoices:\nA: cursive writing\nB: hand writing\nC: store bought\nD: online media\nE: hand written",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James chose not to print cards to make them more personal. This suggests he is opting for a method of creating cards that allows for a personal touch.",
    "\"Print the cards\" implies using a machine or service to mass-produce cards, which lacks a personal touch. Therefore, he is looking for an alternative that allows more individual expression.",
    "The choices given involve different methods of card creation. We need to analyze which methods would maintain the personal element James desires.",
    "Choice A: \"cursive writing\" suggests a specific style of writing but doesn't imply it being a complete card-making method on its own.",
    "Choice B: \"hand writing\" can imply writing by hand but it\u2019s not necessarily describing a full card creation process. It may not emphasize personalization fully.",
    "Choice C: \"store bought\" refers to cards that are pre-made, which would contradict James's intent of creating something personal.",
    "Choice D: \"online media\" suggests digital formats that may not carry the personal touch associated with physically crafted cards. This doesn't align with his aim for personalization.",
    "Choice E: \"hand written\" emphasizes that the card is created by him personally, which maintains the personalization he is looking for.",
    "By testing each option against the intent of creating something personal, \"hand written\" clearly aligns with his reason for avoiding printed cards."
