  "query": "Question: People from all countries enjoyed the music, what was the music like?\n\nChoices:\nA: universal\nB: vocal or instrumental\nC: soothing\nD: artistic\nE: enjoyable",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that people from all countries enjoyed the music, suggesting that it had a broad appeal.",
    "The word \"universal\" implies that the music transcends cultural and geographical boundaries, which aligns with the idea of enjoyment from all countries.",
    "Option A: \"universal\" fits well because it indicates that the music could be appreciated by anyone, regardless of background.",
    "Next, I will consider option B: \"vocal or instrumental\". While the music could fall into these categories, it doesn\u2019t specify the quality that made it enjoyable to all people.",
    "Option C: \"soothing\" suggests a calming effect, but it doesn't encompass the idea of broad appeal across diverse cultures.",
    "Option D: \"artistic\" describes music that has aesthetic value, but it doesn't explicitly state it was enjoyed universally.",
    "Option E: \"enjoyable\" is a positive descriptor of music, but \"universal\" indicates the reason behind the enjoyment across different cultures.",
    "I now compare the options: \"universal\" captures the essence of enjoyment by all countries better than \"enjoyable\" does, because it explains the phenomenon of global appeal.",
    "I conclude that option A: \"universal\" best describes the music in the context of the enjoyment experienced by people from all countries."
