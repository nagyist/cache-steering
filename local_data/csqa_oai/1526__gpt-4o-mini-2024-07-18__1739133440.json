  "query": "Question: John hated lying.  It made him do something.  What did lying make him do?\n\nChoices:\nA: avoid eye contact\nB: feel guilty\nC: blush\nD: turn purple\nE: fall asleep",
  "steps": [
    "John hated lying, which indicates that lying has a strong negative emotional effect on him.",
    "Since people who dislike lying often feel bad about it, a commonly associated feeling is guilt.",
    "Avoiding eye contact is also a possibility when someone is lying or feels uncomfortable due to lying, but it's more of a behavioral response rather than a direct emotional effect.",
    "Blushing is typically associated with embarrassment or shame, which can be linked to lying, but it is less universal than guilt.",
    "Turning purple is less common as a reaction to lying, and falling asleep does not correlate with the act of lying.",
    "Among the choices provided, 'feel guilty' aligns most closely with the emotional response to lying, which John hates.",
    "The other options might occur but are less definitive or relevant to the issue of dislike for lying itself.",
    "Thus, the most fitting response to what lying made John do, considering his strong aversion, is to feel guilty."
