  "query": "Question: Where would you store potatoes for the winter?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: sliced\nC: cellar\nD: restaurant\nE: fried",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the best environment for storing potatoes to keep them fresh during winter months.",
    "Potatoes require a cool, dark, and dry place to prevent sprouting and decay.",
    "A cellar, which is often underground or in a cool part of a house, meets these conditions well.",
    "Next, evaluate the other options: \nOption A (countryside) does not specify a suitable storage facility. While there may be cellars in the countryside, the answer is too vague.",
    "Option B (sliced) refers to a form of potato and not a storage method.",
    "Option D (restaurant) suggests a place where potatoes might be used rather than stored long-term.",
    "Option E (fried) indicates a cooking method, not a storage solution.",
    "Since the only option that effectively looks like a proper storage solution for potatoes during winter is option C (cellar), this must be the correct choice."
