  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"blunt instrument\" suggests a physical object was used to commit a violent act.",
    "The action of killing with a blunt instrument would likely result in physical evidence at the crime scene.",
    "Among the options given, some refer to emotional states (sorrow, freedom) while others refer to physical evidence (finger prints, bloody mess).",
    "\"Finger prints\" are typically associated with more precise or clean actions, whereas a blunt object might not leave clear fingerprints.",
    "\"Bloody mess\" directly refers to the aftermath of a violent act with a blunt instrument, which would likely result in significant blood spillage.",
    "Cleaning up a \"bloody mess\" would indeed be very difficult, more so than cleaning up fingerprints.",
    "Therefore, the phrase \"no way to clean up the what\" logically relates to the aftermath of the violent act.",
    "Among the suggestive answers, \"bloody mess\" directly correlates to the type of cleanup mentioned."
