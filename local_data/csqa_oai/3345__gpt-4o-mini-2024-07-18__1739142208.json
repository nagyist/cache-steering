  "query": "Question: What happens when someone trips when going for run?\n\nChoices:\nA: falling down\nB: sweating\nC: get tired\nD: flying\nE: working out",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequence of tripping while running.",
    "When someone trips, the immediate physical response is usually an imbalance leading to a loss of stability.",
    "Losing balance typically results in falling down.",
    "Sweating, getting tired, and working out are related to the physical activity of running, but they are not direct results of tripping.",
    "Flying is not a plausible consequence of tripping; it's an unrealistic outcome.",
    "Given the choices, the most accurate and immediate result of tripping is to fall down.",
    "Thus, the answer that best fits the question based on the reasoning is A."
