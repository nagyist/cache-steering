  "query": "Question: What type of game causes players to use their head on the ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: sporting event\nB: head ball\nC: stadium\nD: soccer game\nE: hockey game",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a type of game that involves players using their head on the ball.",
    "Considering each option, \"head ball\" might imply a specific activity involving using the head, but it is not a commonly recognized type of game.",
    "The option \"stadium\" refers to a venue where sports are played and does not describe a game type.",
    "\"Soccer game\" is a well-known sport where players often use their heads to play the ball, such as during headers.",
    "\"Hockey game\" typically involves using a stick to control the puck rather than using the head, so this does not fit the question.",
    "Now I will evaluate the main options left: \"head ball\" and \"soccer game.\"",
    "\"Head ball\" does not describe a standard recognized game compared to \"soccer game.\"",
    "\"Soccer game\" fits perfectly as it involves players using their heads to play the ball frequently during matches.",
    "Finally, I can conclude that \"soccer game\" is the answer that best matches the description given in the question."
