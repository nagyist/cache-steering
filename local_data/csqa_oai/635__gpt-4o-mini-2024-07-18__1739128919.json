  "query": "Question: What would form on your feet, if you were jogging all day?\n\nChoices:\nA: heart attacks\nB: hole in your socks\nC: exhaustion\nD: shortness of breath\nE: blisters",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the physical activity of jogging all day. This is a prolonged form of exercise that can place stress on various parts of the body, particularly the feet.",
    "Next, think about how feet function during jogging. They experience repeated impact and friction with the ground and inside the shoes. This can lead to various physical issues.",
    "Now, evaluate the potential outcomes of jogging for an extended period. The most likely problems would stem from friction and pressure on the skin of the feet.",
    "Consider each of the answer choices in relation to feet and jogging. \"Heart attacks\" and \"shortness of breath\" relate to cardiovascular strain and overall exertion, not specifically to the feet.",
    "The option \"hole in your socks\" could occur, but it is not a typical result of jogging itself; rather, it might depend on the quality of the socks or previous wear.",
    "Now focus on \"exhaustion,\" which refers to overall fatigue from physical activity. While it may happen during or after jogging, it's not something that forms directly on your feet.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"blisters.\" Blisters are common injuries that form on the skin of the feet due to friction, especially when jogging for extended periods.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, blisters are a direct and likely result of jogging all day while the other choices either relate to more general health concerns or issues not confined specifically to the feet."
