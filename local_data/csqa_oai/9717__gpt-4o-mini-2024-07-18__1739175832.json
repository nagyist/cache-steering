  "steps": [
    "To determine a good time for garlic bread, we need to consider when it is typically consumed or enjoyed.",
    "Garlic bread is often served as a side dish during meals, especially with Italian cuisine such as pasta or pizza.",
    "Dinner is the primary meal when people usually enjoy garlic bread alongside their main courses.",
    "The other options provided do not represent typical scenarios where garlic bread is part of the experience:\n- A: refrigerator is merely a storage option, not a time for consumption.\n- C: jail is not a setting where one typically enjoys a meal like garlic bread.\n- D: supermarket refers to a place to purchase food, not a time for eating.\n- E: going on a date might suggest a meal, but it\u2019s not specifically tied to garlic bread as dinner would be.",
    "Given these considerations, \"dinner\" is the most appropriate answer for when garlic bread is typically enjoyed."
