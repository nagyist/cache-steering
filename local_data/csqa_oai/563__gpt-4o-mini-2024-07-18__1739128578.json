  "query": "Question: What business has a tower to transmit signals?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: toronto\nC: radio station\nD: roger that\nE: medieval castle",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of a \"tower\" that transmits signals.",
    "Towers are often used in telecommunications for broadcasting signals, such as radio and television transmissions.",
    "A radio station specifically utilizes towers to transmit radio signals to reach listeners over a wide area.",
    "Other options, like a city or Toronto, may have towers, but they do not primarily exist for the purpose of signal transmission.",
    "A medieval castle can have towers, but they are not associated with transmitting signals.",
    "\"Roger that\" is not a business and does not relate to towers or signal transmission.",
    "Now, looking at the options, \"radio station\" is the most relevant business associated with towers for signal transmission.",
    "Therefore, I can conclude that the correct answer aligns with the initial context of a tower specifically used for communication purposes."
