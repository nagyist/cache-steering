  "query": "Question: If you're a construction foreman and your job is to supervise others, what would your eyes been doing all day?\n\nChoices:\nA: fill with tears\nB: see work\nC: burning\nD: glass over\nE: dry out",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary responsibilities of a construction foreman, which include supervising workers and monitoring construction sites.",
    "Next, think about what is involved in supervision. This typically requires observation, so a foreman would need to keep an eye on the work being done.",
    "Evaluate the options in light of this role. Option A, \"fill with tears,\" does not relate to the duties of a foreman. Foremen are usually focused and attentive.",
    "Option B, \"see work,\" aligns with the duties of a foreman, as they must observe the progress of construction to ensure quality and safety.",
    "Check option C, \"burning.\" This doesn\u2019t correlate with the role in a constructive way. It's more metaphorical, not practical.",
    "Consider option D, \"glass over,\" which suggests losing focus or becoming unfocused \u2014 not something a foreman would want to happen while supervising.",
    "Lastly, evaluate option E, \"dry out.\" This could refer to a lack of moisture but is not relevant to the task of supervising construction work.",
    "Now, compare the viable options. Option B stands out as the most logical choice since seeing the work is integral to the foreman\u2019s responsibilities."
