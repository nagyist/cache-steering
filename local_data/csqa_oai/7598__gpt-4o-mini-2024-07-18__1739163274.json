  "query": "Question: When helping soldiers in the middle of fighting, where do medics practice practice their craft?\n\nChoices:\nA: funeral\nB: battlefield\nC: hospital\nD: war\nE: safety tent",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where medics perform their duties while assisting soldiers during combat.",
    "Considering the context of the question, the term \"fighting\" suggests a combat situation, which points to the location where active military operations are taking place.",
    "Among the options listed, \"battlefield\" clearly refers to the location where fighting occurs, making it a relevant choice.",
    "In contrast, \"hospital\" typically relates to post-combat care and not the immediate rendering of aid in the midst of fighting.",
    "\"Funeral\" is unrelated because it refers to a ceremony that occurs after death, not during the provision of medical assistance.",
    "\"War\" is too general a term; it refers to the overall conflict rather than a specific location where medics would be active.",
    "\"Safety tent\" does allow for some level of medical assistance, but it is not as specific or recognized as the \"battlefield\" itself.",
    "Considering the above points, \"battlefield\" is the most appropriate answer because it indicates the location where medics directly practice their craft while helping injured soldiers."
