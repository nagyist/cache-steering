  "query": "Question: What does a server need to be to serve customers well?\n\nChoices:\nA: polite\nB: commercial\nC: make money\nD: drivers license\nE: smile",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what it means for a server to serve customers well. This typically involves providing good customer service, which includes being friendly and accommodating.",
    "Next, examine the options provided. Option A, \"polite,\" directly relates to good customer service. A polite server is likely to create a positive experience for customers.",
    "Now, look at option B, \"commercial.\" This doesn't directly apply to the characteristics of a server but rather suggests a business aspect that doesn't reflect the server's interaction with customers.",
    "Option C, \"make money,\" while important for a restaurant or business's success, does not relate to the individual performance of a server in terms of service quality and customer interaction.",
    "Option D, \"drivers license,\" is irrelevant to the qualities of a server. A driver's license has no bearing on their ability to serve customers well.",
    "Consider option E, \"smile.\" A smile is a key aspect of customer service. It indicates friendliness and approachability, enhancing the customer\u2019s experience.",
    "Both options A (polite) and E (smile) are strong candidates as they relate directly to positive customer interactions.",
    "However, politeness is a broader concept that encompasses various behaviors, while smiling is a specific action. A polite server who does not smile may still serve well, but a smiling server is often perceived as polite.",
    "From the above reasoning, the most comprehensive quality that allows a server to serve customers well is to be polite, as it includes behavior that typically leads to customer satisfaction."
