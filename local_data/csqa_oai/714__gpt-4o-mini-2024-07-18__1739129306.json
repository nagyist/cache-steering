  "query": "Question: James went to the best steakhouse outside of the South.  Where is James?\n\nChoices:\nA: dairy farm\nB: texas\nC: building\nD: michigan\nE: florida",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what the term \"the best steakhouse outside of the South\" implies. It suggests a location that is known for its exceptional steakhouse, but is not in the Southern U.S.",
    "Next, we analyze the options provided. Texas is well-known for its steakhouses, but it is located in the South, which conflicts with the clue given.",
    "We now evaluate Florida. While Florida has steakhouses, it is also in the southern region of the United States, thus also conflicting with the clue.",
    "Next, we consider Michigan. There are reputable steakhouses here that would fit the description of being \"the best\" outside of the South.",
    "The option \"building\" is not a location where one would typically associate with a steakhouse; therefore, it can be ruled out.",
    "So far, based on our evaluation, Texas and Florida are in the South, and \"building\" does not refer to a geographic place one would associate with a steakhouse.",
    "The remaining viable option, Michigan, is geographically north of the southern United States and indeed has a reputation for good steakhouses.",
    "Therefore, based on the options and the interpretation of James' location, it seems most logical that he is in Michigan."
