  "query": "Question: Where can you buy lettuce directly from the grower?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: grocery store\nC: salad\nD: farmer's market\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you can buy lettuce directly from the grower, which implies a direct point of sale, not a store that may source from multiple growers.",
    "Choice A: supermarket - While supermarkets do sell lettuce, they source their produce from various suppliers and therefore do not sell directly from growers.",
    "Choice B: grocery store - Similar to supermarkets, grocery stores typically buy from distributors and do not offer direct sales from growers.",
    "Choice C: salad - This is not a place of purchase but rather a dish made from lettuce. It doesn't apply to buying.",
    "Choice D: farmer's market - Farmer's markets are venues where local growers sell their produce directly to consumers, making this a likely choice for buying directly from the grower.",
    "Choice E: refrigerator - This is a storage appliance and not a purchasing location, so it does not apply.",
    "Comparing the remaining relevant choice (D) with the eliminated options, I conclude that D is indeed the correct answer."
