  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the sentence. It mentions that a small dog was indoors but felt like it had all the space in the world.",
    "Next, I should consider the choices provided: living room, dog park, basket, small apartment, and big house.",
    "The phrase \"felt like it had all the space in the world\" implies a sense of comfort and ample room, which may not typically apply to a 'basket' or a 'small apartment'.",
    "Considering the option of a 'basket', it suggests a confined space, which would contradict the dog's feeling of having ample space.",
    "Next, analyzing 'living room', it can be spacious; however, it might not evoke the ultimate feeling of space compared to other options like a big house.",
    "Then, I examine the 'dog park', which is indeed a space for dogs, but the dog is stated to be indoors, making this option less likely.",
    "I also consider 'small apartment'. While it could offer some space, it doesn\u2019t have the connotation of unlimited space that the phrase implies.",
    "Lastly, 'big house' provides a strong connotation of having plenty of space available. It aligns well with the idea of feeling unrestricted indoors.",
    "Given all the probabilities and evaluations, the most fitting answer is 'big house' as it correlates well with the notion of feeling like one has \"all the space in the world\"."
