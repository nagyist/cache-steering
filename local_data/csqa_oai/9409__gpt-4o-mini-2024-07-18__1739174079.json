  "query": "Question: What would an adult woman do to get ready for work?\n\nChoices:\nA: drink beer\nB: put on make up\nC: dress himself\nD: work\nE: dress herself",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what \"getting ready for work\" typically involves for an adult woman.",
    "Common activities include personal grooming, dressing, and possibly having breakfast or commuting.",
    "Among the options given, I can eliminate \"drink beer\" since it's not a typical activity for getting ready for work.",
    "Next, I can also eliminate \"work,\" as this is what she is preparing for, not a preparatory step.",
    "Now I have \"put on make up,\" \"dress himself,\" and \"dress herself\" left to consider.",
    "The option \"dress himself\" is not suitable because it uses the male pronoun \"himself\" instead of \"herself.\"",
    "This leaves us with \"put on make up\" and \"dress herself.\"",
    "It is common for many women to put on make-up as part of their morning routine when getting ready for work, but \"dress herself\" is also an essential part of getting ready.",
    "Since \"dress herself\" is a more comprehensive step, it encompasses getting dressed and is also appropriate for the context of the question.",
    "Given that both \"put on make up\" and \"dress herself\" are valid, \"dress herself\" specifically indicates the action of preparing for the workday by putting on clothing, which is a key part of the routine."
