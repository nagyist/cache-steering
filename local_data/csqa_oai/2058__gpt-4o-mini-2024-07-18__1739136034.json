  "query": "Question: What can't viruses do without infecting a host cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: reproduce\nB: make computer malfunction\nC: infect\nD: hack computer\nE: mutate",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what viruses are. They are unique biological entities that cannot thrive independently; they require a host cell for their life cycle.",
    "Next, we need to consider what \"reproduce\" means. Viruses cannot reproduce themselves; they must enter a host cell where they can hijack the host's cellular machinery to create copies of themselves.",
    "Now, let's look at the option of \"make computer malfunction.\" This is related to computer viruses, which are different from biological viruses. However, biological viruses do not have any ability to make computers malfunction at all, as they are not related to the technology.",
    "Next, we examine \"infect.\" By definition, a virus's main function is to infect host cells to propagate. Without a host, the virus cannot perform this initial and crucial step.",
    "Considering the option \"hack computer,\" again, this relates to computer viruses. Biological viruses cannot hack anything as they do not possess the necessary tools or framework to engage with technology.",
    "Now let\u2019s evaluate \"mutate.\" While viruses can mutate, they typically do this after infecting a host where they replicate and can change genetically. Mutation does not occur independently of a host environment for their replication.",
    "To summarize, the primary functions that a virus performs without a host cell are extremely limited. The one function they absolutely cannot perform is reproduction, which is intimately tied to infection.",
    "Among the options provided, the only function that cannot be done without infecting a host cell is reproduction."
