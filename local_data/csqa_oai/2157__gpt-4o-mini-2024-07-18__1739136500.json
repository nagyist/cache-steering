  "steps": [
    "Consider the usual course of action for a farmer when an animal is no longer useful for farm work.",
    "Commonly, farmers may sell animals to various destinations where they are either kept for breeding, used for their meat, or possibly retired.",
    "A sanctuary farm is usually a place where animals are taken for their care and not sent for commercial purposes, which would not likely be the farmer's goal to make money.",
    "A cow pasture refers to a grazing area and again does not imply a financially beneficial action for the farmer.",
    "The countryside is a vague term and does not directly correlate with making financial gains from the animal.",
    "A cattle ranch is an option where animals may be raised for profit, but does not typically pertain to a heifer that is no longer useful.",
    "An slaughterhouse is an establishment where animals are processed for meat, which directly relates to making money from an animal that is no longer useful.",
    "Given that the purpose of sending the heifer away is to generate revenue, the most logical option regarding financial benefit is the slaughterhouse."
