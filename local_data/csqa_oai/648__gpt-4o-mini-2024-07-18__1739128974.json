  "query": "Question: If someone is outgoing what are they likely to seek?\n\nChoices:\nA: new experiences\nB: playfulness\nC: own house\nD: good looking\nE: beautiful",
  "steps": [
    "Outgoing individuals are generally characterized by their sociability and desire to engage with others.",
    "Because of their sociable nature, outgoing people often seek opportunities to meet new people and expand their social circles.",
    "Meeting new people usually involves trying out new activities or experiences, which aligns with seeking new experiences.",
    "While playfulness may also be a trait of outgoing individuals, it is less about seeking and more about their behavior in social situations.",
    "Having an own house or being good looking, while potentially appealing, are not necessarily goals that outgoing people prioritize over social interaction.",
    "The choice of being beautiful is subjective and doesn\u2019t directly relate to the behaviors of outgoing people in seeking experiences.",
    "Thus, among the choices, seeking new experiences is the most fitting for someone who is outgoing."
