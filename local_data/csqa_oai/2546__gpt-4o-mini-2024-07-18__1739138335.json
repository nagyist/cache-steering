  "query": "Question: Where could she go to find a big cat to see?\n\nChoices:\nA: front door\nB: residence\nC: zoo\nD: restaurant\nE: barn",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what \"big cat\" refers to. Typically, \"big cats\" refers to wild cat species such as lions, tigers, leopards, etc.",
    "Next, we consider locations where one can commonly find and see big cats in person.",
    "The front door is not a location where big cats are typically found, as it's typically a residential entrance.",
    "A residence is also unlikely to have big cats, as it's typically a home, not a place for wild animals.",
    "A restaurant typically serves food and does not house wild animals, so big cats would not be found there either.",
    "A barn is generally associated with domestic animals rather than wild big cats, so it would not be a suitable place to see them.",
    "Now, the zoo is a facility specifically designed to house and display animals, including big cats for public viewing.",
    "Given that the zoo is the only location on the list that is intended for viewing wild animals, including big cats, it becomes the clear choice.",
    "Thus, if she wants to find a big cat to see, the appropriate location would be the zoo."
