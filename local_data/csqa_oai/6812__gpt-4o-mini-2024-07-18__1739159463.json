  "query": "Question: If people are 19 years of age, what has happened already to most of them?\n\nChoices:\nA: die suddenly\nB: go to jail\nC: complete high school\nD: believe in god\nE: cross river",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the average age at which individuals complete high school in many countries, which is typically around 18 years old.",
    "Since most people graduate from high school at or before the age of 19, it is likely that a significant number of 19-year-olds have already completed high school.",
    "Next, evaluate the other options. Option A (die suddenly) is less common and not a typical occurrence for 19-year-olds. Most 19-year-olds are likely to be alive and pursuing their education or careers.",
    "For option B (go to jail), while some individuals may have legal troubles, this is not a common scenario that applies to most 19-year-olds, as many are still in school or beginning careers.",
    "Regarding option D (believe in god), while many individuals may hold religious beliefs, this is highly variable and not something that can be generalized to \"most\" 19-year-olds.",
    "Option E (cross river) does not correlate specifically with the life experiences of 19-year-olds and is not a common milestone for this age group.",
    "After evaluating the options clearly, option C (complete high school) stands out as the most applicable action that has occurred to the majority of 19-year-olds."
