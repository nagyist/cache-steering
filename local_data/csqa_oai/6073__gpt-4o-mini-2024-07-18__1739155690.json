  "query": "Question: The business meeting was more casual and not standard protocol, what was it like?\n\nChoices:\nA: informal\nB: nonstandard\nC: colloquial\nD: stanine\nE: standard wing",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a description of a business meeting that deviates from standard protocol.",
    "The keywords \"more casual\" indicate a relaxed atmosphere, which typically aligns with the term \"informal.\"",
    "The word \"nonstandard\" suggests something that does not conform to the usual ways, which would also be fitting but may not encompass the casual nature.",
    "The term \"colloquial\" refers to informal language or expressions used in everyday conversation, which may apply but doesn't directly describe a business meeting itself.",
    "The term \"stanine\" refers to a type of standard score and is irrelevant to the context of a business meeting.",
    "The phrase \"standard wing\" does not relate to the description of a meeting, as it suggests a structural or organizational part rather than the tone or style of the meeting.",
    "Between \"informal,\" \"nonstandard,\" and \"colloquial,\" the best fit for a casual business meeting is \"informal,\" as it directly describes the tone.",
    "Thus, while both \"informal\" and \"nonstandard\" could apply, \"informal\" captures the essence of the casual approach described in the question more accurately.",
    "I conclude that the most suitable answer is A, as it reflects the casual nature explicitly mentioned."
