  "query": "Question: What do people in a family typically do on the holidays?\n\nChoices:\nA: get angry\nB: talk to each other\nC: gather together\nD: run a race\nE: facing each other",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of holidays and family gatherings. Holidays are often a time when families come together to celebrate and spend time with each other.",
    "Next, evaluate each option based on typical family behaviors during holidays.",
    "Looking at option A, \"get angry,\" this is generally not a typical or desired behavior during holidays, even though disagreements can arise.",
    "Option B, \"talk to each other,\" is a plausible activity during holidays, as communication is a key part of family gatherings. However, it's not as comprehensive as other options.",
    "Option C, \"gather together,\" seems to directly address the essence of family holidays, where families unite in one place to celebrate.",
    "Next, consider option D, \"run a race.\" While some families may engage in playful activities, running a race is less common as a primary holiday activity.",
    "Evaluate option E, \"facing each other.\" While families may face each other during conversations or activities, this choice feels less representative of the overall holiday experience.",
    "Weigh all evaluated options. Options A, D, and E do not represent typical holiday activities. Option B is relevant, but option C \"gather together\" best encapsulates the primary activity family members engage in during holidays.",
    "Thus, conclude that the most fitting answer is that families typically \"gather together\" on holidays."
