    "Consider the choices provided and analyze which conditions are positively affected by regular exercise.",
    "A: Exercise helps prevent heart problems by improving heart health and reducing risk factors.",
    "B: Tiredness is generally a state not improved by exercise, but it can be opposed by proper fitness levels.",
