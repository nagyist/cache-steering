    "The scenario describes someone who is on a long haul and has gotten lost, indicating a need for navigation support.",
    "To navigate effectively, he would typically go to a place that provides necessary resources for travelers, such as information or supplies.",
    "Among the choices, a \"truck stop\" is commonly frequented by long-distance drivers and usually offers maps, food, and fuel.",
    "A \"gas station\" also provides maps and assistance for travelers, making it a possible choice as well.",
    "However, the wording \"made sure to buy a map\" suggests a specific interest in locating resources more tailored to long-distance road travel, which is exemplified by truck stops.",
    "A \"backpack\" does not fit as a location to stop; it\u2019s an item.",
    "A \"taco shop\" and \"amusement park\" are typically not focused on travel needs or resources like maps.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most logical stop to buy a map while on a long haul would be a truck stop."
