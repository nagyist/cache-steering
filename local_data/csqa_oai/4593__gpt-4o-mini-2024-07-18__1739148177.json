  "query": "Question: Where can one find multiple closets?\n\nChoices:\nA: hotel\nB: apartment building\nC: bedroom\nD: school\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options provided and the common places where closets might be found.",
    "Evaluate option A: hotel. Hotels typically have individual rooms that may have a closet, but a single hotel room would generally not have multiple closets.",
    "Next, examine option B: apartment building. An apartment may have multiple units, and each unit could have its own closets, but again, a single apartment unit typically does not contain multiple closets.",
    "Now look at option C: bedroom. A bedroom can have a single closet, but some larger bedrooms might have more than one closet (e.g., in master bedrooms with walk-in closets).",
    "Consider option D: school. Schools may have closets for storage, but these are not usually the type of closets one would think of in a personal space; they are generally dedicated to storage purposes, not multiple closets in a single area.",
    "Finally, evaluate option E: house. A house typically contains multiple rooms and can have several closets (in bedrooms, hallways, etc.), making it a likely candidate for having multiple closets.",
    "When looking for a place that is most likely to have multiple closets, option E (house) stands out as the best answer since it encompasses multiple rooms where closets can be spread throughout."
