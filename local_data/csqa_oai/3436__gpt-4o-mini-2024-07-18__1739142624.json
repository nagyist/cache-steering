  "query": "Question: What type of place has stopped giving out plastic shopping bags?\n\nChoices:\nA: retail store\nB: restaurant\nC: mini mart\nD: grocery store\nE: home",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the types of places that typically use shopping bags. Retail stores, mini marts, grocery stores, and restaurants all have the potential to give out plastic shopping bags.",
    "Plastic shopping bags are commonly associated with places that sell goods. Grocery stores often provide these bags for customers to carry their purchases.",
    "Retail stores also give out plastic bags, but some have transitioned to alternatives due to environmental concerns.",
    "Restaurants are less likely to give out shopping bags in a traditional sense, as they usually provide containers for take-out food instead.",
    "Mini marts may provide plastic bags, but they are generally smaller than grocery stores, and their usage depends on local regulations.",
    "Grocery stores are often at the forefront of the movement to stop using plastic bags, as they deal with a high volume of transactions and customers who may be more aware of environmental issues.",
    "Many grocery stores have introduced policies to eliminate plastic bags in favor of reusable bags or paper bags based on initiatives for sustainability.",
    "I will also consider recent trends; many places have stopped using plastic bags due to legislative changes or efforts to reduce plastic waste.",
    "Given these considerations, I posit that the type of place most commonly known for stopping the distribution of plastic shopping bags is the grocery store."
