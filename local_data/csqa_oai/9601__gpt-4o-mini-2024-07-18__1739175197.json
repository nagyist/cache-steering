  "query": "Question: Where would you find travelers that are planning to go to a different continent?\n\nChoices:\nA: rest area\nB: bus depot\nC: train station\nD: airport\nE: book tickets",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what it means to plan for travel to a different continent. This typically involves long-distance travel that often requires air transportation.",
    "Next, evaluate each option for its relevance to international travel. A rest area is mostly for road travelers and does not specifically cater to planning for different continents.",
    "Then, analyze the bus depot. While buses can travel long distances within a continent, they do not generally facilitate international travel across continents.",
    "Now, examine the train station. Similar to the bus depot, trains are primarily for transportation within the continent, with some exceptions for regions near borders, but it's not common for long-distance, intercontinental trips.",
    "Next, consider the airport. Airports are specifically designed for air travel, which is essential for flying to other continents. They are places where travelers book flights, check in, and board planes for international travel.",
    "Furthermore, think about the option to book tickets. While this is part of the travel process, it is not a physical location where travelers gather to plan their trip.",
    "Comparing all options, the only place where travelers going to different continents would be found is at the airport, as it is the hub for international flights.",
    "Therefore, I confirm that the correct answer is the one that specifically relates to traveling between continents, which is strongly linked to air travel."
