  "query": "Question: To prevent unwanted pregnancies, you'd keep the heifers and the bulls in separate what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cattle show\nB: houses\nC: corral\nD: dairy barn\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of keeping heifers and bulls separate to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Heifers are young female cattle, and bulls are male cattle. Keeping them apart is essential to control breeding.",
    "Next, I should determine the best physical space or structure used to separate these animals in farming or ranching operations.",
    "The term \"cattle show\" refers to an event where livestock are displayed, which is not a suitable environment for managing breeding.",
    "\"Houses\" could imply buildings but does not specifically denote a farming practice relevant to cattle management.",
    "\"Dairy barn\" is primarily for milking cows and may not necessarily be designed for keeping heifers and bulls separate. It often contains only the dairy-producing cows.",
    "\"Countryside\" refers to rural land and is too vague to serve as a specific location for cattle separation.",
    "The term \"corral\" is a fenced area designed to keep livestock contained and is a practical solution for separating animals, particularly in a ranching context.",
    "Considering all the options, the only appropriate structure specifically aimed at managing the separation of heifers and bulls to prevent breeding is the \"corral.\"",
    "Therefore, the best answer to the question is \"corral,\" as it is designed for this exact purpose."
