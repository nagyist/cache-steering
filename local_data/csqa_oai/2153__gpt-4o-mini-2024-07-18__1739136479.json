  "query": "Question: If I wanted to look at a drum, where would I go?\n\nChoices:\nA: symphony orchestra\nB: child's room\nC: music store\nD: rock band\nE: parade",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where drums are commonly found. They are musical instruments that can be part of various settings.",
    "Next, evaluate the options. A symphony orchestra primarily features classical instruments, but rarely has drums prominently featured.",
    "In a child's room, there might be toy drums or children's percussion instruments, but this setting is not specific to looking at drums as a musical instrument.",
    "A music store typically stocks a variety of musical instruments, including different types of drums. This setting is specifically tailored for purchasing and viewing musical instruments.",
    "Rock bands often have drummers and drums as part of their performances, but this is more about the performance aspect rather than merely looking at drums.",
    "Parades might feature marching bands that include drums, but again, this is not a location focused on viewing instruments closely.",
    "Based on the evaluations, the most suitable location specifically for looking at drums, in a broader context of purchasing and selection, is the music store."
