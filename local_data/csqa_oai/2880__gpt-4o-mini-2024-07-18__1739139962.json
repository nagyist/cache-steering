  "steps": [
    "The question states that the chain kept coming off of Bill's bike, indicating a mechanical issue.",
    "A bike's chain is essential for transferring power from the pedals to the wheels, allowing the bike to move.",
    "If the chain is not functioning properly, the bike cannot be pedaled effectively, which impacts its performance.",
    "The choices provided must relate to something directly affected by the bike chain's issue.",
    "Choice A, \"gear shift,\" refers to the mechanism used to change gears on a bike. If the chain is coming off, it affects the gear shifting process.",
    "Choice B, \"wheels,\" are still present and functional even if the chain is coming off, as they don't rely on the chain to exist.",
    "Choice C, \"garage,\" is irrelevant since it is a location and not affected by the bike's mechanical function.",
    "Choice D, \"hardware store,\" is also irrelevant, as it is a place where tools and supplies are sold and does not get directly affected by the bike chain issue.",
    "Choice E, \"motorbike,\" is a different type of vehicle that functions differently and would not be directly impacted by the problem of a bike chain.",
    "Considering the importance of the chain for operating the bike, the inability to use the gear shift due to a faulty chain is the most logical answer."
