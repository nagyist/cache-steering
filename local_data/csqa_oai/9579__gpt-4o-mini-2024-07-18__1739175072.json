  "query": "Question: Where is a dress shirt kept?\n\nChoices:\nA: garderobe\nB: drawer\nC: suitcase\nD: absence heat\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the places where a dress shirt is commonly stored.",
    "A garderobe typically refers to a medieval toilet or lavatory and does not relate to clothing storage.",
    "A drawer is a potential storage location for a dress shirt, as many people keep clothing items in drawers.",
    "A suitcase is generally used for travel, and while it may hold a dress shirt temporarily, it is not a common or permanent storage solution.",
    "Absence heat does not pertain to clothing storage at all; it is a scientific term related to energy or temperature.",
    "A closet is specifically designed to store clothes, including dress shirts. This is typical in households.",
    "I compare the options: garderobe is irrelevant, drawer is possible, suitcase is not likely for regular storage, absence heat is irrelevant, and closet is ideal.",
    "Considering all of the options and their relevance to storing clothing, the most appropriate choice for where a dress shirt is kept is the closet."
