  "steps": [
    "First, I consider where sugar is typically stored in a household. Common locations include the kitchen, cabinets, and cupboards.",
    "Next, I establish that if I do not have any sugar at home, I would need to obtain it from an external source or another location.",
    "I analyze the choices available. Options A (kitchen), B (cabinet), and E (cupboard) suggest locations where sugar is stored within my own home, which is irrelevant since I do not have any sugar.",
    "I then consider option D (container). While sugar could be stored in a container, it doesn't provide an immediate external source if I lack sugar entirely.",
    "This leads me to option C (neighbor's house), which suggests going to a neighbor to borrow sugar. This is a practical solution when in need of sugar.",
    "I assess all options and realize that the only choice that allows me to obtain sugar when I don't have any is option C, since it references an external source."
