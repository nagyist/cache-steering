  "query": "Question: The people began thanking each other, and they sealed the deal by doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel good\nB: appreciation\nC: kissing\nD: shake hands\nE: smile",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that there is a formal or celebratory action taken by the people after thanking each other.",
    "The context suggests that the action to \"seal the deal\" is likely a gesture that capstones an agreement or mutual appreciation.",
    "The action of \"kissing\" might be seen as overly intimate or personal in most contexts, making it less likely to be the correct answer in a formal scenario.",
    "Options like \"smile\" and \"appreciation\" do not match the idea of a concrete action to seal a deal but rather describe feelings or emotions.",
    "\"Shake hands\" is a traditional and widely recognized gesture used to signify agreement or the sealing of a deal in many cultures.",
    "I will compare \"shake hands\" with the remaining option \"feel good\" which also does not represent a physical action and is more abstract.",
    "Considering the context and customary practices, shaking hands appears to be the most appropriate action to indicate the sealing of a deal.",
    "I eliminate the options that do not describe a physical act, leading me to conclude that \"shake hands\" is the best fit."
