  "query": "Question: The executives talked strategy walking through the lobby, what were they likely discussing?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera\nB: office building\nC: receptionist\nD: business plan\nE: game plan",
  "steps": [
    "The executives are likely focused on topics relevant to their roles and responsibilities.",
    "The context of them discussing strategy suggests that their conversation pertains to planning or decision-making.",
    "Out of the options provided, some do not align with the notion of \"strategy.\" For example, opera (A) and office building (B) are unlikely topics for a strategic discussion.",
    "A receptionist (C) might be related to logistical discussions, but it doesn\u2019t fit into a strategic framework.",
    "Both business plan (D) and game plan (E) could potentially relate to their strategic discussions.",
    "A business plan typically outlines the strategy a company will follow, encompassing goals, business model, and market analysis.",
    "A game plan refers to a strategy or approach to a specific situation or competition, which could also be fitting.",
    "However, a business plan (D) tends to be broader and encompasses long-term strategy, while a game plan (E) could imply a more short-term tactical approach.",
    "Given the context of \"talking strategy,\" the term \"business plan\" (D) seems more aligned with overarching strategy.",
    "Thus, while both \u201cbusiness plan\u201d and \u201cgame plan\u201d have merit, \u201cbusiness plan\u201d is more appropriate in this executive context."
