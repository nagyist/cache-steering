  "query": "Question: Graphite is referred to as lead in what writing implement?\n\nChoices:\nA: lead pencil\nB: black\nC: very heavy\nD: news article\nE: card game",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a writing implement that uses graphite, commonly referred to as \"lead.\"",
    "Graphite has been historically called \"plumbago,\" which translates to \"lead ore,\" leading to the term \"lead\" in common language.",
    "The writing implement that primarily uses graphite is the pencil.",
    "In the context of pencils, \"lead pencil\" is a commonly used term, despite the fact that it contains graphite, not actual lead.",
    "Reviewing the answer choices, I need to identify which one correctly corresponds to a writing implement using graphite.",
    "Choice A states \"lead pencil,\" which directly references the writing implement that uses graphite.",
    "Choices B (\"black\"), C (\"very heavy\"), D (\"news article\"), and E (\"card game\") do not relate to writing implements or graphite.",
    "Therefore, the only answer choice that is both related to graphite and is a recognized writing implement is A."
