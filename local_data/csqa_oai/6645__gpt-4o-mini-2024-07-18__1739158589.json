  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what an apartment building is. It is typically a multi-family residential building that houses multiple separate living units. This suggests that it is more likely found in densely populated areas.",
    "Next, consider the term \"suburbs.\" Suburbs often consist of single-family homes rather than multi-unit buildings, although some apartment complexes can exist. However, they generally have less density than urban areas.",
    "Now, let\u2019s examine the choice \"urban area.\" Urban areas are characterized by higher population density and a greater number of businesses and residences. Therefore, it is plausible to find a significant number of apartment buildings in urban areas.",
    "Next, consider the option \"urban environment.\" This is quite similar to \"urban area,\" suggesting a densely populated region as well. It implies a setting that would support a variety of residential structures, including apartment buildings.",
    "Looking at \"Indiana,\" this is a state and does not inherently indicate the presence of apartment buildings. The density and urban planning would determine the quantity of apartment buildings, not the state itself.",
    "Lastly, the choice \"housing unit\" refers to a type of accommodation rather than a specific location or environment, so it is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Since both \"urban area\" and \"urban environment\" suggest a place with high density that supports apartment buildings, we need to analyze which of these terms might better relate to the presence of a large number of apartment buildings.",
    "\"Urban area\" is more commonly used in zoning and planning to describe regions that would have substantial multi-family housing developments, indicating it has a more official designation related to population density.",
    "Although \"urban environment\" is very similar, the term \"urban area\" tends to be more directly associated with the presence of multiple housing units such as apartment buildings in planning and statistical contexts."
