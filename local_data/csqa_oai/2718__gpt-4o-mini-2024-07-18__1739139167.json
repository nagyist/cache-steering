  "query": "Question: The mailbox is just inside the entrance of what structure containing many homes?\n\nChoices:\nA: beehive\nB: porch\nC: post office\nD: apartment building\nE: front door",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a 'mailbox' that is located 'just inside the entrance' of a certain structure.",
    "A 'mailbox' is typically used to receive mail, which is often located near where people live.",
    "The phrase 'containing many homes' suggests that the structure is a place where multiple residences are located.",
    "Let's evaluate the choices one by one:\n- A beehive contains bees, not homes. Not relevant.\n- A porch is the area in front of a house but does not contain homes itself. Not relevant.\n- A post office is a place where mail is processed and sent from, not a residence. Not relevant.\n- An apartment building is a type of structure that contains many individual living units or homes. Relevant.\n- A front door is just an entryway and does not represent a structure with homes contained within it. Not relevant.",
    "From this evaluation, the only option that meets the criteria of containing many homes is 'apartment building'.",
    "Thus, the correct answer aligns with the description of a mailbox being placed within a structure that houses multiple residences, which clearly fits an apartment building."
