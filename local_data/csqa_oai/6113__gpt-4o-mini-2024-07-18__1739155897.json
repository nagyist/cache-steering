  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a personal washing machine is likely to be found, implying a location where individuals typically have their own machines.",
    "Option A mentions \"clean dishes,\" which is unrelated to washing machines since it pertains to dishwashing rather than laundry.",
    "Option B mentions \"laundromat.\" While laundromats do have washing machines, they are typically used by the public and not considered personal.",
    "Option C mentions \"streets.\" This is not a plausible location for a personal washing machine, as they are usually kept indoors.",
    "Option D mentions \"cellar.\" A cellar may hold a washing machine, but it is less common to have it exclusively there; it is not the most likely place.",
    "Option E mentions \"house.\" A personal washing machine is most commonly found in someone's house, as many people have their own machine at home for convenience.",
    "After analyzing all options, the most suitable choice that aligns with the idea of a personal washing machine would be a place routinely associated with households."
