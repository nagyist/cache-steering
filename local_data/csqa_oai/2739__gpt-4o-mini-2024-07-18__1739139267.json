  "query": "Question: Where can a calendar be purchased normally?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: desktop\nC: smart phone\nD: wrist watch\nE: date book",
  "steps": [
    "I need to evaluate each option in relation to where a calendar can be normally purchased.",
    "Option A is \"office supply store.\" Office supply stores typically stock calendars as part of their inventory for productivity tools. This is a reasonable option.",
    "Option B is \"desktop.\" A desktop is a physical computer device where digital calendars may be accessed, but one does not purchase a calendar directly from a desktop. This option is not valid.",
    "Option C is \"smart phone.\" While a smart phone can have calendar applications, it is not a place where a physical calendar can be purchased, making this option less relevant for the question.",
    "Option D is \"wrist watch.\" Watches may feature digital calendars or date functions, but one cannot purchase a standard calendar from a wristwatch. Hence, this option also doesn't fit.",
    "Option E is \"date book.\" A date book is a type of planner that often incorporates a calendar, and it can be purchased, but it is a specific format rather than a standard calendar. It might be considered an acceptable answer, but not as direct as option A.",
    "Based on the evaluations, the strongest candidate for where a calendar can typically be purchased is option A, the office supply store."
