  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a hard substance that must take on different forms. This implies that the substance can exist in various states or shapes.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, I need to identify which option represents forms of a hard substance.",
    "Option A \"ice cream\" does not represent a hard substance; instead, it is a soft, creamy dessert that can freeze but is not inherently hard.",
    "Option B \"chipped\" suggests a state of being broken down or altered but does not specifically denote a hard form.",
    "Option C \"formed into cubes\" directly implies that a hard substance can be shaped. This suggests that the substance can take on a solid, defined form, which fits the criteria.",
    "Option D \"antarctica\" refers to a geographical location and does not pertain to a specific form of a substance.",
    "Option E \"found in Arctic\" again references a location and not a form of a substance, much like option D.",
    "From the analysis, it becomes clear that the only choice that represents a way a hard substance can take form is Option C \"formed into cubes.\""
