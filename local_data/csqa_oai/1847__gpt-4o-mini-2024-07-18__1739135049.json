  "query": "Question: Where should meat to be used soon be?\n\nChoices:\nA: freezer\nB: fridge\nC: butcher shop\nD: counter\nE: frying pan",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what \"meat to be used soon\" implies. It suggests that the meat should be stored in a location that retains freshness and is suitable for short-term use.",
    "Next, we consider the characteristics of each location mentioned in the options. The freezer is typically used for long-term storage since it preserves food for extended periods.",
    "Moving to the fridge, it is designed for short-term storage and helps maintain the freshness of meat for a few days. This aligns well with the idea of meat needing to be used soon.",
    "The butcher shop is where we purchase meat, and while meat can be fresh there, it is not a place for storing meat we already have.",
    "The counter could imply a countertop where meat is kept out at room temperature, which is not safe for preserving meat for any duration.",
    "Lastly, the frying pan is a cooking method and not a storage option. It cannot be used to preserve meat but rather to cook it.",
    "After evaluating all options, the refrigerator (fridge) remains the most appropriate choice for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it balances convenience with food safety."
