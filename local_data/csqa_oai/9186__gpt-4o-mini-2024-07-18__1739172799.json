  "query": "Question: What is someone not legal to buy alcohol?\n\nChoices:\nA: underage\nB: banned\nC: adult\nD: rules\nE: black market",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify who is not legally allowed to purchase alcohol.",
    "The general legal requirement for purchasing alcohol is that the buyer must be of a certain age, which is typically 21 years old in many countries.",
    "Given this requirement, anyone who is younger than this age would be considered \"underage\" and therefore not legally able to purchase alcohol.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided in the question:\n- A: underage - this choice directly relates to the legal age requirement.\n- B: banned - this could refer to someone who is banned from alcohol for various legal reasons, but it is not the primary definition of who cannot buy alcohol.\n- C: adult - this choice is incorrect as adults are typically allowed to purchase alcohol.\n- D: rules - this is not a person and does not specify who may not buy alcohol.\n- E: black market - while this relates to illegal sales, it does not answer who cannot legally purchase alcohol.",
    "Since we can see that \"underage\" clearly identifies the group that is not legally able to buy alcohol, it stands out as the correct option."
