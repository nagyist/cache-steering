  "query": "Question: Where is a ferret getting lots of attention likely to be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: trouser leg\nB: sick bay\nC: own home\nD: petting zoo\nE: mother's hair",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of \"a ferret getting lots of attention.\" Generally, when animals receive attention, it is within a setting where they are being interacted with by people.",
    "Next, evaluate each option. Option A, \"trouser leg,\" is unlikely as it is a very confined space and not a typical place for a ferret to be receiving attention.",
    "Option B, \"sick bay,\" typically refers to a place for animals or people that are unwell, and while some attention could be given here by caretakers, it's not a regular location for positive attention or interaction.",
    "Option C, \"own home,\" is a plausible choice because ferrets are sometimes kept as pets and can receive a lot of attention from their owners in a home environment.",
    "Option D, \"petting zoo,\" is another strong candidate because ferrets could be in a petting zoo and receive lots of attention from visitors who are allowed to interact with them.",
    "Option E, \"mother's hair,\" is a humorous option but not a realistic one for where a ferret would gather attention. It suggests an awkward situation rather than a common or expected scenario.",
    "Now, compare option C and option D. While ferrets can get a lot of attention in both \"own home\" and \"petting zoo,\" a petting zoo is specifically designed for interaction and attention from strangers.",
    "It's important to consider the likelihood of a ferret being in each environment. While pets get attention at home, a petting zoo is tailored for such interactions.",
    "After weighing the contexts, option D stands out as it directly states that attention is a main focus in that scenario, while attention at home may not be as consistent or meaningful as in a petting zoo."
