  "query": "Question: What might an honor killing attempt to achieve?\n\nChoices:\nA: criminal trial\nB: dies\nC: guilty conscience\nD: retribution\nE: murder",
  "steps": [
    "An honor killing is a type of violence primarily aimed at individuals who are perceived to have brought dishonor to their family or community.",
    "The perpetrators of honor killings often believe they are restoring their family's honor by punishing the individual who has supposedly transgressed social or cultural norms.",
    "Given the context of the choices, options that relate to punishment or violence would be the most relevant to the concept of an honor killing.",
    "Each option can be analyzed: \n- A (criminal trial) does not align with the intention behind an honor killing, as the act is typically carried out outside of legal boundaries.\n- B (dies) is somewhat related but does not represent the overarching aim of honor killings, which is more about restoring honor rather than simply causing death.\n- C (guilty conscience) relates to internal feelings rather than the external actions or consequences intended by the perpetrators of honor killings.\n- D (retribution) aligns well since honor killings can be seen as a form of retribution for perceived dishonor.\n- E (murder) is the act itself but again doesn't reflect the underlying motivation of restoring honor.",
    "Among the choices, option D (retribution) best captures the motive behind honor killings, as it implies a corrective response to perceived wrongdoing in accordance with cultural expectations."
