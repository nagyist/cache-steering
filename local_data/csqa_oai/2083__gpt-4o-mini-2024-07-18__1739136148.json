  "query": "Question: There is a cave near the capital of Charleston, where is the cave at?\n\nChoices:\nA: west virginia\nB: rocky hills\nC: kentucky\nD: in a sea\nE: desert",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that there is a cave near Charleston. We need to determine the geographical context of Charleston, which is the capital of West Virginia.",
    "Since Charleston is located in West Virginia, we should consider options that may relate to this state or nearby areas.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices:\n- A: West Virginia - This is a strong candidate since the cave is said to be near Charleston, which is in West Virginia.\n- B: Rocky hills - This option is too vague and doesn't specify a location. \n- C: Kentucky - While Kentucky is adjacent to West Virginia, it does not directly relate to the question about being near Charleston.\n- D: In a sea - This option doesn't make geographical sense for being near Charleston.\n- E: Desert - West Virginia is not known for deserts, making this option inappropriate.",
    "Given that the question specifically states the cave is near Charleston, and considering the options, A is the most relevant choice since it directly connects to the location of Charleston."
