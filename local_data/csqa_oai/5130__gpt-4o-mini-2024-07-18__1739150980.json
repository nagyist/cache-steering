  "query": "Question: Where always has a large amount of trash that only grows?\n\nChoices:\nA: dumpster\nB: detroit\nC: garbage dump\nD: state park\nE: subway",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a location that consistently accumulates a large amount of trash.",
    "A dumpster might contain a large amount of trash, but it is not a location that continually grows indefinitely; it can be emptied.",
    "Detroit, as a city, has areas with trash and urban decay, but it does not specifically represent a place that exclusively grows trash.",
    "A garbage dump is specifically designed for the accumulation and disposal of waste, and it certainly grows as more trash is added.",
    "A state park is meant to preserve natural beauty and usually has restrictions against trash accumulation, making it not suitable for the question.",
    "The subway can have trash in it, but since it is a transportation system, it is regularly cleaned and does not serve as a growing repository for refuse.",
    "Hence, out of all the choices, the garbage dump stands out as the only location intended for the collection of trash that continues to increase over time."
