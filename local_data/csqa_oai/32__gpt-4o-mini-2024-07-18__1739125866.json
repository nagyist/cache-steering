    "Identify the geographical region referenced in the question, which is Southern Europe.",
    "Consider the options provided and determine if any are located in Southern Europe. \nA: Michigan - located in the USA. \nB: New York - also in the USA. \nC: Amsterdam - located in the Netherlands, which is Northern Europe. \nD: Venice - a city known for its canals, located in Italy, Southern Europe. \nE: Bridge - not a location, but rather a structure.",
