  "query": "Question: They needed human to act out motion capture, what were they producing?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: movies\nC: actors\nD: cafe\nE: movie theatre",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"motion capture,\" which is a technology used mainly in animation and film production, capturing human movements to create realistic animations.",
    "Out of the provided choices, options such as \"university,\" \"cafe,\" and \"movie theatre\" do not directly relate to the need for motion capture technology, which is focused on capturing human performance.",
    "\"Actors\" could be a possibility, as they perform for motion capture, but it does not represent what is being produced; it refers to the individuals involved.",
    "\"Movies,\" on the other hand, is a direct output of the use of motion capture technology, as films often require this technology for animation and special effects.",
    "Since the context specifically requires a product that is typically created through motion capture, \"movies\" fits perfectly.",
    "I will review the other options to ensure there's no better choice.",
    "\"Actors\" refers to the people needed for motion capture, but they are part of the production rather than the end product.",
    "Therefore, I can infer that the primary output from using motion capture would be to create \"movies.\""
