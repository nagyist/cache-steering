  "query": "Question: Simon bought a cow because he wanted to put it to work.   He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: city\nC: dairy farm\nD: butcher shop\nE: canada",
  "steps": [
    "First, we establish that Simon bought the cow not for meat but to put it to work. This suggests that he intends to use the cow for some agricultural or labor purpose rather than for food consumption.",
    "Next, we analyze the options provided. The option \"D: butcher shop\" can be ruled out immediately since a butcher shop is a place where animals are slaughtered for meat, which contradicts Simon's intention of not wanting any meat for the cow.",
    "Looking at \"B: city,\" while it is possible that Simon could take a cow to the city, it is less likely given that cities typically have restrictions on livestock and are not common places for agricultural work.",
    "Considering \"A: countryside,\" this is a valid option because the countryside is a more suitable environment for farm animals and agricultural activities. However, we need to explore the specific purpose Simon has for the cow.",
    "Now we turn to \"C: dairy farm.\" If Simon didn't want the cow for meat, it could be that he intends to use it for dairy production, which aligns perfectly with his desire to put it to work.",
    "Finally, \"E: Canada\" refers to a country rather than a specific type of farm or work setting. While Canada does have rural areas and farms, this option is vague and does not directly address Simon's immediate purpose for the cow.",
    "Given the reasoning about Simon's intentions, the best option is clearly \"C: dairy farm,\" as this is a specific location relevant to his goal of using the cow for productive work."
