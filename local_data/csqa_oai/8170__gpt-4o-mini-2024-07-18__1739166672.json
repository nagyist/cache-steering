  "query": "Question: John had his appointment book with him when he got a medical checkup but he lost it somewhere.  He doesn't want to bother looking for it, so where would he go to get a new one?\n\nChoices:\nA: his house\nB: pocket\nC: office supply store\nD: doctor's office\nE: handbag",
  "steps": [
    "First, John needs a new appointment book since he lost his original one during his medical checkup.",
    "Next, he has options for places to go to obtain a new appointment book.",
    "While his house could potentially have another appointment book, it\u2019s likely that he wants to get a new one quickly and might prefer buying one rather than searching through his belongings.",
    "The pocket and handbag options are not viable because neither would have a new appointment book; they are not places to obtain items, just storage for what he already has.",
    "The doctor's office might have appointment books, but they are generally not places that provide these for personal use; they would likely refer him to a store or suggest he contacts his own office.",
    "An office supply store is a specialized place where John would likely find a variety of appointment books available for purchase.",
    "Considering John's need for speed and convenience in obtaining a new appointment book, an office supply store is the most appropriate choice.",
    "Thus, among the available options, the most logical place for John to go is an office supply store to replace his lost appointment book."
