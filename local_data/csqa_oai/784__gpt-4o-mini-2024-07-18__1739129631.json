  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question, \"What is the biggest speech in the capital?\" I must consider what \"biggest\" could refer to\u2014impact, significance, or size of the speech in terms of length.",
    "Next, I will identify what is meant by \"the capital.\" In the context of the United States, \"the capital\" typically refers to Washington, D.C.",
    "Now, I can look at the choices provided: A) each state, B) Gettysburg Address, C) State of the Union, D) each country, E) Europe.",
    "Evaluating each option, A (each state) is too vague and generic. D (each country) and E (Europe) similarly do not apply to \"the capital.\"",
    "The Gettysburg Address (B) is a historically significant speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln, but it was not delivered in the capital; it was delivered in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.",
    "The State of the Union (C) is a major address given by the President of the United States in Washington, D.C., outlining the administration's accomplishments and legislative agenda.",
    "Considering the context of a significant speech that is directly related to the capital, the State of the Union clearly fulfills that requirement.",
    "In terms of significance, the State of the Union address is highly regarded, occurs annually, and represents a tradition as the President's major speech before Congress.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all choices and their relevance to the question, the best answer that fits the description of \"the biggest speech in the capital\" is the State of the Union."
