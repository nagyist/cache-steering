  "query": "Question: The skin was cut while chopping onions, where was this skin likely cut?\n\nChoices:\nA: good health\nB: finger\nC: meat\nD: body\nE: own family",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that \"the skin was cut while chopping onions.\" The reference to \"skin\" suggests it is talking about skin on a body part, rather than skin related to food (like meat or the onion itself).",
    "Among the answer choices, we are looking for the most likely body part where a person might get cut. The term \"skin\" typically relates to human anatomy.",
    "The options presented include \"good health,\" \"finger,\" \"meat,\" \"body,\" and \"own family.\" \"Meat\" and \"own family\" don't logically associate with the act of cutting skin in the context of chopping onions.",
    "\"Good health\" does not correlate with the context of getting cut. \"Body\" is too vague, as it encompasses all body parts rather than specifying where the cut occurred.",
    "\"Finger,\" however, is a specific body part and is commonly cut in kitchen activities such as chopping food due to their thin skin and proximity to the cutting action.",
    "Since the scenario describes a cutting incident that is typically associated with fingers while handling sharp objects in a kitchen environment, this is likely the intended answer.",
    "To conclude, the logical deduction based on the description of the incident leads us to the most probable answer being the \"finger,\" as it relates directly to the action of chopping and the potential for cutting skin."
