  "query": "Question: John moved away from his family.  He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what?\n\nChoices:\nA: present\nB: stay here\nC: closer\nD: available\nE: come here",
  "steps": [
    "John moved away from his family, indicating that he was in a situation where he had to relocate for work.",
    "He felt a bit upset about moving, which suggests that he valued being near his family.",
    "The fact that he needed the job implies it was important for his livelihood, but he still had preferences regarding the job's location.",
    "To determine his preference, we must consider what aspect of the job location he would likely wish to change.",
    "If the job were \"present,\" it would suggest that he has the job now, but it doesn't account for the location.",
    "If the job were \"stay here,\" it implies he wishes he could keep the job at his current location, but this isn't a viable job preference.",
    "Considering \"available,\" it suggests that he might wish for a job opportunity locally, but doesn\u2019t specify the nature of that job.",
    "\"Come here\" presents the notion of the job being relocated to where he is, which is not a typical expression of preference in this context.",
    "The choice of \"closer\" indicates that he wishes the job were located nearer to his family, aligning with his feelings about being upset about the distance.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, \"closer\" stands out as the most logical choice reflecting John's desire for the job location."
