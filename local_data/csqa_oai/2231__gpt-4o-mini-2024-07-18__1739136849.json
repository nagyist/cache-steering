    "The question highlights that old folks in facilities often experience loneliness.",
    "To address loneliness, it is important to consider what can help alleviate this feeling.",
    "Interaction with others is a known way to reduce feelings of loneliness amongst the elderly.",
    "Plants, respiration, expiration, and perspiration do not directly address the emotional need for companionship or social engagement.",
    "While plants can provide some comfort or joy, they do not fulfill the need for social interaction.",
    "Respiration and expiration are physiological processes that do not relate to social needs.",
    "Perspiration, or sweating, is also unrelated to the emotional or social aspect of loneliness.",
