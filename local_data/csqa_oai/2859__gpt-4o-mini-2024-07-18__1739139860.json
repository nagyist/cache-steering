  "query": "Question: What do animals and humans have in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: bones\nB: tails\nC: bodies\nD: horns\nE: fur coat",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the fundamental biological similarities between animals and humans. Both belong to the kingdom Animalia, indicating they share basic life processes such as cellular structure and metabolism.",
    "Next, evaluate what constitutes a \"body.\" Both animals and humans have a physical form that includes organs, tissues, and other structures necessary for life.",
    "Now, let's look at the other options: \n- \"A: bones\" - While it's true that many animals have bones, not all do (like insects).\n- \"B: tails\" - Not all animals have tails, and humans do not have tails.\n- \"D: horns\" - Only certain types of animals have horns, such as goats or deer, but humans do not.\n- \"E: fur coat\" - Most animals have fur, but humans have hair, which is different.",
    "Given that \"bodies\" encompasses the entire physical structure shared by all animals and humans, it is the most universal option.",
    "Comparing the options individually shows that most do not apply universally to both humans and all animals, but \"bodies\" does."
