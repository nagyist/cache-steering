  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a person's likely feelings after receiving a gift that is not common.",
    "A gift that is not common may evoke a strong emotional response, as the recipient may see it as thoughtful or surprising.",
    "The options provided include feelings such as special, personal, offended, unique, and rare.",
    "Option A, \"special\", suggests a feeling of being valued or considered, which could be a likely response to an uncommon gift.",
    "Option B, \"personal\", also relates to the idea of the gift being tailored or significant to the recipient, which is possible but may not capture the overall emotion as well as \"special\".",
    "Option C, \"offended\", seems unlikely because receiving a gift is generally a positive experience, especially if it is not common; being offended by an uncommon gift is rare.",
    "Option D, \"unique\", relates to the nature of the gift rather than the recipient's feelings. A gift can be unique but does not necessarily describe how the recipient feels about it.",
    "Option E, \"rare\", similarly describes the gift as opposed to the emotional response of the recipient; it does not address the feeling.",
    "Comparing the suitable emotional responses, \"special\" seems to be the most fitting because it captures the essence of how a person might feel appreciated and valued upon receiving a thoughtful uncommon gift."
