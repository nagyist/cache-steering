    "Tickling stimulates the nervous system, and prolonged exposure can lead to physical responses.",
    "One common response to prolonged tickling is laughter, which is a natural reaction.",
    "Giggles can also stem from tickling but may not encompass the entire range of reactions.",
    "Dizziness can alter your body\u2019s balance and may trigger other responses such as nausea or vomiting.",

    "Nausea is a common sensation that can arise when someone experiences dizziness, especially if it is prolonged or intense.",
    "While laughing and giggling are also responses to tickling, they aren't the most direct consequences of dizziness resulting from prolonged tickling.",
