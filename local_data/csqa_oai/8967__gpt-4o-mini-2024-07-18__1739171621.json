  "query": "Question: The salesman was a weasel, this should've probably been expected at a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: used car lot\nB: viking ship\nC: chicken coop\nD: backyards\nE: rabbit warren",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of the statement. The term \"weasel\" often implies deceitfulness or dishonesty, particularly in reference to someone trying to sell something.",
    "Next, I should consider environments where one might expect deceitful behavior, particularly in a sales context. A used car lot is a common stereotype for deceptive sales practices due to the nature of some salespeople trying to upsell or hide flaws in vehicles.",
    "Looking at other options, a \"viking ship\" doesn't fit well as it is not associated with sales or deceit.",
    "The option \"chicken coop\" might imply trickiness or cunning, as weasels are known predators of chickens, but it doesn\u2019t directly connect to the sales context.",
    "A backyard may involve personal dealings that could be informal, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a high level of deceit or a sales scenario.",
    "The option \"rabbit warren\" is another place associated with animals and doesn't relate strongly to a sales tactic.",
    "Given that the term \"weasel\" is an idiom associated with dishonesty and the used car lot is a well-known context for such behavior, this connection seems strong.",
    "After weighing all the options, \"used car lot\" reflects the idea of expecting deceitful sales tactics the most clearly and fittingly."
