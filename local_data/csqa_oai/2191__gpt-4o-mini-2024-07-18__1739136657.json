  "query": "Question: Where do you see tiny bottles of shampoo when away from home?\n\nChoices:\nA: shampoo bottle\nB: hair salon\nC: pedestrian's hands\nD: at hotel\nE: supermarket",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where tiny bottles of shampoo are commonly found when away from home, I must consider locations where people typically travel and might need personal care items.",
    "When staying away from home, such as in a hotel or rental, travelers often use toiletries provided by that accommodation.",
    "Tiny bottles of shampoo are frequently provided in hotels as complimentary toiletries for guests to use during their stay.",
    "While hair salons may have shampoo, they usually don't provide tiny bottles to clients unless they are purchased.",
    "Supermarkets sell various hygiene products, including shampoo, but they are not places where tiny bottles are typically provided for personal use while away from home.",
    "I ruled out the options of a shampoo bottle (A), hair salon (B), pedestrian's hands (C), and supermarket (E) as they do not fit the context of traveling or being temporarily away from home.",
    "Given that hotels are specifically designed to accommodate travelers, the presence of tiny shampoo bottles is an industry standard for guest comfort.",
    "The choice of \"at hotel\" (D) is solid, as it directly corresponds to the context of where one would find such bottled toiletries when away from home.",
    "To verify the choices again, \"at hotel\" is clearly the most appropriate answer while considering the disposition of guests in temporary accommodations."
