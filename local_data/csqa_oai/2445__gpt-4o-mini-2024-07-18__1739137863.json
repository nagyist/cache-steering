  "query": "Question: Where is dust likely to be visible in sunlight?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: restaurant\nC: library\nD: windowsill\nE: carpet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify places where dust can accumulate and is visible, especially in sunlight.",
    "Dust particles are often more visible when they are illuminated by sunlight due to the scattering of light.",
    "Common areas where dust tends to settle include horizontal surfaces, such as floors, shelves, and window areas.",
    "The ground may accumulate dust, but it may not be as visibly illuminated by sunlight because it's typically outside.",
    "In a restaurant, dust can exist, but cleanliness is usually maintained, so visible dust is less likely in commonly viewed areas.",
    "In a library, dust might be less visible as well due to regular cleaning and maintenance, and the dimmer lighting often found there.",
    "A windowsill often collects dust and is typically exposed to direct sunlight, making dust particles there more visible.",
    "A carpet can collect significant dust, but it\u2019s generally in contact with the ground, thus covered and not exposed to light in a way that enhances visibility.",
    "Among the given options, the windowsill (D) is most likely to allow dust to be both present and easily seen in sunlight."
