  "query": "Question: Beautiful lightning strikes happen on what kind of day?\n\nChoices:\nA: november\nB: rainy\nC: dull\nD: wet\nE: average",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what conditions are typically associated with beautiful lightning strikes. Lightning is often more visible against dark storm clouds.",
    "Second, rainy days often come with thunderstorms, which means that the conditions for lightning are present.",
    "Third, a dull day might suggest a lack of brightness and excitement, possibly meaning cloudy but not necessarily stormy.",
    "Fourth, wet days indicate moisture in the air, which does not automatically translate into thunderstorms or lightning.",
    "Fifth, average days might be clear or slightly cloudy, but don't specifically indicate conditions that produce beautiful lightning.",
    "Sixth, then, rainy and stormy days are more likely to have active lightning. However, if we consider \"beautiful\" lightning, this usually refers to more dramatic storms.",
    "Seventh, considering the options, \"rainy\" or \"wet\" could both be plausible to suggest a thunderstorm. \"Dull\" does not imply active thunderstorms.",
    "Eighth, while \"rainy\" and \"wet\" can both lead to thunderstorms, \"rainy\" indicates a more likely chance of thunderstorm activity which produces beautiful lightning.",
    "Ninth, I will compare the meanings of the remaining candidates. \"Beautiful lightning\" is more visually striking during intense rain and storms, which makes \"rainy\" the strongest candidate.",
    "Tenth, I conclude that based on the conditions conducive to thunderstorms, the option \u201cB: rainy\u201d is the best choice that encompasses days that commonly have beautiful lightning strikes."
