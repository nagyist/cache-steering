  "query": "Question: The helm is the steering control of what powered leisure vessel?\n\nChoices:\nA: motorboat\nB: south tyrol\nC: tugboat\nD: brig\nE: sailing vessel",
  "steps": [
    "The helm is a term generally referring to the steering mechanism of a vessel.",
    "I need to determine which powered leisure vessels are operated using a helm.",
    "Motorboats are powered vessels and typically have a helm used for steering.",
    "Tugboats are also powered vessels, but their primary purpose is to tow or push other vessels rather than being leisure craft.",
    "A brig is a type of sailing ship with two square rigged masts, thus it doesn't align with the concept of a powered leisure vessel with a helm.",
    "Sailing vessels rely primarily on sails for navigation and may not have a traditional helm in the context of powered vessels.",
    "Given that the question focuses on a powered leisure vessel, I will narrow down to motorboat and sailing vessel.",
    "From the reasoning, motorboats are primarily designed for leisure, and they utilize a helm for steering.",
    "In contrast, while a sailing vessel can have a helm, it isn\u2019t powered by an engine in the same way a motorboat is.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting choice for a powered leisure vessel that uses a helm is a motorboat."
