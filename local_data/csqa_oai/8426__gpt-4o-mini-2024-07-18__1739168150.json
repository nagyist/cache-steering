  "query": "Question: The hot dogs were extremely expensive despite where they walked, where were they?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie theater\nB: disneyland\nC: park\nD: sporting event\nE: bowling alley",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the contexts in which hot dogs are typically expensive. Locations such as sporting events and amusement parks are known for selling high-priced food items, including hot dogs.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice. A movie theater often sells snacks and drinks at a premium, but hot dogs are less common there compared to other venues.",
    "Disneyland is known for its high prices on food, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A park generally offers hot dogs at lower prices, often at concession stands or food trucks, so it is less likely to fit the description given in the question.",
    "At sporting events, hot dogs are typically expensive due to high demand and the captive audience, which makes this option credible as well.",
    "Bowling alleys usually sell food, but hot dogs are not commonly associated with high prices there.",
    "Now, weigh the remaining strong candidates: Disneyland and sporting events. Both locations can justify high prices for hot dogs due to the context of entertainment and experience.",
    "Consider the phrase \"despite where they walked,\" which suggests an open area or venue where movement is free, leaning more towards an outdoor or expansive place like Disneyland or a sporting event.",
    "Since Disneyland is a distinct theme park with a theme of fantasy and attractions, it may lean more towards the intention behind the high prices compared to a sporting event, which has a more competitive atmosphere.",
    "Ultimately, both Disneyland and sporting events have high prices for food, but given the context of walking and the nature of the establishments, Disneyland seems to be the most fitting answer."
