  "query": "Question: Danny noticed a ceramic object on the table and picked a grape out of it.  What might have been on the table?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: painting of fruits\nC: fruit basket\nD: bowl of fruit\nE: fruit stand",
  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that Danny picked a grape out of a ceramic object. This suggests that the ceramic object is likely used for holding fruits.",
    "Examining the options, we see that some of them refer to places (like kitchen or fruit stand), while others refer to containers or collections of fruits (like fruit basket, bowl of fruit).",
    "A fruit basket and a bowl of fruit are both ceramic objects that could reasonably hold grapes.",
    "The option \"painting of fruits\" does not fit because it describes an image, not a physical object from which one could pick a grape.",
    "The term \"kitchen\" is too vague and general to specifically denote a place where one might find grapes.",
    "The term \"fruit stand\" refers to a vendor's setup for selling fruits, which is not a type of object from which you would pick grapes.",
    "Between \"fruit basket\" and \"bowl of fruit\", both are plausible, but \"bowl of fruit\" aligns more closely with a typical type of ceramic object one might find on a table filled with fruits.",
    "Therefore, considering the specific wording of the question and the options provided, \"bowl of fruit\" is the most likely correct answer."
