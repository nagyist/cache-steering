  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the immediate effects of consuming a large amount of alcohol, which can lead to various physical responses in the body.",
    "Next, I note that excessive drinking often results in headaches when the effects of the alcohol wear off, due to dehydration and withdrawal symptoms.",
    "I also recognize that a common consequence of drinking too much alcohol is vomiting, as the body may attempt to expel toxins.",
    "Furthermore, I acknowledge that falls and accidents can occur due to impaired coordination and judgment while intoxicated, making physical injuries more likely.",
    "In addition to vomiting and headaches, sickness can arise from alcohol poisoning or hangover symptoms, affecting the individual's overall wellbeing.",
    "Hydration is usually not a consequence of too much drinking but rather the opposite; excessive alcohol consumption typically leads to dehydration.",
    "Now, I analyze which options are direct results of excessive drinking; headaches, vomiting, and sickness relate closely to immediate or aftereffects.",
    "Among these, vomiting is a strongly indicative and common immediate response when someone drinks excessively, possibly to the point of losing consciousness or feeling very ill.",
    "While headaches (A) and sickness (D) commonly occur after drinking, vomiting (C) is a more significant and immediate response.",
    "In summary, I conclude that the most likely immediate consequence of too much drinking is vomiting."
