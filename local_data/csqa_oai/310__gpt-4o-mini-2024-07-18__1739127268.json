  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question, which asks what AI machines are known for doing.",
    "AI machines are primarily designed for data processing, analysis, and automation of tasks.",
    "I will evaluate each choice to determine if it aligns with the primary functions of AI machines.",
    "Choice A: \"fly\" - AI machines do not inherently have the capability to fly unless they are specifically designed for flight, such as drones, which is a narrow application of AI.",
    "Choice B: \"milk cows\" - This task is typically performed by specialized machines or robotics in agriculture, but it is not a primary function of AI technology itself.",
    "Choice C: \"eat\" - AI machines do not consume food; they process information and perform tasks for humans.",
    "Choice D: \"answering questions\" - AI is widely recognized for its ability to answer questions through applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and search engines.",
    "Choice E: \"fail to work\" - While failure can occur with any technology, it is not a defining characteristic of AI machines.",
    "Among the choices analyzed, \"answering questions\" stands out as the most prominent function associated with AI machines."
