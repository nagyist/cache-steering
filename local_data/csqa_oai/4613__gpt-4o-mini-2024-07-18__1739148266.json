  "query": "Question: Sean was a native English speaker, a fact that he found helpful.  Ludwig didn't speak the language well because he was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: introduced\nB: foreigner\nC: alien\nD: immigrant\nE: guide foreigners",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the relationship between Sean being a native English speaker and Ludwig's challenges with the language.",
    "Since Sean\u2019s fluency in English is contrasted with Ludwig's lack of proficiency, it implies that Ludwig might be from a different background.",
    "Examine the options provided to see which could accurately explain why Ludwig might struggle with English.",
    "Option A: \"introduced\" does not pertain to language proficiency and is not relevant.",
    "Option B: \"foreigner\" suggests that Ludwig is from another country, which would explain his difficulties with English.",
    "Option C: \"alien\" typically refers to a non-citizen or someone from another planet and is not commonly used to describe someone unfamiliar with a language.",
    "Option D: \"immigrant\" implies someone who has moved to another country, which could explain Ludwig's language skills. However, it refers specifically to the act of moving rather than the current language proficiency.",
    "Option E: \"guide foreigners\" does not make sense in the context of explaining why Ludwig struggles with English since it suggests he would be proficient in order to guide others.",
    "Compare B and D. While \"foreigner\" is general, \"immigrant\" specifically includes the aspect of cultural integration, which might also relate to Ludwig\u2019s struggle, but is more nuanced.",
    "Ultimately, the term \"foreigner\" is more direct and clearly answers why Ludwig didn't speak the language well."
