  "query": "Question: The travelers didn't have much money but didn't have far to travel, so were did they go?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: come home\nC: train station\nD: taxi station\nE: bus depot",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the travelers didn't have much money, which suggests that they are looking for a low-cost option for transportation.",
    "Since they didn't have far to travel, it's likely they chose a mode of transportation that is economical and practical for short distances.",
    "I consider the options provided: airport, come home, train station, taxi station, and bus depot.",
    "The airport is generally associated with long-distance travel and can be expensive, thus it is not a suitable choice.",
    "\"Come home\" suggests that they might not need transport if they are returning to where they live, but it doesn't specify where they went.",
    "The train station could be a possibility for inexpensive short-distance travel; however, it typically involves a ticket purchase, which might still be more than they can afford considering their financial situation.",
    "A taxi station is generally associated with higher fares, making it an unlikely choice for travelers with limited funds.",
    "A bus depot is known for providing lower-cost transport options, making it suitable for short trips. It\u2019s also a common choice for those who don't have much money.",
    "Comparing all the options, the bus depot aligns best with the clues provided in the question, allowing for economical travel over a short distance."
