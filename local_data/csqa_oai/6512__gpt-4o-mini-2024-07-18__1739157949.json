  "query": "Question: Where would someone have to carry their brass instrument while they played?\n\nChoices:\nA: punk rock band\nB: marching band\nC: brass band\nD: annoy mom\nE: jazz band",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand what is meant by \"carry their brass instrument while they played.\" This suggests a situation where the musician needs to perform while holding the instrument, rather than being stationary.",
    "Consider the nature of a \"marching band.\" In a marching band, musicians perform while marching, which requires them to carry their instruments during the performance.",
    "Examine the \"punk rock band.\" Usually, rock bands perform on a stage, and musicians can have their instruments set down during parts of their performance, making it less likely they are always carrying their instruments.",
    "Look into \"brass band.\" While it\u2019s common for brass bands to play together, they usually perform in concert settings where instruments are not necessarily carried while playing.",
    "Assess the \"annoy mom\" option. This is not a legitimate musical context and does not relate to the question about performing with a brass instrument.",
    "Investigate the \"jazz band.\" Jazz musicians often perform at gigs or concerts but typically do not march or need to carry their instruments during a performance.",
    "After considering all options, it\u2019s clear that the marching band is the only context where musicians must carry their instruments while they are performing.",
    "Thus, the only correct answer to the question based on the performance requirement is B."
