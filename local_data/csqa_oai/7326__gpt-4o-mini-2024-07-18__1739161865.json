  "steps": [
    "The question describes a janitor who is climbing in the rafters of an auditorium. The rafters are typically used for supporting structures, including lighting and sound equipment.",
    "The term \"stage\" in the context of an auditorium usually refers to the area where performances occur, which often requires good lighting for visibility and effect.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"theater\" refers to a type of venue, not something the janitor would replace. \"University campus\" does not fit the context since the janitor is working in an auditorium specifically.",
    "\"Director\" is a person in charge of a production, not something that can be replaced in the context of this question.",
    "The remaining option, \"lights,\" matches the context because replacing stage lights would necessitate climbing into the rafters where the lights are typically mounted.",
    "Since the other options (A, C, D, E) do not logically fit with the action of climbing and replacing something in the auditorium, \"lights\" is the most suitable answer."
