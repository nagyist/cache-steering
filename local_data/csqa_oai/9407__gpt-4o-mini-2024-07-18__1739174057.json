  "query": "Question: Food on what kind of transport is normally freeze dried or dehydrated?\n\nChoices:\nA: friend's house\nB: bicycle\nC: space shuttle\nD: kitchen\nE: disneyland",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves identifying a type of transport where food is typically freeze dried or dehydrated.",
    "Freeze-drying and dehydration are methods used to preserve food, commonly utilized in locations where fresh food might not be available for long durations.",
    "Considering the options, \"friend's house\" does not specifically relate to freeze-drying practices.",
    "\"Bicycle\" doesn\u2019t have a direct association with food preservation methods like freeze drying or dehydration.",
    "The option \"kitchen\" is where food can be prepared and processed, but it is not a form of transport and doesn't specifically relate to freeze-dried or dehydrated food.",
    "The option \"disneyland\" is more about recreation and entertainment, not a mode of transport for food preservation.",
    "Now consider \"space shuttle\". In space travel, the limitation on storage and the need for long-lasting food means that astronauts rely on freeze-dried and dehydrated food.",
    "Space missions often use dehydrated food to ensure that meal options remain lightweight and have a long shelf life, which is crucial for long-duration flights into space.",
    "Hence, the type of transport associated with freeze-dried or dehydrated food would most logically be space shuttles."
