  "query": "Question: Why is waiting for the doctor difficult for people who need to do work?\n\nChoices:\nA: having appointements\nB: being late\nC: have time to think\nD: time consuming\nE: impatience",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the main issue faced by people who need to do work while waiting for the doctor. The primary concern is how the waiting impacts their ability to accomplish work tasks.",
    "Consider each answer choice to see if it directly addresses the difficulty of waiting for a doctor when one needs to work.",
    "Evaluate choice A: \"having appointments.\" People might have appointments, but this does not explain why waiting is difficult for those needing to work.",
    "Evaluate choice B: \"being late.\" This can be a concern, but it's more related to punctuality rather than the act of waiting itself causing difficulties.",
    "Evaluate choice C: \"have time to think.\" While this can be perceived positively, it does not convey a challenge associated with needing to work.",
    "Evaluate choice D: \"time consuming.\" This option suggests that waiting takes up a significant amount of time that could be used for work, indicating a clear difficulty.",
    "Evaluate choice E: \"impatience.\" Impatience might arise from waiting, but it doesn't fully explain the significance of the work-related aspect.",
    "From the evaluations above, \"time consuming\" is the most relevant and illustrates the inconvenience of waiting when someone has work that needs to be done."
