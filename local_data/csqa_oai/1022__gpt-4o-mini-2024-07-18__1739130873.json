  "query": "Question: Where can a grain of sand cause a person a lot of pain and possible damage sight?\n\nChoices:\nA: eye\nB: clam\nC: bathing suit\nD: shoes\nE: beach",
  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the potential consequences of a grain of sand in each of the given options.",
    "Starting with option A (eye), a grain of sand can easily get lodged in the eye and cause significant pain and potential damage to eyesight.",
    "Looking at option B (clam), a grain of sand may be found inside a clam but it is unlikely to cause pain to a person, as it does not directly affect human health or eyesight.",
    "For option C (bathing suit), a grain of sand may cause discomfort but does not pose a direct threat to a person's eyesight.",
    "In option D (shoes), a grain of sand might irritate the foot or become uncomfortable, but it similarly does not have implications for vision.",
    "Lastly, for option E (beach), while a grain of sand can be found on the beach, it does not directly harm a person unless it is in the context of entering an eye.",
    "Therefore, out of all the options examined, option A (eye) is the only one where a grain of sand causes pain and potential damage to sight."
