  "steps": [
    "I need to identify where fictional words are likely to be found. Fictional words are typically those that do not exist in standard dictionaries, often created for storytelling or imaginative literature.",
    "Books are a primary form of storytelling and are known to contain fictional words, especially in genres like fantasy and science fiction where authors often create their own terms.",
    "Newspapers focus on factual reporting and current events, making them an unlikely source for fictional words.",
    "The mouth is a part of the body used for speaking but isn't a source of written fictional words.",
    "A sentence is a grammatical structure for conveying meaning but doesn't specifically represent a location where fictional words are gathered.",
    "The phrase \"in the package\" does not suggest a traditional form of storytelling or literature where fictional words would typically appear.",
    "Given that books are a stronghold of fictional words, I conclude that choice A is the most logical answer."
