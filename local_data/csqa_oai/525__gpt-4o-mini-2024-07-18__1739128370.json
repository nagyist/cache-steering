  "query": "Question: What happens to cats every day?\n\nChoices:\nA: open doors\nB: drink water\nC: need food\nD: annoy\nE: play",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the daily needs of cats as living creatures. Like all animals, they need sustenance to survive.",
    "Next, think about the essential elements of a cat's diet. This primarily includes food, which they consume regularly.",
    "Evaluate the significance of the choices provided. All options either describe activities that cats might engage in or needs they may have.",
    "Out of all options, A (open doors) is unlikely as it varies by individual cat behavior and not something that happens every day for all cats.",
    "Option B (drink water) is also a daily activity for cats since hydration is essential, but it is secondary to the immediate need for food.",
    "Consider option C (need food). This is a fundamental requirement for cats and occurs every day as they need to eat to sustain energy.",
    "Option D (annoy) could happen daily, but it is not a necessity or a universal truth across all cats.",
    "Option E (play) might occur on a daily basis for many cats but is not a survival requirement in the same way that food is.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the most universally accurate choice that applies to every cat on a daily basis is C (need food), as cats must eat every day for their health and well-being."
