  "query": "Question: The detective had a lot of corporeal evidence to sort through, unfortunately the bulk of it would prove to be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: intangible\nB: spiritual\nC: transparent\nD: ethereal\nE: insubstantial",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"corporeal evidence\" indicates that the evidence is physical or tangible in nature.",
    "The question states that the bulk of the corporeal evidence would prove to be something else. This suggests a contradiction or unexpected characteristic of that evidence.",
    "Examining the choices: \n- A (intangible): means not able to be touched or not having physical presence. \n- B (spiritual): relates to the spirit rather than physical matter. \n- C (transparent): can refer to something that is clear or easily seen through but doesn\u2019t relate to the physical nature in a contradictory way.\n- D (ethereal): often associated with things that are heavenly or delicate but does not directly contradict corporeal.\n- E (insubstantial): means lacking substance, physical presence, or strength.",
    "Out of the options, \"insubstantial\" directly opposes the idea of corporeal, as it suggests that the evidence lacks physical presence.",
    "The other options (intangible, spiritual, ethereal) may suggest lack of physicality, but they do not have the same strong oppositional meaning as \"insubstantial.\"",
    "Since the bulk of corporeal evidence would exist as something lacking substance, \"insubstantial\" fits best with the provided context.",
    "Therefore, the answer must reflect the idea that although the evidence was originally corporeal, it turned out to be lacking any solid or meaningful presence."
