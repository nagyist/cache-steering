  "steps": [
    "The question mentions an old saying about taxes being inevitable. Common phrases related to taxes often include references to death.",
    "I recall a well-known saying: \"Nothing is certain except for death and taxes.\" This suggests a strong correlation between death and taxes in popular sayings.",
    "Next, I should evaluate the answer choices provided in relation to this phrase. Choice A (discount) does not relate to the saying.",
    "Choice C (refund) has no direct connection to the inevitability aspect of taxes.",
    "Choice D (free money) is also irrelevant in this context.",
    "Choice E (spend) does not relate to the notion of inevitability and certainty, thus leaving it out of consideration.",
    "The only choice that directly fits with the common saying about taxes is choice B (death and).",
    "Since it is an established phrase, I can affirm that it aligns with the context of the question."
