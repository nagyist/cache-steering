  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the options given to see where students are likely to stick gum in a school setting.",
    "Option A suggests that students stick gum in books. This is a possibility since students might hide it in their textbooks or notebooks, but it's not the most common place.",
    "Option B proposes that students stick gum on the sidewalk. However, sidewalks are outside the school environment and typically not a primary context for students.",
    "Option C mentions the water fountain. It's likely that some students might stick gum there as it is a common area for students to gather, though it may not be socially acceptable.",
    "Option D refers to a shelf. Students might stick gum on shelves, but there are many shelves, and it\u2019s not as common or visible.",
    "Option E suggests movies. This option is unrelated to schools and therefore is not a viable place for students to stick gum in a school setting.",
    "Among the options, sticking gum on the water fountain (Option C) seems like a common behavior since many students frequently use water fountains, and they might carelessly discard gum there.",
    "I need to double-check the likelihood of the other options compared to sticking gum on a water fountain.",
    "Books (A) and shelves (D) could be locations, but they are more covert and unlikely compared to a water fountain where it's more publicly visible.",
    "The sidewalk (B) is outside the school and not specific to the school building or its environment.",
    "Given these considerations, sticking gum on the water fountain seems like the most plausible answer regarding behavior observed in schools."
