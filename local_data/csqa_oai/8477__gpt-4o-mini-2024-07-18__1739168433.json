  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"Loose lips sink ships\" suggests that careless talk can lead to problems, particularly in maintaining confidentiality.",
    "Since the context involves planners for a surprise party, they need to keep their plans secret from the person being surprised.",
    "To ensure that the surprise is not spoiled, the planners must be cautious about what they say and to whom they say it.",
    "The word \"discreet\" implies being careful about what one says or does, especially in order to avoid causing offense or to maintain privacy.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, \"discreet\" aligns with the need for secrecy and carefulness suggested by the original phrase.",
    "The other options (close fitting, careful, compact, faithful) do not directly relate to the specific need for secrecy or confidentiality.",
    "While \"careful\" also suggests a sense of caution, \"discreet\" is more precise in context as it addresses the avoidance of talking about the surprise.",
    "Therefore, the best choice based on the understanding of the implications of the phrase and the context of a surprise party is \"discreet.\""
