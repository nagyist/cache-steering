  "query": "Question: James's hammer bent while he was driving nails. He needed a new one.  Where might he go to find one?\n\nChoices:\nA: repair shop\nB: carpenter's toolbox\nC: tool box\nD: hardware store\nE: tool shop",
  "steps": [
    "First reasoning step: Consider the context of needing a new hammer. James\u2019s current hammer is bent and no longer functional, so he needs a replacement.",
    "Second reasoning step: A repair shop is typically for fixing items rather than selling new ones, so it\u2019s unlikely he would go there for a new hammer.",
    "Third reasoning step: A carpenter's toolbox might have a hammer, but since it's a toolbox belonging to someone else, he wouldn't be able to find a new hammer there.",
    "Fourth reasoning step: A toolbox generally refers to a collection of tools owned by an individual, but it doesn\u2019t specifically imply that it\u2019s a place to buy a new hammer.",
    "Fifth reasoning step: A hardware store is designed for selling tools and materials, including hammers; this is a strong candidate for where James might find a new hammer.",
    "Sixth reasoning step: A tool shop, like a hardware store, specializes in tools. It\u2019s another viable option where James could purchase a new hammer.",
    "Seventh reasoning step: Compare the options. A hardware store is more commonly associated with a wide variety of tools and items for building or fixing, making it a likely choice for a new hammer.",
    "Eighth reasoning step: Although both a hardware store and a tool shop are valid options, hardware stores are more prevalent and usually more accessible for most people.",
    "Ninth reasoning step: Since the question is about finding a new hammer, selecting the option that is most aligned with that need is essential.",
    "Final reasoning step: Among the options, the hardware store stands out as the most logical and common choice for James to find a new hammer."
