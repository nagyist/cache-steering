  "query": "Question: Along what feature will you find a rosebush?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: in the ground\nC: hedgerow\nD: temperate climate\nE: botanical gardens",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the common characteristics or locations where rosebushes typically grow.",
    "Rosebushes are often found in gardens, which suggests a location that is maintained by humans.",
    "A park could be a suitable location since it often has gardens or landscaped areas with flowers, including rosebushes.",
    "Being \"in the ground\" is too general; it doesn't specify any particular setting or ecosystem for rosebushes.",
    "A hedgerow is a type of boundary formed by a dense row of shrubs and plants, which often includes rosebushes.",
    "Temperate climates are suitable for growing rosebushes, but it is not a specific location rather just a climatic condition.",
    "Botanical gardens are specifically designed to host a variety of plants, including ornamental species like rosebushes.",
    "Now I must evaluate which option is most closely associated with the presence of rosebushes.",
    "While parks and botanical gardens are both plausible, the hedgerow option specifically implies a natural setting where one is likely to find rosebushes as part of a boundary or habitat.",
    "I conclude that all options have merit, but the hedgerow is a distinctive feature known for containing rose bushes in many ecological contexts."
