  "steps": [
    "The question asks about an activity that is typically done at a concert.",
    "I will analyze each option in relation to a concert setting.",
    "Option A, \"make noise\", is relevant since concerts are often loud environments where the audience cheers, claps, and sings along.",
    "Option B, \"make time\", does not seem particularly relevant to a concert experience. Concerts are scheduled events, but this phrase more commonly relates to time management rather than a concert activity.",
    "Option C, \"make payments\", can occur when purchasing tickets or merchandise, but it is not something actively done during the concert itself.",
    "Option D, \"make hay\", has no connection to concerts; it\u2019s more related to farming and outside activity.",
    "Option E, \"make peace\", is not a standard activity associated with concerts; it's more of a diplomatic or social initiative.",
    "Comparing all options, \"make noise\" is the primary activity done by the audience during a concert, as they typically express their enjoyment and excitement through cheering and singing."
