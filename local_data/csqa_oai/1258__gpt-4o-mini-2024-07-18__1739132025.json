  "query": "Question: John bought a ferret at a pet shop.  He couldn't take it on the bus, so he called something else.  What might he have called?\n\nChoices:\nA: cousin's house\nB: taxi cab\nC: own home\nD: friend\nE: wood pile",
  "steps": [
    "John bought a ferret and needed to transport it somewhere since he couldn't take it on the bus. This implies he needed a form of transportation.",
    "Since he couldn't take it on the bus, he likely considered other common forms of transportation.",
    "Out of the options provided, a taxi cab (B) is a readily available mode of transportation for individuals with pets, especially when public transport isn't an option.",
    "Cousin's house (A) and friend (D) could imply that he might have called someone to pick him up or to help him, but they do not directly serve as transportation options.",
    "His own home (C) could be a possibility if he already had a way to transport the ferret back home himself.",
    "Wood pile (E) is not a plausible option for transportation as it does not refer to a means of moving himself or the ferret.",
    "Taking all this into account, while cousin's house, friend, and own home could suggest getting help, they are not direct forms of transportation like a taxi cab would be.",
    "Thus, the best choice that directly relates to his need for transportation is a taxi cab (B)."
