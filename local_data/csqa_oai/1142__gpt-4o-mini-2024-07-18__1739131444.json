  "steps": [
    "The context of the question suggests that the person in question is experiencing a consequence of getting up early, which may affect her physical state or feelings.",
    "Getting up early often leads to feelings of fatigue or tiredness, especially if someone isn't used to it.",
    "The phrase \"she needed some drops to clear up\" implies a remedy for a physical condition, which suggests that the answer should relate to a visible or physical symptom.",
    "\"Restlessness\" and \"starting early\" do not align well with the idea of needing drops, as they don't typically correspond to a symptom that could be treated with drops.",
    "\"Tiredness\" is a general feeling and is not something that can be cleared up with drops.",
    "\"Feeling tired\" is similar to tiredness and does not denote a physical symptom requiring treatment with drops.",
    "\"Bloodshot eyes\" is a physical condition often caused by lack of sleep or waking up early. It is something that could be treated with eye drops to reduce redness.",
    "Considering the above reasoning, \"bloodshot eyes\" clearly fits the context and need for drops."
