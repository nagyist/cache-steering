  "query": "Question: Where could a jellyfish stay alive?\n\nChoices:\nA: book\nB: store\nC: forest\nD: lake\nE: current",
  "steps": [
    "Jellyfish are aquatic animals and require water to survive. They cannot live outside of water for an extended period of time.",
    "A \"book\" is a non-living object and does not provide an environment for jellyfish to live in, as it is dry and has no water.",
    "A \"store\" is typically a commercial establishment where goods are sold. It does not provide an aquatic environment, so jellyfish cannot live there.",
    "A \"forest\" consists of land and is populated with trees and plants, but lacks the aquatic environment necessary for jellyfish survival.",
    "A \"lake\" is a body of freshwater surrounded by land. It provides a suitable habitat for jellyfish, depending on the species, since they can live in various types of water bodies.",
    "The \"current\" refers to the flow of water, often in oceans or rivers. While jellyfish can thrive in aquatic currents, it is not a stand-alone habitat; rather, it describes a movement within the water.",
    "From the above reasoning, the only choice that allows for jellyfish survival is the \"lake\" where they can find the water they need."
