  "steps": [
    "The question asks what Billy will be for the next few hours as he goes to sleep.",
    "When a person goes to sleep, they typically enter a state of decreased consciousness and responsiveness to external stimuli.",
    "The term \"not awake\" directly describes the state of a person who is sleeping, as they are not in a state of wakefulness.",
    "\"Loss of consciousness\" can also describe a sleep state, but it is a more general term that may imply a more severe condition than typical sleep.",
    "\"Latency\" refers to a delay or period before something happens, which does not accurately represent Billy's state while he sleeps.",
    "\"Sleep walking\" is a specific phenomenon that occurs during sleep, but it does not apply to all individuals who are asleep.",
    "Among the options, \"not awake\" most accurately describes Billy's state as he sleeps, combining simplicity and directness.",
    "\"Snoring\" is a possible action during sleep, but not all individuals snore, and it does not represent the state of being itself.",
    "Given this analysis, the most appropriate answer is \"not awake\" since it encompasses the general state of sleeping without additional assumptions about other conditions."
