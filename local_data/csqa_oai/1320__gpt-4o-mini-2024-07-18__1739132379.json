  "query": "Question: Jane's baking oven was broken and she was afraid to use it.  She didn't want to burn what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pizza parlor\nB: store\nC: house\nD: pie shop\nE: stove",
  "steps": [
    "First, we recognize that Jane's concern is related to her baking oven being broken. If she uses a faulty oven, she risks ruining her food.",
    "Next, we consider the choices provided. Choices A, B, D, and E refer to establishments or items rather than food items.",
    "Choice A, \"pizza parlor,\" and choice D, \"pie shop,\" are locations that sell baked items but do not directly relate to what Jane might burn in her own oven.",
    "Choice B, \"store,\" typically refers to a retail establishment and not something that would be burnt in the context of baking.",
    "Choice E, \"stove,\" could potentially be burned if used improperly; however, it is not the most relevant to her concern about the baking oven\u2019s function.",
    "The most logical option from the provided choices is \"house,\" which encompasses the idea that a broken oven could lead to a fire that could endanger the whole house.",
    "Since the main concern here seems to be the potential fire hazard and destruction of property, we conclude that Jane was worried about burning her house due to the faulty oven.",
    "After analyzing all options, the final choice that best reflects Jane's concerns is C."
