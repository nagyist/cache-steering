  "query": "Question: James looked for an out of the way spot for his new floor lamp. Where might he have put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: desktop\nC: corner\nD: next to the bed\nE: at hotel",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what \"out of the way spot\" means. It suggests a place where the lamp would not be in the main line of sight or in a busy area.",
    "Next, evaluate each option to see if it aligns with the idea of being discreet or out of the way.",
    "Option A, \"office,\" could potentially be a busy area where the lamp might not be out of the way as it could be used frequently.",
    "Option B, \"desktop,\" implies that the lamp would be directly on a work surface, making it prominent and not \"out of the way.\"",
    "Option C, \"corner,\" suggests a location that is often overlooked and typically considered a less prominent spot for a lamp.",
    "Option D, \"next to the bed,\" while it could be out of the way during the day, it is still close to an area used regularly, especially in the evening.",
    "Option E, \"at hotel,\" does not specify a location within the hotel and is vague compared to the other options.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"corner\" is the best fit for an \"out of the way spot\" for the lamp."
