  "query": "Question: Sally  often went jogging in the morning, but she rode her bike less than one per year.  You could say she did so how often?\n\nChoices:\nA: sometimes\nB: usually\nC: seldom\nD: occasionally\nE: infrequently",
  "steps": [
    "Sally jogs often, which implies a regular activity that she enjoys and does frequently in the mornings.",
    "Conversely, she rides her bike less than once a year. This indicates that biking is a rare occurrence for her.",
    "We need to determine the best word that encapsulates the infrequent nature of her biking activity compared to her jogging routine.",
    "The choices provided include: A - sometimes, B - usually, C - seldom, D - occasionally, E - infrequently.",
    "The term \"sometimes\" (A) suggests a more frequent occurrence than riding less than once a year.",
    "\"Usually\" (B) implies a regular or common practice, which does not fit with her infrequent biking.",
    "\"Seldom\" (C) indicates that something does not happen often, which aligns well with her biking habit described as very rare.",
    "\"Occasionally\" (D) hints at something happening now and then, which could also fit but is slightly less specific than \"seldom.\"",
    "\"Rarely\" (E) implies infrequent but is not one of the options; however, \"infrequently\" could mean less frequent than occasionally but still fits with \"seldom.\"",
    "Between \"seldom,\" \"occasionally,\" and \"infrequently,\" \"seldom\" is the most appropriate word that fits the context of biking less than once per year."
