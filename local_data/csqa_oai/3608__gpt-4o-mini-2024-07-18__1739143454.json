  "query": "Question: If you're moving, the people here will forward your letters for you.\n\nChoices:\nA: envelopes\nB: post office\nC: mailbox\nD: mail box\nE: front door",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what \"the people here\" refers to in the context of forwarding letters.",
    "Next, recognize that letters are typically managed by a specific entity that handles mail.",
    "Consider the options provided: envelopes, post office, mailbox, mail box, and front door.",
    "Analyze each option in relation to the forwarding of letters: \n- \"envelopes\" are just containers for letters, not entities that forward them.\n- \"post office\" is the most likely option as it is the place that manages mail forwarding.\n- \"mailbox\" and \"mail box\" refer to where mail is deposited, not entities that forward mail.\n- \"front door\" is irrelevant as it does not pertain to letter forwarding.",
    "Review the primary duty of a post office, which is to handle mail collection, sorting, and forwarding.",
    "Identify that while \"mailbox\" is related to mail, it doesn't involve the action of forwarding.",
    "Affirm that of all the choices, \"post office\" is the only place that is responsible for forwarding letters as part of service.",
    "Conclude that \"post office\" is the answer based on its role in mail management and forwarding."
