  "query": "Question: I want to make something that I put peanut butter and jelly on; what do I cook?\n\nChoices:\nA: open can\nB: brown meat\nC: add egg\nD: bake bread\nE: smoke salmon",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the objective is to have something on which to put peanut butter and jelly.",
    "Peanut butter and jelly are commonly served on a type of bread, often in a sandwich.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, option A (open can) does not relate to making something for peanut butter and jelly.",
    "Option B (brown meat) is also unrelated to creating a base for peanut butter and jelly.",
    "Option C (add egg) does not apply to making a base for peanut butter and jelly either.",
    "Option E (smoke salmon) is yet another unrelated choice since it involves fish and not a spreadable base.",
    "Option D (bake bread) is relevant because if I bake bread, I would then have a suitable surface to put peanut butter and jelly on.",
    "Thus, among all the choices, baking bread is the only option that directly allows for making something that can hold peanut butter and jelly."
