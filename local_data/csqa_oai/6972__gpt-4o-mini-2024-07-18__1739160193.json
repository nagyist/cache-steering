  "query": "Question: James walked barefoot on a something that was made hot by sunshine. What is he probably walking on?\n\nChoices:\nA: desktop\nB: summer\nC: moon\nD: meadow\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of \"something that was made hot by sunshine.\" This suggests the object in question is typically exposed to sunlight and can retain heat.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option A, \"desktop,\" is typically indoors and does not get hot from sunshine unless left in direct sunlight for an extended period, which is unlikely to be the context here.",
    "Option B, \"summer,\" refers to a season rather than a physical object that can be walked on; therefore, it is not applicable.",
    "Option C, \"moon,\" while it does experience extremes of temperature, is not something one can walk upon in the context of James's situation, as it doesn't involve direct sunlight in a typical terrestrial sense.",
    "Option D, \"meadow,\" is a natural area that could be hot due to sunshine, but typically meadows are grassy and soft underfoot, which may not fully fit the idea of being \"hot.\"",
    "Option E, \"street,\" is a solid surface that can absorb and retain heat from the sun, making it very likely to be hot during sunny weather.",
    "Considering the possibilities, the most logical option that aligns with the scenario of walking barefoot on something made hot by sunshine is the street, as it is both tangible and likely to become very hot under direct sunlight."
