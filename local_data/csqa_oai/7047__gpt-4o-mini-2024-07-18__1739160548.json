    "Elephants are large mammals belonging to the family Elephantidae.",
    "There are two main species of elephants: the African elephant and the Asian elephant.",
    "The African elephant is primarily found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "The Asian elephant can be found in various parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia.",
    "The question asks about the origin of elephants in general, and both species must be considered.",
    "Given that the African elephant is native to Africa, this continent is a significant origin for elephant species.",
    "The Asian elephant being native to India also suggests that this region is part of the elephants' origin.",
    "However, \"origin\" typically refers to where the species first appeared or became distinct, which includes Africa for the lineage of extant elephants.",
    "Comparing the provided options, we have Africa and India referenced, but the term 'origin' can imply where species first evolved broadly.",
    "Evaluating the choices, Africa is directly associated with the African elephant, considered one of the primary locations of the modern elephant lineage."
