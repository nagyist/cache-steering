  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what one takes fish off of when fishing.",
    "When fishing, a person typically uses a fishing line to catch fish.",
    "Once a fish is caught, it is removed from the fishing hook, which is attached to the end of the fishing line.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"end of line\" refers specifically to the fishing line where the hook would be located.",
    "Other options such as \"ocean,\" \"pet shop,\" \"boat,\" and \"pond\" do not describe an object from which one would take a fish off.",
    "Thus, \"end of line\" is the most accurate choice relating to where fish are taken off from when fishing."
