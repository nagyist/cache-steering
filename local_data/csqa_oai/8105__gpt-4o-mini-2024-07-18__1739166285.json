  "steps": [
    "To determine where captured elephants live, we first consider what it means for an elephant to be captured. Captured elephants are often removed from their natural habitat to be placed in controlled environments.",
    "We can evaluate each option based on common practices for animals, particularly elephants, which require significant space and specific environments.",
    "Option A: \"city\" does not typically serve as a habitat forCaptured elephants. Cities are not designed for housing such large animals.",
    "Option B: \"circus\" is a possible environment for captured elephants, as they are sometimes used in performances. However, it is not a permanent or ideal habitat for their well-being.",
    "Option C: \"zoo\" is a more appropriate choice, as zoos are specifically created to house a variety of animals, including elephants, and aim to provide better living conditions than a circus.",
    "Option D: \"weight 1000 kilos\" does not relate to a habitat or living condition and is an irrelevant choice in this context.",
    "Option E: \"africa\" refers to their natural habitat but does not apply to captured elephants, as those are no longer living in their native land.",
    "Having compared all options, it seems that the most fitting answer that represents a common living situation for captured elephants is option C, as zoos have facilities and care for such animals."
