  "query": "Question: Where does a hat go when you wear it?\n\nChoices:\nA: head\nB: leg\nC: suitcase\nD: closet\nE: shelf",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a hat goes when you wear it, we need to consider the purpose of a hat and where it is positioned on the body.",
    "A hat is typically an accessory that is designed to be worn on the body, specifically to cover the head, provide warmth, or serve a fashion purpose.",
    "Next, we review the options provided: \nA: head - the place on the body where a hat would be worn.\nB: leg - this is not a typical location for wearing a hat.\nC: suitcase - a suitcase is used for carrying items, not for wearing.\nD: closet - a closet is a place where you might store a hat when it\u2019s not in use.\nE: shelf - a shelf can also be used for storage, but again, not for wearing.",
    "From this analysis, the only logical choice for where a hat goes when worn is the head.",
    "Since option A refers specifically to the head, it directly aligns with the question about where a hat is worn.",
    "The other options either refer to storage locations or body parts that do not relate to wearing a hat."
