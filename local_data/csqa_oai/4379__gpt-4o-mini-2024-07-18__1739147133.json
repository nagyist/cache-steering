  "query": "Question: The interior designer didn't like the office just yet, so she tried putting a colorful rug under the computer what?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: sofa\nC: desk\nD: bedroom\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the designer is trying to improve the office space, which is typically a work environment. The context points to common furniture items found in an office.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"bedroom\" (D) and \"living room\" (E) are more associated with residential spaces, not offices.",
    "Next, I need to consider the remaining options: \"table,\" \"sofa,\" and \"desk.\" While both a table and a desk are common in offices, \"sofa\" is less typical in a standard office setup.",
    "The term \"desk\" (C) is more specific to a workspace and is often where a computer would be located. Therefore, it makes the most sense to place the rug under the desk in an office context.",
    "A \"table\" (A) could also fit, but it is less common for computers to be placed on a standard table. Desks are designed specifically for that purpose.",
    "Since the context directly relates to an office environment and the specific placement of a computer, \"desk\" is the most logical answer."
