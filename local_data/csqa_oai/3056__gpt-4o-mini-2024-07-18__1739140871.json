  "query": "Question: What would be built on a foundation of rock?\n\nChoices:\nA: pillars\nB: mountains\nC: bridge\nD: mountain range\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what could be built on a foundation of rock, we first need to understand the characteristics and stability of a rock foundation.",
    "A foundation of rock is often stable, durable, and provides strong support for various structures.",
    "Now, let\u2019s analyze the choices provided. Choice A, \"pillars,\" can be built on a foundation of rock, but they usually support something rather than being a standalone structure.",
    "Choice B, \"mountains,\" are natural formations that don\u2019t require a constructed foundation, so this does not fit the concept of being built.",
    "Choice C, \"bridge,\" typically requires a stable foundation, and rock is one of the best materials to support the heavy loads a bridge must bear.",
    "Choice D, \"mountain range,\" similar to mountains, is a geographical feature formed over time and not built in a conventional sense.",
    "Choice E, \"surface of earth,\" is more of a description of a geographical state rather than something that can be built upon.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only one that aligns with the idea of being built on a rock foundation is a bridge, as it requires strong support for construction.",
    "I can confirm that from an engineering perspective, bridges are commonly built on rocks or stable geological formations to ensure safety and stability."
