  "steps": [
    "Consider the natural movements of a frog on land compared to in water.",
    "Frogs are primarily known for their jumping and leaping abilities.",
    "Walking is not a common method of locomotion for frogs; they typically use their strong hind legs.",
    "Swimming is not applicable as the scenario specifies travel on land.",
    "The terms \"hop\" and \"leap\" are often used interchangeably when describing a frog's movement.",
    "\"Jump\" could also describe a frog's movement but may imply larger distances than the phrase \"short distance.\"",
    "Considering \"hop\" and \"leap\" more closely, \"hop\" generally refers to smaller, quick movements, while \"leap\" often implies a larger or more powerful jump.",
    "Since the question specifies a \"short distance,\" \"hop\" fits best as it suggests a shorter, more controlled movement as opposed to \"leap.\"",
    "Reviewing the options, \"hop\" clearly aligns with the typical movement of a frog over a short distance on land."
