  "query": "Question: While some people prefer to lie, others do prefer to bluntly what?\n\nChoices:\nA: amount to nothing\nB: talk louder\nC: talking loudly\nD: talk to each other\nE: state facts",
  "steps": [
    "The question contrasts two types of behavior: one involving lying and the other involving a preference that stands in contrast to lying.",
    "Looking for a word that makes sense with \"bluntly,\" I need to find an action that aligns with honesty or straightforwardness, unlike lying.",
    "The word \"state\" implies giving information clearly and truthfully, which fits well with someone who prefers honesty over deceit.",
    "Examining the options, I note that \"state facts\" (Choice E) matches the context of being straightforward and honest; it emphasizes giving concrete information.",
    "The other choices either change the meaning (like \"talk louder\" or \"talking loudly\"), do not fit the context (like \"amount to nothing\" or \"talk to each other\"), or are not directly related to honesty.",
    "Since \"state facts\" is the only option that explicitly aligns with the idea of being direct and truthful, it becomes the most logical choice.",
    "I will also double-check the remaining options to ensure there are no other valid considerations.",
    "The other options either imply a misunderstanding of bluntness or do not resonate with straightforwardness; thus confirming my reasoning about \"state facts.\""
