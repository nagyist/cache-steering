  "query": "Question: Where would a towel be kept in a gym?\n\nChoices:\nA: locker room\nB: in the showers\nC: linen closet\nD: swimming pool\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary locations in a gym where towels might commonly be found.",
    "The locker room is a common place for gym-goers to change, and towels are often kept there for convenience after taking a shower.",
    "The showers themselves may also have towels available; however, they are typically not stored there long-term.",
    "A linen closet could also be a possibility, as it is a storage space, but it may not be directly accessible to all gym members.",
    "The swimming pool area might have towels for swimmers, but they are not the primary storage place for towels used by all gym members.",
    "A cupboard could serve as a storage location, but it is less common than designated areas like a locker room or linen closet.",
    "After weighing the common practice, the locker room stands out as a dedicated area where towels are readily available for use before and after workouts.",
    "While some other locations can store towels, the locker room is most commonly associated with towel access in a gym setting.",
    "Thus, the most likely answer, considering typical gym layout and usage, is the locker room."
