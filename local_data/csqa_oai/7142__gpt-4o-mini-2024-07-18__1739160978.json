  "query": "Question: antarctic ocean is named after a continent.  What's another ocean that's named after a landmass?\n\nChoices:\nA: antarctic\nB: atlantic\nC: pacific\nD: indian ocean\nE: pacific",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an ocean that is named after a landmass, similar to how the Antarctic Ocean is named after the continent of Antarctica.",
    "First, let's analyze the name \"Antarctic Ocean.\" It is derived from Antarctica, which is a landmass (the continent).",
    "Now, let's evaluate each of the options provided for another ocean named after a landmass.",
    "Option A: Antarctic Ocean - This is the one we started with, reinforcing the example but not providing a new answer.",
    "Option B: Atlantic Ocean - The name \"Atlantic\" derives from the mythological landmass of Atlantis, however, it can also be associated with its geographical context relating to landmasses in Europe and America.",
    "Option C: Pacific Ocean - The name \"Pacific\" means peaceful, and it is not named after a specific landmass directly.",
    "Option D: Indian Ocean - This ocean is named after the Indian subcontinent, which makes it a strong candidate for being named after a landmass.",
    "Option E: Pacific (again) - This is just a repeated option which would not be valid as a new answer.",
    "From the evaluations, the \"Indian Ocean\" is clearly named after the Indian subcontinent, making it another ocean like the Antarctic Ocean that is named after a landmass."
