    "The question asks about the emotions authors experience when they reach a certain milestone in their writing process.",
    "Relief and happiness are typically associated with completing a significant task or finishing a project rather than starting or writing in general.",
    "Completing a piece of writing signifies an important achievement for authors, which aligns with the emotions of relief and happiness mentioned in the question.",
    "The option \"complete writing\" (choice A) directly correlates with the act of finishing a writing task, making it a strong candidate.",
    "The other options (B, C, D, E) focus on various stages or forms of writing that do not necessarily indicate completion, thus likely resulting in different emotional responses.",
    "\"Write books\" (choice B) implies creating books but does not suggest the finality needed for the emotions of relief or happiness.",
    "\"Word passage\" (choice C) is vague and does not pertain to the act of completing a significant writing endeavor.",
    "\"Start book\" (choice D) implies the beginning of a project, which is usually accompanied by anxiety rather than relief or happiness upon completion.",
    "\"Write poems\" (choice E) similarly refers to the act of creation but does not encapsulate the completion aspect that leads to the mentioned emotions.",
    "Given the analysis, the only option that aligns perfectly with the context of the question is \"complete writing\" (choice A)."
