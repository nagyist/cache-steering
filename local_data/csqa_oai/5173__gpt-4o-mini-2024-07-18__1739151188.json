  "query": "Question: Where do passengers typically wait?\n\nChoices:\nA: vehicle\nB: bus depot\nC: bus\nD: car\nE: train station",
  "steps": [
    "Passengers typically wait in locations designed for public transportation or travel.",
    "A vehicle, like a car, is usually not a waiting area but a means of transport.",
    "A bus is also a means of transport where passengers do not wait; they travel inside it.",
    "A bus depot is a location related to buses but is more for the operations than for waiting.",
    "A train station is a designated area for waiting for trains and is commonly associated with travel.",
    "However, a train station is specifically for trains, and the question refers to locations for passengers in a broader sense.",
    "Both bus depots and train stations serve as specific waiting areas for public transport but I need to identify more generalized options.",
    "Since passengers wait at a vehicle loading and unloading area, that could include both bus depots and train stations.",
    "Comparing the choices, bus depot and train station stand out as dedicated waiting locations; yet bus depot serves only bus passengers.",
    "Thus, the answer should focus on the most common waiting areas for passengers across various modes of transportation."
