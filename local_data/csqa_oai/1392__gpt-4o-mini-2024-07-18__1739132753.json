  "query": "Question: The teenagers were celebrating irresponsibly, what were they doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: drinking\nB: lude behavior\nC: happiness\nD: intimacy\nE: enjoyment",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"celebrating irresponsibly\" suggests that their actions were likely risky or inappropriate in some way.",
    "Among the choices given, \"drinking\" (A) is often associated with irresponsible celebration, especially among teenagers.",
    "\"Lude behavior\" (B) can also imply irresponsibility but is more vague and doesn\u2019t specify an activity.",
    "\"Happiness\" (C) is a feeling, but it does not directly relate to the actions of celebrating irresponsibly.",
    "\"Intimacy\" (D) can be a part of celebration but is not inherently irresponsible; it depends on the context.",
    "\"Enjoyment\" (E) like happiness, is a feeling that does not indicate a specific irresponsible action either.",
    "Considering the context in which teenagers might celebrate irresponsibly, \"drinking\" stands out as the most likely activity.",
    "To further analyze, \"lude behavior\" could also align with irresponsible actions, but it is much broader and less focused than drinking.",
    "In the context of typical teenage celebrations, \"drinking\" is a common risky behavior, making it the strongest choice."
