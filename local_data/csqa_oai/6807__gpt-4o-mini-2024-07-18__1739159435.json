  "query": "Question: What part of a property may be next to a driveway?\n\nChoices:\nA: yard\nB: neighborhood\nC: driving car on\nD: subdivision\nE: suburb",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what might be adjacent to a driveway on a property.",
    "A driveway is typically associated with a residential property where vehicles are parked or accessed.",
    "The term \"yard\" generally refers to the area around a house, which often includes lawn or garden space.",
    "In most cases, a yard is directly next to a driveway, as it is usually the space in front or beside the house.",
    "The other options, \"neighborhood,\" \"driving car on,\" \"subdivision,\" and \"suburb,\" refer to broader concepts or areas rather than specific features of a property.",
    "\"Neighborhood\" and \"suburb\" relate to locations that contain multiple properties and do not specify what is directly next to a driveway.",
    "\"Driving car on\" refers to an action rather than a physical space adjacent to a driveway.",
    "\"Subdivision\" usually refers to a planned development of multiple houses and does not pertain to a singular property element next to a driveway.",
    "Considering the context and typical layout of properties, a yard is the most logical answer."
