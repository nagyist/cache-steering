  "query": "Question: What is likely the result of remembering a deceased friend?\n\nChoices:\nA: problems\nB: inspiration\nC: crying\nD: knowledge\nE: trauma",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the emotional responses people typically have when they remember a deceased friend. Memories can evoke a range of emotions including sadness, comfort, nostalgia, or inspiration.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices: \n- Option A (problems) could relate to unresolved issues or grief but is not a universal response.\n- Option B (inspiration) could occur if the individual reflects positively on the friend's qualities or achievements.\n- Option C (crying) is often associated with grief and sorrow when remembering a lost friend.\n- Option D (knowledge) seems less relevant; while remembering someone might lead to reflections that impart understanding, it is not a direct emotional response.\n- Option E (trauma) may apply if the loss was particularly traumatic, but not all memories trigger this response.",
    "Considering the context of friendship and loss, many individuals do experience crying or a strong emotional reaction when they remember a deceased friend, often indicative of the bond they shared.",
    "While some might find inspiration in such memories, crying aligns more closely with the immediate emotional response commonly felt at the recollection of loss.",
    "Based on this analysis, we can conclude that crying is a frequent response when remembering a deceased friend, as it encapsulates the sadness and longing associated with the grief."
