  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what types of stoves are commonly available in kitchens or for cooking purposes.",
    "Stoves typically fall into distinct categories based on their fuel source or heating method.",
    "The most common types of stoves that come to mind are gas stoves and electric stoves.",
    "Gas stoves use natural gas or propane as the fuel source, which allows for quick heating and precise temperature control.",
    "Electric stoves use electricity to generate heat through coils or induction technology, providing another efficient cooking method.",
    "Next, I will examine the given answer choices to see which one correlates with the defined types of stoves.",
    "Choice A mentions that the two options are irrelevant, which does not pertain to stove types.",
    "Choice B talks about a warm pot of beans, which is not a type of stove.",
    "Choice C mentions brown meat, which also does not describe a stove type.",
    "Choice D refers to a warm room, which again is irrelevant to stoves.",
    "Choice E clearly states \"gas or electric,\" which directly aligns with the recognized types of stoves."
