  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze what a bike generally refers to. A bike usually implies a two-wheeled vehicle, which can be powered by human effort or an engine.",
    "Next, I will review the options provided. A lawnmower (A) is primarily a yard maintenance tool and does not fit the 'bike' category. An automobile (B) and car (C), while they have engines, are typically not referred to as bikes.",
    "Now I will consider the remaining options: D (bicycle) and E (motorcycle). A bicycle is human-powered and does not have an engine.",
    "On the other hand, a motorcycle is a two-wheeled vehicle that is powered by an engine. Therefore, it fits the criteria of having an engine.",
    "Conclusively, from the analysis of all options, E (motorcycle) is the only type of bike among the options that has an engine."
