  "query": "Question: I only like fiction books, why should I read a non-fiction book?\n\nChoices:\nA: knowledge\nB: been printed new\nC: many words\nD: for fun\nE: cover",
  "steps": [
    "I start by considering the primary purpose of reading non-fiction books. They are typically designed to educate or inform the reader about real-life topics, events, or ideas.",
    "Although I prefer fiction, reading non-fiction can enhance my understanding of the world and provide factual knowledge that might enrich my perspective.",
    "Knowledge gained from non-fiction can be applied in various areas of life, helping with personal growth and informed decision-making.",
    "Next, I analyze the answer choices. \"Knowledge\" (A) seems to align well with the benefits of reading non-fiction.",
    "I also consider other options like \"been printed new\" (B) and \"many words\" (C), but they do not capture the essential reason for reading.",
    "\"For fun\" (D) might apply to some non-fiction books, but it is primarily associated with fiction. Most non-fiction is not inherently meant for entertainment.",
    "Lastly, \"cover\" (E) does not provide a compelling reason to read non-fiction either. It refers to the physical aspect rather than content value.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all reasons, the most significant purpose of reading a non-fiction book, even if I like fiction, is to gain knowledge."
