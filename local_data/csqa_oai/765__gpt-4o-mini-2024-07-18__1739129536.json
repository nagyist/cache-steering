  "query": "Question: He curled up and tried to fall on his shoulder so his arm or what wouldn't take the hit?\n\nChoices:\nA: leg\nB: garment\nC: torso\nD: body\nE: road",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"fall on his shoulder\" implies that the shoulder is part of a larger body part that the person would prefer to land on instead of another part.",
    "The use of the word \"hit\" suggests that the landing would involve some impact or force that he wants to avoid transferring to other body parts.",
    "Considering the body structure, when falling, the shoulder is part of the torso.",
    "The choice of \"arm\" in the sentence indicates that the person is trying to avoid putting pressure on the arm during the fall.",
    "If the shoulder contacts the ground, it likely relates to the torso since the shoulder is supported by muscles and bones within the torso region.",
    "The term \"body\" could be another possibility, but it is too general compared to \"torso\", which has a more specific anatomical context.",
    "Reviewing the remaining options, \"leg,\" \"garment,\" and \"road\" do not align with the anatomical context or the intent behind the action described.",
    "Therefore, based on the context of falling and the impact considerations, the correct body part to avoid the hit following the shoulder is indeed the torso."
