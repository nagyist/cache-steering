  "steps": [
    "When something is broken, the first instinct is to figure out what went wrong.",
    "The term \"wrong\" (Option B) indicates something is not correct, but it does not specify that there is a need for a resolution or understanding.",
    "The term \"question\" (Option A) implies seeking information, however, it doesn't directly relate to the issue of being broken.",
    "\"Swear\" (Option D) does not contribute to a solution; it's more of a reaction to frustration rather than an answer-seeking term.",
    "\"Confusion\" (Option E) suggests an unclear situation but again does not imply an immediate need to solve the situation of something being broken.",
    "\"Problem\" (Option C) effectively encapsulates the situation; when something is broken, one is indeed trying to understand and resolve the problem causing the breakage.",
    "Therefore, among all options, \"problem\" specifically addresses the action of identifying and resolving issues when something is broken."
