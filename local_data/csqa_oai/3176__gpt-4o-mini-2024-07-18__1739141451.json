  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a low area between mountains where an apple tree can typically be found.",
    "A valley is defined as an elongated low area between hills or mountains, typically with a river or stream running through it.",
    "Apple trees are known to grow well in fertile soil and in locations that receive adequate sunlight, both of which can be found in valleys.",
    "I will evaluate each option: \n- Option A (valley) fits the description of a low area.\n- Option B (Washington State) is a geographic region but does not specify a low area.\n- Option C (open) is too broad and does not specifically refer to a location between mountains.\n- Option D (countryside) is a general term and does not indicate a specific low area.\n- Option E (fields) could be low areas but does not specifically refer to being between mountains.",
    "Given this analysis, option A (valley) is the most appropriate choice as it specifically identifies a low area where apple trees are commonly found."
