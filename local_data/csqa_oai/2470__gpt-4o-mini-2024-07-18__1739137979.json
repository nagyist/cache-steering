  "steps": [
    "To determine where building is likely to be rapid, I need to consider the context of construction and development.",
    "Urban areas generally experience higher rates of growth and demand for new structures due to population density and economic activity.",
    "Building in a home is usually a slower process, as it involves individual homeowners and often requires permits, zoning, and personal financing.",
    "Towns can have building projects, but their pace is usually slower than urban areas due to less demand and smaller populations.",
    "Rooms are not considered a location for building but rather individual parts of a structure, so they are not relevant for this question.",
    "Offices can rapidly undergo construction or refurbishment, particularly in urban settings, but it is usually just a segment of broader urban development.",
    "Comparing all choices, urban areas are generally characterized by the most significant construction velocity due to their economic activities and infrastructure needs.",
    "None of the other choices (home, town, rooms, office) can compete with urban areas in terms of the speed and scale of building."
