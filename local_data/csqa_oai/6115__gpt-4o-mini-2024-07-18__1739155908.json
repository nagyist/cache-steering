  "query": "Question: Where would you put the end of a steel cable if you want to use it as a lightningrod?\n\nChoices:\nA: ship\nB: building\nC: in the air\nD: ground\nE: suspension bridge",
  "steps": [
    "To effectively act as a lightning rod, a steel cable needs to provide a path for the electrical discharge to reach the ground safely.",
    "Lightning rods are typically installed at the highest points of structures to attract lightning strikes and direct the energy safely into the earth.",
    "Considering that the cable needs to be connected to the ground, placing it in the air by itself would not be effective without a grounding mechanism.",
    "A ship is mobile and may not effectively stabilize the lightning discharge, thus it wouldn't be the best choice for a lightning rod.",
    "A suspension bridge has high points which could attract lightning; however, the end of the cable must still be grounded, which connects it to the earth.",
    "Placing the cable in a building may attract lightning, but again, the cable would need to be grounded properly to serve its function.",
    "Ultimately, the ideal place for the end of the cable should be where it can safely transfer the lightning discharge to the ground, minimizing risk.",
    "Therefore, connecting the end of the steel cable directly to the ground provides the safest and most effective way to use it as a lightning rod."
