  "query": "Question: Billy needed his hammer, so he looked where?\n\nChoices:\nA: hardware store\nB: toolbelt\nC: repair shop\nD: backpack\nE: tool box",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which indicates that Billy needed his hammer. A hammer is typically a tool that one would use for construction or repair work.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided answer choices for their relevance to where a hammer might be found.",
    "Choice A, \"hardware store,\" is a potential place to buy a hammer, but since Billy already needs a hammer, it's less likely he would look there.",
    "Choice B, \"toolbelt,\" is also a possibility, especially if he is actively working and might carry a hammer on his belt. However, typically, a hammer wouldn\u2019t be stored in a toolbelt.",
    "Choice C, \"repair shop,\" suggests a place where repairs are conducted and tools might be available, but it\u2019s not a common place for Billy to keep his personal hammer.",
    "Choice D, \"backpack,\" is less practical for carrying a hammer, as backpacks are often used for lighter items.",
    "Choice E, \"tool box,\" is very relevant, as a tool box is specifically designed to store tools, including a hammer.",
    "Based on the evaluation above, the most logical place for Billy to look for his hammer is the tool box, as it is customary to store tools there."
