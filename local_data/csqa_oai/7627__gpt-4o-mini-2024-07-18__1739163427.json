  "query": "Question: There was a bacteria scare, so bleach was added to the well what?\n\nChoices:\nA: water\nB: septic tank\nC: petri dish\nD: leg\nE: ground",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question mentions a bacteria scare, which suggests that there was a concern regarding contamination, typically found in water sources such as wells.",
    "Bleach is commonly used as a disinfectant and is often added to water sources to kill bacteria and make the water safe for consumption.",
    "The most logical location for adding bleach in response to a bacteria scare would be a water source, specifically a well, to purify the water.",
    "The other options presented\u2014septic tank, petri dish, leg, and ground\u2014do not relate to the context of treating a water source for bacteria.",
    "A septic tank may contain wastewater, but it is not the immediate concern in a bacterial scare related to drinking water from a well.",
    "A petri dish is typically used in laboratory settings for cultivating bacteria, and it is not relevant in the context of addressing a bacteria scare in a well.",
    "The mention of \"leg\" does not relate to the treatment of water or bacteria; it is unrelated.",
    "The ground could be associated with contamination but not specifically as a target for adding bleach in response to a well contamination issue.",
    "Given all the reasoning above, the most direct and relevant answer to the question of what bleach was added to in response to a bacteria scare is the water in the well."
