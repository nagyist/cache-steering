  "query": "Question: Where do you get your teeth drill?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: army\nC: basement\nD: dentist office\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to establish what kind of drilling involves teeth. This would usually refer to dental procedures.",
    "In dental practice, a drill is a common tool used by dentists to remove decay and prepare a tooth for filling.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided. A garage typically refers to a place for vehicles, not dental procedures.",
    "The army does not provide dental services as a main function; this choice is also irrelevant for dental drilling.",
    "A basement is a type of room or space that does not specifically relate to dental care or drilling.",
    "A repair shop usually pertains to mechanical or other types of repairs, not dental services.",
    "Therefore, the most logical choice based on the context of drilling teeth is a dentist office, as that is where dental procedures occur.",
    "None of the other options relate to the dental profession directly or provide dental tools or services.",
    "Thus, the choice that directly addresses where one could \"get your teeth drill\" is a dentist office."
