  "query": "Question: Why do you need faith in religion?\n\nChoices:\nA: unknowable\nB: confusing\nC: wars\nD: both positive and negative\nE: afterlife",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the reason why faith is necessary in religion, so I need to consider what role faith plays in religious belief systems.",
    "Faith in religion often fills the gaps of knowledge about ultimate truths, such as the nature of existence, the universe, and divine entities \u2014 things that may be beyond human understanding.",
    "Option A, \"unknowable,\" reflects this aspect where faith is needed in areas that are not empirically provable.",
    "Option B, \"confusing,\" suggests that religions can be complex and their teachings may not always be straightforward, but it doesn\u2019t address why faith is specifically needed.",
    "Option C, \"wars,\" points to historical conflicts often associated with differing religious beliefs, but this statement does not explain the necessity of faith.",
    "Option D, \"both positive and negative,\" implies that faith can lead to both beneficial and harmful outcomes in societies, but it still does not clarify why faith is essential in religion.",
    "Option E, \"afterlife,\" indicates that many religions focus on the belief in an afterlife, a concept where faith is certainly required, as one cannot empirically prove such a state.",
    "Among the options, A and E closely relate to the need for faith. However, A (unknowable) encapsulates the broader necessity of faith in believing in aspects that cannot be scientifically proven, which is fundamental to all religions.",
    "Thus, while faith relates to concepts of the afterlife, the term \"unknowable\" encompasses a wider range of reasons for faith in religion, including the mysteries of existence and divine intention."
