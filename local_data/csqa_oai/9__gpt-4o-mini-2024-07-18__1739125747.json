  "query": "Question: Where is a business restaurant likely to be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: at hotel\nC: mall\nD: business sector\nE: yellow pages",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a business restaurant, which typically caters to professionals and groups seeking meals during work hours or business meetings.",
    "Next, evaluate the traditional locations where such restaurants are found, such as busy business districts or areas frequented by corporate employees.",
    "Now, assess each option provided: Option A (town) is too broad; while a business restaurant could be in a town, it does not specifically indicate a business-centric location.",
    "For option B (at hotel), while it is possible for business restaurants to exist in hotels, hotels serve a broader clientele and may not be specifically focused on business patrons alone.",
    "Next, consider option C (mall). Although there are restaurants in malls, they are generally geared towards shoppers and families rather than strictly business clients.",
    "Moving on to option D (business sector), this specifically suggests areas where a substantial number of businesses operate, which aligns well with the target audience of a business restaurant.",
    "Lastly, review option E (yellow pages), which is merely a directory and does not represent a physical location.",
    "Assessing all options, option D (business sector) stands out as the most logical answer because it directly addresses the needs and location of a business restaurant."
