  "query": "Question: If I'm on the water after an earthquake, what should I be on the look out for?\n\nChoices:\nA: steam room\nB: debris\nC: crushed ice\nD: ocean\nE: tidal waves",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates a scenario involving being on water after an earthquake, suggesting a need for awareness of potential hazards.",
    "After an earthquake, the area may experience disruptions that can lead to dangerous conditions in water bodies.",
    "Tidal waves, also known as tsunamis, are a common consequence of underwater earthquakes, making them a significant concern for anyone on the water post-earthquake.",
    "Although debris can also be a concern, it is more specific to the areas near land or in shallow waters. The question describes being on water, so debris isn't the primary focus.",
    "Steam rooms, crushed ice, and the ocean do not directly correlate with common hazards resulting from an earthquake in a marine environment.",
    "Given that tidal waves are closely associated with seismic activity, they are a critical hazard to watch out for when on water after an earthquake.",
    "While other options are less relevant, it's important to distinctly recognize the immediate threat posed by tidal waves in the aftermath of an earthquake at sea.",
    "Thus, the most logical option from the provided choices that matches the scenario described (being on water after an earthquake) is E, meaning tidal waves."
