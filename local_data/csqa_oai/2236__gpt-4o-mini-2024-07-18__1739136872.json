  "query": "Question: Where is a beam likely to be created?\n\nChoices:\nA: ceiling\nB: large building\nC: warehouse\nD: construction site\nE: train station",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what a \"beam\" typically refers to in construction and architecture. A beam is usually a structural element that helps support loads across distances.",
    "Next, I consider the context where beams are commonly created or constructed. Beams can be made in multiple places, but certain settings are more likely than others.",
    "I assess option A: \"ceiling\". While beams can be part of ceilings, they are usually not created there; rather, they are installed.",
    "Next, I analyze option B: \"large building\". Large buildings may contain many beams but are usually constructed using beams rather than being a location where they are created.",
    "Now, I examine option C: \"warehouse\". A warehouse might store beams or materials for beams, but it's not a primary place for their creation.",
    "Then, I look at option D: \"construction site\". Construction sites are active places where new structures are built, including the fabrication and installation of beams.",
    "I consider option E: \"train station\". Like large buildings, train stations consist of beams but do not represent an area focused on the creation of beams.",
    "From my analysis, the best option is D: \"construction site\". This is where the actual creation or assembly of beams usually happens.",
    "To confirm, I think about the processes involved in creating structural beams, which typically occur at construction sites or factories designed for that purpose."
