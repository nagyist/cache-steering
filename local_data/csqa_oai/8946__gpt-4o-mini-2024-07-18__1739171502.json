  "query": "Question: Sarah wants to eat lunch.  To do this she'll have to go to her kitchen and do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: smell\nB: have food\nC: get food\nD: hungry\nE: buy food",
  "steps": [
    "First, Sarah wants to eat lunch, which implies she needs to have something to consume.",
    "To eat lunch, Sarah must have food available to eat.",
    "She needs to go to her kitchen, which is where she typically prepares or obtains food.",
    "The choices presented include options related to her food situation: smelling, having, getting, being hungry, or buying food.",
    "Smelling food (A) does not directly contribute to her eating lunch; it is more an action related to food rather than obtaining it.",
    "Having food (B) suggests she might already possess food, but it does not indicate the action she must take in the kitchen.",
    "Getting food (C) is an active step indicating that she intends to retrieve food from her kitchen to prepare her lunch.",
    "Being hungry (D) is a state that explains why she wants to eat lunch but does not require any action in the kitchen.",
    "Buying food (E) implies she needs to purchase food, which is not necessarily what she must do if she\u2019s already in the kitchen and has access to food.",
    "Among all the options, \"get food\" (C) represents the direct action Sarah must undertake in her kitchen to satisfy her desire for lunch."
