  "query": "Question: The mother knew her children to be messy, so she always kept extra kleenex in her what?\n\nChoices:\nA: blow nose\nB: box\nC: wipe nose\nD: purse\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to interpret the question. The mother is aware that her children are messy, and she keeps extra kleenex for them.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll consider the purpose of kleenex. It is commonly used for wiping noses and cleaning up messes.",
    "Now, I\u2019ll analyze the options given. The question asks where the mother keeps the extra kleenex.",
    "Option A: \"blow nose\" doesn\u2019t make sense as a storage area; it refers to the action done with kleenex.",
    "Option B: \"box\" could be a reasonable place to store kleenex; people often keep tissues in boxes.",
    "Option C: \"wipe nose\" also describes an action, not a storage area.",
    "Option D: \"purse\" is a common place for carrying items, including kleenex, especially for a mother with messy children.",
    "Option E: \"pocket\" is another possible storage area, but it\u2019s less common to keep kleenex there compared to a purse.",
    "Now, I need to make a choice based on the most logical option. A box is not typically carried around, while a purse can conveniently hold extra kleenex and be used by a mother.",
    "Considering that she is always prepared for her children\u2019s messiness, the most suitable option would be the purse."
