  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an activity that a child can do to quietly pass the time.",
    "We need to evaluate each option in terms of quietness and suitability for a child's activity.",
    "Option A, \"brood,\" suggests being deep in thought or sulking, which is not a constructive or quiet activity.",
    "Option B, \"read book,\" is a quiet activity that children can engage in. Reading is generally accepted as a peaceful way to pass the time.",
    "Option C, \"become adult,\" is not an activity but rather a transformation that is impossible to achieve at will, especially in the context of time-passing activities.",
    "Option D, \"ask questions,\" while it can be done quietly, often leads to more engagement and interaction, which may not be considered as quietly passing time.",
    "Option E, \"clean room,\" while quiet, may not be appealing or engaging for a child and is more of a chore than a pastime.",
    "Considering these evaluations, the most appropriate option for a child to quietly pass the time is \"read book.\""
