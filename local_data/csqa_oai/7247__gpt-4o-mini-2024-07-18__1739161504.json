  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that John didn't use double spaces or line breaks in his writing.",
    "Double spacing and line breaks are typically used to visually separate text, making it easier to read.",
    "Given the options provided (sentence, paragraph, box, suitcase, ears), we need to determine which item relies on these formatting techniques for clarity.",
    "\"Sentence\" refers to a grammatical structure, so it is not typically separated using line breaks, but rather by punctuation.",
    "\"Paragraph\" consists of multiple sentences and is often separated by blank lines or indentation for clearer readability.",
    "\"Box,\" \"suitcase,\" and \"ears\" do not relate to text formatting or readability issues.",
    "Since John\u2019s lack of formatting would most likely obscure the separation of larger blocks of text, \"paragraph\" is the most logical choice.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that the absence of double spaces and line breaks made it impossible to make out the breaks between his paragraphs."
