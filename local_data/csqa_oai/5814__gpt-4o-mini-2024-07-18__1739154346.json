  "query": "Question: James crushed his paper coffee cup and then left it in its proper place.  Where might he have left it?\n\nChoices:\nA: coffee\nB: desk\nC: starbucks\nD: cupboard\nE: trash",
  "steps": [
    "James crushed his paper coffee cup, indicating it was no longer in a usable state.",
    "Since it is common to crush a used coffee cup, it points towards it being an empty cup rather than a full one.",
    "The phrase \"left it in its proper place\" suggests he disposed of it correctly.",
    "For paper coffee cups, the likely \"proper place\" for disposal is a trash bin.",
    "Choices A (coffee) and B (desk) do not make sense for a used coffee cup that has been crushed, as they imply keeping the cup rather than disposing of it.",
    "Choice C (Starbucks) would not be appropriate as it implies leaving the cup at its original point of purchase rather than disposing of it.",
    "Choice D (cupboard) does not align with the act of crushing a used cup, as you wouldn\u2019t store a used cup in a cupboard.",
    "Thus, the only option that fits the situation of disposing of a crushed coffee cup is E (trash)."
