  "query": "Question: A small dog will do well in what competition?\n\nChoices:\nA: basket\nB: dog show\nC: triathalon\nD: animal shelter\nE: own home",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the nature of the competition options provided: basket, dog show, triathlon, animal shelter, and own home.",
    "Next, I should analyze what type of competition would be suitable for a small dog. Small dogs often excel in competitions that showcase their appearance, behavior, or training, rather than physical endurance.",
    "Looking at the options, \"dog show\" stands out because it is specifically designed for dogs and evaluates them based on breed standards, grooming, and performance.",
    "Options like \"triathlon\" do not suit small dogs as these events typically require endurance and physical ability that small dogs may lack compared to larger breeds.",
    "\"Basket\" does not make sense as a competition for a dog. It has no relevance to dog training or competitions.",
    "The option \"animal shelter\" is not a competition; rather, it is a place for housing animals. While a small dog can be adopted or found there, it does not imply competition.",
    "Finally, the \"own home\" option suggests that small dogs are best in their living environment, but again, this is not a competition.",
    "Thus, after double-checking and considering all options, the only suitable competition for a small dog is the \"dog show.\""
