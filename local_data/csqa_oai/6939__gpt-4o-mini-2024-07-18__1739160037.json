  "query": "Question: What kind of business would you make if you want to help people?\n\nChoices:\nA: nonprofit\nB: art\nC: pyramid scheme\nD: pleasure\nE: personal",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what it means to \"help people.\" This typically involves providing services or support that improve individuals' quality of life or address their needs.",
    "Next, I assess the choices provided: A (nonprofit), B (art), C (pyramid scheme), D (pleasure), and E (personal).",
    "A nonprofit organization is specifically designed to support a cause or help people without the goal of making a profit. This aligns with the idea of helping people effectively.",
    "The option B (art) can help people by providing inspiration or enjoyment, but it may not directly address specific needs in the same way a nonprofit does.",
    "C (pyramid scheme) is primarily focused on making money for those at the top of the scheme and often harms people by exploiting them, so this does not align with helping people.",
    "D (pleasure) could suggest activities that are enjoyable, but this is more subjective and does not directly correlate with helping people.",
    "E (personal) could encompass activities that help individuals but lacks specificity in relation to helping the broader community or addressing collective needs.",
    "Considering all these options and their alignment with the goal of helping people, the nonprofit model stands out as the most direct and effective means of providing support and assistance."
