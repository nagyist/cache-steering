  "query": "Question: Where can a human find body coverings?\n\nChoices:\nA: phone booth\nB: clothing store\nC: workplace\nD: swimming pool\nE: closets",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"body coverings\" refers to. Generally, body coverings are articles of clothing or items that can be worn on the body.",
    "Next, I will analyze each of the provided choices to determine if they relate to body coverings.",
    "The first option is a \"phone booth.\" Phone booths typically do not have any clothing or body coverings. They are just enclosures for making phone calls.",
    "The second option is a \"clothing store.\" Clothing stores are specifically designed to sell various types of clothing and body coverings. This is a strong contender.",
    "The third option is a \"workplace.\" Depending on the type of workplace, there might be body coverings (e.g., uniforms), but it is not primarily a place for finding a variety of body coverings.",
    "The fourth option is a \"swimming pool.\" At a swimming pool, people might wear swimsuits, which are a type of body covering, but it's not a place for finding a wide range of clothing.",
    "The fifth option is \"closets.\" Closets typically contain clothing or body coverings, but they are inside homes rather than a public or commercial location like a clothing store.",
    "Now, comparing the options, the \"clothing store\" is the most representative location where one can specifically find body coverings as its primary purpose is selling clothing.",
    "While \"closets\" also contain body coverings, they are not accessible in a public sense and would not apply broadly to the question.",
    "Based on this reasoning, I conclude that the best answer to the question about where to find body coverings is in a clothing store."
