  "steps": [
    "Identify the primary purpose of video games mentioned in the question. The question suggests that some video games are beneficial for kids.",
    "Consider the context of benefits related to children playing video games. The benefits could include fun aspects, but also the potential for learning or education.",
    "Review the choices to see which ones align with the idea that some video games are good for kids. Choice A mentions \"fun to play,\" which, while true, does not imply an additional benefit aside from enjoyment.",
    "Choice B states \"played inside stadium,\" which does not relate to the positive impact on children.",
    "Choice C refers to \"played at office,\" which is also irrelevant in the context of children's wellness or education.",
    "Choice D states \"educational,\" which suggests that some video games can have a learning component. This aligns well with the idea of being good for kids as it implies a positive enhancement of knowledge or skills.",
    "Choice E mentions \"played outside,\" which may not directly imply a benefit of education or personal growth. It's simply a location.",
    "Out of all these choices, D is the only one that explicitly suggests a benefit beyond just enjoyment, focusing on education, which can be a significant advantage for children's development."
