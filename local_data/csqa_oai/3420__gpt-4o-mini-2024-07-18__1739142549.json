  "query": "Question: His boss told him that he would be speaking to the group that afternoon, he needed him to share his knowledge at the next what?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: class\nC: office party\nD: book\nE: meeting",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the boss wants him to share his knowledge with a group, which suggests a formal or educational context.",
    "The word \"knowledge\" also implies that the group will be seeking information or expertise on a specific topic.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"university\" (A) seems unlikely, as the context suggests a more specific and immediate event rather than a broader institution.",
    "The term \"class\" (B) could fit, but there\u2019s no indication that this is a classroom setting or a formal class.",
    "\"Office party\" (C) seems inappropriate because it does not usually involve sharing knowledge but rather social interaction.",
    "The word \"book\" (D) does not fit, as books are typically written works and not events where one speaks to a group.",
    "Finally, \"meeting\" (E) fits well as it is a common setting for discussing work matters where sharing knowledge is highly relevant.",
    "Considering all options and their contexts, \"meeting\" (E) is the most appropriate choice for where he would share his knowledge."
