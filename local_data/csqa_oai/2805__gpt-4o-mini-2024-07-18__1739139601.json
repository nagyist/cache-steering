  "query": "Question: If you are cleaning house, what will happen to it?\n\nChoices:\nA: neatness\nB: exhaustion\nC: sneezing\nD: order\nE: clutter",
  "steps": [
    "When cleaning a house, the primary goal is to remove dirt, dust, and disarray from the living space.",
    "The process of cleaning typically involves organizing items, thus leading to a more tidy environment.",
    "One outcome of cleaning is often achieving neatness, as items are put in their proper places.",
    "Another possible outcome is a state of order, where everything has a designated place and is organized logically.",
    "While cleaning may lead to feelings of exhaustion due to physical activity, this is more of a side effect than the end result of the cleaning process itself.",
    "Sneezing could occur if dust is disturbed during cleaning, but it is not a guaranteed outcome nor a primary purpose of cleaning.",
    "Clutter is what one tries to eliminate through cleaning, so it wouldn\u2019t be a result of the cleaning process.",
    "Evaluating the most logical end results of cleaning, we see that neatness and order are the two most relevant choices.",
    "Since \u2018neatness\u2019 and \u2018order\u2019 often go hand-in-hand, I need to distinguish which single concept aligns best with the traditional outcome of cleaning.",
    "Considering the typical intention behind cleaning a house is to restore or achieve a state of order, I would select order as the optimal answer."
