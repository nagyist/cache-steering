  "query": "Question: Where are mice usually found in  house?\n\nChoices:\nA: on the couch\nB: disneyland\nC: garage\nD: kitchen\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the typical habitats or places where mice are commonly found in a house.",
    "Mice are known to seek shelter and food sources, so I should focus on locations in a house that provide both.",
    "The kitchen is a place where food is stored and prepared, making it a likely area for mice looking for food.",
    "Garages often have storage, but they may not provide as consistent a food source as a kitchen.",
    "Couches are unlikely to be a primary habitat for mice, as they typically do not contain food and are not suitable shelters.",
    "Disneyland is not a valid option for where mice are found in a house, as it is a theme park and not a household location.",
    "Cupboards, particularly those in the kitchen, can also serve as a shelter for mice, especially if they contain food.",
    "Now, I need to compare the kitchen and cupboard as the most likely places. The kitchen is generally more expansive and likely to have more food sources than just a cupboard alone.",
    "Considering the choices, the kitchen stands out as the most common location for mice due to the availability of food and shelter.",
    "Therefore, the best answer to the question based on all reasoning steps is the kitchen."
