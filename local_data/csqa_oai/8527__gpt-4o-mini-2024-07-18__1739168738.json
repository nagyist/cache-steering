  "query": "Question: A person who found something odd, may have found it odd because it wasn't what?\n\nChoices:\nA: even\nB: common\nC: expected\nD: happening\nE: habitual",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct answer, I need to understand the meaning of \"found it odd.\" This phrase suggests that something was surprising or unusual to the person.",
    "Next, I will analyze the choices in relation to something being perceived as odd. An odd occurrence typically diverges from what someone anticipates.",
    "Looking at choice A, \"even\" implies a mathematical concept, and while it could be contextualized in some scenarios, it doesn't specifically relate to why something would be perceived as odd.",
    "Choice B, \"common,\" suggests something that occurs frequently or regularly. While a lack of commonality could contribute to being seen as odd, it doesn\u2019t directly address the feelings of expectation.",
    "Choice C, \"expected,\" implies that a person has prior beliefs or anticipations about how something should be. If something is not expected, it may be perceived as odd.",
    "For choice D, \"happening,\" doesn't fit the context because whether something is happening or not doesn't inherently relate to expectations or norms about its nature.",
    "Finally, choice E, \"habitual,\" could relate to routine behavior. However, oddity is more strongly correlated with not meeting expectations rather than not being habitual.",
    "After evaluating all options, choice C connects most directly with the notion of oddity; if something is unexpected, it is likely to be considered odd."
