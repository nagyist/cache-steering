  "query": "Question: People use a knife to clean their catch on what vessel?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: kitchen drawer\nC: fishing boat\nD: pocket\nE: board",
  "steps": [
    "To understand the context, I need to identify what \"catch\" refers to. In fishing, a \"catch\" typically means the fish or other aquatic animals that have been captured.",
    "Next, I consider where people usually clean their fish after catching them. The cleaning process usually involves tools like knives and is done in a specific location designed for this purpose.",
    "Among the options provided, I need to evaluate where it would be practical to have a knife and perform the cleaning of the catch.",
    "Option A, \"table,\" could refer to a regular dining table, but it may not be ideal for cleaning fish due to hygiene and mess concerns.",
    "Option B, \"kitchen drawer,\" suggests storage for utensils but does not serve as an appropriate location for cleaning the catch.",
    "Option C, \"fishing boat,\" is a typical place where people fish. Many fishermen clean their catch right on the boat before returning home or preparing the fish for storage.",
    "Option D, \"pocket,\" is impractical for cleaning a catch, as it's not a location for performing any such activity.",
    "Option E, \"board,\" although it might imply a cutting board, lacks the context to indicate that it's specifically for cleaning fish in the scenario described.",
    "Considering all options, the most logical answer is C, as a fishing boat is specifically designed for fishing and often used for cleaning catches."
