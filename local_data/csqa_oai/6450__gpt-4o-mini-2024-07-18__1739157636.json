  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a place where one could find a real knight, implying a historical or physical context rather than a fictional or abstract one.",
    "Choice A is a chess board, which represents knights but doesn't have real knights; they are just pieces on the board.",
    "Choice B refers to the middle ages, a historical period known for the presence of actual knights. This is a plausible answer.",
    "Choice C suggests video games, which often feature knights but do not have real knights as they are also fictional characters.",
    "Choice D mentions a chess set, which is similar to choice A; it represents knights but does not have real knights.",
    "Choice E refers to fairy tales, where knights are common characters, but these are also fictional and do not represent real knights.",
    "Comparing all the options, choice B stands out as it directly relates to a historical context where knights, as real persons, were present.",
    "Although choices C (video game) and E (fairy tale) feature knights, they do so in fictional scenarios, thus not fulfilling the condition of \u201creal.\u201d",
    "Finalizing the analysis, the only option denoting the existence of real knights is from the middle ages."
