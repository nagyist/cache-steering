  "query": "Question: Where is there likely to be sadness in a waiting room?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospitals\nB: airport\nC: clinic\nD: in a marriage hall\nE: doctor's office",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll consider the environments where waiting rooms exist. Waiting rooms are commonly found in medical settings, airports, and some event spaces.",
    "Next, I will analyze where people might experience sadness while waiting. Hospitals typically have a heavier atmosphere due to health concerns.",
    "Clinics also deal with health issues, so they may have people waiting who are anxious or worried about medical results.",
    "Airports tend to be busy and more neutral in emotional context, as people are typically excited or in transit.",
    "Marriage halls usually have an atmosphere of celebration, so sadness is less likely to be associated with waiting there.",
    "Now, I will focus on the choices related to medical settings: hospitals, clinics, and doctor's offices.",
    "Considering the hospital and clinic choices, both settings can have sadness; however, hospitals are often associated with more severe health issues.",
    "Doctor's offices also present similar scenarios as clinics, where patients may be anxious or worried.",
    "Since the question asks about where sadness is LIKELY to be present in a waiting room, hospitals generally present the highest risk of sadness due to the serious nature of the visits often associated with them.",
    "Therefore, the answer that best fits the expectation of sadness in a waiting room context would be hospitals, leading me to choose that option."
