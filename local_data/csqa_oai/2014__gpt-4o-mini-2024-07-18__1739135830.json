  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the location where litter ends up when it is thrown away.",
    "When we throw litter, it is typically projected into the air but does not remain suspended.",
    "The most common outcome of throwing litter is that it falls to the ground due to gravity.",
    "Choices B (midair) and D (bus) do not represent a realistic end location for litter, as it cannot stay in midair and is unlikely to land specifically in a bus.",
    "Although choice A (street corner) and choice E (roadsides) may seem plausible, they are both specific locations rather than a general end point.",
    "Since litter is more likely to initially hit the ground and then can be found in various locations after that, the most direct and broad answer would be the ground itself.",
    "Thus, the correct answer must reflect where litter ultimately lands after being thrown away."
