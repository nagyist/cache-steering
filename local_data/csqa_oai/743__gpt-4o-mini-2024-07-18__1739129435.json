  "steps": [
    "An obtuse angle is defined as an angle that is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.",
    "In geometry, an acute angle is one that is less than 90 degrees. Therefore, an obtuse angle cannot be acute by definition.",
    "Now, I will consider the response choices one by one to see which cannot logically be associated with an obtuse angle.",
    "Choice A is \"bright.\" Brightness is not a geometrical property and does not directly relate to obtuse angles; therefore, it can be aligned with obtuseness in another context.",
    "Choice B is \"pointed.\" Pointed can refer to an angle that is sharp or acute, but it does not necessarily mean that it cannot be associated with obtuse angles in different contexts.",
    "Choice C is \"correct.\" Similar to brightness, correctness is subjective and does not pertain directly to angles.",
    "Choice D is \"acute angled.\" Since an obtuse angle is defined as being greater than 90 degrees, it cannot ever be an acute angle, which is defined as being less than 90 degrees.",
    "Choice E is \"clear.\" Clarity is also not a property that applies directly to angles and can be perceived regardless of the angle's measurement.",
    "The only option that logically cannot coexist with something being obtuse is \"acute angled.\""
