  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a location where mail is sent over a counter. I need to consider places that are related to mailing or postal services.",
    "The most common place associated with sending mail is a post office, which has services for mailing letters and packages.",
    "A candy store is primarily for selling sweets and treats, and does not typically handle mail or postal services.",
    "A butcher shop sells meat products and does not engage in sending or receiving mail.",
    "The choice \"animals\" does not pertain to any location where mail is sent; it implies living creatures instead.",
    "The kitchen is a space for cooking and food preparation, not for sending mail.",
    "After analyzing all the options, only the post office offers mail services over a counter, which aligns with the question's context.",
    "I now confirm that A: post office is the correct answer based on the reasoning steps above."
