  "query": "Question: Where might a person play an acoustic guitar at a birthday party?\n\nChoices:\nA: studio\nB: at funeral place\nC: house\nD: music shop\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of a birthday party and the typical locations associated with such an event.",
    "A studio is generally associated with recording music and not typically a venue for social gatherings like birthday parties.",
    "A funeral place is an inappropriate setting for a birthday celebration and thus not a logical choice for playing an acoustic guitar.",
    "A house is commonly used for personal celebrations such as birthday parties, making it a plausible location to play an acoustic guitar.",
    "A music shop might allow for music playing, but it's not a common location for a birthday party where guests gather and celebrate.",
    "A closet is an enclosed space that lacks the setting and atmosphere suitable for a birthday celebration.",
    "Having evaluated the choices, the house stands out as the most appropriate location for playing an acoustic guitar during a birthday party."
