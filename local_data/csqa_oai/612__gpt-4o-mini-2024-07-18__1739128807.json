  "query": "Question: John is studying animals.   What is one of the many things he has to watch them doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathe\nB: bite\nC: die of cancer\nD: obesity\nE: copulate",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the context of John's studies. He is studying animals, which implies observational behavior is key to his research.",
    "Next, we can analyze the options provided. There are various behaviors and health-related issues listed.",
    "Option A, \"bathe,\" is a behavior that some animals exhibit, but it is not universally applicable to all species.",
    "Option B, \"bite,\" may be seen as a reaction or defensive behavior but is not a primary focus in many studies of animal behavior.",
    "Option C, \"die of cancer,\" is a health issue and while it may be observed in certain animals, it is not a behavior that is typically studied in live observation.",
    "Option D, \"obesity,\" refers to a condition and might be relevant in studies of certain animals, but it doesn\u2019t cover common observational behavior found in many species.",
    "Option E, \"copulate,\" is a fundamental behavior that is frequently observed in many animal studies, particularly concerning reproduction and mating rituals.",
    "Among these choices, \"copulate\" stands out as a common and significant behavior that John would likely need to observe in his studies of animals."
