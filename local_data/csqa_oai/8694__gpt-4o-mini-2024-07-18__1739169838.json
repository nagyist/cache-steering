  "query": "Question: If I wanted to buy a cable, where would I go?\n\nChoices:\nA: substation\nB: electrical device\nC: television\nD: radio shack\nE: side ports of tv",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to buy a cable, I need to consider what locations typically sell cables.",
    "A substation is a facility used in electricity transmission and does not sell consumer goods, so it's not a viable option.",
    "An electrical device generally refers to an appliance or instrument that uses electricity and does not sell items like cables.",
    "A television, as a device, would not sell cables either, as it is a finished product.",
    "A radio shack is a type of retail store that specializes in electronics and often carries various cables and accessories.",
    "The side ports of a TV are component inputs and do not serve as a place to purchase cables; they are just connectors.",
    "Therefore, from the options available, the most logical choice for purchasing a cable is a retail store that sells electronics.",
    "Hence, I conclude that the best answer for where to buy a cable is a place like Radio Shack, which is known to carry such items."
