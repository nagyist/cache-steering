  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"creatures that are easy to see for people even in a city\". This suggests a place where animals or creatures are likely to be observed in an urban environment.",
    "Option A: \"forest\" doesn't fit because forests are usually not found within cities.",
    "Option B: \"library\" doesn't fit either, as it typically does not contain creatures.",
    "Option C: \"woods\" is similar to a forest, which again is not a common city setting.",
    "Option D: \"black lagoon\" is more of a fictional or obscure reference and does not likely contain visible creatures in a city context.",
    "Option E: \"zoo\" is a place specifically designed to house creatures and is commonly found in urban areas, making it accessible and easy to see various animals.",
    "Comparing all options, \"zoo\" stands out as the most likely place where people would see creatures easily in a city."
