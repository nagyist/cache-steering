  "query": "Question: How does an investor get cash?\n\nChoices:\nA: save money\nB: buy stock\nC: sell stock\nD: gain wealth\nE: from a job",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to clarify what is meant by \"getting cash\" as an investor. Cash is typically obtained through various financial activities involving assets.",
    "Next, let's explore the possible choices. \"Save money\" (A) refers to setting aside cash, which does not directly generate cash from an investment standpoint.",
    "Then, we consider \"buy stock\" (B). Buying stock requires cash outflow rather than generating cash for the investor.",
    "Next, \"sell stock\" (C) involves liquidating investments, which directly converts stocks into cash. This is a primary method for investors to obtain cash.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate \"gain wealth\" (D). Gaining wealth is a broader concept that may involve an increase in asset value but does not specify how cash is obtained.",
    "Finally, \"from a job\" (E) implies earning money through employment, which is not specific to investment activities.",
    "Thus, the most straightforward and relevant choice for how an investor obtains cash is by selling stock."
