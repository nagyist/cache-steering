  "query": "Question: Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, why are they?\n\nChoices:\nA: wet soil\nB: start to fall\nC: dry soil\nD: wet things\nE: wet ground",
  "steps": [
    "Worms are known to thrive in moist environments, which are typically found in wet soil.",
    "During rain, the soil becomes saturated with water, creating ideal conditions for worms to move around.",
    "Worms breathe through their skin, which needs to remain moist in order for them to absorb oxygen; therefore, rain makes it easier for them to come to the surface.",
    "Worms may also come to the surface during rain because they can move more freely through wet soil compared to dry soil.",
    "The phrase \"crawling out of the earth\" indicates that worms are pushed to leave their burrows, suggesting an external factor like water.",
    "Among the choices, \"wet soil\" directly correlates to the condition that encourages worms to emerge from the ground during rain.",
    "Other options like \"start to fall,\" \"dry soil,\" \"wet things,\" and \"wet ground\" do not capture the condition that specifically makes worms emerge as effectively as \"wet soil\" does.",
    "\"Wet ground\" is a close contender, but it is less precise compared to \"wet soil,\" which directly implies the condition of the soil that affects worm behavior.",
    "Thus, the best choice reflecting the reason worms are emerging during rain is \"wet soil.\""
