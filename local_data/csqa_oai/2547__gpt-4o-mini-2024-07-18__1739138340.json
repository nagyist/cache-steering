  "query": "Question: What geological feature is made mostly of rock?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: ground\nC: street\nD: mountain range\nE: bridge",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what each option represents in terms of geological features or constructs made from rock.",
    "The countryside primarily consists of various types of landforms and vegetation, so it is not predominantly made of rock.",
    "The ground is a general term that could refer to both soil and rock but does not specifically denote a rock feature.",
    "A street is a man-made construct, typically paved with asphalt or concrete, rather than made of natural rock.",
    "A mountain range is a natural geological feature formed primarily of rock, often consisting of various types of rock and geological formations.",
    "Now, I need to compare my findings for the remaining options: mountain range versus bridge, since a bridge is also a man-made structure.",
    "The bridge, like the street, is not made mostly of rock but rather of concrete, steel, or wood.",
    "Thus, by process of elimination, the only option that fits the description of being made mostly of rock is the mountain range.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is mountain range, as it is a geological feature specifically composed of rock."
