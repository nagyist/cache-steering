  "query": "Question: What is a  cathode ray tube typically part of?\n\nChoices:\nA: vacuum tube\nB: television\nC: screen\nD: oscilloscope\nE: computer",
  "steps": [
    "A cathode ray tube (CRT) is a device used to display images by directing electron beams onto a screen.",
    "The CRT was historically used in various types of display devices, notably televisions and computer monitors.",
    "Option A, \"vacuum tube\", refers to a broader category of devices that include CRTs but does not represent the specific application of displaying images.",
    "Option C, \"screen\", is somewhat vague and does not specifically denote the device that utilizes the CRT for display.",
    "Option D, \"oscilloscope\", is another application of CRT technology used primarily for waveform analysis rather than general image display.",
    "Option E, \"computer\", is also a broader category that does not define the specific function of a CRT, even though it can relate to CRTs used in monitors.",
    "Between options B (television), D (oscilloscope), and general terms like A, C, and E, the clearest association with CRTs in consumer electronics and imaging is in televisions.",
    "Television sets were the most common devices to utilize CRTs extensively until the advent of newer display technologies like LCD and LED.",
    "Thus, based on the typical use of cathode ray tubes, the most accurate answer correlates with televisions."
