  "steps": [
    "Lizards are ectothermic creatures, meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.",
    "They often seek out sunlight to warm their bodies since they cannot produce their own heat internally.",
    "This behavior is commonly observed in environments where they can bask in the sun.",
    "Among the provided choices, I need to find a surface that would be suitable for lizards to bask in the sun.",
    "Choice A: bushes could provide some shelter but may not be a consistent source of warmth.",
    "Choice B: \"dessert\" appears to be a typo for \"desert,\" which is a hot environment where lizards commonly bask in the sun, but not a specific basking surface.",
    "Choice C: books would not be a natural habitat for lizards to gather and bask in heat.",
    "Choice D: heat lamps are artificial sources of heat, but they wouldn't be where you'd typically see lizards in nature.",
    "Choice E: rocks are often used by lizards to bask, as they absorb heat from the sun and provide a warm surface for them.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given choices is E, as lizards will often be seen basking on rocks to regulate their body temperature."
