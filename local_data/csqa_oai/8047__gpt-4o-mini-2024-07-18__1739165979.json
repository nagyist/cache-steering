  "query": "Question: The bachelor didn't bother cleaning his sink, where was the unfortunate sink located?\n\nChoices:\nA: chemistry lab\nB: front desk\nC: apartment\nD: laundry room\nE: laboratory",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context of the sentence regarding the bachelor and the sink. Since it mentions a bachelor, it suggests a personal living environment rather than a professional one.",
    "Next, I will consider what locations are typically associated with a bachelor. A common living space for a bachelor is an apartment, which usually contains a kitchen and bathroom with sinks.",
    "I will evaluate the other choices: \n- A chemistry lab is more formal and not likely a place where a bachelor would reside. \n- A front desk is typically a reception area and does not involve sinks in a personal context. \n- A laundry room may include a sink, but it's not a primary living area and often not associated directly with bachelors.\n- A laboratory is similar to a chemistry lab and also unlikely to be associated with a bachelor in a way that would fit this scenario.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most logical and common living space for a bachelor that fits the context of a sink being neglected is an apartment.",
    "I need to confirm whether any of the other choices could be equally likely. However, the context of the sink not being cleaned fits more with a bachelor\u2019s personal living environment than any other professional or communal places."
