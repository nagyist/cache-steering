  "query": "Question: The wine cellar needed a consistently cool and dark place, where should it be built?\n\nChoices:\nA: home\nB: italy\nC: wilderness\nD: basement\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The wine cellar must maintain a constant temperature to preserve the quality of the wine. It should be in an area that is inherently cooler than other areas in a building or home.",
    "It must also be dark, as exposure to light can negatively affect wine. Thus, it should be built away from direct sunlight.",
    "Considering the choices provided, a \"home\" or \"house\" might have varying temperatures and exposure to light. An outdoor \"wilderness\" setting would not necessarily guarantee a stable and controlled environment.",
    "Both \"home\" and \"house\" refer to similar concepts and do not inherently provide the necessary conditions. Thus, we consider specific parts of a home where these conditions are likely to exist.",
    "A \"basement\" is typically the most suitable location for a wine cellar, as it is usually cooler and darker compared to above-ground levels in a home.",
    "Other options, like Italy, while famous for wine, do not provide a specific or guaranteed location; focusing instead on a physical structure is more relevant.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the best choice from the options listed, which provides consistency in temperature and darkness, is the basement."
