    "The question mentions that he spent the entire workday at a computer, which suggests that he was likely working in a space commonly associated with computer use.",
    "Typical places where one would use a computer for work include an office or a desk setup.",
    "Among the provided answer choices, \"desk\" is most directly related to a work environment where computers are typically used.",
    "The other options, such as \"bathroom,\" \"shoe shop,\" \"family room,\" and \"living room,\" do not strongly correlate with a traditional work setting where a computer would be used for a workday.",
    "Since a footstool is often used to enhance comfort while seated, particularly at a desk or workstation, this further supports the idea that he is referring to his desk.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer that connects his need for a footstool with a computer work situation is \"desk.\""
