  "query": "Question: A living person lays on their death bed, what awaits them soon?\n\nChoices:\nA: expiration\nB: massage\nC: interaction\nD: perspiration\nE: respiration",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a person who is on their death bed. This suggests that they are in the final stages of life or nearing death.",
    "Next, analyze the choices given. \"Expiration\" refers to the end of life, which aligns with the context of being on a death bed.",
    "Evaluate \"massage.\" This is unlikely as a death bed scenario typically does not involve physical relaxation techniques that are associated with massages.",
    "Now, consider \"interaction.\" While there might be interactions occurring, they are not definitive outcomes associated with being on a death bed.",
    "Look at \"perspiration.\" Perspiration could occur under various conditions, but it is not a key aspect of what is expected to happen as one approaches death.",
    "Finally, assess \"respiration.\" While breathing does continue up to the moment of death, it does not signify the end but rather the process of dying.",
    "Among all these options, \"expiration\" is the most direct result of being on a death bed, as it signifies the imminent end of life."
