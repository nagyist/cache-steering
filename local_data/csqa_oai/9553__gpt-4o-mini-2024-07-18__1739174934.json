  "query": "Question: James finishes playing with his ball and left it on the floor.  His mother found it and put it somewhere that he could find it easily.  Where might she put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: playroom\nB: brush\nC: closet\nD: toy box\nE: pool table",
  "steps": [
    "James was playing with his ball, indicating it's a toy meant for play.",
    "His mother decided to put the ball somewhere James could find it easily, which suggests she wouldn't put it in an out-of-reach or less accessible location.",
    "The playroom is a space designed for play and would be a logical place to put a toy, making it easily accessible for James.",
    "The options include a brush, which is not a suitable place for a toy like a ball, as it is used for a different purpose.",
    "The closet is typically a storage area that might not be easily accessible for a child to find toys, especially if it is not organized for play items.",
    "A toy box is specifically designed for storing toys and would also be an easily accessible spot for James to find his ball.",
    "The pool table is a surface for playing games and is not a reasonable place to leave a ball for a child to easily find.",
    "Comparing the options: \n- The playroom and toy box are suitable as they are places for toys. \n- The closet is less accessible, and the brush and pool table are impractical for storing a ball.",
    "To find the best choice, I consider where James would most likely expect his ball to be: in a place that signifies play.",
    "Both the playroom and toy box fit this, but a toy box is explicitly meant for toys and more organized."
