  "query": "Question: The baboon is a species of monkey native to where?\n\nChoices:\nA: amazon basin\nB: rain forest\nC: zoological gardens\nD: jungle\nE: african continent",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what I know about baboons. Baboons are a type of primate classified within the family Cercopithecidae and are specifically part of the genus Papio.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll consider the geographic distribution of baboons. They are primarily found in various regions of Africa.",
    "Now, I should examine the provided choices. Options A, B, C, and D refer to specific types of environments (Amazon basin, rain forest, zoological gardens, jungle), while option E specifically refers to a continent.",
    "The Amazon basin, rain forests, and jungles typically refer to tropical environments, which are not the primary habitats of baboons. Instead, baboons are commonly found in savannah, open woodland, and grassland areas.",
    "I will rule out options A, B, C, and D, as they do not specifically relate to the native habitat of baboons.",
    "This leaves me with option E, which states the African continent, indicating that baboons originate from a broader geographical area rather than a specific environment.",
    "I know that different species of baboons can be found in diverse habitats across many countries in Africa, confirming that they are indeed native to the African continent.",
    "Therefore, after carefully evaluating the options and confirming the specific native region of baboons, I conclude that option E is the correct answer."
