  "query": "Question: What type of people get books written about them?\n\nChoices:\nA: entertaining\nB: important\nC: written on paper\nD: engaging\nE: rich people",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what it typically means for a book to be written about someone. Generally, it involves a person having a significant influence or impact in some way.",
    "Next, we can evaluate each choice in relation to how often books are written about those types of people.",
    "Looking at option A, \"entertaining\" people may have stories or experiences that are enjoyable, but that doesn't necessarily mean a book is written about them. Many entertaining individuals remain obscure.",
    "For option B, \"important\" people often have books written about them due to their roles in society, history, or other significant contributions. This option seems plausible.",
    "Examining option C, \"written on paper\" describes a format rather than a type of person. It is not applicable here.",
    "Considering option D, \"engaging\" people share qualities that capture interest. However, someone can be engaging without necessarily having the significant impact required to warrant a book.",
    "Option E, \"rich people,\" could lead to books being written about them, but wealth alone does not guarantee that their life or story is compelling enough for a biography or similar book.",
    "Comparing all valid options, \"important\" is a strong candidate, as history tends to recognize certain individuals with biographies or books about their lives based on their contributions.",
    "Hence, the choice that best describes who typically has books written about them is those who are \"important.\""
