  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that is not the main focus of a video, which implies looking for terms that suggest a supporting or less important role.",
    "Choice A, \"peripheral,\" suggests something that is on the outside or marginal, which fits the criteria of not being the main focus.",
    "Choice B, \"secondary,\" also implies a lesser importance compared to a primary focus and aligns with the question's requirements.",
    "Choice C, \"maintopmast,\" is a nautical term referring to a part of a ship, unrelated to video content, and is therefore irrelevant.",
    "Choice D, \"characters,\" are central to many videos' plots, making them a primary focus rather than something that's not central.",
    "Choice E, \"minor,\" suggests something that is lesser in importance or scale, which again fits the definition of not being the main focus.",
    "Now evaluating the strongest candidates: A (peripheral), B (secondary), and E (minor) all represent things that aren't the main focus, but I need to assess which could be more suitable overall.",
    "Choosing between \"peripheral,\" \"secondary,\" and \"minor,\" \"peripheral\" stands out as a term that clearly denotes something that exists outside of the main action or focus.",
    "\"Secondary\" and \"minor\" are also fitting, but \"peripheral\" consistently conveys the idea of being on the edge or not in the spotlight across a variety of contexts, not just videos specifically.",
    "Since the question does not specify nuances and requests something that fits the definition broadly as not being a main focus, I conclude that peripheral directly aligns with that meaning."
