  "query": "Question: Where in a meadow would a snake hide?\n\nChoices:\nA: underwater\nB: tropical forest\nC: amazon river\nD: western texas\nE: high grass",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical habitat of a snake. Snakes are often found in environments where they can hide and ambush their prey.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided. Underwater (A) is not a typical hiding place for snakes, especially in a meadow context.",
    "Tropical forest (B) is an entirely different ecosystem which does not correlate with a meadow.",
    "Amazon river (C) refers specifically to a body of water, rather than an area typically associated with meadows.",
    "Next, western Texas (D) is a geographical location that may have some meadow areas, but it is too broad of a choice without defining a specific habitat.",
    "Consider the final choice: high grass (E). This environment mimics natural grasslands, where snakes would likely be able to hide effectively from predators and while hunting.",
    "Based on the analysis, high grass is the most suitable option for where a snake would hide in a meadow."
