  "steps": [
    "Fighting inflation typically involves monitoring the impact of inflation on various financial metrics, including loans and borrowing costs.",
    "Inflation affects the cost of borrowing, often leading lenders to increase interest rates to maintain profitability and manage their risk.",
    "Rising interest rates are a direct response to inflation concerns, as they influence the overall cost of loans and credit accessibility.",
    "When inflation is anticipated or occurring, borrowers may face increased costs on their loans, making rising interest rates a significant consideration.",
    "After identifying that rising interest rates are typically associated with inflation, I will consider other provided options.",
    "The other options (not noticeable, loss of money, economic instability, problems) do not specifically address the impact on loans in the context of inflation as directly as rising interest rates.",
    "Rising interest rates are closely linked to the concept of managing loans during inflationary periods, making it an important factor to be aware of when fighting inflation.",
    "Therefore, the most relevant answer relating to loans when fighting inflation is rising interest rates."
