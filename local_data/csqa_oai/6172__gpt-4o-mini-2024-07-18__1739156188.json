  "query": "Question: Where can you get a brand new book shelf?\n\nChoices:\nA: library\nB: ocean\nC: bedroom\nD: bookends\nE: furniture store",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a brand new bookshelf is and where it can typically be obtained. A bookshelf is a piece of furniture designed to hold books.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. A library is primarily a place to borrow books, not buy new furniture. So option A is unlikely.",
    "Consider option B: the ocean. This is irrelevant, as the ocean is not a place to find items like furniture.",
    "Look at option C: bedroom. While a bedroom may contain a bookshelf, it is not a place where one typically purchases a brand new bookshelf.",
    "Next, assess option D: bookends. Bookends are used to hold books in place on a shelf but are not themselves bookshelves. Therefore, this option does not apply.",
    "Finally, analyze option E: furniture store. Furniture stores are specifically designed to sell various kinds of furniture, including bookshelves.",
    "Based on the reasoning steps, the most suitable answer for where to get a brand new bookshelf is option E, as furniture stores sell new furniture items."
