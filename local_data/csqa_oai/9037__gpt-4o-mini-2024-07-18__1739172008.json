  "query": "Question: Debbie buys a ficus on how own, but she doesn't want to keep it in a pot.  Where does she put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: window\nB: park\nC: hair salon\nD: family room\nE: flower garden",
  "steps": [
    "Debbie has bought a ficus, which is a type of plant that typically requires proper sunlight and soil conditions to thrive.",
    "The question states that she doesn't want to keep it in a pot, which suggests she is considering an alternative location where the plant can still grow properly.",
    "Looking at the options provided, a \"flower garden\" (option E) is a place where plants are directly put into the ground, which would not involve using a pot.",
    "A \"window\" (option A) may provide sunlight but does not allow the ficus to be planted in the ground, so it doesn't fit the requirement of not being in a pot.",
    "A \"park\" (option B) could potentially be a place for a ficus, but it's not a specific area for keeping planted houseplants.",
    "A \"hair salon\" (option C) is an unlikely place for a ficus, as it is not typically designed for plants and does not offer proper conditions for growing.",
    "A \"family room\" (option D) could accommodate a plant, but again, it would likely be in a pot rather than planted directly in the ground.",
    "Since the only option that allows for the ficus to be planted directly into the ground rather than in a pot is the \"flower garden,\" that seems to be the most logical choice."
