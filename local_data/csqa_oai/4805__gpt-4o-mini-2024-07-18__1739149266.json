  "query": "Question: The coupon frenzied lady bought many bags of chips, she had her kids stuff the bags on the shelves in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: bar\nC: pantry\nD: supermarket\nE: motherboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what type of location is typically associated with storing food items like bags of chips.",
    "A \"house\" is a general living space but does not specifically imply a storage area for food.",
    "A \"bar\" usually refers to a place where drinks are served, not a food storage area.",
    "A \"supermarket\" is a place where food is sold, not stored after purchase.",
    "A \"motherboard\" is a component of a computer and is not related to storing food at all.",
    "The term \"pantry\" refers specifically to a small room or space in a home where food, dishes, linens, or provisions are stored.",
    "Since the question mentions bags of chips being stored, and \"pantry\" is the only option that clearly fits as a storage area for food items, it becomes the most logical choice.",
    "Thus, we conclude that the lady stuffed the bags of chips into the pantry."
