  "query": "Question: Where does a human go to be lifted and carried off?\n\nChoices:\nA: solar system\nB: upstairs\nC: workplace\nD: bathroom\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to interpret the question about where a human goes to be \"lifted and carried off.\" This suggests an action that involves moving someone from one place to another.",
    "Next, let's analyze each of the options provided to see which one aligns best with the concept of being lifted and carried.",
    "A: Solar system. While it might be possible to imagine a human being taken off to space, it\u2019s not a common or literal interpretation of being lifted and carried off. Furthermore, it's far too broad and abstract to be applicable here.",
    "B: Upstairs. A person can be lifted and carried upstairs, but it specifically implies movement within a building and does not refer to being taken away or carried off in a broader sense.",
    "C: Workplace. This may involve scenarios such as a person being assisted by coworkers or medical staff, yet it does not distinctly imply being \u201ccarried off,\u201d making it less likely as an answer.",
    "D: Bathroom. This option does not quite relate to the concept of being lifted and carried off. Normally, individuals go to bathrooms privately, not in a context of being carried.",
    "E: Airport. Airports are places where people are often \"lifted and carried off,\" particularly in the context of boarding flights, where passengers are assisted by staff or might carry luggage.",
    "Considering all the options, the primary context of being lifted and carried off most positively aligns with the scenario of an airport."
