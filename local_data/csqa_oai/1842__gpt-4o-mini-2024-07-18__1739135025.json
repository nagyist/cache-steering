  "query": "Question: Why is someone getting drunk likely to sleep with someone they usually wouldn't approve of?\n\nChoices:\nA: tired\nB: violence\nC: falling down\nD: lower standards\nE: vomiting",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the effects of alcohol on behavior and decision-making. Alcohol consumption often impairs judgment and leads to less inhibition.",
    "Next, when a person is drunk, they may become less aware of social norms and personal standards they usually adhere to while sober.",
    "This loss of inhibitions and altered judgment can lead to individuals engaging in behaviors they normally wouldn't consider, including sexual encounters with others they might otherwise disapprove of.",
    "Additionally, alcohol can create a temporary feeling of increased confidence, which can further contribute to decisions that ignore previously held standards or values.",
    "Given the choices, we need to identify which one relates most directly to this phenomenon of lowered standards while intoxicated.",
    "Option A (tired) does not specifically address the concept of standard and approval in sexual encounters.",
    "Option B (violence) is unrelated to the question, as it addresses a different extreme behavior induced by alcohol.",
    "Option C (falling down) also does not relate to the reasons behind choosing partners.",
    "Option E (vomiting) is a physiological response that does not influence sexual decision-making processes.",
    "Therefore, option D (lower standards) directly addresses the concept of diminished judgment and altered perceptions that lead individuals to engage with partners they would typically avoid when sober."
