  "query": "Question: Danny was young human.  He didn't have a job. Instead he went where?\n\nChoices:\nA: museum\nB: homes\nC: workplace\nD: school\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "Danny is described as a young human who does not have a job, which suggests that he is likely in an educational or developmental stage of life.",
    "Given that Danny does not have a job, it is logical to consider places where young individuals typically engage or learn rather than work.",
    "Among the options provided, a \"workplace\" is generally a location associated with jobs, so it is unlikely that Danny would frequent such a place.",
    "The option \"homes\" is too vague and general for a young person without a job, as it does not imply a place he actively goes to for engagement or learning.",
    "The \"museum\" is a place that could provide educational experiences, but it is less typical for regular visits by young individuals compared to more dedicated learning environments.",
    "The \"library,\" however, is a specific place that is often associated with learning, study, and exploration, making it a suitable choice for a young person without a job.",
    "The \"school\" stands out as a primary environment for education, especially for young humans, indicating that it is highly probable that Danny goes to school.",
    "Thus, analyzing the choices, it seems most reasonable for a young person without a job to attend a place of learning like a school.",
    "I will finalize my answer, confirming that a young person like Danny would certainly go where education is provided, which is most convincingly represented by \"school.\""
