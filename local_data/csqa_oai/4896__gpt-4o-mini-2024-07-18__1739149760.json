  "steps": [
    "The scenario indicates that Sarah has a trash can beside her desk, which implies she is in a location where a desk is present.",
    "Desks are commonly found in indoor spaces such as offices, homes, or workplaces. Since the trash can is specifically described as being beside her desk, it suggests a functional workspace rather than a casual or outdoor space.",
    "A bus stop (Choice A) typically does not have a desk or a trash can in proximity, as it is an outdoor environment primarily for waiting for transportation.",
    "A corner (Choice B) is a vague location and does not imply a workspace; therefore, it is not a suitable choice either.",
    "A park (Choice D) does not generally have desks, and while there may be trash cans, the presence of a desk would be out of place.",
    "A motel (Choice E) may have rooms with desks inside but is less likely to have the arrangement described, as this scenario does not suggest a temporary stay.",
    "Given the presence of a desk and a trash can, the most logical and fitting location is an office where individuals typically work and often have a desk setup.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, the most plausible scenario for Sarah putting her food in a trash can beside her desk is that she was in an office."
