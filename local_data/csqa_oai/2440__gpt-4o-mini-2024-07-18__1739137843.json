  "query": "Question: What might be the result if one is convicted of obstructing justice?\n\nChoices:\nA: injustice\nB: fear\nC: bad\nD: criminal charges\nE: going to jail",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"obstructing justice\" refers to various acts that interfere with the enforcement of the law or the administration of justice.",
    "Typically, obstructing justice is treated as a criminal offense, meaning it involves violations of legal statutes.",
    "If someone is convicted of obstructing justice, it usually leads to legal penalties as a result of the conviction.",
    "Such penalties can include fines, a criminal record, probation, or imprisonment, depending on the severity of the offense and jurisdiction.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"going to jail\" explicitly represents one of the consequences of a conviction related to obstructing justice.",
    "Although \"criminal charges\" might seem relevant, that refers to the prospective situation before a conviction, not the result of being convicted.",
    "The choice \"bad\" is too vague to accurately describe the specific outcomes of a conviction.",
    "Similarly, \"injustice\" and \"fear\" do not directly relate to the legal consequences of being convicted.",
    "Hence, the most accurate result listed that correlates directly with a conviction for obstructing justice is \"going to jail.\""
