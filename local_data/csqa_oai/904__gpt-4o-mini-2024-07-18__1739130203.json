  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for locations where a binder can be purchased, not where it can be used or stored.",
    "Analyzing the choices: A college dorm might have binders, but it's not a typical purchasing location.",
    "A backpack is an item used to carry books and supplies, not a place to buy a binder.",
    "A classroom is primarily a learning space, and while binders may be present, it is not a retail location.",
    "Looking at the choice 'office supply store,' this is a recognized venue where school and office supplies, including binders, are sold.",
    "No other options, such as 'college dorm,' 'classroom,' or 'backpack,' are suitable for purchasing a binder. They are locations or items rather than retail venues.",
    "Thus, the only logical choice for buying a binder is the office supply store."
