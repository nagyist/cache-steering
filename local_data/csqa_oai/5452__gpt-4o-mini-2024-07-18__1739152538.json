  "steps": [
    "The question asks where the poet had to go to write about his distant past.",
    "Writing about the past often involves introspection and reflection on personal history, which could suggest a private or comfortable space.",
    "Among the options provided, some places like \"garden\" and \"bathroom\" may not be conducive for writing about complex memories.",
    "A \"classroom\" might typically be for learning or teaching rather than personal reflection on one's past.",
    "\"University\" could have a connection with learning about history or literature but may not directly relate to the poet\u2019s personal past.",
    "\"Home\" is often where someone feels most comfortable and is likely to find inspiration and recall memories.",
    "We can infer that if the poet was reflecting on his distant past, he would want a familiar and meaningful environment.",
    "Considering all options, \"home\" stands out as the most likely place to reflect on distant memories."
