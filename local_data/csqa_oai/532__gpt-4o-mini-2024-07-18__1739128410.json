  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the disease was spreading quickly, indicating an urgent situation.",
    "In such scenarios, researchers typically focus on solutions to counteract the spread of the disease.",
    "The term \"desperately seeking\" suggests that researchers are looking for something that can effectively address or mitigate the disease.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, options A, B, C, and D do not seem relevant to the context of actively countering a disease.",
    "Option A talks about cause spots on a leaf, which is more about symptoms rather than a solution.",
    "Option B mentions \"healthy,\" which does not specify what kind of health aspect they are seeking.",
    "Option C introduces \"wellness,\" which also relates to general health but does not imply a direct solution to the disease.",
    "Option D, \"ball stopped,\" is unrelated to the context of disease.",
    "Option E, \"cure,\" directly refers to a means of eliminating or controlling the disease, making it the most relevant option given the urgency highlighted earlier.",
    "Given the context and the choice of words in the question, the only logical answer that aligns with researchers\u2019 needs during a disease outbreak is \"cure.\""
