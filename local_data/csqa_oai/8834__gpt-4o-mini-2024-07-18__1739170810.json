  "query": "Question: If your shoes are too tight what will you get on your feet after jogging?\n\nChoices:\nA: exhaustion\nB: shortness of breath\nC: knee pain\nD: blisters\nE: lose weight",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider the effects of jogging with tight shoes on my feet specifically.",
    "Jogging puts a lot of impact on the feet, and if the shoes are too tight, this will likely create friction.",
    "Friction between feet and the inner lining of the tight shoes could lead to skin irritation.",
    "Skin irritation in this context is often manifested as blisters, which are fluid-filled bumps on the skin.",
    "I can rule out options A (exhaustion), B (shortness of breath), and E (lose weight) as these are not direct effects on the feet.",
    "Knee pain (option C) is also not a direct consequence of tight shoes specifically; it's more related to the impact on the knees rather than the fit of the shoes.",
    "Considering these points, I conclude that the most likely outcome of jogging in tight shoes is blisters."
