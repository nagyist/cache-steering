  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the role of light in the context of reading. Light is essential for visibility.",
    "Next, I will analyze the choices based on their relevance to light's importance in reading.",
    "Choice A, \"heavy,\" does not relate to the concept of light in reading. Light isn't a weight-related concept here.",
    "Choice B, \"forceful,\" suggests intensity but does not capture the essential function of light when reading.",
    "Choice C, \"unimportant,\" contradicts the common understanding that light is vital for reading effectively.",
    "Choice D, \"crucial,\" aligns well with the necessity of light for reading; without it, reading is almost impossible.",
    "Finally, choice E, \"cumbersome,\" implies difficulty or awkwardness, which does not accurately describe the role of light in reading.",
    "I will double-check the choices. \"Crucial\" clearly stands out as the most fitting description of light in the context of reading."
