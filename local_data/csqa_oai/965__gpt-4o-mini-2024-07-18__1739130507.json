  "query": "Question: A man was driving himself to the airport, where did he put his luggage?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: at hotel\nC: sidewalk\nD: bus stop\nE: trunk",
  "steps": [
    "The man is driving himself to the airport, suggesting he is likely using a car for transportation.",
    "Typically, when using a car to travel, luggage is placed in the vehicle's storage area, commonly referred to as the trunk.",
    "The options presented include locations that don't match the typical behavior of someone traveling to the airport with luggage.",
    "A closet and a hotel imply stationary locations where luggage would be stored, rather than being actively transported.",
    "The sidewalk or bus stop does not make sense as locations for luggage when driving someone to the airport.",
    "Since the man is driving, the most logical place for his luggage would be inside his car.",
    "Given that the trunk of a car is specifically designed for storing luggage and other items during travel, it is the most suitable option in this context.",
    "Other choices do not fit the context of a man driving to the airport and needing to transport his luggage.",
    "Therefore, placing the luggage in the trunk of the car is the only reasonable conclusion based on typical behavior and logistics."
