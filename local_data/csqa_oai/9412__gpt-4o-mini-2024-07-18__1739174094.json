  "query": "Question: She always wondered how safe it was to use her hair dryer straight after a hot shower, it was always so wet and steamy in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: jungle\nB: drug store\nC: box\nD: beauty salon\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question revolves around the safety of using a hair dryer after a hot shower. This suggests a setting where one would typically shower, which is often enclosed and steamy.",
    "Looking at the choices, I need to consider which places are commonly associated with showers and the use of hair dryers.",
    "Option A, \"jungle,\" is not a plausible location for showers and hair dryers; therefore it can be eliminated.",
    "Option B, \"drug store,\" typically does not provide a shower facility, thus it is not the right option.",
    "Option C, \"box,\" is an unusual and nonsensical location for showering or drying hair, so it can also be dismissed.",
    "Option D, \"beauty salon,\" is a relevant location where hair dryers are used; however, the question specifically references after a personal hot shower, which typically occurs in a different setting.",
    "Option E, \"bathroom,\" is the most logical choice. Bathrooms are where showers take place, and they are filled with steam after a hot shower.",
    "Considering all previous reasoning, \"bathroom\" aligns perfectly with the context of using a hair dryer after a hot shower, making it the correct answer."
