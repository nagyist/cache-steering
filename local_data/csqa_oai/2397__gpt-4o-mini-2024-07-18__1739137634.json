  "query": "Question: What must someone purchase if they plan on going to a play?\n\nChoices:\nA: tickets\nB: having ticket\nC: patience\nD: time\nE: a hat",
  "steps": [
    "To go to a play, one typically needs access to the venue where the play is performed.",
    "Access to the venue is usually obtained through a purchase or reservation.",
    "The most common way to gain access to a play is by purchasing tickets.",
    "While having a ticket is important, it is not something that is purchased in the same sense; it is the result of the purchase.",
    "Patience might be necessary for waiting before the play starts but is not a specific purchase required to attend.",
    "Time is also needed to attend the play, but again, it is not something that is purchased.",
    "A hat is not a requirement for attending a play and is largely a matter of personal choice or style.",
    "Given the need for access to the play, purchasing tickets is the primary requirement for attendance.",
    "Therefore, among the options presented, the correct choice is to purchase tickets."
