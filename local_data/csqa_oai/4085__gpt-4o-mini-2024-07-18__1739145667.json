    "The question asks about the body part that is primarily responsible for the sense of smell.",
    "Considering the options, I need to evaluate which of them is related to the sense of smell.",
    "Option A: \"hair\" does not have any function related to the sense of smell; thus, it can be eliminated.",
    "Option B: \"do dishes\" is an activity related to cleaning and has no connection to smelling. This can also be eliminated.",
    "Option C: \"nose\" is the organ responsible for the sense of smell. It contains olfactory receptors that detect odors.",
    "Option D: \"headache\" is a medical condition and is not related to smelling. This option can be eliminated.",
    "Option E: \"eat food to live\" refers to the function of eating and survival but does not pertain to the act of smelling.",
