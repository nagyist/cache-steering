  "query": "Question: John's kitchen sink was clogged.  He had other sinks, though, and ended up washing dishes where?\n\nChoices:\nA: laboratory\nB: neighbor's house\nC: office\nD: home\nE: laundry room",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that John's kitchen sink is clogged, which implies he needs an alternative place to wash his dishes.",
    "The options provided include various locations: laboratory, neighbor's house, office, home, and laundry room.",
    "Washing dishes typically requires access to a sink or basin, so I need to evaluate which of these options is practical for washing dishes.",
    "The laboratory is generally not a place for doing household chores like washing dishes, so option A is unlikely.",
    "Using a neighbor's house (option B) is possible but may not be the first choice unless John is very close to his neighbor or has a good relationship with them.",
    "The office (option C) is typically not equipped for washing dishes, as it\u2019s a work environment rather than a place for eating or cleaning.",
    "Home (option D) does not make sense as a choice for where John washed dishes since it implies he was at his kitchen sink, which is clogged.",
    "The laundry room (option E) is a plausible location. It's common for laundry rooms to have sinks or basins where one might hand wash items including dishes.",
    "Given that the laundry room is often equipped with a sink and is a reasonable place to wash dishes if the kitchen is unavailable, it stands out as a logical choice."
