  "query": "Question: The humorous is a bone located where?\n\nChoices:\nA: tomb\nB: animal\nC: arm\nD: museum\nE: comedy club",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"humorous\" might refer to in terms of anatomy. It sounds similar to \"humerus,\" which is a bone in the human body.",
    "Next, I need to confirm that the humerus is, indeed, a specific bone. The humerus is the long bone in the upper arm.",
    "Now, I'll analyze the provided choices. I need to see which option might relate to the humerus (or humorous).",
    "Choice A, \"tomb\", doesn't have any anatomical connection to the humerus, so I can eliminate it.",
    "Choice B, \"animal\", is very broad and does not directly relate to the specific location of the humerus, so I can eliminate it as well.",
    "Choice C, \"arm\", corresponds directly with the location of the humerus, as it is the bone found in the upper arm.",
    "Choice D, \"museum\", does not relate to any anatomical structure, so I can eliminate this choice too.",
    "Choice E, \"comedy club\", is playful but does not relate to any bone or anatomy, making it an unlikely answer.",
    "After reviewing all the options, the only viable and correct answer is associated with the arm where the humerus is located."
