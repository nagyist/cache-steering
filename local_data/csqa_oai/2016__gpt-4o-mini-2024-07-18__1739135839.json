  "query": "Question: Where does a wild cat usually live?\n\nChoices:\nA: beam of sunlight\nB: restaurant\nC: floor\nD: warm place\nE: barn",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a wild cat usually lives, we first need to consider the habitat preferences of wild cats. Wild cats generally prefer environments that provide cover and hunting opportunities.",
    "Next, we think about the choices provided. \"Beam of sunlight\" (A) is not a viable habitat; it is simply a natural occurrence. Similarly, \"restaurant\" (B) is a man-made environment and not suitable for wild cats.",
    "The option \"floor\" (C) is also not a suitable habitat. While wild cats can occupy various spaces, it doesn't represent a typical living environment.",
    "The option \"warm place\" (D) is somewhat vague but could apply to various habitats wild cats might prefer, such as forests or deserts. However, it does not specify a distinct location.",
    "Finally, we consider the option \"barn\" (E). While not a typical wild habitat, barns can offer shelter and a place for wild cats to hunt small animals like rodents.",
    "After analyzing the choices, the most relevant locations for wild cats would typically be natural environments, but the closest answer from the options is likely \"barn\".",
    "Therefore, while wild cats do not exclusively live in barns, barns can serve as a habitat, making it a reasonable choice compared to the other options."
