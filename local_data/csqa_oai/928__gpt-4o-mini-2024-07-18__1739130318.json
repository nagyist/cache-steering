  "query": "Question: Mary was a bad girl, but she was always open about that.  People liked her because she was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: excellent\nB: fun\nC: honest\nD: worthy\nE: choice",
  "steps": [
    "The statement describes Mary as a \"bad girl,\" indicating that she might engage in behaviors that are not socially accepted.",
    "However, it also states that she was \"always open about that,\" which suggests she was transparent regarding her actions and character.",
    "The excerpt indicates that her openness about her behavior was a significant factor in how people perceived her.",
    "The word \"honest\" aligns with the concept of being open about one\u2019s character and actions, regardless of whether those actions are deemed socially acceptable.",
    "The choices provided (A: excellent, B: fun, C: honest, D: worthy, E: choice) indicate that we are looking for a trait that would lead people to like her despite her being a \"bad girl.\"",
    "\"Fun\" (B) could also be considered as a potential reason for people liking her, but it does not directly correspond with the idea of being open about her character.",
    "\"Honest\" (C) strongly resonates with the idea that people appreciated her honesty about her behavior, making it the most fitting choice.",
    "The other choices (A: excellent, D: worthy, E: choice) do not correlate with the idea of her being openly \"bad,\" and thus do not seem likely to be the reason people liked her.",
    "Therefore, the best answer that reflects why people liked Mary is because of her honesty."
