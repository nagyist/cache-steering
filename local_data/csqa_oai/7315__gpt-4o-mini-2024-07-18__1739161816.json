  "steps": [
    "First, the scenario mentions she needs a new night table. Night tables are typically household furniture items.",
    "Next, legal acquisition of a night table would generally involve purchasing it from a licensed seller.",
    "Considering the options provided, a furniture store is a place specifically dedicated to selling furniture, including night tables.",
    "The other options (homes, hotel, hallway, grocery) are not primarily places for purchasing furniture. For example, homes are residences, hotels are for temporary stays, hallways are passageways, and groceries typically sell food items.",
