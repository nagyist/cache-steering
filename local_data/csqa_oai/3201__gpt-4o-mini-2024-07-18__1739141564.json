  "query": "Question: What city is likely to have a tearoom?\n\nChoices:\nA: tea shop\nB: london\nC: restaurant\nD: building\nE: england",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the logical connection between the options and the concept of a tearoom.",
    "A tearoom is primarily a place where tea is served, often accompanied by light meals and snacks.",
    "Examine the options: \n- A: tea shop (This could serve tea, but it doesn\u2019t specifically embody the full experience of a tearoom.)\n- B: london (Known for its tearoom culture; it's synonymous with traditional tearoom experiences.)\n- C: restaurant (While it may serve tea, it typically offers a broader menu than a typical tearoom.)\n- D: building (Too vague; a tearoom exists within a type of structure but does not equate to this option.)\n- E: england (Although tearooms are prevalent here, it is still too broad without a specific city context.)",
    "Assess the choice of London as a specific city where tearooms are iconic and culturally embedded.",
    "Compare London to other choices: 'tea shop' looks too generic, a 'restaurant' might serve tea alongside many other cuisines, 'building' is not relevant, and while 'England' relates to tearoom culture, it does not specify a city.",
    "Conclude that London is not only a city but also widely recognized for its rich tearoom culture, making it the best answer among the choices."
