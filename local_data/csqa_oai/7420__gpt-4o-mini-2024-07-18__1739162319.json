  "query": "Question: Where might a large dog live?\n\nChoices:\nA: guard house\nB: shake hands\nC: drink water\nD: come home\nE: small house",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand where a large dog typically lives. Large dogs need enough space to move around comfortably.",
    "Next, I can analyze each of the answer choices to see if they make sense in the context of where a large dog lives.",
    "Looking at option A, \"guard house,\" seems plausible since guard dogs often live in a designated area, which could be larger than a typical house.",
    "Option B, \"shake hands,\" doesn't represent a living space; it refers to an action, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "For option C, \"drink water,\" is also not a living space but an activity that a dog might do, thus it can be eliminated.",
    "Option D, \"come home,\" is more of an action or a concept rather than a specific living space.",
    "Finally, examining option E, \"small house,\" indicates a physical location, but it's specified as \"small,\" which generally wouldn't be suitable for a large dog.",
    "Comparing all viable options, \"guard house\" aligns best as it suggests an appropriate living environment for a large dog."
