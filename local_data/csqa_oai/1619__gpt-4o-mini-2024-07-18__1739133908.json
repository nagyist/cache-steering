  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to find a plate in the home?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: table\nC: dishwasher\nD: fridge\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a plate is. Plates are commonly used tableware for serving food.",
    "Next, think about where plates are typically stored or found in a home setting.",
    "Cabinets are standard storage places in kitchens and dining areas where dishes, including plates, are stored.",
    "While plates might be found on a table when they are in use, they are not usually stored there.",
    "A dishwasher is a machine used for cleaning dishes and plates but is not a storage place for them.",
    "A fridge is mainly used for food storage and does not typically house plates.",
    "Restaurants may have plates available, but this question specifically asks about locations within a home.",
    "Considering all these factors, the best answer would be the cabinet since that is a common storage area for plates in homes."
