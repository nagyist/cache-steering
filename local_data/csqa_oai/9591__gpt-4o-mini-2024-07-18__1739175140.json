  "steps": [
    "The question implies we are looking for a location close to home where a monkey might be found. Therefore, options that are far from home can be eliminated first.",
    "Option A (Canada) is a country far removed from typical monkey habitats, so it is unlikely to be the right choice.",
    "Option D (Amazon Basin) is also a distant location, typically inhabited by monkeys, but it is located in South America.",
    "Option E (African continent) is another large and distant area where monkeys could be found, but it does not match the likely immediate surroundings of a home.",
    "Option C (rain forest) is a type of habitat where monkeys live but isn't specific about the location; however, it is closer to home compared to countries or entire continents.",
    "Option B (friend's house) suggests a nearby location. If you lost track of the monkey at home, it might have wandered to a nearby friend's house, making this a plausible choice.",
    "Now, we compare the proximity and likelihood of finding a monkey in the remaining options. A friend's house is likely to be much closer than any of the other listed locations.",
    "Therefore, the most logical first place to look for the monkey would be at a friend's house due to its immediate proximity."
