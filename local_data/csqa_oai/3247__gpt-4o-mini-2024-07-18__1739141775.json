  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about where sugar is stored when it is not needed.",
    "I need to analyze the options provided to find the most logical place where sugar could be stored.",
    "Option A: \"coffee\" doesn't make sense as a storage place; coffee is a drink, not a storage location.",
    "Option B: \"bank locker\" is also illogical for sugar storage as it is used for valuable items, not food items like sugar.",
    "Option C: \"cupboard\" is a common place in homes where food items, including sugar, are typically stored when not in use.",
    "Option D: \"every home\" is too broad and does not specify an actual storage location.",
    "Option E: \"candy bar\" is incorrect as it refers to a specific item rather than a storage area for sugar.",
    "After reviewing the options, the best answer is that sugar is stored in the \"cupboard\" when not needed."
