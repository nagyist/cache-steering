  "query": "Question: Which coast are toll roads not near the pacific ocean on?\n\nChoices:\nA: delaware\nB: new jersey\nC: eastern united states\nD: connecticut\nE: good repair",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the regions mentioned in the question regarding toll roads and their proximity to the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Note that the Pacific Ocean is primarily along the western edge of the United States, which suggests that locations on the eastern coast are unlikely to have toll roads near the Pacific.",
    "Examine the choices given: Delaware, New Jersey, Eastern United States, Connecticut, and Good Repair.",
    "Delaware is located on the eastern coast and tends to have toll roads, but it is not near the Pacific.",
    "New Jersey is also on the eastern coast with toll roads, thus also not near the Pacific.",
    "The Eastern United States encompasses all areas that are east of the Mississippi River, including states that are far from the Pacific.",
    "Connecticut, like Delaware and New Jersey, is situated on the eastern coast and therefore has no proximity to the Pacific Ocean.",
    "The term \"Good Repair\" does not refer to a geographical location, making it irrelevant to the question about toll roads.",
    "Since both Delaware, New Jersey, and Connecticut are on the eastern seaboard, they meet the criteria of having toll roads that are not near the Pacific.",
    "Out of the options, \"Eastern United States\" encapsulates all states in the eastern region, confirming that toll roads would not be near the Pacific there either."
