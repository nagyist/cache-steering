  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"men in robes,\" which suggests a formal or ceremonial setting. This detail can help us narrow down the options.",
    "Next, let's consider where wine and crackers might be served. Wine is often associated with religious or ceremonial functions rather than casual settings.",
    "Among the options, \"church\" is a place where religious services take place, often involving rituals that include wine (like communion) and bread or crackers.",
    "The option \"bar\" is typically not associated with men in robes, as it suggests a casual drinking environment.",
    "\"Garden centre\" and \"basement\" do not relate to formal services where wine and crackers would typically be served.",
    "\"Spaghetti sauce\" is not a relevant choice, as it does not imply a location, nor does it fit the context of wine and crackers.",
    "Therefore, the only option where we can logically conclude that wine and crackers would be served by men in robes is \"church.\""
