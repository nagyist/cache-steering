  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the purpose of a company's committee meeting, which is typically to discuss business-related matters.",
    "Next, I consider the environments that are generally used for professional gatherings. A formal or professional setting is often required.",
    "Looking at the options: \nA: A church is primarily a place of worship, not suitable for business meetings.",
    "B: An office building is a reasonable choice as it pertains directly to a workplace environment.",
    "C: City hall is used for municipal matters and public administration, which is not typically a setting for a company committee meeting.",
    "D: A zoo is more of a recreational facility, not appropriate for formal meetings.",
    "E: A boardroom is specifically designed for meetings and discussions, making it a very suitable option.",
    "Comparing the remaining viable options, B (office building) and E (boardroom) are both feasible, but the boardroom is the most specific to a committee meeting context.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing all options, the most appropriate location for a company\u2019s committee meeting would be in a boardroom."
