    "The question is about the correct placement of a used salad bowl after consumption.",
    "I need to evaluate each choice to see if it makes sense for placing a used salad bowl.",
    "Option A, \"salad bar,\" indicates a place where salads are prepared and served, not a place for used dishes.",
    "Option B, \"dishwasher,\" is a common place for used dishware after a meal, as it is meant to clean them.",
    "Option C, \"trash can,\" wouldn't be appropriate unless the salad bowl is disposable or has food waste, which is not the usual case.",
