  "steps": [
    "The prompt asks how people would use their minds in a brainstorming session, which typically involves generating and discussing ideas.",
    "Option A, \"shake hands,\" does not involved creative thinking or brainstorming and is a physical action rather than a mental one.",
    "Option B, \"control events,\" suggests a sense of planning or management rather than the free-flowing generation of ideas typical of brainstorming.",
    "Option C, \"talk to each other,\" could be part of the brainstorming process, as discussing ideas is important; however, it does not fully embrace the mental aspect of using one's mind creatively.",
    "Option D, \"think creatively,\" directly aligns with the essence of brainstorming as it emphasizes generating new and innovative ideas, which is the primary purpose of a brainstorming session.",
    "Option E, \"dress themselves,\" is irrelevant in the context of using minds to brainstorm ideas, as it pertains more to personal grooming rather than mental activities.",
    "From the options provided, the most fitting one that encapsulates the mental exercise required in brainstorming is \"think creatively.\""
