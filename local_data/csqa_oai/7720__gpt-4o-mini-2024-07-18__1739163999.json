  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions a little girl smiling and pointing, which typically indicates something positive or cheerful.",
    "The word \"big\" in the phrase suggests that the thing she is pointing to is something large or significant, which might be an object or a phenomenon rather than an emotional state or concept.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"cry\" (A) and \"frown\" (E) are negative emotions or expressions and do not align with the context of smiling.",
    "\"Happy\" (C) is an emotion but not something one can point at; it is intangible and doesn\u2019t fit with the word \"big.\"",
    "The phrase \"make others happy too\" (D) implies a potential action or effect but does not refer to a physical object or phenomena that could be pointed at.",
    "\"Rainbow\" (B) is a physical phenomenon that is often associated with happiness and wonder, and it can be described as \"big\" in the context of its visual impact.",
    "Considering the context of a little girl smiling and the use of \"big,\" it seems most plausible that she is pointing out something visually appealing and large.",
    "Among the provided choices, \"rainbow\" (B) fits perfectly as it is a large and colorful natural occurrence that a child would likely admire and point to while smiling."
