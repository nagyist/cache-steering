  "query": "Question: If one is contemplating during meditation, what does one strive for?\n\nChoices:\nA: deep thoughts\nB: action\nC: new discovery\nD: clear thought\nE: sense of fulfillment",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question is meditation, which often involves mental processes aimed at achieving a certain state of mind.",
    "In meditation, individuals typically aim to calm their mind and focus their thoughts rather than engage in active thinking or over-analysis.",
    "The term \"contemplating\" suggests a reflective and thoughtful process, aiming for clarity rather than complexity.",
    "Among the choices, \"deep thoughts\" (A) can imply complexity and layering, which is usually not the goal of meditation.",
    "\"Action\" (B) contradicts the essence of meditation, which is about stillness and inner peace rather than external engagement.",
    "\"New discovery\" (C) might imply generating new ideas or insights, which is more aligned with exploration rather than the tranquility sought in meditation.",
    "Conversely, \"clear thought\" (D) aligns well with common meditation goals, which include achieving mental clarity and focus.",
    "Lastly, while \"sense of fulfillment\" (E) may occasionally be an outcome of meditation, it is not a direct objective that practitioners typically strive for during the process.",
    "Considering all these factors, the primary focus during meditation is likely to be achieving a \"clear thought\" state."
