  "steps": [
    "To understand why the line formed outside of the hot-dog stand, we should consider the primary reason people queue up at food vendors.",
    "Typically, individuals line up at food stands to wait for their chance to order and get food rather than having a chaotic free-for-all.",
    "The option \"wait turn\" suggests that the line is there for the purpose of orderly service, which is a common practice at food stands.",
    "The next option, \"tickets,\" does not apply here because a hot-dog stand usually does not require tickets to order food.",
    "\"Cirque act\" is unrelated as it implies something entertaining and not typically seen at a food vendor like a hot-dog stand.",
    "\"Polite\" is too vague and does not directly explain the action that causes the line to form; it's more of an adjective than a reason.",
    "\"Money from bank\" is not relevant because it does not explain why people would queue outside a hot-dog stand.",
    "After reviewing all the options, \"wait turn\" clearly and logically explains the reason for the line formation, as it emphasizes orderly queuing at the food stand."
