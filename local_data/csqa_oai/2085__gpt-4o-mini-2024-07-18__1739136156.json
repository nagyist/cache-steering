  "query": "Question: Denny couldn't find his hairbrush.  He looked everywhere for it.  Under and over, up and down, it was not where he thought it would be.  So he closed the door behind him and continued his systematic search.  Where might Denny have looked first?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: kitchen\nC: car\nD: drugstore\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Denny looked everywhere, but we need to determine where he might have looked first. Since the search was systematic and described as thorough, it\u2019s logical to analyze the places most commonly associated with his hairbrush.",
    "Denny's hairbrush is typically an item found in spaces where personal grooming occurs. The most likely first place for Denny to check would be his personal spaces, such as his bedroom or bathroom.",
    "Among the options provided, 'bedroom' appears to be the most probable place Denny would check first, as it is a personal space typically associated with grooming items.",
    "The kitchen (B), car (C), and drugstore (D) seem less likely to have a hairbrush, as they are not typically locations where grooming tools are stored.",
    "Although Denny could technically search the whole house (A), including other rooms, the question asks specifically where he might have looked first, guiding us toward personal spaces closest to personal hygiene.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, 'bedroom' is the most logical option to be chosen as the first choice Denny would have made in searching for his hairbrush."
