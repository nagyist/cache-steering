  "query": "Question: When do people go shopping for souvenirs?\n\nChoices:\nA: having money\nB: money and time\nC: funeral\nD: spending money\nE: travel",
  "steps": [
    "To determine when people go shopping for souvenirs, we should first consider the common context in which souvenir shopping occurs.",
    "Souvenirs are typically purchased during travel as a way to capture memories or commemorate a place visited.",
    "The act of shopping for souvenirs is not necessarily dependent on just having money, but also on being in a location that is worth remembering.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"having money\" (A) is not specific to souvenirs as people shop for many reasons.",
    "The option \"money and time\" (B) does not specifically relate to the context of traveling to buy souvenirs; people might have time and money but not be in a suitable context for souvenirs.",
    "\"Funeral\" (C) is an extreme context unlikely to be associated with the act of buying souvenirs.",
    "\"Spending money\" (D) is very general and does not specifically connect to the theme of souvenirs during travel.",
    "The option \"travel\" (E) directly relates to when people typically go shopping for souvenirs, as it implies they are in another location.",
    "Therefore, among the provided alternatives, \"travel\" is the most accurate answer to when people go shopping for souvenirs."
