  "query": "Question: If a person has clean laundry in the basement, what will they have to do in order to put it away in the bedroom?\n\nChoices:\nA: die at home\nB: cross street\nC: climb stairs\nD: make dinner\nE: love objects",
  "steps": [
    "We start by identifying the location of the clean laundry, which is in the basement.",
    "In order to put the laundry away in the bedroom, the person needs to physically transport it from the basement to the bedroom.",
    "Given that the laundry is in the basement, the person would most likely need to go up to reach the bedroom, which is typically on a higher level in a house.",
    "To move from the basement to the bedroom, the most direct way would be to climb stairs, as basements and bedrooms are usually separated by at least one level.",
    "We can eliminate options A, B, D, and E based on the context:\n- A (die at home) is irrelevant to the task of putting away laundry.\n- B (cross street) does not pertain to the action of moving laundry within a house.\n- D (make dinner) is unrelated to the task at hand.\n- E (love objects) also has no connection to moving laundry.",
    "The only option that logically fits the requirement of getting the laundry from the basement to the bedroom is to go up, which would be achieved by climbing stairs."
