  "query": "Question: What is likely to happen if you're doing housework all day?\n\nChoices:\nA: boredom\nB: tiredness\nC: get tired\nD: backache\nE: get a clean house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what housework typically involves, such as cleaning, organizing, and other physical tasks.",
    "Next, recognize that performing these tasks for an extended period can lead to physical fatigue.",
    "Then, evaluate the implications of being physically active for a long time. This often results in tiredness.",
    "Also, think about how the repetitive movements of housework may lead to muscle strain or discomfort.",
    "Consider the psychological impact as well. Doing housework all day can lead to boredom for some individuals.",
    "It's also worth noting that one of the outcomes of housework is a clean house.",
    "However, the focus of the question seems to be on the physical and psychological effects experienced during the process.",
    "Now, compare the choices. While boredom (A) can happen, it\u2019s not a guaranteed outcome. Tiredness (B) and getting tired (C) are closely related, as they express the same physical fatigue.",
    "Backache (D) could happen due to physical strain, but it\u2019s not as universally applicable as tiredness.",
    "Lastly, the clean house (E) is a result of the housework itself, not an effect of doing housework all day."
