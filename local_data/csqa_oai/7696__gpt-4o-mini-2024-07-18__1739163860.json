  "query": "Question: Where do spirits haunt outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar\nB: funeral home\nC: haunted house\nD: liquor cabinet\nE: cemetary",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is generally associated with spirits or hauntings. Spirits are often linked to locations where people have experienced significant emotional events, such as death or tragedy.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. A bar (A) is primarily a place for social gathering, and while it may have stories associated with spirits, it does not generally evoke a haunting atmosphere.",
    "Then, look at a funeral home (B). This location deals with death and mourning, making it a relevant site for spiritual encounters; however, it is an interior space rather than outdoors.",
    "Now, consider a haunted house (C). Haunted houses are typically designed to simulate fright and are often associated with ghost stories and supernatural events. However, they are also usually located indoors, even if they are part of a yard or outdoor attraction.",
    "Evaluate a liquor cabinet (D). This is a place within a home and does not represent an outdoor setting, making it an unsuitable option for spirits to haunt outside.",
    "Finally, reflect on the cemetery (E). Cemeteries are outdoor spaces where the deceased are laid to rest, making them one of the most traditional locations associated with hauntings and spiritual presence, aligning well with the concept of spirits haunting outside."
