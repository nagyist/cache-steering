  "query": "Question: How do birds have babies?\n\nChoices:\nA: sing songs\nB: sleep together\nC: lay eggs\nD: spread wings\nE: reproduce",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the fundamental reproductive method used by birds.",
    "Birds typically reproduce through a process known as oviposition, which involves laying eggs.",
    "Egg laying is a common characteristic of birds, distinct from mammals that often give live birth.",
    "Bird eggs contain an embryo that develops into a chick within the egg, facilitated by external conditions like warmth.",
    "The other options (A, B, D, E) do not correctly describe the biological method by which birds produce offspring.",
    "While \"E: reproduce\" can be considered correct in a broad sense, it doesn\u2019t specify the unique method employed by birds, which is egg-laying.",
    "Thus, \"C: lay eggs\" directly addresses the specific biological process used by birds to have babies."
