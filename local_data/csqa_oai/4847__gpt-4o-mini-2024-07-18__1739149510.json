  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a type of core value that is \"likely to not be trivial,\" suggesting that we should consider values that have notable impact or importance in a significant manner.",
    "The term \"trivial\" typically refers to something insignificant or of little value. Therefore, we should look for words that indicate strength or seriousness in value.",
    "Considering the choices provided, terms such as \"important,\" \"significant,\" \"fundamental,\" and \"radical\" all suggest a degree of value or importance.",
    "The word \"important\" implies that something has relevance or consequence. However, it may not necessarily convey the depth of importance implied by \"core values.\"",
    "The term \"significant\" carries weight and suggests that something has considerable meaning or influence, aligning well with the idea of core values.",
    "\"Fundamental\" suggests that something is essential or foundational, indicating that it is crucial and not trivial at all. Core values are often seen as fundamental to a person's beliefs or to organizations.",
    "The word \"radical\" implies a value that may be extreme or transformative. While this can be significant, it doesn't directly relate to typical core values compared to the other options.",
    "Evaluating the strongest candidates: \"fundamental\" not only indicates importance but also highlights the essential nature of core values, suggesting they are core and not trivial.",
    "Both \"significant\" and \"fundamental\" stand out as strong contenders. However, \"fundamental\" is more closely associated with being a foundational principle.",
    "Finally, since we are looking for a value that is definitely not trivial, \"fundamental\" aligns most closely with the idea of core values being essential and integral to identity or purpose."
