  "query": "Question: What are all living things that have at least one nerve called?\n\nChoices:\nA: person's body\nB: brainstem\nC: organism\nD: turtles\nE: fingertips",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to understand the definition of living things that have at least one nerve. This generally refers to any individual living entity that has nervous tissue or nerve structures.",
    "Examining the answer choices, we can analyze each one in terms of whether it fits the definition of a living entity with nerves.",
    "Choice A: \"person's body\" is not specifically a living thing itself, but rather a collection of organisms (cells and systems). Thus, it doesn't directly answer the question.",
    "Choice B: \"brainstem\" is a part of the central nervous system in organisms, not a complete living entity, so it does not fulfill the requirement of being a living thing.",
    "Choice C: \"organism\" refers to any living individual, which inherently includes entities that have at least one nerve. This is a broad classification that fits the requirement perfectly.",
    "Choice D: \"turtles\" are a specific type of organism. While they do have nerves, this choice is not all-encompassing and only represents one specific category of living things.",
    "Choice E: \"fingertips\" are parts of a person's body and also, like choice A, do not represent a living thing, but rather a structure within a living thing.",
    "Out of all the choices, \"organism\" (Choice C) is the only one that clearly signifies any living entity with nerves, regardless of its type or category."
