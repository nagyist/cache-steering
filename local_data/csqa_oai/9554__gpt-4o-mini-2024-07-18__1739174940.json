  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that there was a limit to how many could enter.",
    "The phrase \"would only allow one more in\" suggests that anyone who does not meet certain criteria cannot enter.",
    "The word \"unfortunately\" implies that there is a negative connotation regarding the individual trying to enter.",
    "The word \"forbid\" (Choice A) means to prohibit someone from doing something, which does not directly align with the context of a person trying to enter.",
    "The word \"deny\" (Choice B) suggests that something was not granted, but does not specifically indicate rejection based on a person's status.",
    "The words \"reject\" (Choices C and D) mean to dismiss or refuse someone, clearly relating to the context of not allowing a person in.",
    "Both Choice C (\"reject\") and Choice D (\"reject\") have the same meaning, creating a redundancy.",
    "The remaining choice \"permitted\" (Choice E) indicates allowance, which contradicts the overall implication of the sentence.",
    "Since \"reject\" captures the action taken against the person, this is the correct answer."
