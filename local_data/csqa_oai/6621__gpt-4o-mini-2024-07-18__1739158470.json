  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you would normally find two eyes.",
    "Typically, two eyes are associated with living beings, particularly humans.",
    "Looking at the choices, I will evaluate each one.",
    "Choice A states \"someones face.\" This is a correct statement since faces typically have two eyes.",
    "Choice B states \"faces.\" This is also correct as faces in general (including those of humans) typically feature two eyes.",
    "Choice C states \"person's head.\" This is true as eyes are located on the face, which is part of the head.",
    "Choice D states \"potato.\" This is not correct since potatoes do not have eyes in the sense of sight; they do have \"eyes,\" but those are growth buds.",
    "Choice E is identical to choice A, \"someones face,\" so it will yield the same reasoning.",
    "Choices A, B, and C are all valid since they all refer to locations typically associated with having two eyes.",
    "However, to choose one, \"C: person's head\" is the most encompassing option since it refers to the general location of the eyes as part of the person's anatomy."
