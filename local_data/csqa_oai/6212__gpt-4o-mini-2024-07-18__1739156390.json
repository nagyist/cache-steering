  "query": "Question: Where is a shelf likely to be made of wire?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: cupboard\nC: corner\nD: bookstore\nE: hades",
  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the options one by one to identify where a shelf is likely to be made of wire.",
    "Option A: refrigerator - Refrigerators often have wire shelves to allow for better air circulation and easy cleaning. This makes wire shelves common in refrigerators.",
    "Option B: cupboard - Cupboards typically have wooden or plastic shelves. It's less common for cupboards to have wire shelves.",
    "Option C: corner - \"Corner\" does not specify a type of storage; it refers more to a location than to a specific structure where wire shelves would be utilized.",
    "Option D: bookstore - Bookstores generally use wooden or metal shelves to display books. Wire shelves are less common in this context but not entirely impossible; however, they are more typically used in display cases or for storage.",
    "Option E: hades - Hades represents a mythological concept rather than a physical structure, so it wouldn't be applicable for shelves of any kind.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most suitable answer is Option A (refrigerator) because it is a well-known setting for the use of wire shelves."
