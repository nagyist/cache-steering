  "query": "Question: Every one of the kids felt average, but the teacher explained that each one was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: uncommon\nB: an adult\nC: bad\nD: special\nE: hyperbolic",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that every one of the kids felt average, which implies that they might have a perception of being ordinary or not standing out in a positive way.",
    "The teacher's explanation is likely aimed at countering or reframing the children's perception of themselves, indicating that they are not merely average.",
    "I need to analyze the choices available: \n- A: uncommon suggests they are not typical kids.\n- B: an adult implies they are mature, but this doesn't seem to relate to the context of feeling average.\n- C: bad suggests a negative quality, which is unlikely to be what the teacher would express.\n- D: special suggests that each child has unique qualities, possibly something the teacher would want to convey to uplift them.\n- E: hyperbolic suggests exaggeration, which doesn't fit well with the context of encouragement.",
    "Given the context of the teacher trying to affirm the kids' worth, \"special\" aligns closely with a positive encouragement that counters the feeling of being average.",
    "The teacher would likely want to express that even if the kids feel average, each has unique qualities that should be recognized, thus supporting the idea that they are \"special.\"",
    "Choices A, B, C, and E do not convey this supportive message as effectively as D does.",
    "Consequently, \"special\" fits as the teacher's intended message to uplift the children's spirits."
