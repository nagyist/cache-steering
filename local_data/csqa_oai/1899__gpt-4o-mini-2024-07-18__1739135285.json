  "query": "Question: Where might I find a decanter outside of drinking alcohol?\n\nChoices:\nA: georgia\nB: kitchen cupboard\nC: brewery\nD: chemistry lab\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the function of a decanter. A decanter is primarily used for holding and serving liquids. While it's commonly associated with wine, it can also be used for other liquids.",
    "Next, I should evaluate each option to see where a decanter might be applicable outside of its traditional use for alcohol.",
    "Option A, Georgia, does not specify a context in which a decanter would be found, so it\u2019s less likely to be the right answer.",
    "Option B, kitchen cupboard, is a place where various kitchenware is stored, including potentially decanters used for things like oils, vinegars, or other cooking materials.",
    "Option C, brewery, suggests usage related to beer production, and while brewers may use similar vessels, it's not a common place for decanters outside of drinking contexts.",
    "Option D, chemistry lab, makes the most sense for decanters, as they are often used in scientific settings to separate mixtures or hold various chemicals under controlled conditions.",
    "Option E, restaurant, may have decanters but is primarily associated with serving drinks, which again leans towards alcohol consumption.",
    "Considering these options, the most fitting choice that includes decanters used outside of alcohol-related contexts is the chemistry lab."
