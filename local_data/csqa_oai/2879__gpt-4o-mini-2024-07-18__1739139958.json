  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a person who achieved success was regarded as by peers.",
    "Success typically garners positive reactions from others, especially peers in a similar field or context.",
    "Among the choices given, \"congratulated\" is a reaction that aligns with the idea of celebrating someone else's success.",
    "The other options, such as \"critical thinking,\" \"kick him,\" \"equal opportunity,\" and \"own house,\" do not logically fit as reactions to someone's success.",
    "\"Critical thinking\" is a skill, \"kick him\" suggests a negative or violent reaction, \"equal opportunity\" refers to a concept rather than a reaction, and \"own house\" does not relate to peer reactions at all.",
    "Considering the context of peers responding to someone\u2019s success, \"congratulated\" is the only appropriate choice.",
    "Thus, the answer has to be one that signifies a positive acknowledgment of success."
