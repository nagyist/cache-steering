  "query": "Question: If your joke is funny you will not experience surprise if someone does what?\n\nChoices:\nA: scare\nB: send flowers\nC: laugh\nD: cries\nE: keep secret",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the relationship between the joke being funny and the potential reactions from someone.",
    "If the joke is funny, it is likely that laughter is an expected and normal reaction.",
    "Thinking about the provided options, if someone were to laugh at a funny joke, it would not be surprising; it would match the anticipation created by the humor.",
    "Next, consider the other options: if someone scares you, sends flowers, cries, or keeps a secret, these reactions do not typically follow from telling a funny joke.",
    "Surprise would be expected for all of the other choices except for laughter, as they do not align with the typical expectation of a response to a joke.",
    "Hence, if someone laughs after hearing a funny joke, it reinforces the humor and does not evoke surprise.",
    "In contrast, scare, send flowers, cry, or keep a secret would be reactions that could evoke surprise if the joke was funny.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that you would not experience surprise if someone laughs after a funny joke."
