  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about what a student is encouraged to do as they mature, implying a focus on development and independence.",
    "Among the options, we need to identify actions that reflect increased personal responsibility and cognitive development typical of maturation.",
    "Option A, \"wait in line,\" does not specifically relate to personal growth or critical thinking; it\u2019s more about compliance.",
    "Option B, \"do extra credit,\" suggests an effort to improve academically, but it may not encompass the broader concept of maturation and independence.",
    "Option C, \"cross road,\" is metaphorical but seems more about taking risks or making decisions rather than maturity.",
    "Option D, \"think for himself,\" directly relates to developing personal thought, judgment, and independence, which is central to maturity.",
    "Option E, \"study book,\" indicates academic diligence but again does not strongly connect to the independence and critical thinking associated with maturation.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"think for himself\" stands out as the most relevant to a student's maturation process, emphasizing autonomy and critical thinking."
