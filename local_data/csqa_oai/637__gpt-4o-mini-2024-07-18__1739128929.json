  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for an appropriate location for a school.",
    "Schools are typically found in areas where there are residents and families who may need educational services.",
    "A residential neighborhood is specifically designed for housing and would likely have families with children requiring schools.",
    "While a mosque can serve as a community center, it is not primarily designed for educational purposes.",
    "\u201cEvery city\u201d suggests that schools can be found in urban areas, but it does not specify if they are well-placed within those cities.",
    "\u201cPrague\u201d is a specific city, which does not universally apply to all schools.",
    "\u201cCommunity\u201d could imply areas that support schools, but it is not as specific as a residential neighborhood.",
    "Considering all factors, a residential neighborhood is the most logical and focused answer for where to find a school, as it is designed to cater to families.",
    "However, the choice \u201cevery city\u201d also suggests that schools are universally located in city areas, which is also a common and valid point.",
    "On balance, \u201cevery city\u201d is the most inclusive option, as it encompasses a broad variety of locations, including residential neighborhoods."
