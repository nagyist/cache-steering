  "query": "Question: Where would you see people in uniform playing with a ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: hole\nB: television\nC: sporting goods store\nD: pool table\nE: sporting event",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of \"people in uniform.\" Uniforms are typically associated with specific groups or organizations, particularly in sports.",
    "Next, think about the activity \"playing with a ball.\" This suggests an outdoor or indoor sport that involves a ball.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices provided. Choice A (hole) doesn't imply any context of uniforms or playing with a ball.",
    "Choice B (television) could show people in uniform, but they aren't actually \"playing\" there; it's through a screen.",
    "Choice C (sporting goods store) indicates a place where sports equipment is sold, but it\u2019s not where people actively play.",
    "Choice D (pool table) refers to a specific game (pool) but typically involves fewer players and may not always involve uniforms, which are more common in team sports.",
    "Now, consider choice E (sporting event). This is commonly a gathering where people are actively playing teams in uniforms, and balls are used in many sports.",
    "Comparing all the previous steps, it's clear that the best fit for \"people in uniform playing with a ball\" is at a sporting event."
