  "steps": [
    "The question asks what Discovery has a number of, starring a shark. My first thought is to identify the nature of the content related to sharks that Discovery is known for.",
    "Discovery Channel typically features documentaries and shows related to nature, wildlife, and marine life, particularly focused on oceanic themes.",
    "One of the most well-known shows that fits the description of starring a shark is \"Shark Week,\" an annual programming block dedicated to the study and celebration of sharks.",
    "Considering the options, I need to determine which one aligns best with a TV show or program format, as \"Shark Week\" is a television program.",
    "Option A, \"open ocean,\" and option E, \"coral reef,\" refer more to environments rather than a specific program.",
    "Option B, \"gulf of mexico,\" is a geographical location and does not represent a television program.",
    "Option C, \"tornado,\" does not relate to sharks or marine content, and instead points towards weather-related themes, which are not relevant here.",
    "Thus, the only option that represents what Discovery is known for in terms of content featuring sharks is option D, \"television program.\""
