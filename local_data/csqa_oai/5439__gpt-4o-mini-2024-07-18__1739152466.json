    "To determine the context in which an arch is strong, we need to consider where arches are commonly used. Arches are structural elements that can bear weight effectively.",
    "Arches are commonly found in architecture, especially in buildings, bridges, and monumental structures. They distribute weight evenly and provide stability.",
    "A cathedral, as a type of building, often utilizes arches in its design, particularly in gothic architecture where pointed arches are common.",
    "Bridges also use arches in their design to support loads, especially in arch bridges which rely on the strength of the arch shape.",
    "The term \"building\" is broad and encompasses a variety of structures, including residential, commercial, and religious buildings, all of which can incorporate arches.",
    "\"Ancient Rome\" refers to a historical period and location known for its advanced architecture, including arches, but does not specify a type of structure.",
    "\"Hole\" does not logically connect with arches, as it suggests an absence of material rather than a structural element.",
    "Considering the choices, both \"cathedral\" and \"bridge\" involve arches, but \"building\" is the most general term encompassing various structures, including both cathedrals and bridges.",
    "Therefore, since arches are a very strong way to have a doorway in a building in general, the best answer that encompasses all possibilities, aside from specific structures, is \"C: building.\""
