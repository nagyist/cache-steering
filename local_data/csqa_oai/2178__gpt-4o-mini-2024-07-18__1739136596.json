  "query": "Question: Where do humans go to be entertained and eat popcorn?\n\nChoices:\nA: mall\nB: country\nC: movie theatre\nD: park\nE: university",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the place where humans often go to be entertained and eat popcorn, we first consider the common activities associated with each option.",
    "The options include a mall, country, movie theatre, park, and university. We should analyze where popcorn is typically eaten.",
    "Popcorn is most often associated with activities like watching movies. Therefore, we need to look for a place where watching movies is a central activity.",
    "A movie theatre is specifically designed for watching films, and it also has a concession stand where popcorn is sold. So, this seems like a strong candidate.",
    "Next, we compare the other options: \n- A mall does have theatres, but it's a broader shopping and entertainment venue and not focused solely on movies and popcorn. \n- The country doesn't relate directly to entertainment in this context.\n- A park may have recreational activities, but popcorn isn\u2019t a typical snack associated with parks.\n- A university might have events or films, but it is primarily an educational institution where popcorn isn't a common offering.",
    "Given this reasoning, we can conclude that the primary location associated with both entertainment and the consumption of popcorn is the movie theatre."
