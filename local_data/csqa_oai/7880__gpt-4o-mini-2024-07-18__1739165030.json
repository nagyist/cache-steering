  "query": "Question: The foreman told the new worker to stop standing in the way and to do what in regards to the dangerous equipment?\n\nChoices:\nA: get off\nB: sit down\nC: step out of\nD: have moved\nE: move away from",
  "steps": [
    "The foreman is addressing a new worker who is likely unfamiliar with the workplace and the dangers it poses. The foreman instructs the worker to stop standing in the way, indicating that the worker's current position is unsafe.",
    "Since the equipment is described as dangerous, the foreman would likely want the worker to maintain a safe distance from it to prevent potential accidents or injuries.",
    "Among the answer choices, I need to identify the phrasing that best describes the action the foreman is asking the worker to take regarding their position relative to the dangerous equipment.",
    "Analyzing the options: \n- A: get off - does not specify a distance from the equipment.\n- B: sit down - does not imply moving away from the equipment.\n- C: step out of - suggests moving away from something but does not necessarily mean a safe distance from the equipment.\n- D: have moved - is not a direct instruction.\n- E: move away from - indicates a clear directive to create distance from the dangerous equipment.",
    "Comparing C and E, \"move away from\" explicitly instructs the worker to distance themselves from the danger, making it the most appropriate choice considering safety.",
    "Thus, the best answer that conveys the foreman\u2019s intent for the worker in relation to the dangerous equipment is \"move away from.\""
