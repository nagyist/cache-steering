  "query": "Question: Brenda spent a lot of effort on washing herself.  She hated what?\n\nChoices:\nA: get messy\nB: cleaning\nC: get dirty\nD: getting dirty\nE: being dirty",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that Brenda \"spent a lot of effort on washing herself,\" indicating that cleaning is important to her.",
    "Since she is putting effort into washing, it implies she dislikes the state that requires her to wash, which is likely associated with being unclean.",
    "The phrasing \"hated what?\" suggests we are looking for a negative sentiment associated with the state of being unclean.",
    "The choices include various forms of the negative feelings associated with being unclean or needing to wash.",
    "Choice A (\"get messy\") is more about the act of becoming messy, which isn\u2019t as directly linked to the need for washing.",
    "Choice B (\"cleaning\") is about the act of removing dirt rather than being dirty, which doesn't match with her effort to wash away dirt.",
    "Choice C (\"get dirty\") refers to the process of becoming unclean, but doesn\u2019t encompass her feelings about that state.",
    "Choice D (\"getting dirty\") reflects the same idea as C but is phrased differently and still does not directly convey her feelings.",
    "Choice E (\"being dirty\") directly addresses the state she dislikes, which aligns perfectly with her effort to wash away dirt.",
    "The word \"being\" implies a current and ongoing state, which is likely what Brenda hates and leads her to expend effort on washing."
