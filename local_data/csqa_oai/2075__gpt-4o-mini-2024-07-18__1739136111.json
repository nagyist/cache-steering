  "query": "Question: The security detail had to keep an eye on the entire crowd, they were constantly scanning all the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: potato\nB: body\nC: focus\nD: faces\nE: person's head",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the security detail was responsible for monitoring the crowd effectively.",
    "To monitor a crowd, security guards typically look for recognizable features of individuals in the crowd.",
    "The options presented include a variety of unrelated terms, such as \"potato,\" \"body,\" \"focus,\" \"faces,\" and \"person's head.\"",
    "Among these options, \"faces\" is closely related to the act of observing individuals in a crowd, as faces are unique identifying features of each person.",
    "The word \"body\" could also relate to monitoring, but it's less specific than \"faces,\" which more directly describes what security would be scanning for.",
    "The options \"potato,\" \"focus,\" and \"person's head\" do not correlate as strongly with the action of keeping an eye on a crowd.",
    "Therefore, similar reasoning suggests that the most reasonable and relevant choice is \"faces,\" as that term encompasses the distinction and identification necessary for crowd monitoring."
