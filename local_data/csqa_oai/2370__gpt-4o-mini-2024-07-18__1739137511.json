  "query": "Question: Where can you find a rubber shark as a villain?\n\nChoices:\nA: museum\nB: outside\nC: bad movie\nD: sea world\nE: marine museum",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a \"rubber shark\" as a villain. This suggests it is likely part of a fictional narrative rather than a real-life scenario.",
    "Next, analyze the answer choices. A museum and a marine museum could potentially have rubber sharks, but these are typically not associated with villainy.",
    "Examine the choice \"outside.\" While you might see some rubber sharks as toys outside, it is unlikely they would be portrayed as villains in that context.",
    "Now look at \"sea world.\" Although it is an aquatic environment, it would not present rubber sharks in a villainous way.",
    "Consider the choice \"bad movie.\" Many bad movies, especially B-movies or low-budget films, could feature rubber sharks as comical or villainous characters.",
    "Reflect on the typical themes of bad movies, which often take an exaggerated or campy approach to villains, including rubber sharks.",
    "Evaluate all the choices again. Both museums and marine parks would not depict a rubber shark as a villain, while a \"bad movie\" scenario fits the description.",
    "Reaffirm that \"bad movie\" captures the essence of a rubber shark as a ridiculous villain, contrasting with the other choices.",
    "Summarize all findings. The only logical option that depicts a rubber shark as a villain is in the context of a bad movie."
