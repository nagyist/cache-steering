  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a human could go to be near their ancestors, which implies a location that holds significance related to deceased relatives or forebears.",
    "Option A, \"civilisation,\" refers to human society but does not imply a specific connection to ancestors or their remains.",
    "Option B, \"underground,\" is too vague and does not necessarily relate to ancestors or their resting places.",
    "Option C, \"graveyard,\" is a place specifically designed for burying the deceased, making it very closely related to ancestors.",
    "Option D, \"spacecraft,\" refers to a vehicle designed for space travel, which has no relevance to being near ancestors.",
    "Option E, \"space shuttle,\" is also related to space travel and does not connect to ancestors in any meaningful way.",
    "Among the options analyzed, the graveyard is the only one that directly connects to the concept of being near ancestors.",
    "Thus, the logical choice based on the connection to ancestors is option C."
