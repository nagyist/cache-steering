  "query": "Question: Where should you store a fiddle when you're not playing it?\n\nChoices:\nA: violin case\nB: tennessee\nC: music store\nD: bluegrass\nE: alabama",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a fiddle is. A fiddle is essentially a violin, commonly used in folk music genres, particularly bluegrass and country.",
    "Next, think about the purpose of storing a fiddle. The main goal is to protect it from damage when it's not being played.",
    "A violin case is specifically designed to store and protect violins (and fiddles), keeping them safe from environmental factors and physical damage.",
    "Other options, such as \"Tennessee,\" \"music store,\" \"bluegrass,\" and \"Alabama,\" do not provide the same level of protection as a fiddle case would.",
    "While a music store might be a place to keep an instrument for sale or storage, it\u2019s not a practical or secure solution for personal storage when you\u2019re not using the fiddle.",
    "\"Bluegrass\" is a genre of music rather than a storage location.",
    "Evaluating all options, the only choice that directly addresses the need for proper storage and protection of a fiddle is the violin case.",
    "Therefore, the best answer based on these reasoning points is the violin case."
