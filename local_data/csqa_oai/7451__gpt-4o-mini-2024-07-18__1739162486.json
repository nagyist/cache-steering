  "query": "Question: Where would you get a marker if you do not have one?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: desk\nC: pocket\nD: drawer\nE: briefcase",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine places one might typically find or acquire a marker.",
    "An office supply store is a common location where various types of markers can be purchased, indicating it's a likely answer.",
    "A desk may also have a marker, but the question specifies that I do not currently have one.",
    "A pocket is generally not a place one would obtain a marker; it is more likely to be a place where one might store small items.",
    "A drawer could potentially contain markers, but the question indicates that I do not have one, suggesting I need a new source outside of where I might have previously looked.",
    "A briefcase could function as a storage area for markers, but again, it's not a place to obtain a new marker.",
    "Evaluating the choices, the office supply store remains the best option because it specifically is a place one would go to acquire a marker if they do not already have one.",
    "Therefore, considering all of the options, the most logical location for obtaining a marker is an office supply store."
