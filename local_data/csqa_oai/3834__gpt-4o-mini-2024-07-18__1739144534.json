  "query": "Question: The school has three wings and had enough space for 5000 students. How might one describe it?\n\nChoices:\nA: buffalo\nB: hospital\nC: birdhouse\nD: mansion\nE: large building",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the school has three wings and can accommodate 5000 students.",
    "This indicates that the building is quite large, as it can hold a significant number of students.",
    "The presence of \"wings\" typically suggests a multi-story or expansive layout commonly associated with educational institutions or large public buildings.",
    "Now, let's evaluate each option provided in the choices against the description of a large school building.",
    "Option A: \"buffalo\" does not relate to a building or structure.",
    "Option B: \"hospital\" suggests a building for healthcare purposes, which does not align directly with a school.",
    "Option C: \"birdhouse\" is typically small and implies a structure for birds, which is not comparable to a school.",
    "Option D: \"mansion\" is usually a large residence, but it does not fit the context of a school.",
    "Option E: \"large building\" accurately describes a facility that has enough space for 5000 students and has multiple wings.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best choice that describes the school is E: \"large building.\""
