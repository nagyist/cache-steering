  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the cabinets were imported and that John bought them because he thought they would look good. This suggests that they are intended for a visually appealing installation.",
    "The choices given include various locations and uses for cabinets, and the options A (kitchen) and B (pantry) imply residential areas where cabinets are commonly found.",
    "Option C refers to cabinets that contain pots and pans, which indicates a specific use rather than a location. This is relevant, but doesn't specify where these cabinets would actually be installed.",
    "Option D (in a flight) does not logically fit the context of cabinets because cabinets are not typically found or installed in flight situations like airplanes.",
    "Option E (Mexico) refers to a country, which does not provide a specific installation location and doesn\u2019t answer where the cabinets might be placed within a residence.",
    "Considering the context of cabinets being visually appealing and imported, they are most commonly used in a kitchen setting, as kitchens are a primary place for cabinets and where aesthetics matter.",
    "The pantry could also house cabinets, but the primary and most common usage of visually appealing imported cabinets is typically in the kitchen."
