  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what is meant by a test that is \"not hard.\" This implies the test is manageable, straightforward, or simple to an extent.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided: A (tricky), B (agreeable), C (easy), D (bearable), E (tryhard).",
    "Analyzing option A: \"tricky\" suggests a test that may be difficult due to its deceptive nature, which does not align with the idea of being not hard.",
    "Now, consider option B: \"agreeable.\" This relates more to how one feels about the test rather than its difficulty level; thus, it is not suitable.",
    "Looking at option C: \"easy.\" This directly aligns with the concept of a test being not hard, suggesting a low level of difficulty.",
    "Next, analyze option D: \"bearable.\" While this implies that the test is tolerable, it does not specifically mean it is not hard; it could be moderately difficult but still tolerable.",
    "Finally, evaluate option E: \"tryhard.\" This term generally suggests effort or attempting to do something at maximum capacity and doesn't relate to the hardness of the test.",
    "From the analysis, option C (easy) is the most fitting choice for a test that is not hard, as it denotes straightforwardness and minimum difficulty."
