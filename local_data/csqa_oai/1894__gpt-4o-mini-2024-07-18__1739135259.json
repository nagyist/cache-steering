  "query": "Question: What was the practical husband concerned most about when house shopping?\n\nChoices:\nA: arriving\nB: location\nC: excitement\nD: movement\nE: expense",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the practical husband and his concerns while house shopping.",
    "The word \"practical\" implies that he is likely considering realistic and sensible factors rather than emotional or impulsive ones.",
    "Among the provided choices, we need to identify concerns that a practical husband would have during the process of house shopping.",
    "Choice A, \"arriving,\" does not seem relevant to house shopping as it does not pertain to the key factors in purchasing a home.",
    "Choice B, \"location,\" is a key factor in real estate, as it affects access to amenities, job opportunities, and overall satisfaction with the home.",
    "Choice C, \"excitement,\" while it may describe an emotional state during house shopping, it is not a practical concern a husband would focus on.",
    "Choice D, \"movement,\" lacks context in house shopping and does not indicate a specific concern.",
    "Choice E, \"expense,\" is also a critical factor when house shopping, as it relates to budgeting and financial planning for purchasing a home.",
    "Now we evaluate between \"location\" and \"expense.\" Both are practical concerns, but generally, a practical husband would be highly concerned about the overall expense since it encompasses the budget and financial implications more profoundly than just the location.",
    "However, location can also largely influence the price, indicating that both factors are intertwined.",
    "To conclude, while location is essential, the practical husband is likely to prioritize expense as it directly affects their financial decision-making."
