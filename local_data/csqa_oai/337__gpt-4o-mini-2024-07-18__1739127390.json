  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a Martian would find the Indian Ocean, which is a body of water on Earth.",
    "The Indian Ocean is one of the five main oceans on Earth, so the Martian would find it specifically located on Earth rather than on Mars.",
    "Next, I consider the available choices: A (Asia), B (southern hemisphere), C (planet), D (east), and E (Earth).",
    "Choice A, Asia, is a continent that is bordered by the Indian Ocean, but it does not fully capture the location of the ocean itself.",
    "Choice B, southern hemisphere, includes part of the Indian Ocean but again does not pinpoint the ocean itself as precisely as necessary.",
    "Choice C, planet, is a broader designation that does not directly indicate where the Indian Ocean is located.",
    "Choice D, east, refers to a direction and is not an accurate designation of the Indian Ocean's location.",
    "Choice E, Earth, explicitly identifies the planet where the Indian Ocean exists.",
    "Considering all the choices, E (Earth) is the most correct answer as it directly states where the Indian Ocean can be found."
