  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of a laundry room that is exclusive to a specific group of people, in this case, staff.",
    "Consider what types of establishments typically have laundry facilities that are meant solely for staff use.",
    "Evaluate each of the provided choices to determine if a laundry room designated for staff could exist there.",
    "A: A house would generally have laundry facilities accessible to the inhabitants, not a staff-exclusive area.",
    "B: A hotel typically has laundry facilities for staff operation, which are not accessible to guests.",
    "C: A green house may not have a laundry room specifically for staff, as it\u2019s not common in that context.",
    "D: A college may have laundry facilities for student use rather than specifically for staff.",
    "E: A dorm may have laundry facilities for all residents, not just those they employ as staff.",
