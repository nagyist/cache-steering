  "query": "Question: There was a sign telling picnickers not to feed squirrels, where was this sign likely placed?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: forest\nC: tree\nD: roof\nE: yard",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the sign advises picnickers not to feed squirrels. Squirrels are commonly found in areas frequented by people, particularly in outdoor recreational spaces.",
    "Picnicking is typically associated with public spaces like parks, where people gather to eat and enjoy nature. This suggests a more controlled environment where signs are often used for regulations and safety.",
    "A forest may have fewer restrictions and is less likely to have such signs since it is a more natural and less structured setting compared to a park.",
    "The option of a tree (C) does not logically fit, as signs are usually placed on structured surfaces where they can be easily seen and understood by people.",
    "A roof (D) is not a sensible location for a sign meant for picnickers and does not match the context of outdoor dining.",
    "A yard (E) is typically a private space, and while signs can be present there, this context does not align with the presence of picnickers as suggested in the question.",
    "Considering all the options, the only plausible location where picnickers are likely to see a sign not to feed squirrels is in a park."
