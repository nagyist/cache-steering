  "query": "Question: As in part of string theory, what particle makes up hadrons?\n\nChoices:\nA: quark\nB: guitar\nC: bird's nest\nD: kite\nE: beads",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine which particle is responsible for making up hadrons in the context of string theory.",
    "Hadrons are a class of subatomic particles that include protons and neutrons, which are found in atomic nuclei.",
    "To understand hadrons, we must consider their composition: they are made up of smaller particles.",
    "The fundamental particles that make up hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, are known as quarks.",
    "In string theory, particles like quarks are described as one-dimensional \"strings\" that vibrate at different frequencies.",
    "None of the other answer choices (guitar, bird's nest, kite, or beads) are related to particle physics or the composition of hadrons.",
    "Thus, the only relevant and correct answer from the provided choices regarding the composition of hadrons is quark."
