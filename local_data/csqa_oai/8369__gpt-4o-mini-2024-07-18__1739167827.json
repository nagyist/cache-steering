  "query": "Question: The children play cards often, but they make their own rules because they can't what the originals?\n\nChoices:\nA: bid\nB: concentrate\nC: winning\nD: count\nE: remember",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"they can't what the originals\" suggests that the children are struggling with something related to the original rules of the game.",
    "Looking at the choices, I need to determine which verb fits best with \"can't\" in this context.",
    "Choice A, \"bid,\" doesn\u2019t connect significantly to rules or games where children might be playing cards casually.",
    "Choice B, \"concentrate,\" implies a focus issue but doesn't directly tie to the original rules.",
    "Choice C, \"winning,\" does not work logically with the phrase since winning is not something they would forget.",
    "Choice D, \"count,\" could relate to the numerical aspects of card games, but isn't necessarily linked to remembering rules.",
    "Choice E, \"remember,\" directly implies a struggle with recalling the original rules, which makes sense.",
    "Since the sentence suggests that the children adapt and create their own rules due to not being able to recall the original ones, \"remember\" is the most fitting option.",
    "Thus, the best fit for the sentence completion is that the children can't remember the original rules."
