  "steps": [
    "The question presents a scenario where two individuals who were previously in a relationship stop communicating after a divorce.",
    "The act of stopping communication after a divorce often indicates unresolved emotions related to the relationship and the separation itself.",
    "Humorously describing the situation, one might think of emotional states that result from such a significant life change, including feelings of sadness or anger.",
    "Among the choices, 'bad feelings' directly speaks to the emotional state of confusion, anger, or hurt that might arise from a divorce.",
    "While 'emotional distress' could also apply, it is a broader term that may encompass a variety of feelings, possibly including anxiety or sadness, but is less specific than 'bad feelings'.",
    "'Melancholy' generally refers to a deep, persistent sadness which may not encapsulate all potential emotions after a divorce.",
    "'Depression' is also a serious mental health condition and may not apply unless explicitly indicated; thus it might be stretching the context.",
    "'Richer' does not logically relate to the emotional fallout of a divorce and can be disregarded.",
    "Considering the emotional implications of a divorce and the cessation of communication, 'bad feelings' encapsulates the negative emotions involved most directly."
