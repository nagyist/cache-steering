  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the natural habitat and dietary habits of sheep. Sheep are typically herbivorous animals that graze on grass and other vegetation.",
    "Next, we analyze the provided choices to identify locations where sheep are likely to graze.",
    "Option A, \"meadow,\" is a type of grassy field, which is a common grazing area for sheep.",
    "Option B, \"fairgrounds,\" is typically a place for events and not an appropriate habitat for grazing animals.",
    "Option C, \"goat,\" does not represent a location but rather another type of animal, which does not relate to where sheep graze.",
    "Option D, \"farm,\" typically includes a variety of animals, including sheep, and often has pastures where they can graze.",
    "Option E, \"mars,\" is an entirely unrelated planet and is not a suitable grazing location for sheep.",
    "Now, we determine which options are valid locations for grazing. Both \"meadow\" (A) and \"farm\" (D) qualify as reasonable contexts for sheep to graze.",
    "While a \"farm\" is a more general term that can encompass a variety of livestock and activities, \"meadow\" specifically refers to a grassy field that is well-suited for grazing.",
    "Considering the specificity of the options, the best answer that describes where sheep primarily graze would be \"meadow\" (A) as it directly relates to the natural behavior of sheep."
