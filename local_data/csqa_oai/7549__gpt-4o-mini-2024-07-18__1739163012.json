  "query": "Question: Where could you find an organ that cannot be played?\n\nChoices:\nA: system\nB: human body\nC: cathedral\nD: music store\nE: band hall",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what an \"organ\" typically refers to. It is commonly understood as a musical instrument, especially one that is used in churches or large venues.",
    "Next, we should analyze the options provided to determine where an organ cannot be played.",
    "Option A, \"system,\" doesn\u2019t pertain to a physical location or context for an organ as an instrument; it seems irrelevant.",
    "Option B, \"human body,\" may refer to the biological organs within a person. Although one could metaphorically consider these an \"organ,\" they cannot be played as a musical instrument.",
    "Option C, \"cathedral,\" is a place where an organ instrument is typically played. Thus, it cannot be the answer to the question being asked.",
    "Option D, \"music store,\" suggests a place where musical instruments, including organs, are sold and potentially played. Again, this would not be valid as an answer.",
    "Option E, \"band hall,\" refers to a place where bands might practice and perform, which would likely include instruments being played. Therefore, it does not fit the question.",
    "Considering all options, the only one that fits the criteria of having an organ that cannot be played is \"human body\" since it refers to the organs inside a person rather than an instrument."
