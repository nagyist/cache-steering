  "query": "Question: Billy cared about his opponent, in spite of their disagreements.  Because of that, when he lost the primary, Billy began to do what for him?\n\nChoices:\nA: proponent\nB: supporter\nC: falling down\nD: advocate\nE: dig up skeletons",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the statement. Billy cared about his opponent, which suggests a level of respect or empathy despite their disagreements. This indicates that he values the other person's perspective or role in the competition.",
    "Next, we consider the context of him losing the primary. When someone loses a contest, especially a political one, there can be feelings of disappointment or bitterness. However, Billy's care for his opponent implies he may act positively rather than negatively.",
    "Now, we need to examine the possible answer choices to see which one reflects a positive action towards his opponent. \n- A: proponent - This means a supporter, but it doesn't fit the context of losing the primary.\n- B: supporter - This suggests that he would continue to support his opponent, which aligns with the caring nature mentioned.\n- C: falling down - This doesn't make sense in the context provided.\n- D: advocate - This means to publicly recommend or support, which also implies a positive action and aligns with the caring aspect.\n- E: dig up skeletons - This implies wrongdoing or uncovering negative aspects about someone, which contradicts the caring sentiment.",
    "Between choices B and D, both suggest positive actions, yet they capture different nuances. \"Supporter\" implies ongoing support, whereas \"advocate\" suggests actively promoting the opponent.",
    "Considering that Billy cared for his opponent enough to potentially advocate for him after losing indicates a stronger, more active engagement than merely being a supporter.",
    "Thus, the best choice that reflects Billy's actions after losing the primary, given his care for his opponent, is 'advocate.'"
