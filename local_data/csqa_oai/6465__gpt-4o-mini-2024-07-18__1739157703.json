  "query": "Question: Where is a safe space for a boat?\n\nChoices:\nA: water\nB: harbor\nC: at sea\nD: lake\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is meant by a \"safe space\" for a boat. A safe space would typically refer to a location where the boat is secure from adverse weather conditions and potential hazards.",
    "Next, I will consider each option in the context of safety. The ocean (E) is generally not considered a safe space due to its unpredictability and potential for storms and waves.",
    "Then, looking at \"at sea\" (C), while it can be safe depending on weather conditions, it is still subject to many dangers similar to the ocean.",
    "Next, evaluating \"lake\" (D), while lakes can offer safety, they are also subject to weather changes, but typically less severe than ocean storms.",
    "Now, examining \"water\" (A) as an option, it is too broad and does not specifically indicate a secure environment for a boat, so it cannot be a safe space.",
    "Finally, I will analyze \"harbor\" (B), which is specifically designed for boats to dock and offers protection from rough water and storms, making it the safest option."
