  "query": "Question: The husband never worked a day, but after getting divorced received alimony, what did he become as a result?\n\nChoices:\nA: emotional distress\nB: bad feelings\nC: richer\nD: depression\nE: guilty",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario mentions that the husband never worked a day, which implies that he was likely dependent on his spouse for financial support during the marriage.",
    "After the divorce, he received alimony, which is a form of financial support paid to a spouse after separation or divorce.",
    "Receiving alimony typically means that the person is receiving money, which can improve their financial situation compared to having no income.",
    "Since the husband did not work and received alimony, he has gained financial resources that he did not have previously.",
    "This means his financial status has improved, leading to him being \"richer\" than he was before the divorce.",
    "We need to evaluate the other options: emotional distress, bad feelings, depression, and guilt, but these do not directly reflect a change in his financial situation.",
    "The most logical conclusion based on the information provided is that his financial status improved due to the alimony he received.",
    "Thus, the answer should reflect this positive change in financial status as a result of the divorce and alimony."
