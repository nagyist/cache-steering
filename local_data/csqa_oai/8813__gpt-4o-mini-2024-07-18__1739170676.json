  "query": "Question: What is likely to happen to a snowman that is getting wet?\n\nChoices:\nA: cool off\nB: could\nC: shrinking\nD: get cold\nE: get larger",
  "steps": [
    "A snowman is made of snow and ice, which are primarily made up of frozen water.",
    "When it starts to get wet, it means that water is being introduced to the snowman, either from rain or melted snow.",
    "The introduction of water can lead to the melting of the snow and ice that make up the snowman.",
    "As the snow and ice melt, they transition from solid to liquid water, which means the snowman will lose mass.",
    "This loss of mass is what we refer to as \"shrinking,\" as the overall size of the snowman decreases.",
    "Choices A (\"cool off\") and D (\"get cold\") do not accurately describe what happens to the snowman, as getting wet typically leads to melting rather than cooling, and snowmen are already cold.",
    "Choice E (\"get larger\") is also incorrect, as melting does not lead to an increase in size.",
    "Therefore, the most logical outcome when a snowman gets wet is that it will shrink."
