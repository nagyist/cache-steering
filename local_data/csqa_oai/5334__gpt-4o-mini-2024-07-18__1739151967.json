  "query": "Question: James wanted a plastic saucer to put some cat food on  He certainly wasn't going to use a good saucer.  Where might he look for one?\n\nChoices:\nA: drawer\nB: kitchen cabinet\nC: china cabinet\nD: tea room\nE: tea cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "James specifically wants a plastic saucer, indicating he is looking for an item that is likely durable and not fragile.",
    "He mentions that he is not going to use a good saucer, which suggests he is trying to avoid anything that might be valuable or breakable.",
    "A drawer could contain various items, and it might have throwaway or less valuable utensils, including a plastic saucer.",
    "A kitchen cabinet is typically where everyday dishes, utensils, and sometimes plastic ware are stored. This could also be a good place to find a plastic saucer.",
    "A china cabinet is generally used for storing fine china or more decorative dishes, which James would want to avoid using.",
    "A tea room is usually set for serving tea and may contain delicate items which are not suitable for cat food.",
    "A tea cabinet often has items related to tea but may not include everyday items such as a plastic saucer.",
    "Given the options, the drawer and kitchen cabinet are likely candidates for where James might find a plastic saucer.",
    "Comparing the two, a kitchen cabinet is more dedicated to dishes and could more likely hold a plastic saucer than a general drawer.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice for where James might find a suitable plastic saucer is in the kitchen cabinet."
