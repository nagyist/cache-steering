  "query": "Question: Akron must have at least one dance club in what state?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: ohio\nC: united states\nD: texas\nE: downtown area",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what Akron is. Akron is a city located in the state of Ohio.",
    "Next, since Akron is situated in Ohio, it would be logical to consider Ohio when determining where a dance club must be located if it's associated with Akron.",
    "I should also analyze the other options provided: Michigan, Texas, and the Downtown area. Michigan is a neighboring state, but it does not have any direct association with Akron.",
    "Texas is a separate state and also does not have any direct connection to Akron.",
    "The option \"United States\" encompasses all states, including Ohio. However, the question specified a state, meaning it is more specific than the entirety of the U.S.",
    "The option \"Downtown area\" does not specify a state and is too nebulous. It could refer to many cities across the U.S.",
    "Considering all options, Ohio clearly is the state where Akron resides and must have at least one dance club.",
    "Therefore, the best answer is the one that directly relates to Akron's location, which is Ohio."
