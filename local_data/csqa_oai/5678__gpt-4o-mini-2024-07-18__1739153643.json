  "query": "Question: The mixer felt like he was a NASA engineer in the control room every time he worked with a band at his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: factory\nB: airbase\nC: recording studio\nD: garage\nE: nuclear plant",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what setting would likely give the mixer the feeling of being in a control room like that of a NASA engineer.",
    "A factory typically involves mass production and machinery rather than a control room scenario, so option A (factory) seems less relevant.",
    "An airbase is related to military aviation, which doesn't closely align with the concept of mixing music or sound, making option B (airbase) unlikely.",
    "Option D (garage) could suggest a place where music is produced, particularly in the context of amateur bands. However, it typically lacks the advanced technology of a control room.",
    "Option E (nuclear plant) involves specialized engineering and control rooms as well but is far removed from music production, making it an unsuitable choice.",
    "Option C (recording studio) is a place designed specifically for music production, equipped with sound mixing technology analogous to sophisticated control rooms.",
    "The specific reference to feeling like a NASA engineer implies a complex, high-tech environment where careful adjustments and monitoring are necessary\u2014qualities inherent to a recording studio.",
    "Given the context of the question and upon analyzing all options, the recording studio aligns perfectly with the feeling of being in a control room."
