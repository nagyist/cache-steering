  "steps": [
    "The word \"ambiguous\" means something that is open to more than one interpretation or is not clear in meaning.",
    "To find the opposite of \"ambiguous,\" we need a word that indicates clarity or definitiveness in meaning.",
    "Looking at the choices: A (clear), B (certain), C (distinct), D (blurry), and E (explicit), we can begin to analyze them.",
    "Choice A \"clear\" suggests something that is easy to perceive or understand, which directly opposes the vagueness of \"ambiguous.\"",
    "Choice B \"certain\" implies certainty and decisiveness, which is also contrary to ambiguity but focuses more on confidence than clarity.",
    "Choice C \"distinct\" indicates something that is clearly different or easily distinguishable, which relates to specificity rather than ambiguity.",
    "Choice D \"blurry\" is the opposite of clear and thus aligns with ambiguity rather than being its opposite.",
    "Choice E \"explicit\" means stated clearly and in detail, leaving no room for confusion or doubt, which opposes ambiguity.",
    "Now, considering the strengths of the oppositional meanings: \"clear\" (A) and \"explicit\" (E) both strongly oppose \"ambiguous,\" but \"explicit\" may carry a slightly stronger connotation of clarity in context.",
    "However, \"clear\" (A) also captures the essence of being unambiguous. Given that \"explicit\" focuses on detailed instructions that leave no room for misunderstanding, it can be argued that the best direct opposite of \"ambiguous\" that conveys clarity in communication overall is \"clear.\""
