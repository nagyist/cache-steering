  "query": "Question: What is a lawyer required to do during the discovery phase of a trial?\n\nChoices:\nA: charge fee for service\nB: come early\nC: convict\nD: produce evidence\nE: state case",
  "steps": [
    "The discovery phase of a trial involves the exchange of information between the parties involved in the case. The main purpose is to gather evidence and understand the opposing party's position.",
    "During discovery, lawyers are required to disclose certain evidence and may be compelled to produce documents, answer interrogatories, and provide witness lists.",
    "The term \"produce evidence\" directly relates to one of the primary tasks of lawyers during the discovery phase, where they are asked to share or present evidence that may be used in the trial.",
    "The other options do not accurately reflect the responsibilities of a lawyer during the discovery phase. Charging a fee is a general aspect of legal practice but not specific to discovery. Coming early is not a critical requirement; it's more about the process. Convicting is a goal of the trial itself and not specific to the discovery phase. Stating a case involves presenting the argument during the trial rather than sharing evidence during discovery.",
    "Given the explanations of the responsibilities during the discovery phase, producing evidence is a key task for lawyers as they prepare for trial."
