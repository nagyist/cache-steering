  "query": "Question: She had seen over 50 marble fountains that day, where was she?\n\nChoices:\nA: lenin's crypt\nB: front of casino\nC: rome\nD: public place\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "The mention of \"over 50 marble fountains\" indicates that she is in a place known for its fountains, which narrows down the options significantly.",
    "Lenin's crypt (A) is not known for its fountains, but rather a mausoleum. So, this option can be ruled out.",
    "The front of a casino (B) could potentially have fountains, but it's not a likely location for over 50 fountains, making this option less probable.",
    "\"Public place\" (D) is too vague and does not provide a specific location, so it cannot be selected as the correct answer.",
    "The term \"city\" (E) is also quite broad and does not specify a location known for marble fountains either.",
    "Rome (C) is famously known for its many marble fountains, including iconic ones such as the Trevi Fountain. This makes it a very likely location for seeing over 50 marble fountains in a single day.",
    "Now, the best answer must be the one that directly associates with a large number of marble fountains, which aligns perfectly with Rome.",
    "Considering the above reasoning and elimination, Rome (C) is the most fitting answer to the question."
