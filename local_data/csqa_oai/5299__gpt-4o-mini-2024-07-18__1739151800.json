  "query": "Question: Where do people go to borrow sugar?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: internet\nC: buildings\nD: neighbor's house\nE: end of line",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of borrowing sugar. Typically, borrowing food or small household items is a social interaction that happens in close proximity.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. An \"apartment\" is a type of housing, but it does not inherently imply a social interaction with others for borrowing.",
    "The \"internet\" is a platform for information and commerce, not a place for physically borrowing items like sugar.",
    "\"Buildings\" is a broad term and does not specify a place where one might commonly borrow sugar from people.",
    "The \"neighbor's house\" is a specific location where someone would typically go to borrow ingredients like sugar, as neighbors often help each other out.",
    "Examine if there are any other plausible options. The \u201cend of line\u201d does not have relevance to borrowing an item like sugar.",
    "Consider social norms about lending and borrowing among neighbors. It\u2019s common for neighbors to ask each other for small amounts of ingredients.",
    "Since the other options do not fit the context or are too vague, the most appropriate and specific choice is the neighbor's house.",
    "Reassess the choices to ensure accuracy. The neighbor's house remains the best answer based on social practices around borrowing."
