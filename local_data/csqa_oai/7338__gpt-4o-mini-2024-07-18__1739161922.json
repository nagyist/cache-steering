  "query": "Question: Who is likely to use a comb?\n\nChoices:\nA: medicine cabinet\nB: trashcan\nC: suitcase\nD: pocket\nE: barber shop",
  "steps": [
    "To determine who is likely to use a comb, I need to consider the purpose of a comb, which is primarily for grooming hair.",
    "I should analyze the options provided to see if any are related to hair grooming and personal care.",
    "Option A: \"medicine cabinet\" is typically used to store medications and healthcare supplies, not for personal grooming, so it is unlikely to be the answer.",
    "Option B: \"trashcan\" is used for waste disposal, and does not correlate with the use of a comb, making it an unlikely answer.",
    "Option C: \"suitcase\" is used for travel and storing belongings, and while someone might carry a comb in a suitcase, it is not a direct association with its primary use.",
    "Option D: \"pocket\" could be a place to carry a comb, but it does not directly indicate usage.",
    "Option E: \"barber shop\" is a place where grooming takes place, and it is common for barbers to use combs on clients.",
    "Comparing all options, \"barber shop\" is the most suitable because it is directly associated with the use of a comb."
