  "query": "Question: What do humans have for speaking?\n\nChoices:\nA: one hand\nB: one mouth\nC: two ears\nD: brains\nE: two legs",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the primary organ that humans use for speaking.",
    "The key organ responsible for producing speech sounds in humans is the mouth, which includes the lips, tongue, vocal cords, and other structures.",
    "I should consider the other options to see if they contribute to speaking. For example, ears are important for hearing, but not directly for speaking.",
    "Although brains play a critical role in processing language and speech, they do not physically produce speech on their own.",
    "Two legs are primarily used for mobility and do not have any direct connection to the act of speaking.",
    "One hand could also be used for gestures or sign language, but it is not essential for spoken language.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most relevant option for what humans have specifically for speaking is \"one mouth.\"",
    "Now, I can conclude that the right answer is option B, which directly aligns with the organ used to produce speech."
