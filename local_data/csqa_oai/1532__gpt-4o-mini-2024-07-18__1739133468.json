  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the potential gains from getting a divorce, which implies looking for a positive outcome rather than negative feelings or financial loss.",
    "Options A, B, C, and D all represent negative outcomes: A suggests financial loss, B represents sadness, C denotes depression, and D indicates emotional pain or tears.",
    "Option E, \"freedom,\" suggests liberation from a situation that may have been restrictive or unhappy, which is often considered a benefit by those who seek divorce.",
    "Divorce can allow individuals to reclaim their independence and make choices that align more with their personal needs and desires, thus supporting the idea of \"freedom.\"",
    "Upon reviewing all the options, it's clear that the other choices do not reflect a gain, but instead represent negative consequences, while freedom is a potential positive change.",
    "Therefore, the final answer underscores the most significant perceived gain from getting a divorce, which is freedom from an undesirable relationship."
