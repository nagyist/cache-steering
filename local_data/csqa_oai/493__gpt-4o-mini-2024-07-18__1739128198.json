    "First, I need to understand the concept of a \"mundane routine.\" It refers to activities that are repetitive and dull.",
    "Next, I look for words in the options that might suggest a way to break or change such a routine.",
    "Option A, \"sophisticated,\" implies complexity or elegance but does not directly relate to alleviating boredom.",
    "Option B, \"imprevist,\" means unpredictable or unexpected. While it suggests surprise, it may not directly convey the idea of breaking a routine.",
    "Option C, \"arcane,\" refers to something mysterious or secretive, which does not relate closely to the idea of changing monotony.",
    "Option D, \"heavenly,\" implies something wonderful or divine, but does not specifically address the idea of a routine.",
