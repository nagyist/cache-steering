  "query": "Question: What happens when friends observe something at the same time?\n\nChoices:\nA: travel together\nB: borrow money\nC: conspire\nD: visit each other\nE: see like",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what the question is asking: it describes a scenario where friends are observing something simultaneously.",
    "Next, we consider the implications of friends observing something together; they share the experience in real-time.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices given. Choice A: \"travel together\" is not directly related to the act of observing something.",
    "Choice B: \"borrow money\" also does not connect clearly with observing; it pertains more to financial transactions.",
    "Choice C: \"conspire\" could imply that they are together to hatch a plan based on what they observe, but it is overly specific and not a universal outcome of observing.",
    "Choice D: \"visit each other\" indicates a physical action rather than an observational context; it doesn't fit the scenario of simultaneous observation.",
    "Choice E: \"see like\" suggests that they perceive what they are looking at in a similar manner, which is indeed a reasonable conclusion when friends observe something together.",
    "Given that \"see like\" represents sharing a moment and the perception of that moment upon observing, it stands out as the best fit.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer that relates to simultaneous observation is \"see like.\""
