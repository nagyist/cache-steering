  "query": "Question: What could have an iron in some areas of it but not in other areas?\n\nChoices:\nA: hematite\nB: linen closet\nC: house\nD: laundry room\nE: chemistry lab",
  "steps": [
    "Hematite is a mineral that contains iron, so it could contain iron in specific areas where it's found, but not in others.",
    "A linen closet is typically used for storing linens and does not inherently have iron.",
    "A house can have iron in parts such as the structure (beams, pipes) but may have areas (like wooden rooms) with no iron.",
    "A laundry room is more likely to have appliances with metal parts, including iron. However, it would generally be consistent in containing iron in the appliances.",
    "A chemistry lab may contain equipment made of various materials and could have iron-containing substances but is not guaranteed to have iron in all areas.",
    "Comparing all choices, only the house consistently stands out as having both areas with and without iron without being a mineral or a specific function-leading place.",
    "The choices like hematite and chemistry lab focus more on materials or functions rather than combined structures where presence varies.",
    "Among all the choices, the house is the most realistic option for having iron in some areas but not in others due to varied construction materials and room types."
