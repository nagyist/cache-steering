  "query": "Question: John was a servant, but he was paid for his work.  What was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: in charge\nB: boss\nC: free person\nD: queen\nE: lord",
  "steps": [
    "John was referred to as a servant, which generally implies that he was working for someone else.",
    "Being a servant means that he performed tasks and duties for another person or household.",
    "The key detail mentioned is that he was \"paid for his work,\" which suggests he had a formal arrangement or employment status.",
    "If he was paid for his work, it indicates that he provided his labor voluntarily in exchange for payment rather than being enslaved or forced to work without compensation.",
    "This compensation for work typically implies a degree of autonomy, or at least the status of a free person engaged in employment.",
    "The choices given are A: in charge, B: boss, C: free person, D: queen, E: lord.",
    "Options A (in charge) and B (boss) suggest leadership roles, which do not fit the description of a servant.",
    "Options D (queen) and E (lord) imply positions of nobility or power, which also do not align with being described as a servant.",
    "The only option that aligns with being a servant who is paid for his work is C (free person), indicating that he was not restricted or enslaved.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer is that John was a free person engaged in paid labor as a servant."
