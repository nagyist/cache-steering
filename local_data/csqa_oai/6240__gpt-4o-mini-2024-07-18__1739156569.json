    "The question asks about what action or state is involved in the process of getting drunk.",
    "When one gets drunk, it is typically due to the intake of substances that cause intoxication, primarily alcohol.",
    "Examining the choices, A (ethanol) is a type of alcohol and not an action. C (fall down) may describe a consequence of being drunk but not a necessary step in the process. D (booze) is another term for alcohol but also does not describe an action or requirement in the process. E (ocean) is unrelated entirely.",
    "Choice B (consumption of alcohol) directly describes the action necessary to get drunk, as one must consume alcohol to become intoxicated.",
    "Thus, out of the options, only B clearly indicates a required activity in the context of getting drunk."
