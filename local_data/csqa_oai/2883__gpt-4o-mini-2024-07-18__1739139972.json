  "query": "Question: What does someone do before they travel to work?\n\nChoices:\nA: wake up\nB: have job\nC: message the boss\nD: get ready\nE: take bus",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of \"before they travel to work,\" which implies the activities someone typically undertakes prior to their commute.",
    "Waking up is usually the first action one takes in the morning, and it is necessary before any other preparations can begin.",
    "Having a job is a condition of being employed, but it is not an action that occurs before traveling to work; instead, it is a state of being.",
    "Messaging the boss might be something someone does, but it is not a universal action that everyone takes before traveling to work; it depends on the situation.",
    "Getting ready is a broader action that encompasses several tasks, such as dressing, grooming, and preparing to leave the house, which happens before traveling to work.",
    "Taking the bus specifically refers to a method of transportation, and while it happens before arriving at work, it is not a necessary action for everyone (some may drive, walk, or use other means).",
    "Based on the reasoning, waking up and getting ready are significant actions that could occur before traveling, but \"getting ready\" seems to cover more preparatory activities.",
    "Since \"getting ready\" includes essential preparations for work, it is a more comprehensive and appropriate response than simply waking up."
