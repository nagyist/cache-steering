  "query": "Question: If you get your paper back marked with corrections, where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: conference\nC: bench\nD: cabinet\nE: notebook",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to receiving a paper back with corrections. This indicates that the paper has likely been evaluated or graded.",
    "Receiving feedback on a paper is a common practice in educational settings, particularly in relation to assignments submitted in class.",
    "The option \"classroom\" aligns with the context of the scenario, as it is a typical location where teachers review and return student assignments.",
    "The other options, such as \"conference,\" \"bench,\" \"cabinet,\" and \"notebook,\" do not fit the usual context for receiving graded work.",
    "A \"conference\" generally involves a more formal discussion or presentation, not the context for simply returning assignments.",
    "A \"bench\" usually refers to a physical seat or an area in a park, which does not relate to academic feedback.",
    "A \"cabinet\" typically refers to a storage unit or a private area, not a place where you would receive feedback on your paper.",
    "A \"notebook\" is where you would write or draft your work, but it is not a place where you would receive corrections back.",
    "Given that classroom settings are where assignments are given, graded, and returned, the most logical conclusion is that receiving such a paper happens in a classroom."
