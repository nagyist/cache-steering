  "query": "Question: What is important in a car when you are driving fast and come to a light?\n\nChoices:\nA: stripes\nB: seat belts\nC: breaks to help stop\nD: tires\nE: radios",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the situation of driving fast and approaching a traffic light, which requires stopping safely.",
    "Next, evaluate what is necessary to stop a vehicle efficiently at high speeds.",
    "Brakes play a crucial role in slowing down and stopping a car. They are specifically designed to reduce the vehicle's speed and bring it to a halt.",
    "While seat belts (B) are also important for safety, they do not assist in stopping the vehicle; they only protect the occupants in the event of a collision.",
    "Stripes (A) are purely aesthetic and do not contribute to the car's functionality or safety in this scenario.",
    "Tires (D) are important for maintaining traction and handling, but they cannot help stop the car by themselves without functioning brakes.",
    "Radios (E) are unrelated to the vehicle's performance and safety in stopping at a traffic light.",
    "Compare the relevance of all the options provided: option C, brakes, is essential for stopping; whereas the other options either enhance safety indirectly or are unrelated.",
    "Therefore, the most critical component when driving fast and approaching a light is indeed the brakes."
