  "query": "Question: What happens soon after christmas?\n\nChoices:\nA: buy presents for others\nB: summer\nC: easter\nD: see work\nE: halloween",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the timing of Christmas. Christmas is celebrated on December 25th each year.",
    "Second, consider the timeframe of events that occur soon after December 25th.",
    "Third, since Christmas falls within the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, the next significant holiday approaching could vary.",
    "Fourth, Easter is not fixed to a specific date; it is celebrated anywhere from March 22 to April 25, making it a possible event that occurs after Christmas.",
    "Fifth, Halloween occurs on October 31, which is much later in the year, so it cannot be the answer.",
    "Sixth, considering option A: buying presents for others is typically associated with Christmas itself and not an event that happens soon after.",
    "Seventh, option B, summer, does not occur right after Christmas as it is generally seen as a season occurring later in the year.",
    "Eighth, option D, \u201csee work,\u201d doesn\u2019t correspond with a holiday or event that follows Christmas.",
    "Ninth, since we have ruled out options A, B, D, and E based on the timing or relevance, we are left with option C.",
    "Finally, Easter fits our criteria as it is a holiday that usually comes after Christmas relatively soon when considering the annual calendar."
