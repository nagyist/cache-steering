  "steps": [
    "To determine where tourists go to see princesses in America, I need to consider locations that are known for princess-themed attractions or entertainment.",
    "Disneyland is widely recognized as a place where various fairy tale characters, including princesses, are prominently featured in parades, shows, and meet-and-greet opportunities.",
    "Other options, like waterfalls, shopping malls, beaches, and state parks, do not have specific associations with princesses or fairy tale characters in the same way that Disneyland does.",
    "While some of these locations may have general attractions or activities, none of them are specifically designed around the concept of interacting with princesses.",
    "Thus, when it comes to locations focused on princesses, Disneyland stands out as the primary choice for tourists.",
    "Considering all mentioned factors, it seems clear that Disneyland is the only suitable option among the provided choices."
