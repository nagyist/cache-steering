  "query": "Question: When generals want to drop bombs, what vehicle do they need?\n\nChoices:\nA: mail box\nB: car\nC: aircraft\nD: afghanistan\nE: suitcase",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the specific context of dropping bombs. Bombing typically requires a vehicle designed for aerial combat or transportation to be effective.",
    "Next, evaluate the options one by one. A mailbox is not designed for any kind of military action, so it\u2019s not useful for dropping bombs.",
    "A car, while a vehicle, cannot drop bombs effectively as it is not an aerial vehicle.",
    "Now, consider the option \"aircraft.\" Aircraft are specifically designed for flight and can carry and drop bombs, making them the most suitable option for this task.",
    "Next, the choice \"Afghanistan\" does not pertain to a type of vehicle but rather a location. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.",
    "Lastly, a suitcase is not designed to drop bombs; it is a travel accessory and not equipped for any military application.",
    "After analyzing all options, it's clear that the only vehicle suitable for generals who want to drop bombs is an aircraft."
