  "query": "Question: I was in a kitchen that I didn't know, so I informally asked where the spoons were, where was I?\n\nChoices:\nA: friend's house\nB: fraternity house\nC: neighbor's house\nD: grandmas house\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "Since the kitchen is unfamiliar to me, I must be in a place where I am not a regular. This could indicate a friend, neighbor, or a more public setting like a fraternity or restaurant.",
    "The act of informally asking where the spoons are suggests a casual environment. This is less likely to be a formal setting, such as a restaurant, where staff would typically be expected to assist guests.",
    "Being at a friend's house would imply a level of comfort where I might ask casually. A neighbor's house can also fit this description if we have a friendly rapport.",
    "A fraternity house might still be casual, but it typically involves a group setting that may involve more formality or rituals, making it less likely for someone to ask for something casually.",
    "Grandma's house usually evokes a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, leading me to believe I would be less likely to ask for silverware outright due to comfort levels.",
    "Between a friend's house and a neighbor's house, asking where the spoons are suggests that I might be in a place where I feel at least somewhat familiar, but it's not my usual setting.",
    "A restaurant is typically not a place where one asks an immediate question of that nature, as it would be more formal, with wait staff available to serve.",
    "Concluding that a friend's or neighbor's house is still most plausible, I weigh out: a friend's house is likely to have an informal and comfortable atmosphere.",
    "Considering the informal context of the question, and the likelihood of visiting a neighbor\u2019s house typically being less frequent and more reserved, a friend's house seems to give me the right mix of familiarity and casualness in asking about spoons."
