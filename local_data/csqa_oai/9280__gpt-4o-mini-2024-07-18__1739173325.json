  "steps": [
    "To determine where students go to get a higher education, we need to consider the terms we have in the choices.",
    "Higher education typically refers to education beyond high school, such as that provided by colleges and universities.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"university\" is a term that directly relates to higher education programs, which include undergraduate and graduate degrees.",
    "\"Classroom\" could refer to any educational setting and doesn't specifically denote higher education.",
    "\"Summer school\" generally refers to a program for students to catch up or advance in their studies, often at the high school level, and is not inherently linked to higher education.",
    "\"Homeschool\" refers to the practice of educating children at home rather than in a traditional setting, which is usually at the primary or secondary education level.",
    "\"Ask questions\" is not a location and does not relate to any form of education or institution.",
    "Therefore, the only option that specifically corresponds to a place where students would go for higher education is \"university.\""
