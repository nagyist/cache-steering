  "query": "Question: Bob is in a dressing room.  He's putting on waterproof trunks and goggles.  What sort of facility is he most likely visiting?\n\nChoices:\nA: swimming pool\nB: actors and actresses\nC: fancy restaurant.\nD: gym\nE: theatre",
  "steps": [
    "Bob is putting on waterproof trunks and goggles, which suggests he is preparing for an activity related to water.",
    "The waterproof trunks indicate that he is likely going to be in a situation where he will be in water, such as swimming.",
    "Goggles are typically used for protection and clarity while swimming, so this reinforces that he is likely to be swimming or engaging in a water-based activity.",
    "Next, let\u2019s analyze the options provided in the context of Bob's attire and equipment.",
    "Option A: swimming pool - This is a facility where people wear trunks and goggles to swim. This makes sense given Bob's clothing.",
    "Option B: actors and actresses - This does not relate to water activities, so it is unlikely.",
    "Option C: fancy restaurant - A fancy restaurant would not typically require trunks and goggles, so it is unlikely.",
    "Option D: gym - While some gyms might have pools, the mention of waterproof trunks and goggles specifically suggests a focus on swimming rather than gym activities in general.",
    "Option E: theatre - Similar to option C, a theatre would not involve wearing waterproof trunks and goggles, making this option unlikely.",
    "From the reasoning process, option A (swimming pool) is the most logical choice, given the context of Bob wearing waterproof trunks and goggles."
