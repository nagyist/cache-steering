  "query": "Question: A dentist's office wanted to have higher visibility than the other medical offices. Where would it set up shop to maximize visibility?\n\nChoices:\nA: corner store\nB: main street\nC: medical center\nD: metropolitan city\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "The objective is to maximize visibility for a dentist's office specifically against other medical offices.",
    "Setting up in a medical center could provide visibility, but it's likely surrounded by other medical offices, which could dilute the visibility.",
    "A metropolitan city would generally have a high amount of foot traffic and visibility, but it may also have many other competing dental offices and medical practitioners.",
    "A main street typically hosts various businesses and has consistent foot and vehicle traffic, making it a prominent option for visibility.",
    "A corner store might not provide the same level of visibility as a main street or metropolitan area since it may be in a localized spot rather than a high-traffic area.",
    "A town would typically have less foot traffic and visibility compared to a bustling area or main street, even if the town has a community feel.",
    "Based on the analysis, both the main street and metropolitan city provide high visibility, but main street specifically targets direct business visibility to customers.",
    "Considering that a dentist's office needs to stand out from other medical offices, the main street is likely to attract more casual passersby who may not be actively seeking dental services but could consider them.",
    "Therefore, setting up on a main street maximizes the visibility of the dentist's office in comparison to the options provided, especially against local competition."
