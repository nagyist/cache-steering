  "query": "Question: The electric fan had gotten too loud and was bothering others, though they allowed many personal things on desks he was required to turn it off where?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: hallway\nC: hot room\nD: home\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of the situation described: The electric fan is too loud and is bothering others.",
    "Next, I consider the various choices provided. A \"closet\" typically wouldn't be a common place for a fan to be used, so it's likely not the answer.",
    "Then, I assess the \"hallway\", which is a public space where a fan would also likely not be used.",
    "Next, I look at the option \"hot room\". While this might need a fan, it doesn't imply that the fan needs to be turned off due to bothering others.",
    "Now, I consider \"home,\" which is a private space where one might use a fan without bothering anyone. However, this option does not imply a requirement to turn the fan off.",
    "Finally, I evaluate the \"office\". Given that the fan is bothering others and that many personal items are allowed on desks, it makes sense there would be a need to turn off the fan in a shared workspace."
