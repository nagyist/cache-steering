    "Consider the nature of rocks and where they are commonly found in the environment.",
    "Rocks can be found in various locations, but certain locations are more likely than others to have accessible rocks.",
    "Bridges are typically made of concrete and steel, not natural rock, so it is unlikely to pick up a rock there.",
    "A mountain range is a region that consists of mountains, which are primarily composed of rock, making it a possible location for obtaining rocks.",
    "Mountains themselves are elevated landforms primarily composed of rock, offering multiple opportunities to find and pick up rocks.",
    "The ground universally contains rocks, whether in nature or urban areas, which makes it very plausible to pick up a rock there.",
    "Forests can also have rocks, but they may be less accessible compared to the more open terrain of mountains or the ground in general.",
    "Among the given options, the ground would most commonly have exposed rocks, making it very easy to pick up a rock.",
    "Both mountains and the ground are strong candidates, but the ground is the most straightforward answer as it encompasses all spaces where rocks can be found.",
    "In conclusion, while mountains and mountain ranges are also likely to have rocks, the ground is the most universal and expected location to pick them up."
