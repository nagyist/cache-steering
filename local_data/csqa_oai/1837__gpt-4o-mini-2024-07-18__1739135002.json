  "query": "Question: The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover?\n\nChoices:\nA: wooded area\nB: tropical forest\nC: warm place\nD: canyon\nE: sleeping bag",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the snake is worried about predators overhead, indicating that it seeks protection from above.",
    "A wooded area typically has trees that could provide cover from aerial predators since the foliage can obscure the snake's presence.",
    "A tropical forest is similar to a wooded area, but it generally refers to denser vegetation in a warm climate, which could also provide cover from predators.",
    "A warm place does not necessarily provide any cover or protection; it's simply describing a temperature condition, not a location that offers safety from predators.",
    "A canyon could offer some coverage and protection, especially from above, but it may not be as dense in vegetation as the prior options, especially in the context of aerial predators.",
    "A sleeping bag is a human item and would not be relevant for a snake seeking cover from predators.",
    "Given the options, A (wooded area) and B (tropical forest) seem the most viable for providing cover.",
    "Between A and B, while both provide coverage, the term \"wooded area\" is broader and can be applicable in various climates, while \"tropical forest\" is more specific, thus making A a stronger candidate for general cover.",
    "Thus, the final comparison indicates that the snake should prioritize going into a wooded area located where it can most effectively hide from overhead threats."
