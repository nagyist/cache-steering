  "query": "Question: Their boss informed them they can't just be chatting with friends on the clock, it was okay if they were doing what though?\n\nChoices:\nA: happiness\nB: will laugh\nC: exchanging information\nD: communication\nE: social approval",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that their boss informed them they cannot just chat with friends while working.",
    "This implies that there is a distinction between permissible and impermissible activities during work hours.",
    "The choices provided include activities or states that can occur during work, with some being less relevant than others to the context of work-related communication.",
    "The options A (happiness) and B (will laugh) do not directly relate to work tasks or responsibilities.",
    "Option E (social approval) also does not closely relate to a productive work environment.",
    "Options C (exchanging information) and D (communication) are more directly related to professional activities.",
    "Exchanging information can be seen as a work-related task, often necessary for collaboration, whereas general communication might not imply a specific productive exchange.",
    "Nonetheless, \"communication\" could encompass various forms of interaction, including work-related and casual communication, which makes it a valid choice.",
    "Between options C and D, \"exchanging information\" specifically suggests a productive activity, which aligns with what the boss is likely endorsing.",
    "I can thus conclude that the primary acceptable activity the boss is referring to is \"exchanging information\" while at work."
