  "query": "Question: When you are finished drinking out of a cup and want it clean you use this.\n\nChoices:\nA: shelf\nB: dishwasher\nC: table\nD: restaurant\nE: paper towel",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what item would typically be used to clean a cup after drinking from it.",
    "A shelf is a place to put items, not something used for cleaning; therefore, it is not a suitable option.",
    "A dishwasher is a machine used for cleaning dishes, including cups; this could be a potential answer.",
    "A table is just a surface to place items on and does not help in cleaning; thus, it is not a suitable option.",
    "A restaurant might have cleaning facilities, but it is not an item used to clean a cup, making it unsuitable.",
    "A paper towel can be used to wipe a cup clean, but it doesn't actually clean it in the same thorough way as a dishwasher would.",
    "Comparing the options, the dishwasher stands out as a specific item used to clean cups effectively.",
    "Although a paper towel may help with immediate drying or wiping, it is less effective for full cleaning compared to a dishwasher.",
    "Since I need to choose the best answer that represents cleaning a cup after use, I conclude that the dishwasher fulfills this need."
