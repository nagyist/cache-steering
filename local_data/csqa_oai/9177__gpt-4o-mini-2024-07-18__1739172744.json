  "query": "Question: Danny was meeting his friend James, but James didn't show up. James was always punctual.  As time wore on and it became clear that his friend wasn't coming, Danny began to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cheer\nB: panic\nC: anger\nD: relaxation\nE: joy",
  "steps": [
    "Danny was expecting his friend James, who is known for being punctual, to arrive for their meeting.",
    "As time passed and James still had not shown up, Danny likely felt a growing sense of concern.",
    "Given James's usual behavior of being on time, Danny could start to worry that something was wrong.",
    "The fact that he began to notice James's absence suggests that Danny's emotions started to shift toward concern rather than happiness.",
    "Among the choices provided, feeling a sense of panic would make sense because he might be considering the possibility that something could have happened to James.",
    "While anger might be a reaction if he was upset about James\u2019s lack of punctuality, it seems less likely given that he knows James is usually timely.",
    "Cheer and joy are unlikely reactions because the situation is concerning rather than a cause for celebration.",
    "Relaxation is also unlikely since one tends to feel more alert and anxious when waiting for someone who is late, especially if it's out of character for them.",
    "Considering all the factors, the most logical emotional reaction for Danny in this scenario would be to panic."
