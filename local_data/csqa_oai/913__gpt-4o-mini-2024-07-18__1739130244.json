  "query": "Question: Where would you see some people standing on a line near a road?\n\nChoices:\nA: water fountain\nB: military base\nC: apartment\nD: fire house\nE: bus stop",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of standing on a line near a road. This scenario suggests a place where people typically congregate or wait for something, such as transportation.",
    "Evaluate the options: A water fountain is usually found in parks or buildings, not on a road. It doesn't fit the description of people standing on a line.",
    "A military base usually has restricted access and is not a public area where civilians would stand in line near a road. This option is unlikely.",
    "An apartment building would not typically have people standing on a line near a road; residents come and go but don't wait in lines.",
    "A firehouse is generally a place for emergency services and while it might have community events, it is not commonly associated with people standing in line.",
    "A bus stop is a designated area along a road where people wait for public transportation, which typically involves standing in line. This aligns perfectly with the scenario described.",
    "Reassess the removed options to confirm they do not fit the criteria of a line near a road better than the bus stop does.",
    "Since the bus stop fits the description of a public transport waiting area, it is the most relevant and logical choice."
