  "query": "Question: What does hurting someone else cause?\n\nChoices:\nA: punishment\nB: anger\nC: arrested\nD: suffering\nE: hatred",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequences of hurting someone else.",
    "Punishment can be a consequence of causing harm, but it is not guaranteed for all situations where someone is hurt.",
    "Anger is often a reaction from the person who is hurt, but it does not encapsulate all effects of hurting someone else.",
    "Being arrested could occur if the harm is severe and illegal, but this is situational and not a universal effect.",
    "Suffering is a direct result of being hurt, as the person who is harmed experiences physical or emotional pain.",
    "Hatred can develop as a reaction to being hurt, but it is more of a long-term feeling rather than an immediate consequence.",
    "Among the options, suffering is the most direct and universally applicable result of hurting someone else.",
    "Therefore, the best answer to the question is related to the personal experience of the individual who was hurt."
