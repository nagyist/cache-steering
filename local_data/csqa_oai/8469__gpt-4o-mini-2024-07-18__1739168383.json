  "query": "Question: When meeting a friend, what does one generally do at first?\n\nChoices:\nA: shake hands\nB: say hi\nC: smile\nD: have coffee\nE: give a hug",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what one generally does when meeting a friend, we need to consider social norms and common behaviors during greetings.",
    "Shaking hands is a common gesture, particularly in formal settings or among acquaintances, but friends may not always use this gesture.",
    "Saying \"hi\" or greeting someone verbally is a universally accepted way to acknowledge someone upon meeting them.",
    "Smiling is a natural human reaction that often accompanies a greeting. It expresses warmth and friendliness.",
    "Having coffee is not a typical immediate action taken when first meeting; it usually occurs later during social interactions.",
    "Giving a hug is a common behavior among close friends, but it can vary based on personal comfort and cultural differences.",
    "Now we evaluate the frequency of these actions: saying \"hi\" and smiling are almost always present in friendly encounters.",
    "Among the options given, \"saying hi\" may be more universally applicable than the other physical gestures like shaking hands or hugging.",
    "However, smiling is a strong contender because it typically accompanies greetings and may occur even before verbal acknowledgment.",
    "Ultimately, while saying \"hi\" is verbal and direct, smiling is a non-verbal sign of friendliness that is almost always present when meeting a friend."
