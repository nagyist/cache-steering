  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to identify something that the government might have \"too much of.\"",
    "The phrase \"too much of\" implies an excess or an overabundance in a certain area or category.",
    "Let's analyze each choice provided:",
    "Choice A: \"Canada\" does not fit because a government cannot have too much of a country.",
    "Choice B: \"Trouble\" does not logically connect as something a government would have too much of; rather, it is something a government tries to mitigate.",
    "Choice C: \"City\" similarly does not make sense; if anything, a government might manage cities rather than have too much of them.",
    "Choice D: \"Control\" suggests a situation where a government can indeed exert excessive power or authority over its citizens, which fits the idea of having \"too much\" of something.",
    "Choice E: \"Water\" may be less relevant, as while some governments manage water resources, it is not commonly phrased that a government has \"too much\" water in the same context as control.",
    "Based on this analysis, the option that best fits the idea of an excess that a government may possess is \"control.\""
