  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where children typically obtain wagons.",
    "Wagons are common toys that are often sold in stores that specialize in children's items or toys.",
    "I'll consider the choices provided: field, garage, bookstore, backyard, and toy store.",
    "A field is usually an outdoor area, and while children can play there, they generally do not purchase wagons there.",
    "A garage is primarily for storing vehicles and tools, not typically a place to get a wagon.",
    "A bookstore primarily sells books and related items, so it is unlikely to have wagons.",
    "A backyard is a play area at home, but it does not serve as a store to purchase wagons.",
    "A toy store, however, is a specialized shop that sells toys, including wagons.",
    "Thus, among all the choices, the toy store is the most likely place where a child can get a wagon."
