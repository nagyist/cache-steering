  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze what it means to not be good at playing poker. This typically implies a lack of skill or understanding of the game.",
    "Next, if I am not good at poker and I choose to play, it is reasonable to assume that my performance might not be successful.",
    "The phrase \"I will begin what if I play\" suggests that if I venture into the game despite my lack of skill, I may encounter negative consequences.",
    "Poker is inherently a game where players can lose money based on their skill level and decision-making abilities.",
    "Because I am not good at playing poker, it is likely that my decisions will lead to financial losses during the game.",
    "Considering the choices provided, \"losing money\" aligns well with the outcome of playing poker poorly.",
    "Other choices such as discord, social event, competition, and heightened awareness do not directly relate to the idea of consequence stemming from poor poker skills.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting conclusion based on my reasoning is that if I play poker while not being good at it, I will likely end up with financial losses."
