  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that a final boarding group has been called, which suggests a context where a group is preparing to depart from a location.",
    "Considering the options provided, \"theatre\" and \"auditorium\" are typically venues where performances occur, but they do not have a concept of boarding or departure.",
    "The choice \"in wedding hall\" is also a place where an event might take place but does not relate to a boarding situation.",
    "The term \"show\" is a performance type but does not convey a sense of departure either.",
    "The option \"airplane\" relates specifically to travel and has a boarding process, making it a likely candidate for something that could \"depart\" after boarding is complete.",
    "Considering the context of travel, and that we are speaking of a process where passengers are involved, the word \"airplane\" fits perfectly as it signifies the end of boarding and readiness for takeoff.",
    "I've eliminated all choices except for \"airplane\" as it contextually makes sense with both boarding and departing.",
    "Thus, we conclude that the boarding group relates to an airplane, since the other options do not connect logically to the boarding concept."
