  "query": "Question: What's black and white and contains many a story?\n\nChoices:\nA: past\nB: book or magazine\nC: novel\nD: newspaper\nE: story book",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes something that is black and white and contains many stories. This suggests it is likely a printed medium.",
    "The phrase \"black and white\" is commonly associated with printed materials that use these colors in their design or print, such as newspapers, books, and magazines.",
    "\"Contains many a story\" implies that the object in question must have multiple narratives or accounts, which suggests it is not just a singular story.",
    "Let's analyze the options:\n- A: past - This does not fit since it\u2019s an abstract concept and not a physical item.\n- B: book or magazine - This could fit as both contain stories and are typically printed in black and white.\n- C: novel - This typically contains a deeper narrative but is usually not associated directly with being \"black and white\" since novels often have colorful covers.\n- D: newspaper - This is printed in black and white and contains multiple stories daily.\n- E: story book - These usually contain stories but are often illustrated and not exclusively black and white.",
    "Considering the criteria, a newspaper fits perfectly as it is a printed item (black and white) that contains numerous stories.",
    "Although books and magazines also fit, newspapers are specifically known for their daily variety of stories presented in black and white.",
    "Thus, the best fit for the description provided in the question is a newspaper."
