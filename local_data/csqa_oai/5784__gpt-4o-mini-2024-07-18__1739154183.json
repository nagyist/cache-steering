  "query": "Question: Where could you find a blowfish in a zoo?\n\nChoices:\nA: jungle\nB: sea water\nC: cuba\nD: atlantic ocean\nE: lake",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the natural habitat of a blowfish. Blowfish, or pufferfish, are primarily found in Marine environments.",
    "Next, consider the geographical locations where blowfish are commonly found. They inhabit warm coastal waters, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.",
    "Now, evaluate the provided choices. The options include jungle, sea water, Cuba, the Atlantic Ocean, and a lake.",
    "Analyze the choice 'jungle.' While jungles might have a variety of wildlife, they do not typically host blowfish.",
    "Next, consider 'sea water.' Blowfish live in sea water, making this a plausible location to find them in a zoo setting that features marine life.",
    "Examine Cuba as a specific location. Cuba has coastal marine environments where blowfish can be found, thus making it a likely candidate.",
    "Assess the option 'Atlantic Ocean.' The Atlantic Ocean contains suitable habitats for blowfish, but it is a broad area without specific reference to a zoo.",
    "Finally, consider the option 'lake.' Blowfish are not typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes.",
    "Conclude the evaluation by identifying that while both 'sea water' and 'Cuba' are suitable choices, the specific wording of 'in a zoo' suggests an environment typically represented by 'Cuba' in contexts studying marine life."
