  "steps": [
    "In order to play chess, a chess set needs to be available and in a suitable condition.",
    "A chess set consists of various pieces (e.g., pawns, bishops, knights, etc.) and a board.",
    "The main requirement is that the chess set is actually assembled and all pieces are present and usable.",
    "Among the choices provided, the most relevant aspect that must occur for a chess set to be ready for play is that it has to be 'made.'",
    "Other choices like 'fun', 'strategic', 'have fun', and 'satisfaction' refer to experiences or qualities that do not directly address the readiness of the chess set itself.",
    "Thus, the only applicable choice that addresses the requirement for a chess set before you can play chess is that it needs to be 'made.'"
