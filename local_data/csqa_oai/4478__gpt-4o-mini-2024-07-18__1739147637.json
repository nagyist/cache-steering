  "steps": [
    "We need to interpret the phrase \"when light bulbs fade into darkness.\" This suggests a situation where light is diminishing or fading away.",
    "Several of the choices describe specific locations or scenarios. We need to consider where light bulbs would commonly fade.",
    "Option A, \"room,\" could be a possibility because light bulbs can fade in any room. However, it's a broad choice.",
    "Option B, \"theatre,\" might also fit because lights are often dimmed in a theatre setting, especially during a performance when the lights fade.",
    "Option C, \"sunrise or twilight,\" refers to natural lighting conditions and does not specifically involve light bulbs fading; it suggests a gradual transition of light rather than an artificial light source fading.",
    "Option D, \"basement,\" again could be a place where light might fade, but it does not specifically stand out compared to other options.",
    "Option E, \"lamp,\" refers specifically to a type of light source that can dim or fade, but it doesn\u2019t imply a specific situation or location.",
    "Among the choices, options B and C focus on the fading of lights in a context where that is expected. A theatre setting (B) is quite typical for deliberately dimming lights, while sunrise or twilight (C) is a gradual fading of natural light.",
    "Given that light bulbs specifically fade, and considering scenarios where audience members might frequently experience light fading, option B (theatre) becomes more viable than the natural processes in option C.",
    "Thus, the stronger connection of light bulbs fading most likely aligns with a theatrical context where lighting is intentionally adjusted, and not merely the process of daybreak or dusk."
