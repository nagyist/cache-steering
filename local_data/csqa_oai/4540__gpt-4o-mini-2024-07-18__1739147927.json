  "query": "Question: Most humans by shoes in pairs, this is because they happen to have what?\n\nChoices:\nA: two ears\nB: lay eggs\nC: one head\nD: a bad day\nE: two feet",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking why most humans buy shoes in pairs.",
    "To determine the reason, we must consider the anatomical structure of humans.",
    "The majority of humans are bipedal, meaning they walk on two feet.",
    "Each foot typically requires its own shoe for proper fit and support.",
    "Therefore, to equip both feet, humans need to purchase shoes in pairs.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate the choices:\n- A: \u201ctwo ears\u201d is not relevant to buying shoes.\n- B: \u201clay eggs\u201d does not apply to humans.\n- C: \u201cone head\u201d is also not related to shoes.\n- D: \u201ca bad day\u201d has no connection to buying shoes.\n- E: \u201ctwo feet\u201d directly correlates with the need for pairs of shoes.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most logical answer is E, as humans require shoes for both of their feet."
