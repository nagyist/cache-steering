  "query": "Question: Where are you if a cow you've raised gets an award?\n\nChoices:\nA: county fair\nB: stable\nC: barnyard\nD: sheepfold\nE: farmyard",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a cow that has been raised and received an award.",
    "Cows are often shown in competitions at agricultural events or fairs.",
    "A common event for showcasing livestock, including cows, is the county fair.",
    "While a stable and barnyard can house cows, these locations do not directly imply that the cow has been awarded.",
    "A sheepfold is specifically for sheep, which does not relate to the cow at all.",
    "The term \"farmyard\" is broader but doesn't specifically indicate an award context for a cow.",
    "Given the specific context of an award for a cow, the county fair stands out as the most appropriate place for such an event.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the answer must be related to the event where awards are typically presented."
