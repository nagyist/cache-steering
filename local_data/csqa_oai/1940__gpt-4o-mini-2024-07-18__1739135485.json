  "query": "Question: John didn't have any memory of the previous week and it was getting worse.  He was doing what to his entire life?\n\nChoices:\nA: last forever\nB: forgetting\nC: forgotten\nD: rehabilitating\nE: forgetfulness",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that John didn't have any memory of the previous week, which implies a loss of memory.",
    "The phrase \"it was getting worse\" suggests that this loss of memory is increasing or expanding beyond just the previous week.",
    "When considering the actions or states related to memory loss, one possible verb is \"forgetting,\" as it describes the process of losing memories.",
    "Other options can be evaluated. \"Last forever\" (A) and \"rehabilitating\" (D) do not directly relate to the action of memory loss. \"Forgotten\" (C) could describe what has occurred, but does not imply an ongoing process. \"Forgetfulness\" (E) describes the state of being forgetful but does not specify an action.",
    "Since the question asks what John was doing to his entire life, the most fitting choice is the continuous action of \"forgetting,\" representing the ongoing process of losing memories."
