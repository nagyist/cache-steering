  "query": "Question: What is a social benefit of going to party?\n\nChoices:\nA: getting drunk\nB: food\nC: plan\nD: having fun\nE: meeting new people",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a party typically involves. A social gathering usually focuses on interaction among attendees.",
    "Next, analyze each option provided to see how it relates to the essence of attending a party.",
    "Option A, \"getting drunk,\" while possible at a party, is not a universally recognized social benefit because it can lead to negative consequences.",
    "Option B, \"food,\" is often present at parties but is typically not the primary social benefit; it's more of a supplementary aspect of social gatherings.",
    "Option C, \"plan,\" does not directly relate to the social aspects of attending a party. It might refer to coordinating something but isn\u2019t a benefit of the social experience itself.",
    "Option D, \"having fun,\" is an essential aspect of social gatherings, emphasizing enjoyment and entertainment, making it a core benefit.",
    "Option E, \"meeting new people,\" is also a significant social benefit of attending a party since it involves making new connections and expanding one's social circle.",
    "Now, compare the two strong candidates: \"having fun\" and \"meeting new people.\" Both are social benefits, but \"meeting new people\" can create lasting relationships and networks, while \"having fun\" is more immediate and subjective.",
    "Given the social nature of parties, \"meeting new people\" appears to be the strongest benefit as it enhances social interaction and can lead to long-term relationships, which is fundamentally what social gatherings are about."
