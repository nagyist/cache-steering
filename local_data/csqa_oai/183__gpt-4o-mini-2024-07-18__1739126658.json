  "query": "Question: James complained that Alexa's electric guitar was too loud and he couldn't get any work done at home,  so she decided that she should get an acoustic guitar.  Where might she look for one?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: music shop\nC: studio\nD: storage\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options available for finding an acoustic guitar. The most logical place to start would likely be a music shop, as they specialize in selling musical instruments.",
    "Next, evaluate the other options. A house may contain a guitar, but it is not a store or a location for purchasing a new one.",
    "The \"studio\" option could imply a place where music is recorded, but studios do not typically sell instruments. They might have them, but they would not be a primary location for purchasing.",
    "\"Storage\" usually refers to somewhere items are kept, but it\u2019s not associated with acquiring instruments; it\u2019s more of a place to keep things you already have.",
    "\"Closet\" also suggests a personal storage space rather than a commercial one, so it wouldn\u2019t be a probable choice for purchasing a guitar either.",
    "Since the purpose of searching is to acquire a new acoustic guitar, and given the specialization of music shops, they fit this need best.",
    "The choice of music shop seems to provide the best solution for obtaining an acoustic guitar while addressing James's complaint about noise."
