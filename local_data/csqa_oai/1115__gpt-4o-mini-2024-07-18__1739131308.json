  "query": "Question: I pay someone in a ticket booth for tickets to \"The Greatest Showman.\"  Where am I likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: sports arena\nB: auditorium\nC: opera\nD: movie theatre\nE: metro station",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves purchasing tickets for a specific movie, \"The Greatest Showman.\"",
    "Movies are typically shown in a venue designed specifically for film screenings.",
    "Among the options given, a \"movie theatre\" fits the description of a place where ticket purchases for films would occur.",
    "An \"auditorium\" may also be a place for shows, but it's less specific and more associated with live performances than movies.",
    "An \"opera\" is primarily for live musical performances and does not fit the context of a movie ticket purchase.",
    "A \"sports arena\" is for sporting events, not movies, so it can be eliminated.",
    "A \"metro station\" involves transportation, making it irrelevant to the purchase of movie tickets.",
    "After evaluating the options, the most appropriate venue for purchasing tickets to a movie would be a \"movie theatre.\""
