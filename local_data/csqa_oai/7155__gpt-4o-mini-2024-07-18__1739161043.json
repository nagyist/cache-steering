  "steps": [
    "To find a jellyfish that has not been captured, I need to consider where jellyfish are typically found in nature.",
    "Jellyfish primarily inhabit ocean waters, so places that are usually associated with the ocean, such as the shore, are potential locations.",
    "The option 'shore' indicates the area along the edges of ocean and seas where jellyfish could naturally be found.",
    "The option 'store' does not align with the natural habitat of jellyfish because they are not found for sale in a store as living creatures in their natural form.",
    "A 'tank' usually refers to an aquarium or a similar environment where jellyfish could be captured or kept.",
    "The option 'river' suggests a freshwater habitat which does not align with where most jellyfish thrive, as they are primarily saltwater organisms.",
    "After reviewing all options, the most logical answer is the 'shore' since jellyfish can be found in their natural environment there and are likely to exist freely."
