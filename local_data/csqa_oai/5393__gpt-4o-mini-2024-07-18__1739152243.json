  "query": "Question: When Bob plugs has electricity next to his nightstand, where is he?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: concert\nC: opera\nD: bedroom\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Bob has electricity next to his nightstand. This implies that he is in an area where a nightstand is typically found.",
    "A nightstand is most commonly located in a bedroom, as it is a piece of furniture where individuals place items such as lamps, alarm clocks, or books.",
    "The other options (church, concert, opera, restaurant) do not commonly have nightstands associated with them.",
    "A church typically has pews or a congregation area, a concert is often an auditorium or venue, an opera is also a performance space, and a restaurant would include tables and chairs rather than individual bedroom furniture.",
    "Since only the bedroom is a fitting environment for a nightstand and has electricity typically in such areas, this reinforces the conclusion.",
    "Considering the options again, the only reasonable location for Bob, considering the presence of a nightstand and electricity, is the bedroom."
