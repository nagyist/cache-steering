    "To determine what a person does before entering tertiary education, I need to understand the typical educational progression.",
    "Tertiary education usually refers to education taken after secondary education, which includes colleges and universities.",
    "Before someone can attend tertiary education, they generally must complete secondary education, which is often high school.",
    "High school graduation is typically a prerequisite for entering colleges or universities, which would be classified as tertiary education.",
    "Since high school is typically completed before entering college, I should examine the options provided to find which corresponds to this necessary step.",
    "Option D states \"graduate from high school,\" which aligns directly with the requirement of completing secondary education before moving on to tertiary education.",
    "Other options like A, B, C, and E do not pertain directly to the educational steps required before tertiary education.",
    "Option C, \"enter college,\" is the result of completing prior educational steps, not a step before entering tertiary education.",
    "Given this analysis, the most logical answer related to what needs to be accomplished before tertiary education is graduating from high school."
