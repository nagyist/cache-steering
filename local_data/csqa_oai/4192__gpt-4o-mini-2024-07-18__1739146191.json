  "query": "Question: The judge had ruled the murder case could be reopened, excavation soon began where?\n\nChoices:\nA: dead\nB: construction site\nC: under ground\nD: egypt\nE: cemetary",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a murder case can be reopened, indicating that new evidence might be found that could provide insight into the case.",
    "Excavation involves digging and searching the ground for evidence, so the location for this excavation must be relevant to the murder case.",
    "Choice A, \"dead,\" does not represent a physical location where excavation could take place.",
    "Choice B, \"construction site,\" is a potential location, but it doesn't inherently relate to finding evidence specifically connected to a murder case unless specified.",
    "Choice C, \"under ground,\" suggests a general area rather than a specific location, making it less likely to be a practical answer.",
    "Choice D, \"egypt,\" is too vague and geographically specific without context showing its relevance to the case.",
    "Choice E, \"cemetery,\" is a likely candidate for excavation in a murder case as it is a place where bodies are buried, and new evidence could potentially be uncovered.",
    "To confirm, cemeteries are known locations where police often conduct investigations when reopened murder cases involve corpses or suspected hidden evidence.",
    "Considering all these points, the most relevant and logical choice for where excavation would begin in a reopened murder case is a cemetery."
