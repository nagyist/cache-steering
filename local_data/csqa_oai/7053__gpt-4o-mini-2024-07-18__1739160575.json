  "query": "Question: What could using computer not cause if you are blind?\n\nChoices:\nA: increased efficiency\nB: happy\nC: stress\nD: carpal tunnel syndrome\nE: eye strain",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context: The question is asking what using a computer cannot cause for a blind person.",
    "Consider the implications of blindness: A blind person does not use their eyes to interact with a computer, which means any condition related to visual fatigue or strain may not apply.",
    "Analyze the choices:\n- A: Increased efficiency - A blind person may still become efficient at using a computer with assistive technologies.\n- B: Happy - A blind person can certainly feel happy while using a computer, depending on their experiences.\n- C: Stress - A blind person can experience stress due to various factors unrelated to sight, such as technical issues or social pressures.\n- D: Carpal tunnel syndrome - This condition relates to repetitive movements of the hands, which can still affect blind users who navigate with a keyboard or mouse.\n- E: Eye strain - As established, a blind person does not use their eyes to see a screen, so they cannot experience eye strain.",
    "Determine which option cannot occur for a blind person: Eye strain is directly related to vision and would not be experienced by someone who is blind.",
    "Review the implications of the other options: While stress (C) can occur for various reasons and does not have to be related to visual inputs, the only option that definitely cannot affect a blind person is E."
