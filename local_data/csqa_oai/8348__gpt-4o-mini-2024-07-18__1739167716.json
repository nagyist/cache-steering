  "query": "Question: Where will you find eggs before the farmer collects them?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: inside chicken\nC: omletts\nD: chicken coop\nE: egg carton",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to determine where eggs are located before they are gathered by the farmer.",
    "Eggs are produced by chickens, and they are usually laid in a specific place.",
    "One common location where chickens lay their eggs is in a chicken coop, which is specifically designed for housing chickens.",
    "The options provided include various locations and items where eggs might be found or sold, but we need to focus only on where they exist before being collected.",
    "The option \"A\" (supermarket) refers to where eggs are sold, and \"C\" (omelets) refers to a dish made from eggs, both of which do not relate to the actual location of the eggs before collection.",
    "The option \"E\" (egg carton) is a container for eggs after they are collected, so it is also irrelevant to the question.",
    "This leaves us with two options: \"B\" (inside chicken) and \"D\" (chicken coop).",
    "While eggs are indeed formed inside a chicken before being laid, the question specifically asks for where they can be found before the farmer collects them.",
    "The most suitable answer from the provided choices is \"D\", since a chicken coop is where eggs are typically found after being laid but before collection."
