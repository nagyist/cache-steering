  "steps": [
    "First, evaluate the context of where a light can be effectively used. A light source generally provides illumination in spaces where visibility is necessary or desired.",
    "Next, consider each option: the ocean would not be a practical place to put a light in terms of functionality for everyday use.",
    "The desk could be a suitable location for a light, as many people use desk lamps for reading or working.",
    "The universe is too vast and abstract of a concept and does not represent a physical location for placing a light.",
    "The attic, while a physical space where a light might also be necessary for visibility, is often used for storage and may not be a primary choice for general lighting.",
    "The chair, while a piece of furniture, does not serve as a location for placing a light effectively.",
    "After reviewing all options, the desk stands out as the most logical and common place to put a light, as it is intended for activities that require illumination."
