  "query": "Question: What does breathing do for living things?\n\nChoices:\nA: asthma attacks\nB: satisfies hunger\nC: sustaining life\nD: warm air\nE: giving life",
  "steps": [
    "Breathing is a biological process that involves the exchange of gases, primarily oxygen and carbon dioxide, between living organisms and their environment.",
    "For most living organisms, particularly those that rely on aerobic respiration, breathing is essential for obtaining oxygen, which is needed to produce energy in the form of ATP.",
    "The process of respiration allows cells to convert nutrients into energy, which powers all cellular activities necessary for survival.",
    "Without the intake of oxygen through breathing, organisms would not be able to sustain the biochemical processes that support life.",
    "While breathing does not satisfy hunger (hunger relates to the need for nutrients rather than oxygen), it is critical for maintaining the energy levels required for all functions, including movement and growth.",
    "The options A (asthma attacks), B (satisfies hunger), D (warm air), and E (giving life) either do not accurately describe the primary function of breathing or are too vague or incorrect in context.",
    "Option C (sustaining life) accurately encompasses the essential role that breathing plays in the energy production necessary for living organisms to exist."
