    "Since jogging is a physical activity, it generally has positive health effects. Thus, improved health (Choice A) is one possible outcome of jogging all day.",
    "However, jogging all day can also lead to injuries due to overuse, which might include shin splints (Choice C). This suggests that while there are benefits, there are also risks associated with excessive jogging.",
    "One common consequence of rigorous activity is fatigue. Jogging all day would likely result in being tired (Choice E) due to physical exertion and energy depletion.",
    "Jogging can also strengthen leg muscles, leading to strong legs (Choice D). However, this effect may not be as immediate or pronounced as the more immediate consequence of fatigue from extended activity.",
    "The risk of heart problems, such as heart attacks (Choice B), is generally lower for individuals who are active; however, extreme levels of exercise may lead to complications in some populations.",
    "Evaluating these options, it becomes clear that fatigue is a direct outcome of extended jogging, which many people would expect after such prolonged physical activity.",
    "While improved health and stronger legs are certainly positive outcomes of regular exercise, the act of jogging all day implies a significant physical toll, making tiredness a strong contender as a likely immediate effect.",
    "Thus, I need to weigh the likelihood and common experiences of consequences from jogging all day and conclude that being tired is the most relatable and immediate outcome."
