  "query": "Question: Sam was performing live.  John couldn't be there but he still listened.  What did he listen to?\n\nChoices:\nA: recorded\nB: eavesdropping\nC: neutral\nD: broadcast\nE: death",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sam was performing live, which implies that there was an event happening in real-time.",
    "John couldn't attend the event in person, indicating he was not physically present where the performance was taking place.",
    "Since John still listened to Sam's performance, we need to consider what form of listening would allow one to enjoy the performance from a distance.",
    "The term \"live\" suggests that the performance would typically be available to an audience through various mediums even if some people cannot attend in person.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"recorded\" implies that the performance was pre-existing and not live at the moment John listened, which contradicts the live nature of Sam's performance.",
    "\"Eavesdropping\" suggests that John was listening in a secretive manner, which does not correlate with a live performance scenario where he would likely want to listen openly.",
    "The term \"neutral\" does not fit in context because it doesn't refer to a method of listening or a form of engagement with Sam's performance.",
    "The option \"death\" does not relate to any listening experience John had or the live performance context at all; it seems completely unrelated.",
    "\"Broadcast\" indicates that the performance was being transmitted live, allowing John to listen from afar, which fits perfectly with the scenario described.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer to what John listened to, given the context of a live performance, is \"broadcast\"."
