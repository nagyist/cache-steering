  "query": "Question: Where would a woman store her leg razor?\n\nChoices:\nA: outside\nB: barber shop\nC: psycho's pocket\nD: suitcase\nE: medicine cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, I consider the typical locations where personal grooming items, such as a leg razor, are usually stored.",
    "I can eliminate options that do not make sense for personal grooming items. For instance, \"outside\" (A) does not provide a safe or suitable storage option.",
    "Next, \"barber shop\" (B) is also not a reasonable choice, as a barber shop is a public place where a woman would not typically store her personal razor.",
    "Then I consider \"psycho's pocket\" (C). This is an inappropriate and nonsensical location for a personal item.",
    "Now, I evaluate \"suitcase\" (D). While a woman might store a razor in a suitcase when traveling, it's not a common or practical storage solution for everyday use.",
    "Finally, I consider \"medicine cabinet\" (E). This is a logical and typical place where a woman might store her leg razor, along with other personal care items.",
    "After analyzing all options, the most suitable and reasonable answer is \"medicine cabinet\" (E)."
