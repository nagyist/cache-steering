  "query": "Question: The frozen food is starting to melt, where would I put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: refrigerator\nC: fridge\nD: grocery store\nE: heater",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where frozen food should be kept to prevent it from melting.",
    "Frozen food should be kept at a low temperature to maintain its frozen state and prevent thawing.",
    "The options presented include a supermarket, refrigerator, fridge, grocery store, and heater.",
    "Both \"refrigerator\" and \"fridge\" refer to the same appliance used for cooling food, typically at a higher temperature than freezing.",
    "The term \"supermarket\" refers to a retail store where groceries and frozen foods are sold, not a suitable option for storing food that is melting.",
    "\"Grocery store\" is similar to a supermarket; it is a place to buy food and is not a location for storing melting food.",
    "A \"heater\" is used to increase temperature, which would worsen the melting of frozen foods, so it's not a suitable option.",
    "Considering all the options, the best place to put melting frozen food is somewhere it can be safely stored and re-frozen, which is either the refrigerator or the fridge.",
    "Since \"fridge\" is just a casual term for refrigerator, I will choose \"fridge\" as a concise answer."
