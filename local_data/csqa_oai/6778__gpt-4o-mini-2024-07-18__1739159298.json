  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which states are part of New England. New England consists of six states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.",
    "Next, I analyze the options provided in relation to New England.",
    "Option A, Kentucky, is not part of New England, so it does not qualify.",
    "Option B, Canada, is a country that borders New England but is not a state within it.",
    "Option C, engraving, is not a relevant location or state.",
    "Option D, New Hampshire, is one of the states that comprises New England.",
    "Option E states \"new england,\" which more generally refers to the entire region rather than a specific state.",
    "I want a horse specifically from New England; New Hampshire is a state within New England where I could obtain a horse.",
    "Considering the options, only New Hampshire (option D) clearly indicates a specific state within New England where I can look for a horse."
