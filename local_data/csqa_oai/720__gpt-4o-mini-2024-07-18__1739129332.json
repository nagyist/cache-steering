    "To determine which creature performing pollination is loved by millions, we need to identify the options given and their relevance to pollination.",
    "Birds are known to be pollinators, especially species like hummingbirds, and they are admired for their beauty and songs.",
    "Action does not refer to a creature and thus is not applicable in the context of pollination.",
