  "steps": [
    "The question asks for what my brother and I should find if we want to see a robin at the end of summer.",
    "Robins are birds that typically lay eggs in nests.",
    "If we are currently seeing a blue egg, it can be inferred that this egg might belong to a bird, potentially a robin's egg.",
    "At the end of summer, robins would have already hatched from their eggs and can be seen flying around or in their habitats.",
    "Considering the options, a 'bird's nest' would be where we could still find eggs, but not necessarily a robin at the end of summer since the egg would have already hatched.",
    "If we are seeking to see the robin itself, we should not be looking for the egg or the nest anymore after it has hatched.",
    "The other options (fridge, plate, yolk, henhouse) do not directly pertain to observing robins at the end of summer.",
    "Among the choices, a 'bird's nest' seems like the option that connects to the concept of seeing a robin, as that is where the robin would have come from.",
    "Therefore, while a nest is where the robin originated from, at the end of summer, we would be looking for a place where we could observe the robin in its natural habitat, which might be around its nest.",
    "However, since the question asks for what to find *instead* of the blue egg to see the robin, the best fit is still related to the idea of seeing the bird, which means looking for the 'bird's nest' to have insight into where robins would be found post-hatching."
