  "query": "Question: The tool didn't fit the bolt, and the tool had a standard sizing, what was the bolt like?\n\nChoices:\nA: informal\nB: colloquial\nC: nonstandard\nD: standard wing\nE: stanine",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that a tool with standard sizing did not fit a bolt. This suggests a discrepancy between the tool's sizing and the bolt's sizing.",
    "Since the tool is described as having standard sizing, we can infer that standard sizes align with conventional measurements used for tools and bolts.",
    "The fact that the tool did not fit indicates that the bolt does not conform to the same standard sizes as the tool.",
    "To determine what the bolt could be like, consider the options presented. \"Nonstandard\" implies that the bolt does not match common or standard sizing conventions.",
    "The options \"informal\" and \"colloquial\" refer to language and style rather than sizing, so they can be ruled out.",
    "The option \"standard wing\" does not specifically pertain to the sizing aspect of bolts but rather refers to a type of fastener or component, which does not apply here either.",
    "The only option left that matches the idea of the bolt not fitting a tool with standard sizing is \"nonstandard\".",
    "Thus, we conclude that the bolt likely has a sizing that is different from the standard sizing, which supports the premise that the tool could not fit it."
