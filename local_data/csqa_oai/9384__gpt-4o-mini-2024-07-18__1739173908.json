  "query": "Question: A person who works 14 hours a day will have very little what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sleep\nB: care about\nC: spare time\nD: know everything\nE: own house",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze what working 14 hours a day implies. It suggests that this person is devoting the majority of their waking hours to work.",
    "Next, we consider the average amount of time people are awake in a day. Assuming a person sleeps around 8 hours, that leaves about 16 hours of awake time.",
    "If this person is working 14 hours of those 16 hours, they have only 2 hours remaining in their day for everything else.",
    "With only 2 hours left after working, it becomes apparent that this person has very little time for other activities.",
    "Now, let's review the choices. Option A, \"sleep,\" is unlikely since the person is already presumed to sleep approximately 8 hours.",
    "Option B, \"care about,\" is vague and does not directly link to time constraints.",
    "Option C, \"spare time,\" aligns perfectly with the scenario of a busy work schedule, indicating a scarcity of free time for leisure or personal activities.",
    "Option D, \"know everything,\" does not logically connect to the working hours. Working long hours does not equate to knowledge accumulation.",
    "Option E, \"own house,\" is unrelated to working hours directly and is more about financial capability than time availability.",
    "Given the analysis, the most fitting choice that makes the most sense based on working so much each day is \"spare time.\""
