    "The question asks about the activities of people who own restaurants.",
    "Owning a restaurant typically involves managing a business that provides food and dining services to customers.",
    "This suggests a primary activity related to the restaurant is selling food and beverages.",
    "The options provided include various unrelated activities, so it's important to find the one that best matches running a restaurant.",
    "Option A, \"own objects,\" is too broad and does not specifically relate to the restaurant business.",
    "Option B, \"mowing lawns,\" is unrelated and does not occur in the context of restaurant ownership.",
    "Option C, \"tell truth,\" is not a defining activity of owning a restaurant.",
    "Option D, \"believe in god,\" is irrelevant to the restaurant industry.",
    "Option E, \"selling food,\" aligns perfectly with the operation of a restaurant, which is primarily about providing food to customers.",
