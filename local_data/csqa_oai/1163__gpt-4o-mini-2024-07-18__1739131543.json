  "steps": [
    "The context mentions an \"attendant at the door,\" which suggests a formal event or gathering.",
    "The purpose of the attendant is to \"keep light from coming in,\" indicating a focus on maintaining a controlled environment, often seen in venues for performances or screenings.",
    "The phrase \"big premiere night\" implies that there is a significant event taking place, which commonly refers to movie premieres or theater productions.",
    "Among the given choices, 'theater' is the most closely associated with both premieres and having attendants to manage audience experience.",
    "'Building' is too generic and doesn't imply a specific event type, while 'office' usually refers to work environments and not premiere events.",
    "'Neighbor's house' is also not typically associated with formal premieres, and 'funeral' does not align with the idea of a premiere night.",
    "Therefore, the only suitable answer that matches the context of an event with an attendant and a premiere is 'theater.'"
