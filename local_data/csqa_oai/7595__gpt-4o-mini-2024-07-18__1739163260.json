  "query": "Question: What do most people have on their feet?\n\nChoices:\nA: shoes and socks\nB: floor\nC: table\nD: surface\nE: desk",
  "steps": [
    "We are trying to determine what most people typically have on their feet.",
    "The options provided are: A: shoes and socks, B: floor, C: table, D: surface, E: desk.",
    "Analyzing option A: \"shoes and socks\" are indeed items that people commonly wear on their feet.",
    "Now analyzing option B: \"floor\" is something that people stand on, but it is not something that is worn on feet.",
    "Considering option C: \"table\" is furniture and does not relate to what is on a person\u2019s feet.",
    "Looking at option D: \"surface\" is too vague and does not refer to specific items worn on the feet.",
    "Lastly, examining option E: \"desk\" is also furniture and not related to what is on feet.",
    "Since options B, C, D, and E do not pertain to items on feet, they can be eliminated.",
    "Therefore, option A is the only relevant choice that logically answers the question."
