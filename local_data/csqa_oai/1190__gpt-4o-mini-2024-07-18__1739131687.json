  "query": "Question: Where would the reception desk be located in a hotel?\n\nChoices:\nA: lobby\nB: seated restaurant\nC: office park\nD: building\nE: motel",
  "steps": [
    "The reception desk in a hotel is typically a service point where guests check in and out, receive information, and get assistance during their stay.",
    "Hotels usually have a designated area for guest services to ensure convenience and accessibility.",
    "The lobby is the main entrance area in a hotel where guests often gather, wait, or socialize.",
    "Given that the lobby is a high-traffic area for guests, it is logical for the reception desk to be located there.",
    "A seated restaurant is primarily for dining and typically does not serve as a check-in or concierge area.",
    "An office park is a commercial area designed for businesses, not hotels, and hence would not have a reception desk for hotel guests.",
    "A building is too broad and does not specifically denote where a hotel reception desk would be located.",
    "A motel may also have a reception desk, but it is not the correct answer considering the question specifically asks about a hotel.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the most appropriate location for a hotel reception desk is the lobby."
