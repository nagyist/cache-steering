  "query": "Question: Sarah didn't think that they deserved division.  She spend a lot of effort doing what to them?\n\nChoices:\nA: multiplication\nB: putting together\nC: times\nD: subtraction\nE: multiply",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sarah didn't think they deserved division, suggesting she believes in a different mathematical operation or approach that is cooperative or additive rather than divisive.",
    "Division, in mathematical terms, usually indicates breaking something apart. If Sarah doesn't believe they deserve division, she likely spent effort on something that brings things together or combines them instead.",
    "Analyzing the choices: \n- A (multiplication) implies putting together or increasing, which aligns with the idea of combining rather than dividing.\n- B (putting together) directly suggests combining, which is also relevant.\n- C (times) generally refers to multiplication but doesn't carry the direct meaning of effort or crafting a concept.\n- D (subtraction) indicates taking away, which is opposite of putting together.\n- E (multiply) is synonymous with multiplication but does not imply effort in a narrative sense.",
    "Choices A and E (multiplication and multiply) imply a similar theme, but they can be seen more as mathematical terms rather than actions Sarah would be \"doing.\"",
    "B (putting together) clearly states an action that aligns with her intention of uniting or combining efforts, while avoiding the idea of division.",
    "C (times) and E (multiply) can also be linked to the idea of a mathematical operation but are less focused on the effort aspect of the narrative.",
    "The most straightforward answer that directly conveys the effort of combining rather than any mathematical operation is choice B (putting together)."
