  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one would typically find a shopping bag for packing groceries.",
    "Shopping bags for groceries are commonly found in supermarkets, as they are often provided for customers to use upon purchase.",
    "While one might have shopping bags at home, it doesn't fit the context of finding a bag, as you're usually looking for one to pack groceries.",
    "A closet could hold shopping bags, but it is not a typical place for actually obtaining one when out shopping.",
    "Marts, similar to supermarkets, are another type of store where shopping bags for groceries can be found.",
    "A hardware store generally doesn't carry shopping bags specifically meant for groceries, as their focus is on tools and building materials.",
    "Given the primary purpose of supermarkets and marts, they are likely the correct choices, but typically, supermarkets are the more common answer.",
    "Therefore, the best option for finding a shopping bag for packing groceries would generally be a supermarket."
