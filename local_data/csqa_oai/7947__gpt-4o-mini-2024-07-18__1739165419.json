  "query": "Question: If one wants to breathe while they sleep, air needs to be inside of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: surface of earth\nC: space shuttle\nD: supermarket balloon\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the requirements for breathing. Humans require air, which contains oxygen, to breathe effectively.",
    "Next, we should identify whether the environment in question can contain air or is typically filled with air.",
    "Looking at option A, \"cupboard,\" it is typically enclosed and may not have enough air circulation for breathing comfortably.",
    "For option B, \"surface of earth,\" while there is technically air present, this option does not specify a confined space where one sleeps.",
    "In option C, \"space shuttle,\" while it does contain air, it is also a very specialized environment meant for astronauts and not a typical sleeping environment for most people.",
    "Moving on to option D, \"supermarket balloon,\" this is non-living and would not allow for breathing as a balloon can trap air but not provide a breathable atmosphere.",
    "Finally, looking at option E, \"house,\" it is a common dwelling where people sleep and naturally contains air needed for breathing.",
    "Now, comparing all options, the most reasonable and practical choice for a place where air needs to be present for breathing while sleeping is a house."
