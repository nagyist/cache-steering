  "query": "Question: The blood was everywhere in the operating room, what were the surgeons operating on?\n\nChoices:\nA: soccer game\nB: musle\nC: vein\nD: animals\nE: person",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the blood was everywhere in the operating room\" indicates a surgical context where a significant amount of blood loss has occurred, which usually happens during surgeries related to living beings.",
    "The presence of blood suggests that the subject of the surgery is likely alive and involves tissues or organs that can bleed during a procedure.",
    "Evaluating the choices, options A (soccer game) and D (animals) refer to situations not typically found in an operating room context for human surgeries.",
    "Option E (person) directly aligns with the typical environment of an operating room, as most surgeries conducted in such settings involve human patients.",
    "Option B (muscle) could also be a consideration since muscles may be operated on, but it does not encompass the entirety of what the surgeons could be focusing on in a surgery, which often includes multiple tissues and organs.",
    "Considering options B and E further, option E provides a broader understanding, implying the surgeons are indeed operating on a human being and involving various systems including blood vessels, muscles, and organs.",
    "In terms of the primary focus of the surgical procedure noted by the large amount of blood, it is most indicative of surgery performed on a person, which would result in the scenario described.",
    "Therefore, while there could be discussions of veins and muscles involved in the overall surgery, the largest and most logical choice considering all aspects of the question is option E."
