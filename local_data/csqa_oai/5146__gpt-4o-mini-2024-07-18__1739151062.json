  "query": "Question: Subway stations are generally found in a?\n\nChoices:\nA: large city\nB: london\nC: big city\nD: toronto\nE: chicago",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is about the common locations of subway stations.",
    "Recognize that subway systems are typically designed to handle high volumes of passengers associated with urban populations.",
    "Consider the option \"large city,\" which is a general term that encompasses cities of significant size and population where subways are commonly found.",
    "Next, evaluate the option \"big city.\" This is a synonym for large city and shares the same implications regarding urban infrastructure, including subway systems.",
    "Assess the other choices: \"London\" and \"Toronto\" are specific cities known for their subway systems, but they do not address the broader context of where subway stations are generally found.",
    "The city of \"Chicago\" is also a specific example but does not encompass the general principle of where subway systems are located.",
    "Since both \"large city\" and \"big city\" are similar and appropriate responses, consider which option better fits the question's intent of finding a general location.",
    "Both large city (A) and big city (C) convey the same meaning, however, \"big city\" is more informal and often used in common vernacular.",
    "Finally, since both A and C are acceptable, then I can choose either, but I will go with C as it stays within the informal context."
