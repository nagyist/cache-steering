  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what \"thousands or millions of office\" refers to. This implies a location where a significant number of office spaces exist.",
    "Next, we should consider the options provided. Each option will be evaluated based on where one might find a high concentration of office spaces.",
    "Option A: A zoo typically involves animal exhibits and visitor services, not offices, so it is unlikely to have thousands or millions of offices.",
    "Option B: \"Work\" is a general term; while it may involve offices, it does not specify a physical location where offices are located in concentration.",
    "Option C: A school building may have administrative offices, but it primarily serves educational purposes and would not typically host thousands or millions of offices.",
    "Option D: A public building can accommodate various offices (government, community services), but it still wouldn\u2019t be the primary place where thousands or millions of offices are concentrated.",
    "Option E: A city is known for having numerous businesses and services, which creates the potential for thousands or millions of offices. Cities are hubs for economic activity and have expansive office buildings.",
    "Considering all the options, the best answer that aligns with finding a large number of offices would be a city, as it encapsulates the density of administrative and business offices within an urban environment."
