  "query": "Question: Where did the bald eagle make its nest so that it couldn't be reached after it escaped?\n\nChoices:\nA: colorado\nB: cliff\nC: in a palm tree\nD: utah\nE: captivity",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the nesting location of a bald eagle after it escaped, indicating it needs a place that is hard to reach.",
    "Among the choices, the bald eagle is a large bird known for nesting in areas that provide height and security from predators.",
    "Colorado and Utah, while mountainous, are not specific enough in the context and suggest broader regions rather than specific nesting sites.",
    "Captivity refers to a situation where the eagle would be held in a confined space, which contradicts the idea of escaping.",
    "A cliff would provide a high and secure nesting area, which makes it difficult for potential threats to reach the nest.",
    "A palm tree, although tall, typically does not provide the same level of security or remoteness from predators as a cliff does.",
    "Therefore, considering the need for height and security, the most logical nesting location for the bald eagle after escaping would be on a cliff."
