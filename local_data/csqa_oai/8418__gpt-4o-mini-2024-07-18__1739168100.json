  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the best place to keep ice cream, which requires understanding the conditions necessary for ice cream storage.",
    "Ice cream needs to be kept at very low temperatures to maintain its solid state and prevent melting.",
    "A freezer is specifically designed to maintain low temperatures, typically around 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or lower, making it ideal for storing ice cream.",
    "Storing ice cream at a party is not a permanent solution and does not ensure it stays cold after a period of time.",
    "Serving ice cream cold is important, but it does not address where to keep it stored before being served.",
    "Keeping ice cream under the counter is not practical because it would likely not be cold enough to keep the ice cream frozen.",
    "While a movie might involve ice cream consumption, it does not serve as a storage solution.",
    "Comparing all options, the freezer stands out as the most reliable choice for long-term storage of ice cream to avoid melting.",
    "Options A, C, and D relate to keeping ice cream, but only A provides the necessary cold environment that ensures ice cream remains frozen.",
    "Therefore, the best place to keep ice cream is the freezer."
