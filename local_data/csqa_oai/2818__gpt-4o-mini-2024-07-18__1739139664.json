  "query": "Question: What can happen if you're too worn out before going to opera?\n\nChoices:\nA: jump\nB: fresh\nC: fall asleep\nD: headache\nE: relaxation",
  "steps": [
    "If someone is too worn out, their energy levels are likely to be very low.",
    "Low energy levels often lead to feelings of drowsiness or fatigue.",
    "Attending an opera typically involves sitting for a long duration in a calm and quiet environment.",
    "A calm and quiet setting can contribute to a person's tendency to fall asleep, especially if they are already feeling tired.",
    "While other options like a headache can occur from exhaustion, it isn't an inevitable reaction like falling asleep.",
    "The option \"jump\" does not relate to the context of being too worn out before an event.",
    "The option \"fresh\" contradicts the premise of being worn out.",
    "\"Relaxation\" could be a potential outcome, but it is less likely than falling asleep due to exhaustion.",
    "Considering all these factors, the most likely consequence of being too worn out before going to an opera is that a person might fall asleep."
