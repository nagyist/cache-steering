  "steps": [
    "The question suggests a scenario where high demand from people can lead to chaos.",
    "To avoid chaos, we need a method that organizes or structures people's actions in response to the high demand.",
    "\"Bank money\" (A) does not directly address crowd control or chaos prevention in the context of high demand from people.",
    "\"Call police\" (B) may help in instances where there is significant disorder, but it does not preemptively manage the situation or prevent chaos from occurring.",
    "\"Wait in line\" (C) suggests an organized and fair way to manage high demand, allowing people to take their turns, thereby maintaining order and reducing the likelihood of chaos.",
    "\"Believe in god\" (D) is more about personal faith and does not provide a practical solution to manage crowd dynamics.",
    "\"Suffer pain\" (E) is not a logical or effective way to manage demand or chaos; it implies a negative outcome rather than a solution.",
    "Among all options, \"wait in line\" is the most straightforward and effective way to avoid chaos when demand is high, as it establishes order."
