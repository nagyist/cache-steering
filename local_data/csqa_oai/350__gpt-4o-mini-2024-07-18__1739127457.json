  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"a vast complex\" implies that the subject being referred to includes multiple components or facilities. Therefore, it suggests the existence of a larger organization or location.",
    "The mention of \"launch pad\" indicates that the context is related to space exploration or aerospace activities, as launch pads are specifically used for launching rockets or spacecraft.",
    "Given the aerospace context, we can eliminate choices that do not align with space efforts. For instance, \"movie\" (A), \"military installation\" (D), and \"spaceship centre\" (E) are less likely related to the term \"launch pad.\"",
    "Next, we consider \"cape kennedy\" (B) and \"space center\" (C). Cape Kennedy, known as Cape Canaveral, is indeed a location associated with space launches but is specifically a geographic area, not a facility or organization in itself.",
    "On the other hand, \"space center\" (C) refers to an establishment designed for the purpose of space operations and activities, which is compatible with terms like \"launch pad.\"",
    "Since multiple launch pads are typically part of a larger facility or organization that conducts space missions, \"space center\" (C) encapsulates this idea of a comprehensive complex better than one specific location like \"cape kennedy.\"",
    "To validate, launch pads are components within space centers that often encompass various facilities for research, administration, and operations related to space missions.",
    "Hence, the most accurate answer, correlating directly to the concept of launching vehicles into space within a larger complex, is \"space center\" (C)."
