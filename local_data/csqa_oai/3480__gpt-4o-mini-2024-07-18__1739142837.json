  "query": "Question: WHat does someone usually produce a lot of when getting divorce?\n\nChoices:\nA: freedom\nB: tears\nC: richer\nD: depression\nE: tissues",
  "steps": [
    "First, it is important to consider the emotional impact of divorce on individuals. Divorce is often associated with a range of emotions, both positive and negative.",
    "One significant reaction to the process of divorce is sadness, which commonly leads to crying. Thus, \"tears\" could be one of the things produced during this emotional upheaval.",
    "In addition to tears, another emotional response to divorce can be feelings of grief or loss. Depression is often prevalent in individuals going through a divorce as they cope with the changes in their life.",
    "On the other hand, \"freedom\" does result from a divorce, but it is generally not something that is 'produced'; rather, it's a state gained after the marriage ends.",
    "The term \"richer\" does not logically connect to divorce, as most people may face financial challenges during and after a divorce due to legal costs and the division of assets.",
    "\"Tissues\" are often used when someone is crying, suggesting a practical item produced in response to the emotional tears that come from the experience of divorce.",
    "Now, considering the emotional aspects, both \"tears\" and \"tissues\" can be associated with the physical manifestation of crying during a divorce. While \"tears\" are directly associated with an emotion, \"tissues\" are the tool used to deal with those tears.",
    "Between the two, \"tears\" and \"tissues\", \"tears\" represent a more direct correlation to the emotional process, whereas \"tissues\" represent how to manage those tears.",
    "Nonetheless, in interpersonal situations, the act of crying is often more likely to be emphasized over merely using tissues, even though both are valid responses."
