  "query": "Question: Where can you take your automobile to go as fast as you can?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: parkling lot\nC: freeway\nD: racetrack\nE: side of road",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze each option to determine where one could potentially drive an automobile at high speeds.",
    "Option A is a garage. Generally, garages are for parking or storing vehicles and are not places to drive fast.",
    "Option B is a parking lot. While one might accelerate in a parking lot, it is usually not allowed or safe to drive at high speeds there.",
    "Option C is a freeway. Freeways are designed for high-speed travel and typically allow for faster speeds than regular city streets.",
    "Option D is a racetrack. Racetracks are specifically designed for racing and high-speed driving, making it another good candidate for driving fast.",
    "Option E is the side of the road. Similar to a parking lot, driving fast on the side of the road is not practical and is likely illegal.",
    "Now we have narrowed down the candidates that allow for high-speed driving to options C (freeway) and D (racetrack).",
    "A freeway allows for continuous high-speed travel across long distances, which is a common and practical scenario for driving fast.",
    "A racetrack, on the other hand, is specifically designed for racing, where individuals can push their automobiles to their limits under controlled conditions.",
    "Considering both options, while the freeway allows for high-speed travel, the racetrack provides a dedicated environment purposely meant for driving as fast as one can."
