  "query": "Question: If you are playing basketball for a long period of time, what is likely to cover your shirt?\n\nChoices:\nA: make baskets\nB: dribbling\nC: sweat\nD: fall down\nE: work together",
  "steps": [
    "When playing basketball for an extended period, physical exertion occurs, which often leads to sweating.",
    "Sweat is a natural response of the body to regulate temperature during physical activities such as basketball.",
    "As the game progresses and the intensity increases, more sweat is produced and can easily soak through clothing.",
    "The other options refer to actions during the game (A, B, D, and E) but do not specifically relate to something that would physically cover the shirt.",
    "While making baskets (A) and dribbling (B) are integral to the game, they do not result in anything covering the shirt.",
    "Falling down (D) could potentially result in dirt or other substances covering the shirt, but it is less common than sweat from exertion.",
    "Working together (E) doesn't involve any physical substance that would cover the shirt.",
    "Given that sweat is a common and expected outcome of playing basketball for a long time, it is the most logical answer."
