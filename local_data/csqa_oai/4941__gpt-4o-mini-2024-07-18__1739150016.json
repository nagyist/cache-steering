  "query": "Question: The horse was decorated because it was taking part in something. What was it in?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: parade\nC: western movie\nD: movies\nE: rodeo",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that the horse was decorated and implies it was participating in an event or activity.",
    "Common events where horses are often decorated include parades, rodeos, and film productions.",
    "Considering that \"countryside,\" \"movies,\" and \"western movie\" do not specifically indicate an event, I can narrow the focus to the events listed in the remaining options: parade and rodeo.",
    "Parades are known for featuring decorated animals and participants, where horses are often adorned to enhance the celebratory atmosphere.",
    "Rodeos also involve horses, but typically they may not be as elaborately decorated as they are in parades, which focus more on visual spectacle.",
    "In the context of \"decorated\" horses, a parade aligns more closely with the idea of presentation and decoration than a rodeo, where functionality is prioritized.",
    "Given the context and the nature of the activities, it seems most likely that the horse was participating in a parade.",
    "Thus, of all the options given, \"parade\" best fits the description of an event where horses would be decorated for participation."
