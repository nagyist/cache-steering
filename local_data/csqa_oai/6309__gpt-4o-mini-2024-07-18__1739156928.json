  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which state is known for having fresh-caught lobster. Lobster is primarily associated with coastal regions.",
    "Maine is well-known for its lobster industry and is a leading provider of fresh-caught lobster in the United States.",
    "Texas is inland and primarily known for its beef production, not seafood like lobster.",
    "Michigan has access to the Great Lakes but is not particularly famous for lobster. It has a fishing industry focused more on freshwater fish.",
    "Kansas City is located in Missouri and is also inland; it is famous for barbecue rather than seafood.",
    "Ohio is also inland, located near the Great Lakes, and while it may have seafood, it is not renowned for fresh-caught lobster.",
    "The other choices, while they may have seafood available, do not compare to Maine when it comes to fresh, commercially caught lobster.",
    "Thus, the only state among the options provided that is synonymous with fresh-caught lobster is Maine."
