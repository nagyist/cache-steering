  "query": "Question: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what?\n\nChoices:\nA: tip\nB: park officer\nC: incinerator\nD: dump\nE: wastebasket",
  "steps": [
    "The problem is related to refuse and littering, which implies the need for better waste management or disposal options.",
    "Adding facilities to manage litter typically involves providing more accessible places for people to dispose of trash and waste properly.",
    "A \"tip\" generally refers to a site for depositing refuse, which may not directly address littering issues in a park setting.",
    "A \"park officer\" could help enforce rules but does not provide a physical solution to the trash issue.",
    "An \"incinerator\" is a facility for burning waste but may not be appropriate or practical for a park, where convenience and accessibility are priorities.",
    "A \"dump\" is a larger waste disposal area and would not effectively reduce litter in a park setting.",
    "A \"wastebasket\" provides a convenient and accessible option for disposing of litter, directly addressing the littering problem.",
    "Comparing all the options, a wastebasket is the most suitable and effective solution for a refuse and littering problem in a park."
