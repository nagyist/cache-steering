  "query": "Question: The anemone was being harvested for sale in New York, where was it likely taken from?\n\nChoices:\nA: tide pool\nB: nursery\nC: michigan\nD: atlantic ocean\nE: ocean floor",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context in which anemones are typically found. Anemones are marine animals that generally inhabit oceanic environments, primarily near the coastlines.",
    "Next, evaluate each option by considering where anemones are likely to be harvested from. Tide pools are shallow water pools on the shore, which can contain various marine life, including anemones.",
    "However, nursery suggests a place where young marine life are raised, which might not directly correspond to harvesting for sale since it's more related to breeding or rearing.",
    "Michigan is a state located in the Great Lakes region, which does not have direct access to saltwater habitats where marine anemones are typically found.",
    "The Atlantic Ocean is a large body of saltwater that has abundant marine life, including anemones, specifically in its coastal areas.",
    "The ocean floor could be a habitat for anemones; however, harvesting them typically occurs at more accessible sites closer to shore rather than deep-sea locations.",
    "Given all of the potential sources, the Atlantic Ocean seems the most plausible as it is a source for marine species including anemones that might be harvested in New York.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that the anemone being sold in New York was likely harvested from the Atlantic Ocean."
