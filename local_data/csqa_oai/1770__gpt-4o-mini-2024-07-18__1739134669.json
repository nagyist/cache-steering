  "query": "Question: He is beginning work at his first job.  What is he feeling?\n\nChoices:\nA: panic\nB: resting\nC: stress\nD: excitement\nE: working",
  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that he is starting his first job, which suggests a significant transition in his life.",
    "New job situations can bring about a variety of emotions due to the uncertainty and new responsibilities involved.",
    "Considering the options, both excitement and stress are common feelings associated with starting a new job.",
    "Panic seems less likely as it indicates a more extreme feeling, which may not apply to everyone starting a new job.",
    "Resting does not fit because one typically does not feel resting when starting a new job; rather, they are expected to be active.",
    "Working is also not a fitting emotion, as it describes an action rather than a feeling.",
    "Excitement may come from the anticipation of new opportunities and experiences, but stress can arise from the pressure of performing well.",
    "It is possible that a person can feel both excited and stressed simultaneously when starting a new job.",
    "Without more context, it is difficult to determine which of the two (stress or excitement) is the predominant feeling.",
    "Given that excitement is often the more general feeling associated with new beginnings, I will lean towards that emotion."
