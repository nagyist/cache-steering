  "query": "Question: Where might a television used at night be?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: house\nC: apartment\nD: bedroom\nE: woods",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of a television used at night. Typically, televisions are used in living spaces where people relax and engage in entertainment.",
    "Identify common places where televisions might be set up. These include living rooms, bedrooms, and sometimes kitchens, but less so in wooden outdoor settings like the woods.",
    "Evaluate the choices: \nA: cabinet - A television being in a cabinet suggests it is not in use, which does not fit with nighttime use.\nB: house - A television can be in a house, but this is quite general and not specific.\nC: apartment - Similar to a house, a television might be in an apartment, but again, this is quite general.\nD: bedroom - Many people watch television at night in their bedrooms before going to sleep, which is a specific and relevant location.\nE: woods - Unlikely as a television setup; the woods would not typically be a place to use a television, especially at night.",
    "Among the specific choices, the bedroom stands out as the most plausible and commonly recognized location for nighttime television use.",
    "Given that the question asks for a specific location, bedroom (D) is the most fitting answer since many people enjoy watching TV in bed at night."
