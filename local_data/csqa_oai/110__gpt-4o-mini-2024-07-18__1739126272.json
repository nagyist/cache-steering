  "query": "Question: John was punching and punching at the wall but succeeded only in bloodying his knuckles. This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what?\n\nChoices:\nA: hostility\nB: anger\nC: nose\nD: fists\nE: hands",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of the scenario. John is repeatedly punching the wall and injures his knuckles. This suggests he is using his fists.",
    "Next, I consider the consequences of injuring his knuckles. Since the knuckles are part of the fingers and hands, injuring them would impact his ability to use his hands effectively.",
    "I then evaluate each of the provided answer choices to see which one is most relevant to the situation.",
    "Choice A (hostility) does not relate to physical ability and is emotional rather than physical.",
    "Choice B (anger) is also an emotion and does not have a direct impact on physical tasks.",
    "Choice C (nose) is a part of the body, but it is not involved in holding tools, making it irrelevant to John's ability to work.",
    "Choice D (fists) are the hands clenched into a position used for punching. However, if he injured his knuckles specifically, it's more directly related to the overall function of his hands.",
    "Choice E (hands) pertains to the entire hand structure which is critical for gripping and holding tools. Injuring his hands would make it impossible for him to effectively hold or operate tools.",
    "After this detailed analysis, the most logical choice in terms of the ability to hold tools is E (hands) since they are directly necessary for that function."
