    "The question asks about a location where there are many seats arranged in rows around a court.",
    "The word \"court\" typically refers to an area used for sports, such as basketball or tennis.",
    "I will consider the definitions of each of the answer choices to identify which fits best with a court.",
    "A \"show\" does not specifically imply a location with seats around a court.",
    "An \"auditorium\" is typically associated with performances or lectures, not sports with a court setup.",
    "\"Movies\" refers to cinemas, which have seats arranged for film viewing but not around a court.",
    "A \"soccer stadium\" does not have a court; it has a field, and the seats surround the field.",
    "A \"hockey game\" refers to an arena but also does not specifically mention a court.",
    "Considering the options, a basketball court or a tennis court has seats arranged around it, which is common in many sports arenas.",
    "The closest match for a location with lots of seats arranged around a designated area for sports is an arena, specifically for sports like basketball or tennis."
