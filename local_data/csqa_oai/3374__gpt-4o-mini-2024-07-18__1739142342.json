  "query": "Question: What weapon will aim for the nose of an aircraft?\n\nChoices:\nA: upper respiratory tract\nB: missile\nC: boomerang\nD: head\nE: aircraft",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, we need to identify what a \"weapon\" is in this context. A weapon is typically used to inflict harm or damage.",
    "Next, we consider the term \"aim for the nose of an aircraft.\" The \"nose\" refers to the front part of an aircraft.",
    "Now, let's evaluate each option to see which one could realistically aim for the nose of an aircraft.",
    "Option A, \"upper respiratory tract,\" does not make sense as a weapon. It refers to part of the human body and cannot aim at anything.",
    "Option B, \"missile,\" is a type of weapon specifically designed to be launched at a target, which could include aircraft. Missiles can be aimed directly at the nose of an aircraft.",
    "Option C, \"boomerang,\" is a throwing tool that is designed to return. While it can be thrown and may hit its target, it is not typically classified as a significant weapon aimed at aircraft.",
    "Option D, \"head,\" does not refer to a weapon but rather a part of the body, making it an unsuitable answer.",
    "Option E, \"aircraft,\" refers to the subject of the question itself and is not a weapon at all.",
    "After considering all options, the only choice that fits the criteria of a weapon that can aim at an aircraft is the missile."
