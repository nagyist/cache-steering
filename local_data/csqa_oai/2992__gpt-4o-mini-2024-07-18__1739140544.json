  "query": "Question: Your oven is most likely found where?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: prison\nC: school\nD: own home\nE: pizza place",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what an oven is typically used for. Ovens are primarily used for cooking and baking food.",
    "Next, think about the environments where cooking and baking are common. These include residential kitchens, commercial kitchens, and facilities that prepare food.",
    "Review the options. A restaurant and a pizza place are establishments that definitely use ovens extensively for food preparation.",
    "Now, consider a prison; while they might have kitchens for meal preparation, they are not commonly associated with standard ovens used for diverse cooking tasks.",
    "Next, evaluate the school option. Schools may have kitchens for preparing meals, but they do not typically have individual ovens like you would find in a home or a restaurant.",
    "Now, look at the option of an own home. Most homes have ovens as part of their kitchen setup, making this a likely option.",
    "Compare all the options: restaurants and pizza places are common for specialized ovens, but so are residences where families cook daily meals.",
    "Since the question asks where an oven is \"most likely\" found, we need to identify the most common scenario.",
    "Evaluate which environment has the highest prevalence of ovens: a residential home is very likely to have this appliance, whereas the other options might not have them everywhere.",
    "Determine the final decision based on this logic. An oven is most commonly associated with home cooking, more than with commercial settings or specific institutions such as schools or prisons."
