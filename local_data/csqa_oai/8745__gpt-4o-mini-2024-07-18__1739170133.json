  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a situation where the police have parked their vehicles and drawn their guns, indicating that they are taking a defensive or controlling action.",
    "The phrase \"the only way out of town\" suggests that the police are trying to control or restrict access to this route.",
    "A roadblock is a method used by law enforcement to stop or control traffic in a certain area, especially in critical situations or emergencies.",
    "The other options don't contextually fit: \n- A \"war\" implies armed conflict on a large scale and does not align with the actions of the police.\n- A \"sporting goods store\" and \"fun\" do not make sense in the context of policing a situation or controlling an exit.\n- A \"military base\" suggests a permanent installation, which does not match with the temporary nature of this action.",
    "Given the context and the actions described (police creating a way to control, stop, or manage an exit), the term \"roadblock\" is the most appropriate."
