  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"just a cog in a machine\" suggests a feeling of being part of a larger system where individual contributions are not valued, which is often associated with corporate or office environments.",
    "The term \"just a number in a cubicle\" implies a similar context, specifically pointing towards a structured work environment where employees are often placed in cubicles, a common feature of offices.",
    "Now, I will analyze the provided choices to see which one aligns with the described feelings of being dehumanized or diminished within a worksetting.",
    "Choice A: planner does not fit, as a planner typically has creative and coordinating roles, which do not imply feeling like a cog.",
    "Choice B: math book does not apply, since a math book is an inanimate object and does not relate to one's feelings about work or labor.",
    "Choice C: office fits perfectly, as workers in an office often feel like just a number or cog due to the repetitive and hierarchical nature of office work.",
    "Choice D: mathematics does not adequately fit the context of a work environment in which one would feel devalued\u2014the field itself lacks the workspace implications.",
    "Choice E: phonebook is irrelevant in a work context and doesn\u2019t convey the feelings described.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, I conclude that choice C: office most accurately reflects the sentiment expressed in the phrase."
