  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature of a stray small dog. A stray dog is one that does not have a permanent owner and is often found roaming freely in search of food or shelter.",
    "Examine each option given in the choices for where a stray dog could be found.",
    "Option A is \"animal shelter.\" This is a likely place because animal shelters often take in stray animals and provide them with care and safety while searching for their owners or new homes.",
    "Option B states \"big house.\" While a big house could potentially have a dog, it is not specifically a place for strays, unless we assume someone has taken the dog in, which is uncertain.",
    "Option C is \"own home.\" This usually refers to a dog's designated living space. If it is truly a stray, it would not typically be found in a home that it belongs to.",
    "Option D is \"Georgia.\" This is a geographical location and while strays can be found anywhere, this does not specifically indicate a place where one might find a stray dog.",
    "Option E is \"on a leash.\" This would normally imply that the dog has an owner or is being controlled, which does not align with being a stray.",
    "Now, comparing the most viable options, option A (animal shelter) clearly stands out as a specific location where stray dogs are frequently found, while the other options do not provide convincing locations for a stray small dog."
