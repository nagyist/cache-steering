  "query": "Question: what period did mammoth's live in?\n\nChoices:\nA: ancient times\nB: marwell comics\nC: forest\nD: prehistory\nE: museum of natural history",
  "steps": [
    "Mammoths are known to have lived during the last Ice Age, which falls within the geological period known as the Quaternary period.",
    "The Quaternary period is classified into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene.",
    "Mammoths predominantly roamed the earth during the Pleistocene epoch, which began around 2.6 million years ago and ended about 11,700 years ago.",
    "The term \"prehistory\" refers to the time period before recorded history, which encompasses the Pleistocene epoch.",
    "By definition, prehistoric times include the existence of species like the mammoth before human history was documented.",
    "While \"ancient times\" could refer to periods when early civilizations existed, it does not specifically refer to the era of mammoths, which predates established civilizations.",
    "\"Marwell comics,\" \"forest,\" and \"museum of natural history\" do not refer to time periods and therefore can be eliminated from consideration.",
    "Among the provided choices, the term that most accurately represents the time period when mammoths lived is \"prehistory.\"",
    "No other options align as precisely with the era of mammoth habitation as prehistory does.",
    "Thus, the correct answer is identified as being directly related to the time period in question."
