  "steps": [
    "To determine where someone is likely to find a huge amount of text, I should examine each option provided.",
    "Option A, a newspaper, contains a considerable amount of text but is limited to the articles and information for that day.",
    "Option B, a writer's brain, could hold many ideas and concepts, but it does not constitute a physical location where text can be found.",
    "Option C, one's own home, might contain books, articles, or other written material, but the volume of text would vary greatly from one home to another.",
    "Option D, a library, is specifically designed to house a vast collection of books, manuscripts, and other textual materials, making it a prime candidate for a huge amount of text.",
    "Option E, a bookstore, also contains a large amount of text in the form of books for sale, but it is generally not as extensive as that found in a library.",
    "Comparing these options, a library not only has a wide range of texts but also collects them for public use, which implies a greater quantity than a bookstore or an individual home.",
    "Thus, I can conclude that a library is the most likely place to find a huge amount of text."
