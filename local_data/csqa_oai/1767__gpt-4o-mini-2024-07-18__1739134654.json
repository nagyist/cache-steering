  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to find well stocked aisles?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: church\nC: car wash\nD: sanctuary\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze each option to identify where well-stocked aisles are commonly found.",
    "A supermarket is known for having aisles stocked with a variety of food and household items, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A church typically does not have aisles stocked with goods; it is primarily a place for worship and community gatherings.",
    "A car wash focuses on cleaning vehicles and may offer some related products, but it does not have well-stocked aisles like a retail environment.",
    "A sanctuary, similar to a church, is a place for worship and does not typically have stocked aisles for goods.",
    "A building is a general term that could refer to almost anything, but it does not specifically imply areas with stocked aisles.",
    "Upon reviewing the above options, a supermarket stands out as the only place that fits the description of having well-stocked aisles.",
    "I will confirm that the definition of well-stocked aisles aligns with essential retail spaces, further supporting the supermarket option.",
    "Finally, since no other options provide a setting for well-stocked aisles, I conclude that the answer must be A."
