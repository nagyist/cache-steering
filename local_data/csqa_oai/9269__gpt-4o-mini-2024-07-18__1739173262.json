  "query": "Question: Where does litter end up when it's tossed from a car?\n\nChoices:\nA: roadsides\nB: street corner\nC: not in the garbage\nD: park\nE: ground",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the action of tossing litter from a car. When someone discards trash while driving, it is likely to fall to the ground rather than being retained inside the vehicle.",
    "Next, we can analyze the potential locations where the litter may land. Litter thrown from a moving vehicle would generally fall onto the roadway or shoulder of the road as opposed to being contained within a specific location such as a park or street corner.",
    "We can eliminate options that suggest a stable or contained area. Options such as \"street corner\" and \"park\" imply that the litter is intentionally placed in specific locations rather than randomly discarded.",
    "Let\u2019s assess the remaining options. The option \u201croadsides\u201d implies a similar concept to the roadway, where litter may accumulate due to being tossed from vehicles. The option \"ground\" is broader and could pertain to any area directly beneath the point of disposal.",
    "Being on the \u201cground\u201d is very general and could encompass numerous environments including roadsides, parks, and other areas. However, specifically, litter thrown from a vehicle most commonly lands on roadsides, making that a more accurate answer for the specific act of littering from a car.",
    "The option \"not in the garbage\" (C) while true, doesn\u2019t specify a location where litter ends up. It merely states an outcome of not being disposed of properly. Therefore, it does not directly answer where the litter lands.",
    "The option \"roadsides\" directly reflects the typical surroundings of roads where litter may accumulate, making it a more definite answer in context to the question.",
    "We should prioritize the option that most directly addresses the question of where litter ends up after being discarded from a car and that is \"roadsides.\""
