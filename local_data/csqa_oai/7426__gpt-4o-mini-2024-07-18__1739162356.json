  "query": "Question: If you're waiting for traffic for a long time you might be what arriving to work?\n\nChoices:\nA: lenthy\nB: have time to think\nC: time consuming\nD: being late\nE: boredom",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the state someone might find themselves in after waiting in traffic for a long time.",
    "One possible outcome of waiting in traffic is that it can often lead to someone arriving at work after their scheduled time.",
    "Option D: \"being late\" directly suggests that the person will arrive later than expected due to the traffic situation.",
    "Options A (lenthy) and C (time consuming) are less about the arrival at work and more about the nature of the wait itself, which is not what the question is asking.",
    "Option B: \"have time to think\" might occur during a wait, but it does not directly answer the question about arriving to work.",
    "Option E: \"boredom\" can be a side effect of waiting but again does not address the arrival at work concept.",
    "Based on the process of elimination, the most suitable answer that aligns with the scenario of long traffic delays impacting arrival is option D."
