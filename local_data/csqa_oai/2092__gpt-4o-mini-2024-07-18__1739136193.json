  "steps": [
    "First, consider the relationship between you and your niece. Your niece is the daughter of your sibling, which makes her your family member.",
    "Next, consider where a child, like your niece, would typically live. Children usually live with family or guardians, not in abstract concepts like a family reunion or family picture book.",
    "The option \"D: brother's house\" indicates a specific location where your niece might live, assuming your brother is her parent.",
    "Both \"family tree\" and \"family reunion\" are concepts that describe relationships, whereas \"adoption\" relates to legal status but does not specify a physical living arrangement.",
    "Since your niece is a child, we would assess the most likely place for her to live among the given choices, focusing on the family connections.",
    "Considering that children often reside with their parents or close family members, the most logical choice among the options presented is her parent's house, which in this context means your brother's house.",
    "The choice \"D: brother's house\" makes the most practical sense as a living situation for your niece."
