  "query": "Question: Where is likely to have a lot of fire extinguishers?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: hospital\nC: boat\nD: house\nE: doll house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the locations mentioned in the choices and the necessity of fire extinguishers in those locations.",
    "The garage (A) often contains flammable materials (e.g., gas, tools), making it a possible location for fire extinguishers.",
    "A hospital (B) has medical equipment that may involve flammable materials, so it likely has fire extinguishers for safety protocols.",
    "A boat (C) is also a valid location for fire extinguishers, especially considering the need for safety on water and the potential for flammable materials.",
    "A house (D) typically has fire extinguishers, especially in modern homes where safety measures are increasingly considered.",
    "A doll house (E) is typically a toy and would not realistically contain fire extinguishers, as it's not a real living space.",
    "The safety regulations for high-risk areas typically require more fire extinguishers; thus, a hospital may have stringent regulations.",
    "Boats also have strict safety regulations requiring them to have fire extinguishers on board, usually due to the presence of flammable materials like fuel.",
    "While all these locations may have fire extinguishers, the hospital likely has them in high quantities due to the diverse needs and safety requirements of medical environments.",
    "Given all this reasoning, the location most likely to have **a lot** of fire extinguishers is the hospital."
