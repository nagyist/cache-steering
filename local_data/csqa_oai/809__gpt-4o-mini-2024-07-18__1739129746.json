  "query": "Question: Where would you put a computer other than a desk?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: table\nC: school\nD: office\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "To find a suitable location for a computer other than a desk, I should consider typical uses and placements of computers.",
    "Desks are commonly associated with workspaces, but there are other surfaces and locations where computers can function effectively.",
    "A table is a flat surface that can accommodate a computer and is often used in casual or communal spaces, making option B viable.",
    "An apartment (option A) is a type of dwelling and doesn\u2019t specify a surface or location within it. It may or may not have a desk/table suitable for a computer.",
    "A school (option C) is an establishing location where computers are frequently used, particularly in classrooms or labs, so it may be a place where a computer can be found even if not on a desk.",
    "An office (option D) primarily indicates a work environment where desks are common, making this less relevant, as I am looking for alternatives to desks.",
    "A house (option E) is another type of dwelling that does not suggest a specific alternative surface for the computer; it could have a table, desk, or floor.",
    "Evaluating the answers, the most reasonable alternative placement for a computer outside of a desk format appears to be a table (B) because it\u2019s specifically a type of surface that fits the requirement.",
    "However, I also recognize that a computer could indeed be utilized in a variety of locations such as a school setting, which accommodates computers without necessarily being on a desk.",
    "Both options B (table) and C (school) are valid answers, but table is more direct as it refers to a specific surface outside of a traditional desk setup."
