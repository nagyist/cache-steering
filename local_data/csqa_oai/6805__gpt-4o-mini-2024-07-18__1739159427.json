  "query": "Question: After getting drunk and crashing his car, what resulted for him?\n\nChoices:\nA: police award\nB: erections\nC: violence\nD: injury\nE: illness",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the consequences of getting drunk and crashing a car. Generally, this action can lead to legal troubles, injuries, or accidents.",
    "Next, let\u2019s analyze the choices provided. \"Police award\" seems unlikely, as police typically do not award individuals for criminal actions like drunk driving.",
    "Now, looking at \"erections,\" this doesn\u2019t logically connect to crashing a car while being drunk. It\u2019s unrelated to the situation at hand.",
    "Next, we examine \"violence.\" While accidents might lead to heightened emotions and potential conflict, it isn't a direct result of the crash itself.",
    "Moving on to \"injury,\" both the driver and other parties involved in a crash can sustain physical harm.",
    "Finally, considering \"illness,\" while alcohol consumption can lead to health issues, it isn't directly related to the immediate result of a car crash.",
    "After analyzing all the options, \"injury\" stands out as the most direct consequence of crashing a car after drinking."
