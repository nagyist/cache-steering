  "query": "Question: How do you communicate with a friend when you are apart?\n\nChoices:\nA: promise to help\nB: offer to help\nC: write letter\nD: keep secret\nE: cover up for",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks how to communicate with a friend when you are apart, which implies a method of communication that can bridge distance.",
    "Let's analyze the options provided: \n- A (promise to help) implies support but doesn\u2019t describe a communication method.\n- B (offer to help) is similar to A; it suggests intention but lacks direct communication.\n- C (write letter) directly states a method of communication that can occur even when separated.\n- D (keep secret) suggests withholding information, which is not a way to communicate.\n- E (cover up for) also implies deceit or protection rather than direct communication.",
    "From the analysis, options A, B, D, and E do not pertain to methods of communication. They either focus on support or secrecy.",
    "Since C (write letter) is the only choice that represents a tangible method to express thoughts or feelings to a friend from a distance, it stands out.",
    "In the context of traditional communication, writing a letter has historically been one of the primary methods for staying in touch when physically apart.",
    "Furthermore, modern adaptations such as emails and text messages serve the same function but align closely with the concept of writing.",
    "Given that C encompasses both the broader concept of writing and delivering messages to maintain communication, it is the most appropriate choice."
