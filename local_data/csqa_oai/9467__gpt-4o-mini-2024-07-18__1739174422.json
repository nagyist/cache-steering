  "query": "Question: The crass men were talking about what they called a broad, one said he thought she was too what?\n\nChoices:\nA: broadtail\nB: thin\nC: skinny\nD: slender\nE: foreign",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"broad\" in this context is likely referring to a woman, often in a derogatory or disrespectful manner.",
    "The phrase \"he thought she was too\" suggests that one of the men is expressing a negative opinion about the woman's physical appearance.",
    "The options presented (A: broadtail, B: thin, C: skinny, D: slender, E: foreign) involve various descriptors related to body type.",
    "Options A: broadtail and E: foreign do not directly relate to a description of a woman's body size.",
    "We are left with options B: thin, C: skinny, and D: slender.",
    "The word \"skinny\" (C) typically carries a stronger negative connotation compared to \"thin\" (B) or \"slender\" (D).",
    "Considering the tone of the conversation among the \"crass men,\" it's likely that they would use a term that conveys a more judgmental view of the woman's appearance.",
    "Among the remaining options, \"skinny\" fits best as it usually denotes an extreme lack of body fat in a way that can be seen as unattractive or unhealthy.",
    "Thus, the man most likely expressed his opinion that the woman was too \"skinny.\""
