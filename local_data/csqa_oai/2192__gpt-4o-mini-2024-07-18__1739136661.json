  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that \"the electricity went out,\" which implies there was some kind of electrical equipment in use.",
    "The use of electricity suggests an event likely involved sound amplification, which is common in concerts and performances.",
    "The phrase \"nobody could see or hear the band\" indicates that there was a band present, which typically refers to a musical group performing in a live setting.",
    "While both concerts and operas can feature bands or musical groups, the mention of a \"band\" specifically points more towards popular music events rather than a formal opera setting.",
    "The other options\u2014building, bedroom, and church\u2014do not provide a context where a band would typically perform.",
    "While churches can host music events, the phrasing used suggests a more typical concert scenario rather than religious settings or personal spaces like a bedroom.",
    "Given all this information, it is most logical that the event being attempted was a concert."
