  "steps": [
    "The question describes an investor who seems shady and insists that his client must spend money.",
    "When thinking about why an investor would tell a client to spend money, it is typically linked to the idea of generating a return on investment.",
    "The most common phrase associated with spending money to generate returns is \"making money.\"",
    "Choice A (\"obtain money\") is less specific than the notion of making money through investment.",
    "Choice B (\"make money\") directly corresponds to the idea of spending money to potentially increase one\u2019s financial status.",
    "Choice C (\"go shopping\") is a more casual and less investment-oriented thought, which doesn't align with an investor's typical advice.",
    "Choice D (\"buy things\") is a similar casual idea, but again does not relate strictly to the investment context.",
    "Choice E (\"steal money\") does not make sense in this context, as it infers illegal activity rather than legitimate investment advice.",
    "Evaluating all options, the only choice that strongly relates to an investment context is \"make money.\""
