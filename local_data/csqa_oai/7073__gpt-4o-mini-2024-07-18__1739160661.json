  "steps": [
    "The question is about a windshield that is primarily designed for spray and also has to deal with wind.",
    "Windshields are commonly associated with vehicles, but the context of \"mostly for spray\" suggests a water-related environment.",
    "Among the given choices, \"motor vehicle\" (A) and \"car\" (B) primarily operate on land, making them less likely candidates for consideration of spray.",
    "\"Motorboat\" (C) is specifically designed for use on water, where spray from the water is common, making it a strong contender.",
    "On a motorboat, the wind is also a significant factor as it can affect the experience of being on the water.",
    "\"Motorcycle\" (D) is another land-based vehicle, which also wouldn't typically deal with water spray.",
    "\"Airplane\" (E) does have a windshield and deals with wind; however, the mention of \"spray\" is not significantly relevant to airplanes, which operate at high altitudes away from water.",
    "Given the context of water and spray, the most logical choice is \"motorboat\" (C), as it considers both aspects mentioned in the question."
