  "query": "Question: What do you use to make confetti?\n\nChoices:\nA: big cities\nB: friend's wedding\nC: air\nD: shredder\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "To make confetti, I need to consider the materials typically used. Confetti is usually made from paper or similar lightweight materials.",
    "Next, I can evaluate the answer choices to see which one relates best to the creation of confetti.",
    "Option A, \"big cities,\" does not make sense as a resource for confetti; rather, they are typically locations where one might use confetti.",
    "Option B, \"friend's wedding,\" might involve confetti but does not indicate a method or material for its creation.",
    "Option C, \"air,\" is unrelated to the creation of confetti, as air is not a physical material that can be used to make confetti.",
    "Option D, \"shredder,\" could be relevant here because shredders can be used to cut paper into small pieces, which can effectively create confetti.",
    "Finally, while option E, \"grocery store,\" is a place where one might purchase confetti, it does not pertain to the process of making it.",
    "Considering these options, the most logical answer for what is used to make confetti is definitely \"shredder,\" as it directly relates to the action of creating confetti from paper."
