  "query": "Question: After taking my final exams I got my grades back and had  a 4.0 gpa, how did I feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: graduation\nB: headaches\nC: fail again\nD: success\nE: failure",
  "steps": [
    "I received my grades back after my final exams, indicating that the outcome has already been determined.",
    "Achieving a 4.0 GPA is a strong indicator of academic success, suggesting that I performed very well in my exams.",
    "I would likely feel positive emotions associated with high achievement and commendable academic performance.",
    "Graduating (Choice A) may be a reasonable feeling, but it is not directly indicated by just receiving my grades.",
    "I am unlikely to feel headaches (Choice B) purely based on academic performance unless there was pre-existing stress, but that does not specifically relate to the grades.",
    "Feeling like I would \"fail again\" (Choice C) contradicts the evidence that suggests I did well, as I secured a perfect GPA.",
    "The likelihood of feeling a sense of success (Choice D) is very high given that a perfect GPA is typically a source of pride and accomplishment.",
    "Feeling like a failure (Choice E) also contradicts my performance, as a 4.0 GPA represents the opposite of failing.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the most appropriate feeling in relation to getting a 4.0 GPA is that of success."
