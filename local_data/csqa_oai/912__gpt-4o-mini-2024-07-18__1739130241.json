  "query": "Question: What do horses do to get energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: eat grass\nB: play\nC: kept in stables\nD: dominated\nE: drink coffee",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the biological needs of horses. Horses require energy to perform activities such as running, walking, or playing.",
    "Next, we think about the primary source of energy for horses. Horses are herbivores, which means their diet consists mainly of plant material.",
    "Looking at the choices, we notice that eating grass is a natural behavior for horses, as it provides them with the necessary nutrients and energy.",
    "Playing, while it does expend energy, does not actually provide energy; it is an activity rather than a source.",
    "Being kept in stables is an environmental condition, not a source of energy.",
    "'Dominated' refers to a social interaction and does not relate to energy acquisition.",
    "Drinking coffee is not something horses can or do consume, and it is not a source of energy for them.",
    "Considering all these points, the most logical choice that corresponds with how horses obtain energy is through their diet, specifically by eating grass."
