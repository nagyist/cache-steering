  "query": "Question: John lives in a farhouse well away from anyone. He doesn't farm himself, the farm shut down long ago.  How would you describe the area where he lives?\n\nChoices:\nA: farming community\nB: rural area\nC: cow's shed\nD: michigan\nE: housing farmer and family",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what \"farhouse\" implies. It suggests that John lives remotely, which generally points towards a less populated area.",
    "Next, the fact that the farm shut down long ago indicates that the area likely does not serve as a thriving agricultural zone at this moment.",
    "The term \"farming community\" suggests an area where farming is still an integral part of the lifestyle, which contradicts the description of shutdown farming.",
    "\"Cow's shed\" refers to a specific structure for livestock, rather than a description of the living area that John resides in, making it irrelevant in this context.",
    "\"Michigan\" is a geographical location but doesn\u2019t specifically relate to a description of the area John lives in. It\u2019s too broad.",
    "\"Housing farmer and family\" also implies an active farming context, which again contrasts with the current state of abandonment of agricultural activities in John's area.",
    "Given these points, the most appropriate term to describe the area where John lives would be \"rural area.\" It encompasses the ideas of being remote and sparsely populated without implying active farming.",
    "Confirming all the choices, the only one that correctly fits the description of a remote, sparsely populated setting without active farming is \"rural area.\""
