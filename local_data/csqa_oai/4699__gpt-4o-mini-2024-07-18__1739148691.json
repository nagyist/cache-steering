  "query": "Question: Where is garbage brought to by garbagemen?\n\nChoices:\nA: trashcan\nB: landfill\nC: television\nD: computer\nE: dumpster",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where garbagemen bring garbage.",
    "Garbagemen are typically responsible for collecting waste and transporting it to a designated location.",
    "Common locations where garbage is taken include landfills or transfer stations.",
    "A trashcan is a receptacle for garbage but not a final destination for collection.",
    "Television and computer are not relevant to the disposal of garbage, as they are electronic devices unrelated to waste management.",
    "A dumpster is also a temporary container for garbage, but it is usually emptied into a larger vehicle for transportation to a landfill.",
    "Given that the question seeks a final destination, the most appropriate answer is where the majority of collected waste ultimately ends up.",
    "Landfills are designed as waste disposal sites for garbage collected by services like those provided by garbagemen.",
    "Thus, the most accurate answer is the landfill where the garbage ultimately goes."
