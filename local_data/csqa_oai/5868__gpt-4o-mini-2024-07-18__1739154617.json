  "query": "Question: Where would you find a dictionary near young people getting lessons?\n\nChoices:\nA: shelf\nB: friend's house\nC: table\nD: library\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of young people getting lessons. This suggests an educational environment.",
    "Next, I think about locations where young people typically receive lessons. This could include schools, study groups, or private tutoring spaces.",
    "Among the options provided, I need to identify which locations are most commonly associated with dictionaries and learning.",
    "A bookshelf (choice A) is usually found in various environments but it's not a direct location where lessons happen.",
    "A friend's house (choice B) might sometimes have a dictionary, but it's not specifically targeted towards learning.",
    "A table (choice C) could be a place where lessons occur, but a table by itself does not indicate a dictionary is present.",
    "A library (choice D) is indeed a place filled with resources like dictionaries and is frequently used as a study area by students.",
    "A classroom (choice E) is a direct setting for lessons and would most certainly have dictionaries available for students.",
    "Now, I need to decide between the library (choice D) and the classroom (choice E). Both are places where dictionaries can be found and lessons can occur.",
    "However, since classrooms are more specifically tailored for learning with dictionaries likely always available, I'd favor the classroom as the primary teaching area."
