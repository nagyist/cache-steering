  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the primary method of combat during war, implying that the focus is on the overall purpose or aim rather than the method itself.",
    "Among the provided options, we need to identify what the ultimate goal of engaging in combat is during war.",
    "Option A states \"conquer opponent,\" which suggests gaining control over territory or the opposing force. This aligns with a common military objective in war.",
    "Option B says \"fight enemy,\" which describes an action rather than a goal. Fighting is indeed a method used in war, but not the overarching aim.",
    "Option C offers \"join army,\" which implies enlistment rather than a goal of combat. Joining an army is a step taken before engaging in combat, not the objective of warfare itself.",
    "Option D, \"kill,\" specifically refers to causing death. While it may occur in warfare, it does not capture the broader goal of engaging in combat, which often includes stopping an enemy or achieving strategic advantages.",
    "Option E, \"terrible,\" is an adjective and does not provide a goal or purpose related to combat in war. It is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Considering the analysis, the most fitting choice that captures the intent of engaging in combat during war is to \"conquer opponent,\" which is a clear goal of many military actions."
