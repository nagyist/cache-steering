  "query": "Question: When a person takes business calls on the phone, where does it tend to take place?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: office\nC: desktop\nD: rest area\nE: in the car",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of business calls. These calls are typically made in environments that facilitate professional communication.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. An office environment is specifically designed for work-related activities, making it a common location for business calls.",
    "Consider the option of a desktop. While it may refer to a computer station, it does not directly imply where phone calls are made; it could be at home or in an office.",
    "Now evaluate the neighbor's house. This is an unlikely place to conduct business calls as it is informal and not dedicated to business.",
    "Examine the rest area. While one could potentially make a call in a rest area, it doesn't convey a professional atmosphere suitable for business discussions.",
    "Finally, assess the option of being in the car. Although people may take calls while driving, it is considered less professional and more distracting than being in a dedicated workspace.",
    "After filtering through the contexts of each option, an office stands out as the most relevant and common location for business-related phone calls."
