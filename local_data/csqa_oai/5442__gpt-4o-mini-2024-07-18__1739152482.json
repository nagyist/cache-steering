  "query": "Question: The shark realized it was in northern california, where was it likely?\n\nChoices:\nA: sea world\nB: tropical waters\nC: tomales bay\nD: aquarium\nE: great oceans",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where the shark might be, consider that northern California has distinct geographical features and marine environments.",
    "The options include various environments: Sea World and an aquarium are enclosed environments, while tropical waters and the great oceans suggest open sea habitats.",
    "Tomales Bay is a specific body of water located in northern California, known for its unique marine ecosystem.",
    "Since the question mentions the shark realized it was in northern California, we should look for a location that is both realistic for a shark and geographically accurate.",
    "Tropical waters are unlikely since northern California has a cooler, temperate climate, which sharks wouldn\u2019t typically inhabit.",
    "The great oceans could be a possibility, but this is too broad and does not specifically denote a location in northern California.",
    "Sea World and aquariums are not likely places for a wild shark to realize its location, as they are man-made environments, and the question implies a wild context.",
    "Tomales Bay, on the other hand, fits well as it is a natural estuary that could contain sharks as part of its ecosystem.",
    "Based on the context and specific location mentioned, Tomales Bay is the most appropriate and logical answer for where the shark could likely be."
