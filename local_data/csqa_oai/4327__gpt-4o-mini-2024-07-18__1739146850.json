  "query": "Question: What does ice on skin cause?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel exciting to touch\nB: feel cold\nC: itches\nD: feel electric\nE: feel pressure",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the properties of ice and cold temperatures. Ice is a solid form of water that is below freezing temperature, typically around 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C).",
    "Next, when ice comes into contact with skin, the temperature difference causes the skin to lose heat rapidly.",
    "As the skin loses heat, it will experience a sensation associated with cold temperatures, which is commonly described as \"cold\" or \"chilly.\"",
    "Now, evaluate the provided options against the sensations experienced when touching ice.",
    "Option A states \"feel exciting to touch.\" This is not true as ice does not create an exciting sensation.",
    "Option B states \"feel cold.\" This accurately describes the immediate sensation caused by ice on skin.",
    "Option C states \"itches.\" While skin can become itchy due to other factors, ice does not directly cause an itching sensation on contact.",
    "Option D states \"feel electric.\" This sensation could be related to various stimuli, but it doesn't accurately describe the effect of ice on skin.",
    "Option E states \"feel pressure.\" Ice does not inherently cause a sensation of pressure; rather, it primarily induces a cold feeling.",
    "Since the primary and most accurate sensation caused by ice coming into contact with skin is cold, the correct choice aligns with option B."
