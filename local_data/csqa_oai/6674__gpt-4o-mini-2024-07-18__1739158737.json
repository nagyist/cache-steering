  "steps": [
    "The question states that she wanted to use television but couldn't find the remote. This implies that she is looking for a way to operate the television without the remote control.",
    "Considering the scenarios of using a television, the common functions include switching it on or off, changing the channel, adjusting the volume, or accessing input sources. The main issue here is the inability to turn the television on.",
    "The phrase \"she didn't know how to manually\" indicates that she lacks the knowledge or skill to perform a basic function of operating the television without the remote.",
    "Among the provided choices, \"switch on\" refers directly to turning on the television, which is a primary function that is typically handled by the remote.",
    "The other choices, such as \"kill,\" \"open eyes,\" \"plug in,\" and \"watch tv,\" do not directly relate to the immediate need to operate the television without a remote control.",
    "\"Kill\" is unrelated as it does not apply in this context. \"Open eyes\" doesn't make sense as it refers to a physical action unrelated to television operation. \"Plug in\" may be a step if the television is disconnected, but it doesn't address operating it without a remote. \"Watch tv\" assumes the television is on and doesn't connect to the struggling with the remote.",
    "Thus, the best choice that directly answers her inability to operate the television manually is \"switch on.\""
