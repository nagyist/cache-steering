  "query": "Question: What type of location would you find fish for sale?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: ocean\nC: pay debts\nD: stream\nE: market",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where fish are commonly sold. Fish can be found in various places, but for sale suggests a commercial setting.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. A refrigerator (A) is a storage option for fish but not where they are sold.",
    "The ocean (B) is a natural habitat for fish but not a location where you would buy fish.",
    "Paying debts (C) is irrelevant to the question about locations where fish are sold.",
    "A stream (D) is also a natural body of water where fish might be found but is not a location to purchase fish.",
    "Now, look at the last option, market (E). A market is a place where goods, including fish, are sold.",
    "Given that the question asks specifically for locations where fish are for sale, the most appropriate answer is market (E)."
