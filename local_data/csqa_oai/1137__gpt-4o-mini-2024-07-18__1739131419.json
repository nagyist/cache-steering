  "query": "Question: If you find a bone wrapped in clothe, where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: tomb\nB: museum\nC: arm\nD: human body\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "The presence of a bone suggests the context may relate to something associated with the dead or remains of a creature or human.",
    "Wraps or cloth often signify a burial practice, which suggests a setting tied to death or an end of life.",
    "A tomb is a specific place where the deceased are buried and is often associated with the discovery of bones wrapped in cloth.",
    "A museum might have bones, but they are typically on display and not wrapped in cloth unless being conserved or transferred, which is less common.",
    "The options \"arm\" and \"human body\" imply an inside context, but bones typically wouldn\u2019t be wrapped in cloth in a living human scenario.",
    "In a hospital, while there could be references to bones, it is more related to treatment rather than being a place where you'd find a wrapped bone specifically.",
    "Considering the direct link between a bone wrapped in cloth and burial, \"tomb\" directly aligns with this interpretation.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer related to the imagery of a bone wrapped in cloth is a tomb, as it matches the perceptions of burial."
