  "query": "Question: Where can you buy a pail, nails and a hammer?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: garden\nC: hardware store\nD: basement\nE: utility room",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what items are being asked about: a pail, nails, and a hammer.",
    "Next, identify where these items are commonly found or sold.",
    "A pail (bucket), nails, and a hammer are typically tools and supplies related to construction, repair, or maintenance tasks.",
    "Think about the locations provided: garage, garden, hardware store, basement, and utility room.",
    "A garage may contain tools and supplies, but it is not primarily a retail location.",
    "A garden would likely have gardening tools and supplies, but not specifically items like nails or hammers.",
    "A basement may contain tools and items for home repair, but again, it is not a retail location.",
    "A utility room usually contains appliances and cleaning supplies, not tools or building supplies.",
    "A hardware store is a retail location specifically designed to sell tools, building supplies, and hardware like the items in question.",
    "Thus, among the choices, the hardware store is the most logical place to buy a pail, nails, and a hammer."
