  "query": "Question: What would describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor?\n\nChoices:\nA: articulate\nB: soft\nC: sign language\nD: graceful\nE: cup water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what is meant by \"someone who doesn't do manual labor.\" Such a person likely has hands that are not calloused or rough, indicating a lack of physical strain.",
    "Next, I will consider the characteristics of hands that are not subjected to manual labor. Softness is often a trait associated with hands that have not been exposed to hard work.",
    "I will evaluate the provided options against the characteristics mentioned. \"Articulate\" generally refers to the clarity with which someone expresses ideas, which does not apply directly to the physical state of hands.",
    "\"Sign language\" is a method of communication using hand gestures, but it does not describe the physical characteristics of the hands themselves.",
    "\"Graceful\" can describe movements and postures, but it is more of an aesthetic or motion descriptor rather than a condition of the skin or texture of the hands.",
    "\"Cup water\" describes an action but does not convey any information about the characteristics of the hands.",
    "Now, I will focus on \"soft,\" which matches the assumption that hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor would likely be soft without calluses or other signs of manual roughness.",
    "I will confirm that \"soft\" is the only option that accurately fits the description of hands not involved in manual labor, as it directly references the texture and condition of those hands.",
    "After reviewing all the options, I've eliminated those that do not describe the hands directly. The best choice remaining is \"soft.\""
