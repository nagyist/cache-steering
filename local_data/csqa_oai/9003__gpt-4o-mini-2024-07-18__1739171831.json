  "query": "Question: The mother had to run some errands, she told he son if he did his chores while she was gone it would be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: get things done\nB: complete tasks\nC: helpful\nD: finished product\nE: gain",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what the mother meant by doing chores while she was gone, we should analyze the context of her statement. It suggests a potential benefit or positive outcome from completing the chores.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, we can eliminate options that do not directly relate to encouragement or recognition of effort. \"Get things done\" (A) and \"complete tasks\" (B) seem more neutral and less expressive of a personal benefit.",
    "\"Finished product\" (D) refers to the result rather than the action of being helpful, thus it is less likely to be the mother's intention in motivating her son.",
    "\"Gain\" (E) implies a reward or benefit, but it is more abstract and doesn't specifically refer to the helpfulness of doing chores, which seems more related to the mother\u2019s usual discourse.",
    "This leaves us with \"helpful\" (C), which captures the essence of what the mother is implying \u2013 that doing the chores will be helpful for her and perhaps for the household overall.",
    "It's also worth noting that a mother typically appreciates the efforts of her children, reinforcing the idea of being helpful.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all options in context, \"helpful\" aligns best with the intent expressed in the mother's statement."
