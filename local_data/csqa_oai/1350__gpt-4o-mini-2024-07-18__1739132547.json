  "query": "Question: what does getting divorce induce in someone who doesn't want it?\n\nChoices:\nA: freedom\nB: joy\nC: depression\nD: anguish\nE: tears",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the emotional impact of getting divorced on someone who is opposed to it.",
    "Typically, when an individual does not wish to undergo a divorce, the experience can lead to negative emotions stemming from loss and change.",
    "One possible emotional reaction to unwanted divorce is depression, as it involves grief over lost hopes and relationships.",
    "Anguish is also a potential reaction, as it can encompass feelings of intense emotional pain and distress.",
    "Another reaction could be tears, as crying is a common response to overwhelming emotions involving loss and sadness.",
    "While freedom and joy might be associated with divorce in certain contexts, these options are less likely for someone who does not want the divorce.",
    "Evaluating the emotional responses, depression fits well, considering it is a common response to unwanted life changes.",
    "Anguish could be equally valid but might be more intense and specific, fitting less in general terms than the broader state of depression.",
    "Tears do reflect emotional pain, but they do not encapsulate the full emotional spectrum as effectively as depression does.",
    "Thus, in summation, the most fitting answer for emotional response to an unwanted divorce is depression."
