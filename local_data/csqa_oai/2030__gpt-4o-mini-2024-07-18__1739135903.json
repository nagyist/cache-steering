  "query": "Question: How can students be social when completing assignments?\n\nChoices:\nA: arm wrestle\nB: study philosophy\nC: study together\nD: further education\nE: read books",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what it means to be social while working on assignments. Being social typically involves interacting with others.",
    "Next, we can think about the context in which students complete assignments. Many students prefer collaborative environments where they can discuss ideas and help each other.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options provided. Arm wrestling (A) does not relate to academic work and would likely be distracting rather than socializing in a productive manner.",
    "Studying philosophy (B) is more about individual or contemplative thought rather than social interaction, making it less relevant.",
    "Further education (D) is a vague term and does not specify social interaction during assignments; it doesn't directly imply collaboration.",
    "Reading books (E) is often a solitary activity, not conducive to socializing, as it usually lacks interaction with others.",
    "Studying together (C), on the other hand, involves working in groups, discussing the assignments, and learning from one another, which clearly promotes social interaction.",
    "Since studying together provides the best opportunity for social interaction while completing assignments, it stands out as the most suitable option."
