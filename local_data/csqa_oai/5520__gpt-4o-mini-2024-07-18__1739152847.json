  "query": "Question: The Mississippi is a very large river, it is the largest in the North American what?\n\nChoices:\nA: wilderness\nB: country\nC: city\nD: bridge\nE: continent",
  "steps": [
    "The Mississippi River is located in North America, so it is relevant to identify what it is the largest of in that context.",
    "The phrase \"largest in the North American\" would suggest that it is the largest of something significant or prominent within North America.",
    "Looking at the choices: wilderness, country, city, bridge, and continent, I need to consider which of these could reasonably relate to the size of a river.",
    "\"Wilderness\" generally refers to a natural area, but it is not a direct comparison to the size of a river.",
    "\"Country\" is too broad, as it encompasses many geographical features which don't directly relate to the scale of a river.",
    "\"City\" likely does not correlate, as cities are typically built around bodies of water rather than measured against them in terms of size.",
    "\"Bridge\" also does not make sense as a bridge is a structure and not a measure of size relevant to a river.",
    "\"Continent\" could be relevant, considering the Mississippi River is one of the largest rivers in North America, which is indeed a continent.",
    "Given that the question asks for the largest in the context provided and \"continent\" matches the context of geography and size, it is the most fitting answer.",
    "Thus, the final answer to the question about what the Mississippi River is the largest of in North America is therefore the continent."
