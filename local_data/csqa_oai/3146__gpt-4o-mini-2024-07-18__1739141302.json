  "query": "Question: What is often the result of having lunch too fast?\n\nChoices:\nA: spending money\nB: sickness\nC: heartburn\nD: low blood sugar\nE: obesity",
  "steps": [
    "Having lunch too fast can lead to poor digestion because the body doesn't have enough time to process the food properly.",
    "When food is eaten quickly, it is often not chewed well, which can complicate digestion.",
    "Improper digestion can lead to discomfort in the stomach, often referred to as indigestion.",
    "One common symptom of indigestion is heartburn, which occurs when stomach acid travels back up into the esophagus.",
    "Heartburn is frequently associated with the rapid intake of food, as it can lead to increased acidity and pressure in the stomach.",
    "While other options like low blood sugar (D) or obesity (E) can be influenced by eating habits, they are not direct results of eating too fast specifically.",
    "Spending money (A) is unrelated to the speed of eating, and sickness (B) can be a broad generalization that doesn't specifically pinpoint a direct result of fast eating.",
    "In conclusion, the most direct outcome of eating lunch too fast is heartburn (C), often caused by the rapid ingestion of food leading to issues like acid reflux."
