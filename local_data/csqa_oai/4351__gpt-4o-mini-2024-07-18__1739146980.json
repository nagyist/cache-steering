  "query": "Question: When frozen it showed solidity, but as it thawed and melted it showed what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fluidity\nB: hollowness\nC: openness\nD: weakness\nE: instability",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a substance that is solid when frozen and changes state as it thaws and melts.",
    "When a substance melts, it transitions from a solid state to a liquid state, which is characterized by the ability to flow.",
    "The properties of a liquid include being able to take the shape of its container and having fluidity.",
    "The options given include fluidity, hollowness, openness, weakness, and instability.",
    "Among these options, \"fluidity\" is the only term directly associated with the properties of a liquid when a solid melts.",
    "Hollowness typically refers to something empty inside rather than a characteristic of melting.",
    "Openness is a vague term and does not apply specifically to liquids transitioning from solid states.",
    "Weakness could imply structural failure, but it is not a typical term used to describe the change from solid to liquid.",
    "Instability might suggest that the state can change, but it does not describe the characteristic of the substance that has melted.",
    "After evaluating each option in relation to the characteristics of a melting substance, the most appropriate answer is fluidity."
