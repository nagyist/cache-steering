    "Identify the context of the question, which is about an event taking place in a theater performance.",
    "Consider what typically happens during a theater performance. One common occurrence is a break period.",
    "An intermission is a standard part of many theater performances where the audience takes a break before the show continues.",
    "Review the options provided: \n- A (spending money) does not represent a break or event in the performance.\n- B (intermission) is a commonly used term to describe a break during performances.\n- C (being entertained) is a general statement and does not specify a break.\n- D (sleepiness) is not directly related to theater performances.\n- E (man of la mancha) refers to a specific play, not a general occurrence during a performance.",
