  "query": "Question: Where is the last place food is before being eaten?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: plate\nC: dinning\nD: stomach\nE: pantry",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the process of preparing food before it is consumed. The final step before food is eaten generally occurs when it is served on a food container.",
    "Identify the common locations where food is served right before it is eaten. One of the primary locations would be a plate.",
    "Next, evaluate each option given and analyze their relevance to when food is eaten:\n- Kitchen refers to where food is prepared, not consumed.\n- Plate is usually where food is placed for serving.\n- Dining refers to the act of eating but is vague and not a specific location.\n- Stomach is where food goes after being eaten, not before.\n- Pantry is where food is stored before preparation.",
    "Among the options, the plate is the most direct and specific answer as it is the last place food is placed before being eaten.",
    "Though dining is related to the act of eating, it doesn't specify a location as directly as a plate does.",
    "Since the question asks for the last place food is before being eaten, the clear and focused choice is a plate."
