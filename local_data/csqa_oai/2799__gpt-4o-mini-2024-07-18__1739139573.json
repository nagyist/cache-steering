  "query": "Question: A monkey ran through La Defense with classified documents, who was chasing it?\n\nChoices:\nA: monkey\nB: rain forest\nC: captivity\nD: madagascar\nE: french government",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a monkey running through La Defense, which is a business district in Paris, France, rather than a natural habitat for monkeys.",
    "The presence of \"classified documents\" indicates that there is a level of importance and seriousness to the situation, likely involving some form of authority or government.",
    "Given that the monkey has classified documents, it would imply that there is someone or some authority concerned about retrieving those documents.",
    "Options A, B, C, and D do not seem to represent entities that would realistically be involved in chasing a monkey with classified documents.",
    "Option E, \"french government\", aligns well with the scenario as they would have a vested interest in retrieving classified documents.",
    "It is also plausible that the French government would send agents or officials to pursue the monkey in order to secure the sensitive materials.",
    "There are no indications or logical connections in the other answer choices that would suggest they could be chasing a monkey in this context.",
    "Considering the nature of the documents and the location (La Defense, France), it further reinforces that the most likely chaser would be a government entity.",
    "Conclusively, the most reasonable answer is that the French government would be the one chasing the monkey."
