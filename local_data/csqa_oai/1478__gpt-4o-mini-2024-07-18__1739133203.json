  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to understand what is meant by \"where\" in the context of the sun setting.",
    "The sun's position in the sky changes throughout the day, and it appears to rise and set due to the rotation of the Earth.",
    "Traditionally, the sun is known to set in the direction opposite to where it rises, which is in the east.",
    "In most locations, the sun sets in the west.",
    "Next, I need to evaluate the provided options and see which one most accurately represents where the sun sets.",
    "Option A, \"outer space,\" doesn't make sense in this context, as it is too broad and not a position relative to Earth.",
    "Option B, \"horizon,\" is a more general term describing the line where the earth's surface and sky appear to meet. While the sun does set at the horizon, it is not specific enough.",
    "Option C, \"beach,\" could refer to a location where one could observe a sunset, but it is not a direction where the sun sets.",
    "Option D, \"west,\" clearly and specifically indicates the direction in which the sun sets, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Finally, option E, \"beans,\" does not relate to the phenomenon of the sun setting at all and can be disregarded."
