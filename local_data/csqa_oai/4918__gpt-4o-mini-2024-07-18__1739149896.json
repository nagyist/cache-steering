  "query": "Question: John was very annoyed by the infidelity of his sound system.  He had paid a premium for it, so he expected what?\n\nChoices:\nA: end marriage\nB: loyalty\nC: fidelity\nD: faithfulness\nE: mean shooting",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John was annoyed by the infidelity of his sound system, which suggests that he expected it to perform reliably and without issues.",
    "Since \"infidelity\" typically refers to a betrayal of trust or expectation, it's reasonable to conclude that John expected his sound system to remain dependable and not malfunction.",
    "The use of the term \"infidelity\" implies a context where loyalty or faithfulness is expected in some form, akin to how one would expect fidelity in relationships.",
    "The choices provided include \"loyalty,\" \"fidelity,\" and \"faithfulness,\" all of which relate to the expectation of reliability and trustworthiness.",
    "The term \"fidelity\" is directly associated with being faithful or loyal, particularly in the context of technology and audio equipment.",
    "By selecting \"fidelity,\" it aligns most closely with the expectation of John's sound system functioning well without unexpected failures.",
    "Considering the definitions of the other options, \"end marriage\" does not fit the context. \"Loyalty\" and \"faithfulness\" are synonymous but do not directly capture what John paid for; the specific term used is important.",
    "In the context of technology, \"fidelity\" often refers to the accuracy and quality of sound reproduction, further validating that John expects high-performance from his investment in sound quality.",
    "Thus, out of all the given options, \"fidelity\" precisely represents John's expectation for his sound system."
