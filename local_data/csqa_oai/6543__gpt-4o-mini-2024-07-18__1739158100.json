  "query": "Question: While in the process of heading home he realized at the last moment he hadn't gotten a souvenir from the trip, luckily the what had a gift shop?\n\nChoices:\nA: museum\nB: airport\nC: hotel\nD: shop\nE: disneyland",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of someone heading home and needing to purchase a souvenir. This context typically implies a last-minute opportunity to buy something memorable from their trip.",
    "Next, evaluate each option based on common places that usually have gift shops. Museums often have gift shops where you can purchase items related to the exhibits.",
    "Airports also commonly have gift shops and they cater to travelers who might want to buy last-minute items, including souvenirs.",
    "Hotels might have gift shops, but these are less common and typically do not offer an extensive selection of souvenirs.",
    "A general shop might have items, but it would not specifically cater to tourists looking for souvenirs in the same way as dedicated gift shops do.",
    "Disneyland is a well-known location for souvenirs, but it is a specific destination rather than a common feature of all travel.",
    "Now, weigh the options. A museum has a gift shop but may not always be a location people visit last-minute while heading home. The airport is explicitly designed for travelers and is almost always open until shortly before flights leave, making it a highly likely place for last-minute purchases.",
    "Considering the need for a quick souvenir purchase on the way home, the airport is the most practical option, as it likely offers a range of travel-specific souvenirs.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer that fits the scenario of buying a last-minute souvenir is the airport."
