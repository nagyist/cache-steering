  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that jealousy affected the best contestant's scorecards, indicating that there was an external factor influencing the scoring process.",
    "Given that scorecards are typically evaluated by a person or a panel, we should focus on entities that might have authority over scoring.",
    "Looking at the choices: \"A: love else,\" \"B: wage war,\" \"C: ocean,\" and \"D: compete\" do not fit well in the context of evaluating scores.",
    "However, \"E: judge\" directly pertains to the person or entity responsible for evaluating and scoring contestants.",
    "Jealousy could lead judges to lower scores unfairly, creating a need for an investigation into their actions.",
    "Thus, the investigation is likely meant to explore the adjudication process and the fairness of the judges' scoring.",
    "In summary, the term that aligns best with the context of score evaluation and potential misconduct due to jealousy is \"judge.\""
