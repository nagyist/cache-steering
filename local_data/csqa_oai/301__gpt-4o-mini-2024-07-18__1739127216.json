  "query": "Question: A night owl is what you'd head at sunset and you'd hear a what at sunrise?\n\nChoices:\nA: morning person\nB: early bird\nC: lark\nD: early riser\nE: rooster",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"night owl,\" which refers to someone who stays up late and is more active during the night. This implies there is a contrasting term that describes someone who is active early in the morning.",
    "At sunset, a night owl would likely be awake, hence the association. The term we are looking for would refer to something or someone that is associated with the beginnings of the day or morning.",
    "\"Sunrise\" suggests the start of the day, and we need to determine what is commonly associated with that time.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"A: morning person\" and \"B: early bird\" both imply someone who is active early in the day.",
    "The term \"C: lark\" is often used to refer to a person who wakes up early or is happy and active in the morning, closely linking it to the concept of sunrise.",
    "\"D: early riser\" also fits the context but is more of a descriptive term rather than a contrasting term like \"night owl.\"",
    "\"E: rooster\" is another term that is often associated with sunrise since roosters are known for crowing at dawn. It is a literal representation, unlike the other more metaphorical choices.",
    "Now I need to evaluate the candidate answers: \n- \"A: morning person\" is too vague.\n- \"B: early bird\" is also vague in directly connecting to sunrise.\n- \"C: lark\" is specific and directly connected to the idea of being active in the morning.\n- \"D: early riser\" is descriptive but less direct than others.\n- \"E: rooster\" is literal and correct in context, but it\u2019s not a person term.",
    "Given that we are looking for a term that represents someone who is awake and active at sunrise, \"C: lark\" fits best with the context as it is explicitly used to denote morning activity."
