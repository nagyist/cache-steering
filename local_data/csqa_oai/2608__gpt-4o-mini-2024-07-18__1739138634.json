  "steps": [
    "Let's first analyze the scenario where someone spends too much time buying products. This behavior suggests excessive consumption or shopping.",
    "Excessive consumer behavior typically leads to financial consequences, as purchasing more items than necessary can strain one's finances.",
    "When someone spends a lot of time buying products, they may not be paying attention to their budget or financial limits. This could lead to unplanned or impulsive purchases.",
    "Considering that overspending often leads to financial issues, it's relevant to evaluate the potential outcomes of such behavior.",
    "\"Debt\" is a consequence of spending more money than one has. If a person keeps spending without a budget, they may indeed accumulate debt.",
    "\"Empty pockets\" is a phrase that reflects a lack of money after spending, which is also a likely result of excessive buying.",
    "\"Loss of money\" indicates a decrease in finances due to purchases, which directly correlates with the act of spending heavily on products.",
    "\"Being able to use\" does not imply a negative consequence of overspending; it seems unrelated to the potential negative outcomes of excessive buying.",
    "\"Economic boom\" typically refers to broader economic growth and wouldn't apply to an individual overspending situation.",
    "Now, let's summarize the negative outcomes of excessive buying: potential \"debt,\" \"empty pockets,\" and \"loss of money\" are all reasonable consequences.",
    "However, since the question asks what one is likely to experience and all options A, B, and C point towards loss of financial resources, we need to identify the most direct and likely outcome.",
    "Among the choices, \"loss of money\" (C) is the most encompassing and directly addresses the issue of financial consequences from overspending, as it relates to all forms of financial loss experienced."
