  "query": "Question: What can ice help you to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: melt\nB: make sugar\nC: become water\nD: form crystals\nE: cool off",
  "steps": [
    "Ice is the solid form of water, created when water freezes at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) or below.",
    "One primary property of ice is its ability to change states of matter. When ice is heated, it can melt back into its liquid state, which is water.",
    "The question asks what ice can help you do, which implies a transformation or purpose of ice.",
    "Among the options provided, \"melt\" (A) refers to ice melting, which is a result of applying heat but not something ice \"helps\" you to do.",
    "The option \"make sugar\" (B) is irrelevant since ice does not participate in sugar production.",
    "The option \"become water\" (C) is somewhat redundant because while ice does become water, this statement alone is a description rather than an action that ice helps you achieve.",
    "The option \"form crystals\" (D) is more relevant to the formation of ice rather than its role since ice is already a crystalline solid structure.",
    "The option \"cool off\" (E) shows that ice is commonly used to lower temperatures, such as in drinks or to reduce body temperature; this is a direct way ice helps people.",
    "Among all the choices, option E (cool off) is the most applicable action that involves ice as an agent for achieving a desired effect."
