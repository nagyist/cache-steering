  "query": "Question: The aisle that John was on had macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper. What sort of store is John most likely shopping at?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: church\nC: drugstore\nD: hardware store\nE: department store",
  "steps": [
    "Analyze the items mentioned: macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper are all food items typically found in a grocery context.",
    "Consider the nature of each store option provided in the choices. Grocery stores primarily sell food items and household necessities.",
    "Evaluate the other options: A church typically does not sell food items, drugstores mainly sell medication and personal care products, hardware stores specialize in tools and home improvement supplies, and department stores sell a variety of items including clothing and household goods but not specifically food items like those mentioned.",
    "Determine which store type would logically contain aisles dedicated to pantry staples like macaroni and rice.",
    "Conclude that a grocery store would not only have these items but also be organized in aisles meant for such food products, while the other options are not relevant for grocery items."
