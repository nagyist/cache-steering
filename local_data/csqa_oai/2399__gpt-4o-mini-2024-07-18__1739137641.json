  "query": "Question: A good habit each morning is eating breakfast, but not too much, because then I'd be guilty of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: starving\nB: heartburn\nC: gas\nD: overeating\nE: being satisfied",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about the potential negative consequence of eating too much breakfast.",
    "I need to analyze the choices given and see which one relates to eating too much.",
    "Choice A, \"starving,\" is not relevant here because it refers to not eating enough rather than eating too much.",
    "Choice B, \"heartburn,\" could be a consequence of overeating, but it is not a direct label for the act of eating too much.",
    "Choice C, \"gas,\" is another possible consequence of overeating but doesn't reflect the idea of guilt directly.",
    "Choice D, \"overeating,\" is directly what would happen if I eat too much breakfast, and it aligns perfectly with the guilt mentioned in the question.",
    "Choice E, \"being satisfied,\" suggests a positive outcome and is the opposite of feeling guilty.",
    "After evaluating all options, the best candidate that directly answers the question, highlighting the guilt from eating too much, is overeating."
