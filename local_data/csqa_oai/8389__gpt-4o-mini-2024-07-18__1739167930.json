  "query": "Question: The person was in the drawing room, but wanted to take his draft to be completed, where did he go?\n\nChoices:\nA: house in england\nB: studio\nC: large house\nD: mansion\nE: studio",
  "steps": [
    "The person was in the drawing room, which is often a social or living space in a home.",
    "The person wanted to take his draft to be completed, indicating he is likely looking for a workspace.",
    "A studio typically refers to a place where artistic work is done and suggests a creative environment suited for drafting or completing work.",
    "The options provided are either specific locations like \"house in England\" or more general locations like \"large house\" and \"mansion\".",
    "Since \"studio\" appears more relevant to someone needing a place to complete a draft, it seems like a strong candidate.",
    "Both \"studio\" options are the same (E is repeated), hence will be considered as one.",
    "The other choices, such as \"large house,\" \"mansion,\" and \"house in England,\" do not explicitly indicate a place designed for work, which makes them less likely.",
    "Therefore, the most logical place for the person to go to complete a draft would be a studio."
