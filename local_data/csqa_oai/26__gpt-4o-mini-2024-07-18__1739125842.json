  "steps": [
    "The context of the sentence suggests that the subject's body had been in an active state throughout the day. The fact that he could've kept going indicates he was engaged in some physical activity.",
    "Looking at the choices, options like 'lay down' wouldn't fit, as lying down implies rest rather than activity.",
    "The terms 'working', 'moving', and 'exercise' all suggest different types of physical activity. I need to determine which best fits the phrase \"his body appreciated the rest.\"",
    "The word 'working' generally implies a sustained effort, often mental as well as physical. It doesn't explicitly imply physical movement.",
    "On the other hand, 'moving' suggests continuous physical activity or motion, which could be tiring and would likely lead to needing a rest.",
    "The term 'exercise' suggests formal physical activity, which could also lead to a need for rest but feels more structured than the general context suggests.",
    "Among 'working', 'moving', and 'exercise', 'moving' feels the most fitting as it directly implies continuous physical activity that is likely to tire the body.",
    "Thus, considering the context of needing rest after a day of continuous activity, 'moving' is the best answer."
