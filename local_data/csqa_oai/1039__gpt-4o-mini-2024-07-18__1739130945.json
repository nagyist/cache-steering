  "query": "Question: Where might you find a computer user that is visiting a foreign city and didn't bring their own computer along?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: hell\nC: internet cafe\nD: office building\nE: despair",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the scenario: a computer user visiting a foreign city without their own computer.",
    "To find a suitable location, look for places where people can access computers.",
    "A school (Choice A) is generally not open to the public for general computer use, so it's less likely to be an option for a visitor.",
    "Hell (Choice B) is not a literal place where computers would be found, but rather a metaphorical or fictional concept, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "An office building (Choice D) typically requires permission to enter and to use computers, making it an unsuitable option for a visitor.",
    "Despair (Choice E) is not a physical location, but rather an emotional state, and does not provide computer access.",
    "An internet caf\u00e9 (Choice C) is a public place designed specifically for allowing people to use computers and access the internet.",
    "Since the visitor didn\u2019t bring their own computer, an internet caf\u00e9 would be the most practical and accessible option for them to use a computer.",
    "After evaluating all the options, it is clear that the best answer is an internet caf\u00e9."
