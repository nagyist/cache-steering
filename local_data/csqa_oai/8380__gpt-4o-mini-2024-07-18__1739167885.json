  "query": "Question: What happens inside of you when you have anger?\n\nChoices:\nA: destroy enemy\nB: write letter\nC: explode\nD: punch\nE: release energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what anger is. Anger is an emotional response characterized by feelings of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility.",
    "When a person feels anger, the body undergoes physiological changes. The brain triggers the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.",
    "These hormones prepare the body for a 'fight or flight' response, which can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure.",
    "As the body prepares to confront or escape from a perceived threat, it's common for people to experience a surge of energy or heightened arousal.",
    "People may express this anger in various ways; some may choose to express it verbally, while others may channel it into physical actions.",
    "The choices provided include various forms of expressing anger, such as physical aggression (D: punch) or emotional outbursts (C: explode).",
    "However, another common response to anger is the release of energy, where a person may engage in activities to dissipate the pent-up feelings without necessarily harming others.",
    "Given the options, \"release energy\" (E) captures a fundamental physiological and psychological response to anger that is often applicable, beyond just aggressive actions.",
    "In contrast, \"destroy enemy\" (A) implies a more definitive and aggressive response, which isn't universally true for everyone experiencing anger.",
    "Thus, the most encompassing choice that describes what happens inside a person when they feel anger is to release that energy."
