  "steps": [
    "The question is about where to give money at a ticket booth, so I need to consider what types of places typically have ticket booths.",
    "Common places with ticket booths include venues (like concert halls), movie theaters, museums, train stations, and events (like fairs).",
    "In each of these locations, there is usually a clerk or staff member who handles ticket sales.",
    "Although I can give money to any of the places listed, the question seems to ask specifically about the act of giving money to a point of sale.",
    "Since all options revolve around a ticket booth, I need to determine whose responsibility that is.",
    "The most direct answer would be \"clerk\" since that is the person physically receiving the money in each case.",
    "However, if I consider how to phrase the response, the term 'venue' or 'movie theater', etc., could also refer to the organization behind the ticket booth.",
    "Some of the choices are much broader (like venue or movie theater), while others like clerk are specific roles involved in the transaction.",
    "In the context of purchasing a ticket, it is typically the clerk (or staff) who directly collects payment at the booth.",
    "Therefore, while the venues and organizations may be receiving the funds, the immediate answer to \"who do you give money to\" at the ticket booth is the clerk."
