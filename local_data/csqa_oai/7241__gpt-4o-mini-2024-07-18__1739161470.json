  "query": "Question: Jane is a pilot.  She recently got a medal and a promotion for her quick thinking when her plane did this.  What might her plane have done?\n\nChoices:\nA: danger\nB: slow down\nC: catch on fire\nD: arrive late\nE: carry freight",
  "steps": [
    "Jane is a pilot, which suggests her responsibilities primarily revolve around flying the aircraft safely.",
    "She received a medal and a promotion for her quick thinking, indicating she successfully handled a critical situation.",
    "The phrase \"quick thinking\" implies that the situation was urgent and potentially dangerous.",
    "Considering the options provided, \"catch on fire\" (C) is a serious hazard that would require immediate and decisive action.",
    "In contrast, the options \"danger\" (A) and \"arrive late\" (D) are somewhat vague. \"Danger\" does not specify an action, and \"arriving late\" does not inherently suggest a situation requiring quick thinking.",
    "The option \"slow down\" (B) might be a tactical decision, but it doesn't exemplify a dire scenario which would merit quick thinking in the same way a fire would.",
    "The only option that compellingly aligns with the notion of needing quick thinking in a stressful emergency context is if the plane caught on fire (C).",
    "Therefore, the situation most deserving of a medal and promotion as a response to an emergency, based on the evidence provided, is one where the plane caught on fire."
