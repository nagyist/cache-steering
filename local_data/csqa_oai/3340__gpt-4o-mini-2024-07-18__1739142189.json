    "Skating (Choice B) is usually done on ice rinks or ponds and is not an indoor activity suitable for a house.",
    "Playing hockey (Choice C), while normally an outdoor sport, can also be played indoors in some settings; however, it's more commonly played on designated rinks.",
    "Blazing it (Choice D) could refer to smoking cannabis, which is a personal choice and often done indoors.",
    "Knitting (Choice E) is a common indoor activity that can be very enjoyable during winter while staying warm inside.",
    "Now comparing the remaining choices, knitting (E) is a widely recognized indoor winter activity.",
