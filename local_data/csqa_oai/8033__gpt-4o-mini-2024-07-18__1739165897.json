  "query": "Question: He was an expert in hieroglyphics, can you tell me the location of his excavation?\n\nChoices:\nA: desert\nB: egypt\nC: montana\nD: work area\nE: in dirt",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of hieroglyphics, which are an ancient writing system used in Egypt.",
    "Next, understand that experts in hieroglyphics likely engage in excavations that are relevant to this writing system, typically in locations where ancient Egyptian artifacts and monuments are found.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided for a location associated with hieroglyphics and relevant excavations.",
    "Choice A, \"desert,\" could refer to the broader region of the Egyptian landscape but is not specific enough as a location.",
    "Choice B, \"egypt,\" is a specific country where hieroglyphics originated and where numerous excavations related to them have been undertaken.",
    "Choice C, \"montana,\" does not have any relevance or historical connection to hieroglyphics or Egyptian archaeology.",
    "Choice D, \"work area,\" is too vague and does not specify a recognizable location connected to hieroglyphics.",
    "Choice E, \"in dirt,\" is again very vague and does not specify a recognized archaeological site or excavation location.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most logical and specific answer to the location of the excavation related to an expert in hieroglyphics is Egypt."
