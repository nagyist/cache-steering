  "query": "Question: Where is a snake likely to reside?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropics\nB: nightmare\nC: wyoming\nD: bushes\nE: feild",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitats where snakes are typically found. Snakes can inhabit various environments including deserts, forests, grasslands, and aquatic settings.",
    "Next, evaluate the geographical options provided. The tropics (A) are known for their biodiversity, including many snake species. Nightmare (B) doesn't refer to a physical location; it's more of a concept. Wyoming (C) has diverse ecosystems and is home to several snake species, especially in rural and mountainous areas.",
    "Then, look at the options related to specific environments. Bushes (D) and fields (E) are types of habitats where snakes could be found as they offer cover and food sources.",
    "Now, let's analyze which option makes the most sense based on typical snake habitats. While the tropics (A) can be a possible habitat, Wyoming (C) also seems plausible as it is a real location where snakes do reside.",
    "Next, bushes (D) can be a specific type of habitat, but they are very broad and not a definitive location like Wyoming (C). Fields (E) also cover a broad area but do not specify a particular habitat.",
    "Consider that snakes are adaptable and can be found in various habitats, but they specifically thrive in environments that provide shelter and prey.",
    "Assessing all these perspectives, the most logical answer to the habitat question is a specific location or a generalized habitat type. Among all options considered, Wyoming (C) represents a specific and suitable habitat."
