  "query": "Question: What caused my shirt to get soaked after going jogging?\n\nChoices:\nA: arthritis\nB: lose weight\nC: sweating\nD: exercise\nE: feel better",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a specific event that caused your shirt to get soaked after jogging.",
    "Jogging is a physical activity that typically causes an increase in heart rate and body temperature.",
    "When the body temperature rises, it naturally responds by producing sweat to cool itself down.",
    "Sweat is released through the skin, which would saturate clothing, leading to a soaked shirt.",
    "Option A (arthritis) is not relevant as it pertains to joint issues and would not cause a shirt to get soaked.",
    "Option B (lose weight) is a potential outcome of jogging, but does not directly explain why the shirt is soaked.",
    "Option C (sweating) directly connects to the process of perspiration, which is what caused the shirt to get soaked.",
    "Option D (exercise) refers to the action of jogging itself but is broader and does not specifically address the soaking of the shirt.",
    "Lastly, option E (feel better) is an emotional or mental outcome rather than a direct cause of the soaked shirt."
