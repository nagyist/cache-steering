  "query": "Question: If someone suffers from hunger but has nothing in the house what do they have to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: eat breakfast\nB: buy food\nC: have lunch\nD: call a friend\nE: eat hamburger",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the problem: the individual is suffering from hunger and has no food in the house.",
    "Consider the implications of having nothing in the house: this means the person cannot prepare any meals or eat anything available at home.",
    "Evaluate the options provided in the choices: \n- A: eat breakfast - not feasible since there\u2019s no food at home. \n- B: buy food - represents a viable solution to resolve hunger. \n- C: have lunch - also not feasible since there\u2019s no food to have. \n- D: call a friend - might be a support option but doesn\u2019t directly resolve hunger. \n- E: eat hamburger - again, requires the presence of food.",
    "Determine which option directly addresses the immediate need of acquiring food: buying food is necessary to end hunger.",
    "Consider practicalities: buying food can be done through various means such as going to a grocery store, ordering online, etc.",
    "Realize that while calling a friend might provide temporary support, it does not address the fundamental issue of satiating hunger.",
    "Weigh all options considering the urgency of satisfying hunger, which requires actual food.",
    "Conclude that the most logical solution to the problem of hunger with no food available is to obtain food through purchasing."
