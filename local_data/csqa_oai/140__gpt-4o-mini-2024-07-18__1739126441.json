  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the question, which is about how letters are delivered by hand.",
    "Next, I consider what common item or location is associated with the delivery of letters specifically by hand.",
    "A mail box is typically where letters are dropped off but not where delivery occurs.",
    "A suitcase is used for carrying items, but it is not related to the delivery of letters.",
    "A front door is a common entry point for homes and can be where letter carriers deliver mail directly.",
    "A bowl does not relate to letter delivery at all, as it is used for holding food or other items.",
    "The post office is a facility that handles letters but isn\u2019t a method of delivering them directly to a recipient's hand.",
    "Considering all of the options, the most appropriate answer is a front door, as it is where letters can be delivered directly to recipients by mail carriers."
