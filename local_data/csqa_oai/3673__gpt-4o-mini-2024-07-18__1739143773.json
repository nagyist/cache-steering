  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider where policemen typically work. They are often found in places related to law enforcement, such as police stations and out in the field.",
    "Next, a policeman could be sitting down either during a break or while performing certain tasks. It's important to consider locations where sitting is permissible or common.",
    "Looking at the choices, we see that policemen could be found in an office, which is often part of a police station and where administrative tasks may be performed while sitting.",
    "The front door is typically an entry and exit point and doesn\u2019t usually have policemen sitting down\u2014more likely, they would be standing or patrolling.",
    "The street generally involves active duty, so a policeman would likely be standing rather than seated.",
    "A roadblock would typically involve temporary stops for vehicles; here again, policemen would more likely be standing.",
    "The option \"police station\" encompasses areas where policemen might be found sitting, including offices, break rooms, or even while writing reports.",
    "Considering the fact that all other options do not provide an adequate place where sitting down is typical, the police station stands out as the most logical choice.",
    "Finally, while options A, B, D, and E do not strongly support the scenario of a policeman sitting down, option C (police station) definitely allows for that possibility."
