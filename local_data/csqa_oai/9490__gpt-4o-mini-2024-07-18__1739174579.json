  "query": "Question: They opened up their picnic basket, they began constructing their sandwiches with what meat?\n\nChoices:\nA: country\nB: camper\nC: kitchen\nD: canned\nE: deli",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves identifying what type of meat they are using to construct their sandwiches.",
    "The choices provided are: A) country, B) camper, C) kitchen, D) canned, E) deli.",
    "I can eliminate 'country' and 'camper' as they do not refer to types of meat typically used in sandwiches.",
    "'Kitchen' is also not a type of meat; it refers to a place where food is prepared.",
    "This leaves us with 'canned' and 'deli'.",
    "'Canned' could refer to canned meats, but it is not a type of meat commonly specified for sandwiches.",
    "'Deli' typically refers to deli meats, which are widely used for sandwiches like turkey, ham, salami, etc.",
    "Considering the common context of picnic baskets and sandwich making, 'deli' is the most relevant option regarding meat.",
    "Thus, the best answer reflecting what meat they would be using is 'deli'."
