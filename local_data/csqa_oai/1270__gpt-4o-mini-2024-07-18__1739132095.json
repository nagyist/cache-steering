  "query": "Question: Where could you hear an organ being played?\n\nChoices:\nA: system\nB: veterinarian\nC: human body\nD: cathedral\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what is meant by \"organ\" in the context of this question. It could refer to a musical instrument or a part of the human body.",
    "Consider the contexts in which a musical organ is played. It is often associated with churches, particularly cathedrals, and also possibly in certain music stores.",
    "Evaluate option D, \"cathedral.\" Cathedrals typically have organs that are used during services or concerts, making it a likely answer.",
    "Now consider option E, \"music store.\" Some music stores might have organs for demonstration, but it is less common compared to cathedrals.",
    "Next, evaluate option C, \"human body.\" This could refer to human organs, but it does not relate to hearing a musical organ being played.",
    "Consider option A, \"system.\" This is vague and does not apply.",
    "Evaluate option B, \"veterinarian.\" This does not relate to hearing an organ being played in either sense.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the most likely place to hear an organ being played is in a cathedral, as this is a traditional setting for such music."
