  "steps": [
    "To find a mailbox, I need to think about common locations where mail is collected or sent.",
    "Mailboxes are usually found in public areas or near postal services.",
    "Typically, post offices have both mailboxes for sending letters and sell stamps for mailing services.",
    "A front yard is a private space and unlikely to have public mail services or stamps available.",
    "A street corner may have a mailbox, but it is unlikely to sell stamps.",
    "Schools usually do not have mailboxes for public use, nor do they sell stamps.",
    "An apartment complex might have a mailbox for residents but typically does not provide stamps or additional postal services.",
    "Since the post office is specifically designed for mailing services, including having both mailboxes and stamps, it is the best option.",
    "Upon review of all choices, the only place explicitly mentioned that offers both mailboxes and stamps is the post office."
