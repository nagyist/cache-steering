  "steps": [
    "The question asks for factors that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. This means we need to identify which of the options represents an obstacle to purchasing a home.",
    "Option A, \"bargain,\" does not directly prevent someone from buying a house; rather, it could imply negotiating a better price, which is typically advantageous.",
    "Option B, \"pay for,\" suggests the act of payment. If someone is able to pay, then this would not be a reason for inability to buy a house.",
    "Option C, \"settle down,\" implies stability and readiness to commit to a location. However, it is not presented as a barrier, but rather a precondition for buying a house.",
    "Option D, \"lose money,\" represents a financial setback which could indeed impact someone's ability to afford a house. If a person loses significant money, they might not have the funds required for a down payment or to cover the ongoing costs of home ownership.",
    "Option E, \"too far away,\" while it could make buying a house less desirable, it does not necessarily prevent someone from buying a house if they can commute or move.",
    "After analyzing all the options, Option D stands out as it directly implies a financial inability to acquire a house."
