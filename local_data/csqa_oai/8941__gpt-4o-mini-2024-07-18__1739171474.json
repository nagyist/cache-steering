  "query": "Question: What place protects animals such as the bald eagle?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm\nB: nature preserve\nC: soup\nD: canada\nE: mountainous area",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a place that provides protection for animals, specifically mentioning the bald eagle, which is a bird of prey that is often associated with conservation efforts.",
    "A farm typically uses land for agricultural purposes and does not specifically focus on the protection of wildlife, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.",
    "A nature preserve is specifically designed to protect wildlife and their natural habitats, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer.",
    "The option \"soup\" does not relate to animal protection in any way, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Canada is a country and while it may have protected areas, it does not specifically indicate that it is primarily a place for the protection of animals like the bald eagle.",
    "A mountainous area could theoretically provide habitat for wildlife, but it does not imply intentional protection or conservation efforts like a nature preserve does.",
    "Since we established that a nature preserve is specifically aimed at protecting wildlife and habitats, it is the most fitting option for protecting animals like the bald eagle.",
    "After eliminating the other options based on their lack of focus on animal protection or conservation, the logical answer remains."
