  "query": "Question: Where would an apple tree be unlikely to grow due to the presence of uneven land?\n\nChoices:\nA: washington state\nB: illinois\nC: north carolina\nD: florida\nE: orchard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the characteristics of an apple tree and its growing requirements. Apple trees generally prefer well-drained soil and flat or gently sloping land to optimize their growth and fruit production.",
    "Next, evaluate the geographical areas listed in the choices. Washington State has a range of land types, including areas with flat land suitable for apple trees.",
    "Then, examine Illinois, which is known for its flat farmland, making it suitable for growing apple trees.",
    "Now, look at North Carolina. While some areas have favorable conditions for apple trees, the state also has regions with uneven or hilly terrain.",
    "Next, assess Florida's geography. Florida is generally flat, but its climate is warmer and more humid, which may not be ideal for apple trees compared to the other states.",
    "Consider the last choice, \"orchard.\" An orchard is specifically a cultivated area for growing fruit trees, including apple trees, and thus would not be a geographical location but a specific planting area.",
    "Since the question pertains to a broader geographical location where apple trees would be unlikely to grow due to uneven land, focus on North Carolina. Although it can have apple trees, its uneven land is a significant factor.",
    "Compare North Carolina to the other options, recognizing that Washington State, Illinois, and Florida present more favorable conditions overall compared to the potential hilly terrain in North Carolina.",
    "Finalize the reasoning: uneven land significantly limits the growth of apple trees, thus making North Carolina the best answer here as it represents a region more likely to have such terrain compared to other options."
