  "query": "Question: John bought a new bookend for a shelf, but he was frustrated because he forgot that they were supposed to come in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pair\nB: a box\nC: library book\nD: school library\nE: library holding books together",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John bought a new bookend but was frustrated because he forgot they were supposed to come in a certain way or format.",
    "Bookends are typically sold in pairs because they are designed to hold books in place on a shelf and usually require two to function properly.",
    "The term \"pair\" implies two items, which aligns with common knowledge about bookends being sold in pairs.",
    "The other options (B, C, D, E) do not directly relate to the general understanding of how bookends are provided for purchase.",
    "Option A (pair) directly addresses John's frustration regarding the forgotten detail about bookends being sold together.",
    "Checking the other choices: \n- B (a box) doesn\u2019t specify what he forgot about and is less relevant.\n- C (library book) and D (school library) refer to library concepts, not applicable here.\n- E (library holding books together) is too vague and doesn't specifically address the purchasing context of bookends.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer based on reasoning is that John forgot they were supposed to come in a \"pair.\""
