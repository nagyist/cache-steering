  "query": "Question: In December how can you throw water at your friends?\n\nChoices:\nA: tsunami\nB: puddle\nC: snowball\nD: glass\nE: backpack",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of throwing water at friends in December. In many places, December is part of the winter season, which is characterized by cold weather.",
    "Next, we should think about the physical state of water in cold temperatures. Water can freeze and turn into ice, which suggests that any method of \"throwing water\" may need to account for the freezing potential.",
    "Now, looking at the choices provided, we need to identify options that might involve water being in a form that could be thrown.",
    "Tsunami (A) refers to a massive wave caused by underwater earthquakes and is not something one can throw. It's not relevant for our context of playful action.",
    "Puddle (B) refers to a small pool of water on the ground. While you could splash someone with a puddle, it's not really about \"throwing\" water in a purposeful way.",
    "Snowball (C) is formed when snow is compacted, which includes water in its frozen state. Throwing a snowball can be seen as throwing something involving water (albeit in ice form).",
    "Glass (D) doesn't fit the context of throwing water. It's an object and would not involve liquid water itself.",
    "Backpack (E) is an item used to carry things and does not relate to throwing water at friends.",
    "Among the choices, only \"snowball\" actively involves water (even in a frozen state) and can be thrown. Therefore, it can be concluded that throwing a snowball would be a way to throw water at friends in December."
