  "query": "Question: James didn't know what drugs he did.  They were being passed around and he just took one.  It was the last time he would go to such a wild what?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: doctor\nC: concert\nD: university\nE: show",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the situation described. James took a drug without knowing what it was, which implies a setting that is often associated with reckless behavior and potentially wild experiences.",
    "Next, examine the choices provided. \"Concert\" (C) stands out as a common environment where individuals might engage in such reckless behavior involving drugs, especially in a \"wild\" setting.",
    "Now, analyze the other options. \"School\" (A) and \"university\" (D) are generally associated with a more structured and academic environment, making it less likely for someone to engage in this type of behavior.",
    "Consider \"doctor\" (B) as a location. This does not fit with the idea of a wild experience, as doctors are usually places of health and care, not associated with reckless behavior.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"show\" (E). While a show might suggest a more lively atmosphere, it lacks the strong drug-related context that is often tied to concerts or music events.",
    "Given the analysis, the most fitting option is \"concert,\" a place where the wild and reckless behavior James experienced is often found; especially with the context of drug use."
