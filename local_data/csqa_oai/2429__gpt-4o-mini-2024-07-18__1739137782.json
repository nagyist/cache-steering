  "query": "Question: If I am near a river with flowing water, which planet am I likely on?\n\nChoices:\nA: mars\nB: wisconsin\nC: waterfall\nD: mountainous area\nE: planet earth",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of the phrase \"near a river with flowing water.\" This suggests an environment where water exists in a river form, which is typically found on planets or places that support water bodies.",
    "Next, review the options provided. Mars (option A) is known for having had water in the past but currently has no flowing rivers as seen on Earth.",
    "Wisconsin (option B) is a location on Earth known for its lakes and rivers, so it matches the criteria of having flowing water.",
    "Option C, Waterfall, though indicative of flowing water, does not refer to a planetary location and thus is not relevant to the question.",
    "Option D, Mountainous area, suggests a geographical feature that could have rivers, but it doesn't specify a direct connection to the presence of flowing water nor identify a specific planet.",
    "Between Wisconsin and the broader Earth context (option E), it's important to recognize that while Wisconsin is indeed near flowing water, Earth is the planet overall that has rivers with flowing water.",
    "Given that the question specifically asks about a planet, Earth (option E) is the most accurate choice since it directly corresponds to the context of \"near a river with flowing water.\"",
    "Therefore, the most correct answer to the question while also considering all other options is planet Earth, as it is the only planet in our solar system known to have consistent and abundant flowing water in the form of rivers."
