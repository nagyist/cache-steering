  "query": "Question: Someone who is not a citizen of your country is considered to be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: foreigner\nB: countryfolk\nC: immigrant\nD: subject\nE: alien",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the term used for someone who is not a citizen of a particular country.",
    "A \"foreigner\" is generally defined as a person from another country. This could fit the description.",
    "The term \"countryfolk\" typically refers to people who belong to the same country or community, which does not fit the description.",
    "An \"immigrant\" specifically refers to someone who moves to another country to live there, usually implying a shift in residency rather than simply not being a citizen.",
    "The term \"subject\" is often used in a monarchical context to refer to people under the rule of a monarch, and not generally used to denote citizenship status.",
    "The term \"alien\" is a legal term used to denote someone who is not a citizen or national of a particular country. It is often used in immigration law.",
    "Since both \"foreigner\" and \"alien\" fit the definition, I need to determine which term is more appropriate in context.",
    "\"Foreigner\" is a more common and less formal term, while \"alien\" is more technical and often used in legal contexts.",
    "However, in a legal or formal sense, \"alien\" is the precise term used to describe non-citizens.",
    "Ultimately, considering the need for accuracy in legal or formal terminology, \"alien\" would be the most appropriate choice."
