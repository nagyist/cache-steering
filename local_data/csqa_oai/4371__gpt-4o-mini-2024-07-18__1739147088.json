  "query": "Question: Where is a student likely to keep their notebook?\n\nChoices:\nA: backpack\nB: bookstore\nC: pocket\nD: office\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the primary use of a notebook for a student, which is typically for taking notes and studying.",
    "Evaluate where a student would most commonly take their notebook to and from school.",
    "A backpack is usually the most common item students carry that would hold their notebooks along with other supplies like textbooks and stationery.",
    "A bookstore is unlikely to be a place where a student would keep their notebook as it is a retail location for purchasing materials, not storage.",
    "A pocket is too small to conveniently carry a standard-sized notebook, making it an impractical choice.",
    "An office could be a place where a student uses their notebook, but it is not a typical location for storing it on a daily basis.",
    "A classroom would be a place where a student uses their notebook, but again, it would not usually be where they keep it when not in use.",
    "Therefore, considering storage and mobility, a backpack is the most logical place for a student to keep their notebook."
