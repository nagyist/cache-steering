  "steps": [
    "The display of a shark jaw skeleton is likely related to marine life and education about the ocean.",
    "Among the given options, a marine museum would be the most relevant location to have such an exhibit.",
    "Tomales Bay is known for its natural beauty and ecological significance, but it does not primarily serve as a venue for displays.",
    "A football ground is related to sports and would not typically host marine exhibits.",
    "A business might sometimes feature educational displays, but the specific context suggests an attraction more related to marine life.",
    "A pool hall is centered around billiards and gaming and would not provide relevant marine life exhibitions.",
    "Given the nature of the exhibit and the context of an educational attraction, the marine museum is a logical choice.",
    "I will now confirm that the marine museum is a common venue for educational displays, particularly about marine biology.",
    "Having assessed all options, the best fit for where the shark jaw skeleton display would be found is indeed a marine museum."
