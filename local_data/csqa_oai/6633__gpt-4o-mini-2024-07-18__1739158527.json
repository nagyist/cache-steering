    "The phrase \"appreciated discovering the truth\" indicates that Sally valued finding out a certain fact or reality after being in a state of uncertainty or worry.",
    "Since she had been worrying, it's likely that the discovery brought a positive outcome or resolution to her concerns.",
    "Enlightenment (Choice A) could be a possibility, but it suggests a deeper understanding rather than just relief from worry.",
    "Happiness (Choice B) could also be relevant, but it doesn't capture the idea of alleviating worry specifically.",
    "Conclusion (Choice C) doesn't fit well because it refers to the end of a matter rather than the feeling Sally experienced upon learning the truth.",
    "Relief (Choice D) directly addresses the alleviation of her worries. Discovering the truth, especially if it was something troubling her, would likely bring her relief.",
    "Excitement (Choice E) would not typically align with the context of discovering a truth that ends worry; it implies a more energetic emotional response rather than calming one.",
