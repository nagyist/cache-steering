  "query": "Question: Where would people be looking at some things which can move, but are not moving?\n\nChoices:\nA: football stadium\nB: surface of earth\nC: car show\nD: opera\nE: movie",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options provided and think about the contexts in which people observe things that can move but are not necessarily moving at that moment.",
    "In a football stadium (Option A), people are typically watching a live game with players and a ball that are moving. Thus, this does not fit the criteria.",
    "On the surface of the Earth (Option B), while it encompasses many moving elements (animals, people), it's too broad and does not specifically describe a situation of observation. Therefore, this may not be the best option.",
    "At a car show (Option C), people are looking at various cars, which are ground vehicles that can move but are stationary during the event. This fits well with the criteria given.",
    "At an opera (Option D), audiences observe performers on stage who are often moving, thus does not meet the requirements of observing things that are still.",
    "In a movie (Option E), viewers watch moving images on a screen. Here, the images (which represent moving objects) are indeed in motion, making this option irrelevant to the question's premise.",
    "After evaluating all options, Option C (car show), where people observe stationary vehicles that have the capacity to move, is the most suitable answer."
