  "query": "Question: The argument was becoming more heated, but when somebody threw fruit at another is when things really started to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: taste sweet\nB: market\nC: go off\nD: keep fresh\nE: become ripe",
  "steps": [
    "The context describes a situation that is escalating or becoming more intense, particularly an argument that is heated.",
    "The act of throwing fruit during a heated argument suggests a moment of disruption or chaos, potentially indicating a breaking point.",
    "The phrase \"things really started to\" implies that something significant happened next that changed the course of the argument.",
    "Analyzing the options, we look for phrases that align with a sudden escalation or dramatic change.",
    "Option A, \"taste sweet,\" does not fit as it conveys a pleasant connotation instead of chaos.",
    "Option B, \"market,\" is not contextually relevant to the heating argument.",
    "Option C, \"go off,\" can mean to explode or become very intense, fitting the context of an argument escalating.",
    "Option D, \"keep fresh,\" also doesn't fit due to its unrelated meaning to the narrative.",
    "Option E, \"become ripe,\" suggests readiness but does not carry the implication of escalation or disruption.",
    "After analyzing the context and the options, \"go off\" is the most suitable because it captures the idea of things getting out of control."
