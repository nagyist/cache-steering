  "steps": [
    "We need to find out what kind of container is typically used alongside a saltshaker, specifically concerning lipids.",
    "Lipids generally refer to fats and oils, which are commonly found in liquid form.",
    "A cruet is a type of container designed to hold liquid condiments, often including oils and vinegar.",
    "Kitchen cupboards and cabinets are storage locations but do not directly relate to serving lipids.",
    "A teaspoon is a utensil used for measuring or serving but not a container for lipids.",
    "A table setting may include a variety of items but does not specifically denote a container for lipids.",
    "The cruet is specifically made for liquids, which makes it a suitable companion for a saltshaker when serving food.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that the most appropriate answer relates to the container that specifically pairs with lipids when serving."
