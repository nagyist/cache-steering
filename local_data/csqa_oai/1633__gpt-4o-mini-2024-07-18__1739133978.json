  "query": "Question: Where does an audience come every week to listen to a person speaking?\n\nChoices:\nA: hockey game\nB: church\nC: sporting event\nD: movie theater\nE: phone call",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze what setting typically involves a person speaking to an audience on a regular weekly basis.",
    "The options available include a hockey game, church, sporting event, movie theater, and phone call.",
    "A hockey game involves players and spectators, but it's primarily about the game and not just about one person speaking.",
    "A sporting event in general is similar; while there are announcers, it's not a regular speaking engagement focused on one person.",
    "At a movie theater, films are shown, and while there may be discussions afterward, there typically isn't a person giving a speech weekly.",
    "A phone call is a private conversation and does not involve an audience in the traditional sense.",
    "Church, on the other hand, often involves a pastor or speaker who addresses the congregation weekly during services.",
    "The frequency of weekly gatherings for sermons or messages aligns with the concept of an audience coming together to listen to a speaker.",
    "Having ruled out the other options, church stands out as the setting where people gather weekly to listen to a singular individual speak."
