  "query": "Question: If I need to use a paper clip to hold medical papers together, where would I be?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk drawer\nB: file folder\nC: office\nD: hospital\nE: file cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one might use a paper clip to hold medical papers together.",
    "Medical papers are typically associated with healthcare environments or settings where such documents are frequently processed or managed.",
    "A desk drawer could potentially contain a paper clip, but it doesn\u2019t specifically imply the use of medical papers.",
    "A file folder could hold papers, but again, this does not specify that the papers are medical.",
    "An office is a general term that could be related to medical or non-medical settings. It does not explicitly suggest the context of medical paperwork.",
    "A hospital is a specific medical facility where one would expect to find medical papers that may need to be organized or secured with paper clips.",
    "A file cabinet is commonly used for the organization of papers, including medical documents, but it is still a location rather than the direct context of the papers themselves.",
    "Considering the use of paper clips directly with medical papers, the strongest association is with a hospital.",
    "Among the options, while both 'hospital' and 'office' could relate to medical papers, 'hospital' is the most directly relevant to the context."
