  "query": "Question: What would you put furniture on top of?\n\nChoices:\nA: roof\nB: room\nC: floor\nD: apartment\nE: neighbor's house",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where furniture is typically placed.",
    "A room is a space that can contain furniture, but it\u2019s not the surface that furniture sits on.",
    "A roof is an overhead covering and does not provide a surface for placing furniture.",
    "An apartment is a type of dwelling, which may contain a room, but does not specifically refer to the surface where furniture is placed.",
    "A neighbor's house is another dwelling, but again, it does not serve as a surface for furniture.",
    "The floor is the primary surface in any room where furniture is set down or organized.",
    "None of the other options (A, B, D, E) serve as appropriate surfaces for placing furniture.",
    "Thus, the only logical and correct answer regarding where to put furniture is the floor."
