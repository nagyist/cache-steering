  "steps": [
    "James experienced painful and long-lasting symptoms on his hands while climbing. This suggests that the issue is related to physical contact or friction rather than a medical condition involving internal bodily functions.",
    "Calluses (Choice A) form due to repeated friction and pressure over time, resulting in thickened skin. While they can be painful, they usually do not cause acute pain during or immediately after an activity.",
    "Loss of oxygen (Choice B) typically leads to symptoms like dizziness or weakness, which does not specifically relate to hand pain.",
    "Vertigo (Choice C) causes sensations of spinning or dizziness. This again does not correlate with hand pain during climbing.",
    "Ascending (Choice D) is just a transition term for going upward and does not indicate a specific condition or symptom.",
    "Blisters (Choice E) are quite common in climbing due to the friction between the skin and climbing holds. They can be painful and can take time to heal, which aligns with the description of James's symptoms.",
    "Considering the most likely cause of painful, long-lasting symptoms on his hands specifically related to climbing, blisters (Choice E) make the most sense."
