  "query": "Question: Where are plants likely to be handled by a city employee?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: windowsill\nC: ground\nD: office\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environments in which city employees typically work and interact with plants. City employees often manage public spaces like parks and gardens.",
    "Next, evaluate the specific options available. \"Park\" and \"garden\" are both outdoor spaces where city employees are likely to handle plants.",
    "Assess \"windowsill\" and \"office,\" as they are more associated with private, indoor environments. It's uncommon for city employees to handle plants in these locations.",
    "Furthermore, think about what \"ground\" means in this context. While plants do grow in the ground, this option lacks specificity as to the handling of plants by city employees.",
    "Now, compare \"park\" and \"garden.\" Parks generally have a wider variety of plant species, landscaping, and maintenance needs, which city employees frequently manage.",
    "Next, consider how gardens can also involve city employees but typically have a more limited scope compared to larger parks.",
    "Based on the analysis, it seems that parks provide the most likely environment where city employees would handle a variety of plants due to their maintenance and landscaping responsibilities.",
    "Finally, while both \"park\" and \"garden\" could be reasonable, the question seems to align more directly with the broader responsibilities of city employees in parks."
