  "steps": [
    "The question states that John saw a billboard every day on his way to work. This implies that the billboard is located along his daily route.",
    "To determine where the billboard is visible from, we need to consider what types of locations would be accessible while commuting.",
    "Out of the choices provided, options like \"Texas,\" \"Las Vegas,\" and \"countryside\" are too broad and do not specifically relate to a commuting route.",
    "\"Football ground\" is a specific location but does not necessarily correlate with a typical commutation path.",
    "The choice \"street\" is a location that is most likely to be encountered daily while traveling to work, especially if the billboard is placed along a busy road.",
    "Since John sees the billboard every day, it reinforces the likelihood that it's positioned where commuters often observe it, which includes streets.",
    "Having eliminated the other options based on their relevance to a commuting route, the best answer that supports the visibility of the billboard is \"street.\""
