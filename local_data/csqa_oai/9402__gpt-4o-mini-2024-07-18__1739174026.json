  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"king me\" is a variation of the phrase \"king me\" from the game of Checkers, which is not mentioned in the choices provided.",
    "His opponent's odd look suggests that he made a mistake by saying something confusing or incorrect related to their game.",
    "If they are playing a game where kings, like in chess, are involved, it would be relevant to consider the context of the game.",
    "The phrase used by the player, having the word \"king\", indicates that it relates to a game involving kings.",
    "Since \"king\" is more relevant to chess, it's logical to conclude they were likely playing chess rather than other options like scrabble, cards, or castle, which don't involve kings in the same context.",
    "Options A (Scrabble) and D (deck of cards) are invalid because they do not relate to kings or the term \"king me\".",
    "Option C (chess set) is a physical representation of the game but does not denote that they are actively playing the game.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer relates to the active gameplay which is represented by choice B (chess game).",
    "After considering all options and eliminating those that do not make sense given the context of \"king me\", I affirm that \"chess game\" is correct."
