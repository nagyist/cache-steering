  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a \"maze of burrows\" typically refers to in the context of animal habitats. Burrows are generally associated with small animals that dig tunnels underground.",
    "Next, we should consider each of the answer choices to see which one relates most closely to small animals that create such burrows.",
    "Option A, \"mole den,\" refers to the dwelling of moles, which do indeed create extensive burrows. This could be a viable option.",
    "Option B, \"used car lot,\" does not relate to burrows at all, as it is a commercial space and not a habitat for burrowing animals.",
    "Option C, \"viking ship,\" is also not applicable since it is a type of vessel and unrelated to burrowing animals.",
    "Option D, \"chicken coop,\" refers to a structure for housing chickens. Chickens do not create burrows, but rather they roost or nest in enclosed structures.",
    "Option E, \"rabbit warren,\" is a term used specifically for a network of burrows made by rabbits. This directly matches the description of a maze of burrows.",
    "Now, since both \"mole den\" and \"rabbit warren\" involve burrows, we need to assess the context of \"hit the jackpot.\" This phrase suggests a significant discovery \u2013 something related to a large number of tunnels or a complex habitat.",
    "Considering that rabbit warrens are typically larger and more complex than mole dens, which often consist of individual or small interconnected burrows, the discovery of a rabbit warren might be more impressive.",
    "Hence, while both options A and E are strong contenders, E (rabbit warren) stands out more due to its complexity and size associated with a maze."
