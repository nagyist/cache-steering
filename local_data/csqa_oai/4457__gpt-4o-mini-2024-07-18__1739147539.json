    "The question is focused on identifying an activity that helps people organize their tasks when they have many things to do.",
    "Looking at the choices, we can evaluate which option is practical for organization.",
    "Option A, \"fast track,\" doesn't directly relate to organization. It implies speed rather than organization.",
    "Option B, \"trade places,\" does not suggest a method for organizing tasks and seems more about role reversal.",
    "Option C, \"make lists,\" is a well-known organizational method where tasks are written down, making it easier to prioritize and track progress.",
    "Option D, \"believe in god,\" is a philosophical or spiritual belief and doesn't provide a practical organizational technique.",
