  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"mental toughness\" means in the context of daily exercise.",
    "Mental toughness generally refers to the resilience and determination required to push through challenges.",
    "Next, I will consider what qualities are important for someone who is exercising daily.",
    "Regular exercise often requires a person to stick to their routine and overcome obstacles such as fatigue, discomfort, or loss of motivation.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the choices provided in relation to daily exercise.",
    "Choice A (effort) is important, but effort alone does not encompass the mental aspect of maintaining a routine.",
    "Choice B (exercise) refers to the physical act itself, not the mental aspect needed to maintain it consistently.",
    "Choice C (discipline) specifically addresses the self-control and commitment needed to stick to a daily exercise regimen.",
    "Choice D (muscles) refers to physical strength rather than the mental component required for perseverance.",
    "Choice E (run) is a type of exercise but does not imply the mental toughness needed across all types of daily workouts.",
    "Given the need for persistence and commitment in daily exercise, discipline aligns best with the concept of mental toughness."
