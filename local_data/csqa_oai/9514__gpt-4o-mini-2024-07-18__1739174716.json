  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location where tickets are sold for an event happening outside.",
    "Choices A (movie theater), B (theater district), and D (theatre) generally refer to indoor locations.",
    "Choice E (street) is too vague and does not specifically indicate a location where tickets would be sold.",
    "Choice C (ballpark) is typically an outdoor venue where sports events or other activities occur, and tickets are sold at a box office.",
    "Considering that the event is happening outside, a ballpark makes the most sense as it explicitly refers to an outdoor location.",
    "Furthermore, at a ballpark, it is common to have a box office selling tickets before the entrance.",
    "Looking through all choices again, none align with the concept of an outdoor box office selling tickets as clearly as a ballpark.",
    "Thus, analyzing all the steps confirms that the best answer is C."
