  "query": "Question: Sammy wanted to preserve the wallpaper, but it was wet and had already begun to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: decay\nB: ruin\nC: throw away\nD: destroy\nE: waste",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the wallpaper is wet and Sammy wants to preserve it, indicating that there is a concern about its condition.",
    "Next, I need to identify the possible states that wet wallpaper can experience. Wet wallpaper typically deteriorates if not properly addressed.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"decay\" (A) refers to gradual deterioration, which aligns with moisture causing wallpaper to deteriorate.",
    "The choice \"ruin\" (B) implies a more complete destruction of its quality, but it doesn't specify a gradual process like \"decay\" does.",
    "\"Throw away\" (C) doesn\u2019t fit since it suggests an action rather than a condition of the wallpaper.",
    "\"Destroy\" (D) suggests total loss or annihilation, which might occur as a consequence of prolonged wetness, but is also more definitive than \u201cdecay.\u201d",
    "\"Waste\" (E) typically refers to something being squandered or used improperly, which doesn\u2019t specifically address the condition of wallpaper.",
    "Considering the context of the question, the term that best fits the description of wet wallpaper that has already begun to change form or lose its integrity is \"decay.\""
