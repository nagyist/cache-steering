  "steps": [
    "The carotid artery is one of the main arteries that supplies blood to the brain, neck, and face.",
    "Given its location, any damage to the carotid artery would most likely occur in an area where it is anatomically situated.",
    "The carotid arteries run along the side of the neck, making them particularly vulnerable to injury in that area.",
    "While the face can also experience injuries, it is not the specific location of the carotid artery itself.",
    "The options \"busy city\" and \"torso\" do not specifically relate to the anatomical location of the carotid artery.",
    "\"Human body\" is a broad term that doesn't pinpoint the specific location of vulnerability concerning the carotid artery.",
    "After analyzing the choices, it\u2019s clear that the most appropriate answer is the one that reflects the location of the carotid artery.",
    "The neck is the area where the carotid artery is most susceptible to damage due to external trauma or injury."
