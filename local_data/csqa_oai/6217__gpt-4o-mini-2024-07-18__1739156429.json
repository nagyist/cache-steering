  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the movies are \"cowboy and indians\" movies, which suggests a Western genre typically set in the United States.",
    "I know that cowboy culture is particularly associated with certain regions in the U.S.",
    "The American Southwest is well-known for its representation in cowboy films, featuring arid deserts and vast landscapes.",
    "Canada, while having its own cowboy culture (e.g., the North-West Mounted Police), is less commonly depicted in traditional cowboy and Indian narratives.",
    "The options B (triple crown) and E (kentucky derby) are related to horse racing, which doesn't directly connect to the cowboy and Indian film genre at all.",
    "England, option C, is usually not associated with cowboy and Indian films; rather, it has its own distinct cultural narratives and genres.",
    "Based on the cultural association and geographical relevance, I can conclude that the majority of cowboy and Indian movies take place in the American Southwest region.",
    "Given the strong association of cowboy movies with the American Southwest, option D aligns perfectly with my conclusion."
