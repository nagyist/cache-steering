  "query": "Question: What must be done to a driveway filled with snow?\n\nChoices:\nA: christmas\nB: avalanches\nC: blizzard\nD: shovelling\nE: ice storm",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the situation: a driveway is filled with snow, which needs to be addressed.",
    "We need to find an action that is typically taken to clear snow from a driveway.",
    "Now, let's analyze each option provided.",
    "Option A, \"christmas,\" is irrelevant in this context; it does not address the snow.",
    "Option B, \"avalanches,\" refers to large amounts of snow falling, which is not something we can do to a driveway; it describes a phenomenon rather than an action.",
    "Option C, \"blizzard,\" describes a weather condition involving heavy snow but does not indicate any action taken by a person.",
    "Option D, \"shovelling,\" is a common and practical action taken to remove snow from surfaces like driveways.",
    "Option E, \"ice storm,\" similarly refers to a weather condition and does not depict an action taken to clear snow.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most accurate choice for what must be done to a driveway filled with snow is shovelling."
