  "query": "Question: When someone is having fun how can you physically see it on their face?\n\nChoices:\nA: being happy\nB: pleasure\nC: smiling\nD: injuries\nE: inner joy",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common expressions of fun and happiness that might be observable on a person's face.",
    "Next, think about what physical manifestations are typically associated with having fun. This could include facial expressions.",
    "Smiling is a prominent facial expression associated with enjoyment and can be easily observed.",
    "While being happy (A) and inner joy (E) are feelings that might cause someone to smile, they are not directly observable like a smile itself.",
    "Pleasure (B) is also more of an internal feeling rather than a visible expression.",
    "Injuries (D) are unrelated to the concept of having fun and don\u2019t depict the feelings associated with enjoyment.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the physical sign of someone having fun can be summed up to a specific observable action.",
    "Therefore, out of all the options, smiling (C) directly reflects the physical aspect of having fun."
