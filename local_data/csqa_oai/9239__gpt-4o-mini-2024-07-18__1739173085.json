    "The primary habitat for jellyfish is in the ocean, as they are marine animals.",
    "Jellyfish thrive in salt water, which is a key characteristic of their environment.",
    "While some jellyfish can be found in brackish water, they are predominantly associated with saltwater environments.",
    "The options provided include various locations and contexts which need to be evaluated for relevance to jellyfish habitats.",
    "Choices A (store) and C (Japanese restaurant) do not represent natural habitats for jellyfish.",
    "Choice B (see) could be a typo for \"sea,\" but as presented, it's unclear.",
    "Choice D (Hawaii) is a location where jellyfish might be found due to its oceanic environment, but it does not encompass the broader context of their habitat.",
    "Choice E (salt water) accurately describes the essential environment that jellyfish inhabit.",
    "Comparing options E and D, while D specifies a particular region, E universally applies to all jellyfish, making it the best answer."
