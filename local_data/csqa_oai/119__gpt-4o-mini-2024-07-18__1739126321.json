    "The question states that Sam went to Paris. Paris is the capital city of France.",
    "Since Paris is located in France, we can conclude that Sam was in France when he was in Paris.",
    "The other options need to be analyzed to determine if any of them are true locations where Sam could have been.",
    "Option A (books) does not refer to a geographical location.",
    "Option C (fish market) is too vague and does not specify a location; it's a type of place but not a true answer.",
    "Option D (atlantic ocean) is a body of water and is not a city or a country where Sam could have been.",
    "Option E (cuba) is a different country and is not where Sam was; he was specifically in Paris.",
