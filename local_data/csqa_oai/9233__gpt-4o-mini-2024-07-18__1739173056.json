  "query": "Question: What is a person likely to lock at night?\n\nChoices:\nA: own\nB: gate\nC: entrance\nD: front door\nE: controlling whether door opened",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a person typically secures or locks at night for safety and security.",
    "Locking is commonly associated with entrances to homes or properties to prevent unauthorized access.",
    "Among the choices, \"gate,\" \"entrance,\" and \"front door\" can all be related to security locking.",
    "However, \"front door\" specifically refers to the main entry point of a home where people frequently lock it at night.",
    "Next, analyze \"own\" and \"controlling whether door opened,\" as they do not directly correspond to something a person would lock.",
    "\"Own\" does not make sense in the context of locking, and \"controlling whether door opened\" is more about management than the act of locking it.",
    "Given this reasoning, the most plausible option for what a person is likely to lock at night is \"front door.\"",
    "Now, confirm that \"front door\" is indeed a common point for locking at nighttime compared to other choices, which are either ambiguous or less appropriate."
