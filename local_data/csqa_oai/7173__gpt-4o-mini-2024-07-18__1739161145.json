  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one might be unrestricted on a superhighway, which suggests looking for locations or systems that do not impose limitations on speed or vehicle types.",
    "Option A is \"semi-truck.\" A semi-truck is a vehicle type, but it generally operates under restrictions on highways, such as speed limits and lane restrictions. Therefore, this option is not valid.",
    "Option B is \"city.\" Superhighways are typically not found in cities as they usually consist of more restrictions including lower speed limits and traffic signals. Hence, this option is also not valid.",
    "Option C is \"Germany.\" Germany is known for having sections of the Autobahn where there are no speed limits, which allows for unrestricted travel on superhighways. This option seems valid.",
    "Option D is \"America.\" While some highways in America do have speed limits, they do not typically allow for unrestricted travel like the Autobahn does in Germany. Therefore, this option is not valid.",
    "Option E is \"computer network.\" This option is unrelated to superhighways, as it refers to data transmission rather than physical roadways. Hence, this option is not valid.",
    "Upon considering all options, \"Germany\" stands out as the only location where one might be unrestricted on a superhighway due to the absence of speed limits in certain sections."
