  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the context in which a \"small knight\" could exist.",
    "The term \"knight\" typically refers to a medieval warrior, which may suggest a historical context.",
    "Fairy tales often feature knights as characters, lending to the idea that a \"small knight\" could be a fantastical representation common in stories.",
    "A \"castle\" is often associated with knights, as it was a common setting for their storylines and where they might reside.",
    "The \"middle ages\" was the historical period when knights existed, but it does not specifically respond to the \"small\" aspect of the knight.",
    "A \"chess board\" features knights as pieces and could be a place where a \"small knight\" is found, as chess pieces are often small in size.",
    "A \"doll house\" might also contain representations of knights, particularly in children's play, suggesting another possibility for where a small knight might be found.",
    "Now I evaluate the choices to see where \"small knight\" could realistically fit, weighing the connection to size and context.",
    "\"Small knight\" could easily refer to a chess piece since chess knights are small compared to other representations of knights.",
    "However, in fantasy contexts, \"small knight\" can also imply a children's representation (e.g., in dolls), pointing towards a dollhouse as another viable option.",
    "After careful consideration, I note that the chess board provides a specific, recognizable answer that aligns closely with the term \"small knight.\""
