  "query": "Question: Where is a student likely to be focused on computers?\n\nChoices:\nA: library\nB: space shuttle\nC: mit\nD: dormitory\nE: post office",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a student is likely to be focused on computers, which suggests locations associated with academic or technological activities.",
    "Option A, the library, is a place where students often study, but it may not specifically be associated with heavy computer use, as some libraries encourage traditional studying and reading.",
    "Option B, the space shuttle, is highly unusual for typical student activities and is not relatable to a student's general academic environment.",
    "Option C, MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), is well-known for its focus on technology and computing. Students there are likely to use computers extensively.",
    "Option D, dormitory, is a living space for students where they may have personal computers; however, it does not strongly emphasize a focus on computing like MIT does.",
    "Option E, the post office, is generally associated with mailing and receiving items and does not have any direct relation to students focusing on computers.",
    "Comparing all options, MIT stands out as the most likely place where students would be specifically focused on computers due to its academic emphasis on technology.",
    "None of the other options hold the same strong association with computers as MIT does."
