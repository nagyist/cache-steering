  "steps": [
    "The question states that the banjo was sent off to be sold retail after it was built. This indicates that the banjo is intended for sale to consumers.",
    "Retail typically refers to the sale of goods to individual customers as opposed to wholesale, which sells in bulk to retailers.",
    "The context suggests that the banjo would be sent to a place that sells musical instruments, specifically a location where individuals can purchase it.",
    "The choices given include options like \"music store\" and \"music shop,\" which both refer to locations where musical instruments, including banjos, are sold.",
    "The terms \"music store\" and \"music shop\" are often used interchangeably, both representing retail locations that deal with the sale of musical instruments.",
    "The term \"jug band\" does not fit in this context, as it refers to a type of musical group rather than a retail location.",
    "\"Office\" does not fit either, as it does not relate to the sale or distribution of musical instruments.",
    "Considering the specificity of the context, \"music store\" and \"music shop\" are the only relevant choices for where a banjo would be sent to be sold retail.",
    "Since both \"music store\" and \"music shop\" refer to the same type of establishment, though the wording varies, I note that the exact answer may depend on preference or local terminology.",
    "In the context of the choices provided, I will select one that is more commonly referred to for such transactions. Thus, I choose \"music store\" as my final answer."
