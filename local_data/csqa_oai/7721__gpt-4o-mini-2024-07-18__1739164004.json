  "steps": [
    "The context of the question involves a Menorah, which is a significant symbol in Judaism, typically used during the celebration of Hanukkah.",
    "Since the Menorah is specifically associated with Jewish tradition and rituals, the setting is likely to be related to a Jewish place of worship.",
    "The most appropriate choice that refers to a place where one would find a Menorah is a synagogue, which is a Jewish place of gathering and worship.",
    "The other choices do not fit well with the context of lighting a Menorah: a mosque is for Muslims, a birthday cake is not relevant to the lighting of a Menorah, a dimly lit room lacks specificity, and a bedroom is not a place for such a ritual.",
    "Therefore, the only fitting option that directly relates to the action of lighting a Menorah is the synagogue."
