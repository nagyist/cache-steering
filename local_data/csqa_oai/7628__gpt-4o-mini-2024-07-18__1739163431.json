  "query": "Question: The sloth heard portuguese being spoken nearby and cowered, where was the sloth?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical forests\nB: dictionary\nC: amazon basin\nD: congo\nE: tropical rain forest",
  "steps": [
    "The sloth is a creature native to Central and South America, particularly found in tropical environments.",
    "Portuguese is primarily spoken in Brazil, which is located in South America.",
    "The Amazon Basin is a significant geographical area in Brazil where sloths are commonly found.",
    "Since the sloth is cowering upon hearing Portuguese, it suggests that it is in an area where Portuguese speakers are present, which aligns with Brazil's population.",
    "Tropical forests exist in many regions, but the mention of Portuguese specifically points towards Brazil.",
    "While \"tropical rain forest\" is a viable option, it is a broader category and doesn't specify the location relevant to Portuguese speakers.",
    "Even though tropical forests exist in other areas, the specific context of Portuguese and sloths indicates a strong connection to the Amazon area in Brazil.",
    "Thus, the best answer matches the location where sloths learn to recognize their surroundings, particularly when perturbed by the presence of humans speaking Portuguese."
