  "query": "Question: Bob was tossed from his boat in the pacific ocean near the United States.  He sees a shore to the east and swims toward it. Where is he most likely swimming to?\n\nChoices:\nA: seaside town\nB: florida\nC: ocean\nD: picture of sea side\nE: california",
  "steps": [
    "First, we establish that Bob is in the Pacific Ocean, which influences the direction he is swimming toward the shore.",
    "He sees a shore to the east, indicating that he is heading towards land.",
    "Considering he is in the Pacific Ocean near the United States, the states along the Pacific coast are Washington, Oregon, and California.",
    "Swimming east from the Pacific Ocean would likely lead him to the coast of one of these states.",
    "Florida is situated on the East Coast of the United States and is not located on the Pacific Ocean, ruling it out as a destination.",
    "The term \"ocean\" in option C does not represent a land destination but rather the body of water he is currently in.",
    "The option \"D: picture of sea side\" does not represent a physical location that Bob could swim to.",
    "Considering the relevant nearby states and the direction Bob is swimming, California is the only viable option since it is on the Pacific coast and he is swimming east.",
    "Thus, the most likely place Bob is swimming to, based on geographic context and direction, is California."
