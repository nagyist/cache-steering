  "query": "Question: What must a foreign exchange student do to get around in the new country?\n\nChoices:\nA: do mathematics\nB: read book\nC: answer question\nD: learn language\nE: begin to study",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the importance of communication in a new country. To effectively engage with local people and navigate the environment, a foreign exchange student needs to communicate.",
    "Next, evaluate the options. Options A (do mathematics) and B (read book) do not directly relate to the necessity of communication in everyday life.",
    "Option C (answer question) is too vague and does not encompass the broader need for understanding and expression in a new language.",
    "Now, consider option D (learn language). This directly addresses the need for effective communication with locals, understanding signage, reading menus, and making conversations.",
    "Finally, check option E (begin to study). While studying is a part of learning the language, it is broader and less focused than option D.",
    "Given that learning the local language is crucial for a foreign exchange student to get around successfully, option D (learn language) emerges as the best choice."
