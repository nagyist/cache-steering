  "steps": [
    "To consider what happens to a person guilty of stabbing someone to death, I first need to understand the legal framework surrounding homicide in Washington State.",
    "In Washington State, murder is classified under several degrees, with first-degree murder being the most serious. Stabbing someone to death would typically fall into this category.",
    "If someone is found guilty of first-degree murder, they face severe penalties, which may include a lengthy prison sentence.",
    "Washington State does not have a mandatory death penalty; therefore, capital punishment (death penalty) is not a default outcome for all murder cases.",
    "The maximum sentence for first-degree murder in Washington can be life imprisonment or potentially the death penalty, if the circumstances allow for it.",
    "Examining the choices provided:\nA: imprisonment - this is likely as life imprisonment is a potential sentence for murder.\nB: capital punishment - while possible, it is not guaranteed for every murder case.\nC: killing - this does not apply since the question refers to the aftermath of the guilty finding, not another act.\nD: hurt - this does not represent the legal consequence for committing murder.\nE: enlightenment - this choice does not relate to the legal or penal outcome following a murder conviction.",
    "Considering the most likely and definitive outcome for someone found guilty of stabbing someone to death in Washington State, the clear choice is imprisonment."
