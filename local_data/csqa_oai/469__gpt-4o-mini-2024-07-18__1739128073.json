  "query": "Question: When a newborn's eyes open for the first time it will be the first time the ever?\n\nChoices:\nA: tear up\nB: see light\nC: fill with tears\nD: be happy\nE: glass over",
  "steps": [
    "First, the question specifies that it deals with the event of a newborn's eyes opening for the first time.",
    "When a newborn opens its eyes, it is typically the first time they experience visual stimuli.",
    "One of the primary experiences associated with opening eyes for the first time is seeing light.",
    "The other options discuss feelings or states that do not directly relate to the act of opening eyes.",
    "Tearing up, filling with tears, being happy, and having eyes glass over are not immediate reactions tied to the physical act of opening their eyes.",
    "The focus of the question is on a sensory experience rather than emotional reactions.",
    "Based on the reasoning that opening the eyes correlates with the ability to see light, the correct answer must reflect that primary experience.",
    "Now, comparing all the options again confirms that only \"seeing light\" is directly tied to the action of opening the eyes for the first time."
