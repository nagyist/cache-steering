  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"\u00e1rbol de manzana\" translates to in English, which is \"apple tree.\"",
    "Next, I need to consider the languages spoken in the locations provided in the choices.",
    "In Spain, Spanish is the primary language, so it\u2019s likely to hear \"\u00e1rbol de manzana\" used as it is in Spanish.",
    "In the Bible, the primary languages are Hebrew and Greek, and \"\u00e1rbol de manzana\" would not be relevant or commonly used.",
    "In Ohio, while there may be Spanish speakers, it is predominantly English-speaking, making \"apple tree\" the more common phrase.",
    "In Montreal, both French and English are spoken, but the phrase \"\u00e1rbol de manzana\" would not be commonly used since it is in Spanish.",
    "In Washington State, similar to Ohio, while there may also be Spanish speakers, English is the predominant language overall.",
    "Considering all of the above, Spain is the only choice where \"\u00e1rbol de manzana\" would naturally be used in everyday language."
