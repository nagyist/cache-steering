  "query": "Question: The person answered the door when the mailman knocked, what likely happened next?\n\nChoices:\nA: arm himself\nB: cross street\nC: feel sleepy\nD: dog barked\nE: receive mail",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario begins with a person answering the door when the mailman knocked. This suggests that the person was expecting someone or something at the door, specifically the mailman.",
    "When the mailman arrives, a common interaction involves delivering mail or packages. Therefore, it's likely that the door was answered to either receive mail or have a brief interaction.",
    "Among the choices given, receiving mail (choice E) is directly related to the action of answering the door for the mailman.",
    "The other options can be considered as follows: \n- Arm himself (A): This is not a reasonable action when someone simply answers the door for a mailman.\n- Cross street (B): This does not relate logically to the scenario presented.\n- Feel sleepy (C): While possible, it does not directly connect to the event of answering the door.\n- Dog barked (D): Although a dog might bark when someone comes to the door, it is not the most likely outcome of the interaction.",
    "Since the primary reason for a mailman knocking is to deliver mail, and the person answered the door, it would be most logical that the next thing that happened was the person would receive mail."
