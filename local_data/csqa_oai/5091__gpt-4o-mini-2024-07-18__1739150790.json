  "steps": [
    "The question states that everyone in John's band plays brass instruments. This suggests a focus on a specific type of musical ensemble that features brass instruments prominently.",
    "The answer choices include different types of bands: annoy mom, jazz band, brass band, punk rock, and marching band. I need to evaluate each of these bands in relation to brass instruments.",
    "\"Annoy mom\" does not refer to a musical ensemble, so it is not a valid option.",
    "A \"jazz band\" typically includes a variety of instruments, such as brass, woodwinds, and rhythm instruments. While it can certainly feature brass players, it is not exclusively a brass ensemble.",
    "A \"brass band\" consists entirely of brass instruments, which aligns perfectly with the statement that every member of John's band plays brass instruments. This could definitely be the correct answer.",
    "\"Marching band\" usually includes brass instruments but also incorporates woodwinds and percussion, meaning it's not exclusively made up of brass instruments.",
    "\"Punk rock\" bands do not typically feature brass instruments at all, as they revolve around electric guitars, bass, and drums.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only band type that categorically fits the criteria of having members who solely play brass instruments is the brass band.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the best answer is that John's band is a brass band."
