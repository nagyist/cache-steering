  "steps": [
    "Identify what is meant by \"meet a friend who lives close to you.\" This suggests looking for a location that is accessible and commonly used by friends who reside in proximity.",
    "Evaluate the options based on common locations for friends who live near each other to meet.",
    "Option A: workplace - This is a specific location related to a job and may not necessarily apply to a personal friendship for someone living nearby.",
    "Option B: bus station - While this is a public transit point, it is not typically a meeting place for friends who live close to each other.",
    "Option C: social atmosphere - This is vague and could imply various places, but does not provide a specific and relatable location.",
    "Option D: neighbor's house - This is a direct option where friends who live close can easily meet, making it a very suitable and practical choice.",
    "Option E: at school - This may apply if friends are students, but it is not guaranteed as not all adults go to school.",
    "Compare options D and E as they are the most relevant. While D indicates meeting at a neighbor's house directly, E may not apply to everyone.",
    "Since meeting at a neighbor's house is the most appropriate and common meeting point for friends living near each other, it stands out as the best option."
