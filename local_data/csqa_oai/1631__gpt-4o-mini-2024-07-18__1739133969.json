  "query": "Question: Why would someone not want to be cogitating?\n\nChoices:\nA: dance\nB: decision\nC: headaches\nD: reaching conclusion\nE: enlightenment",
  "steps": [
    "To begin with, cogitating means to think deeply about something, often leading to decision-making or problem-solving.",
    "When someone is cogitating, they may be faced with complex thoughts or dilemmas that require significant mental effort.",
    "Engaging in deep thinking can sometimes lead to mental fatigue or discomfort, as prolonged concentration can be taxing.",
    "Headaches can be a physical consequence of intense mental exertion, often resulting from stress or strain during cogitation.",
    "Consider the other choices: \"dance\" is unrelated to cogitating, \"decision\" is a potential outcome of cogitating, \"reaching conclusion\" is part of the process of cogitating, and \"enlightenment\" can be a positive aspect of deep thinking.",
    "Since headaches are a negative side effect of deep thinking, this makes them a plausible reason why someone might not want to engage in cogitating.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer that reflects a negative consequence of cogitating is headaches."
