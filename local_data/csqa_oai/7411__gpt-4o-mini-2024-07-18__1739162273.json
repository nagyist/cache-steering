  "query": "Question: What crunchy treat do many people have at a movie theater?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: jolly rancher\nC: popcorn\nD: town\nE: cineplex",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is about a common snack associated with a specific location, in this case, a movie theater.",
    "Consider the options provided: A (city), B (jolly rancher), C (popcorn), D (town), E (cineplex).",
    "Analyze each option:\n- Option A (city) and D (town) are not edible and do not fit the context of a snack.\n- Option E (cineplex) refers to the theater itself, not a snack.",
    "Evaluate option B (jolly rancher). While it is a treat, it is not typically considered a crunchy snack commonly associated with movie theaters.",
    "Now look at option C (popcorn). It is widely known as a crunchy snack and is synonymous with movie theaters.",
    "Consider the popularity of popcorn in various media and advertisements surrounding movies, which strongly associate popcorn with the movie-going experience.",
    "Review what I have concluded: the only option that fits the criteria of a crunchy treat commonly consumed at movie theaters is popcorn.",
    "Therefore, finalize the answer based on the reasoning above."
