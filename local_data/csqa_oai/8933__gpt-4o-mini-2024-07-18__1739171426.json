  "query": "Question: James and Holly were getting a divorce. They didn't like it, but they needed it.  What might they be trying to avoid?\n\nChoices:\nA: being single\nB: tears\nC: children suffer\nD: anger\nE: no spouse",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of a divorce. It often involves a lot of emotional turmoil and stress. James and Holly likely want to minimize aspects of that emotional pain.",
    "Next, among the options provided, \"tears\" (B) could potentially be something they want to avoid as it is often associated with sadness during a divorce.",
    "\"Children suffer\" (C) is another option. If they have children, they might be concerned about the impact of the divorce on their kids and want to protect them from distress.",
    "\"Anger\" (D) may also be something they are trying to avoid, as divorce can lead to heightened emotions and conflicts. However, this typically refers to feelings rather than consequences.",
    "\"Being single\" (A) indicates a status change rather than a direct consequence of divorce; it\u2019s more about being in a relationship as opposed to avoiding sadness or emotional fallout.",
    "Finally, \"no spouse\" (E) suggests a desire for separation from the relationship but does not directly answer what they might be trying to avoid as they are already opting for a divorce.",
    "Considering all the factors, the most compelling reason why they might be getting a divorce is to avoid their children suffering as a direct consequence of the separation, provided they have children involved."
