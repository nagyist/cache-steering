  "query": "Question: The investigator considered the gun evidence, where did he send it?\n\nChoices:\nA: drawer\nB: back to its owner\nC: police station\nD: crime scene\nE: holster",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around what an investigator would typically do with evidence collected from a crime scene, specifically a gun.",
    "In criminal investigations, firearms recovered as evidence are usually sent for analysis or storage in an appropriate and secure location.",
    "Options such as \"drawer\" and \"holster\" do not seem appropriate, as those are not standard evidence handling practices.",
    "Sending the gun \"back to its owner\" might happen after legal proceedings, but not immediately after collecting it for investigation purposes.",
    "The \"crime scene\" is where the gun was found; therefore, it is unlikely that the gun would be sent back there again.",
    "The \"police station\" is a common and logical place to send evidence where it can be properly stored and processed for investigation.",
    "Considering standard procedures in law enforcement for handling evidence, option C (police station) stands out as the most appropriate answer."
