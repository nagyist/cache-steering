  "query": "Question: Where is a snake likely to startle a farmer?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical forest\nB: tree\nC: pet shops\nD: book store\nE: feild",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the environments where snakes are commonly found. Snakes are often found in natural habitats such as forests or fields.",
    "Next, let's analyze each option given. The tropical forest (A) is a natural habitat where a snake might live, potentially startling a farmer who is working nearby.",
    "The second option is a tree (B). While snakes can be found in trees, it is less likely for a farmer to encounter one directly there unless they are specifically climbing or working in an area with trees.",
    "The third option is pet shops (C). While they may contain snakes, it is less likely for a farmer to be startled by them because they are contained environments.",
    "The fourth option is a bookstore (D). It's improbable for a farmer to encounter a snake in a bookstore, as snakes typically do not inhabit such places.",
    "Finally, the fifth option is a field (E). A snake is quite likely to be found in a field, especially if it is a rural area where the farmer works. This would likely lead to a startling encounter for the farmer.",
    "Comparing all the options, the field (E) stands out as the most plausible location for a snake to startle a farmer, as it is a setting where both are likely to intersect."
