  "query": "Question: If you aren't in a jewelry store or looking in a jewelry box where might you find a choker?\n\nChoices:\nA: boutique\nB: kennel\nC: jewelry box\nD: pet store\nE: jewelry store",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that we are excluding a jewelry store and a jewelry box as potential locations for finding a choker.",
    "A choker is typically a type of necklace, so we should consider locations where clothing or accessories might be sold.",
    "A boutique often sells clothing and accessories, making it a likely candidate for where one might find a choker.",
    "A kennel is primarily a place for dogs, so a choker would not typically be found there, ruling it out.",
    "A pet store mainly focuses on pet supplies, and while they may sell pet collars, it is unlikely they would have human jewelry items like chokers.",
    "The jewelry box is already ruled out per the question's stipulation.",
    "The jewelry store is specifically excluded in the question as well, so it cannot be a correct answer either.",
    "Since the kennel, pet store, jewelry box, and jewelry store are eliminated, the only remaining choice is the boutique."
