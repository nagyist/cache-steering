  "query": "Question: Where are leaves likely to cause an accident?\n\nChoices:\nA: roof\nB: ground\nC: trees\nD: field\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify a location where leaves could create a hazardous situation or contribute to accidents.",
    "Leaves can create slippery conditions when wet, which is primarily a concern on surfaces where vehicles or pedestrians are present.",
    "The \"ground\" can refer to a variety of surfaces, but it broadly encompasses places where leaves are likely to fall.",
    "The \"street\" is a specific type of ground where vehicles travel, making it a potential area for accidents due to slippery leaves.",
    "Comparing the options, \"roof,\" \"trees,\" and \"field\" do not directly facilitate situations where leaves could cause accidents involving people or vehicles.",
    "There's also the possibility of leaves falling from trees onto surfaces which could lead to accidents; however, \"trees\" themselves do not cause accidents directly.",
    "Since \"ground\" can be too vague and doesn\u2019t specifically address where accidents are most likely to occur, we focus on \"street\" as it represents an active environment for individuals and vehicles.",
    "Considering that falling leaves can create slippery conditions just like rain does, and given the street context, it is logical to identify the street as a prime location for accidents due to leaves.",
    "Thus, out of all the choices, \"street\" is the location where leaves are most likely to cause an accident due to their impact on vehicle and pedestrian safety."
