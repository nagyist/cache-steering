  "query": "Question: The outdoor restaurant has no business when it rained, where should it move to?\n\nChoices:\nA: big city\nB: town\nC: building\nD: new york\nE: new place",
  "steps": [
    "The restaurant currently has no business when it rains, which indicates that being outdoors is a significant factor affecting its operation and revenue.",
    "To resolve the issue of no business during rain, moving to a location that offers shelter from the rain would be beneficial.",
    "A \"big city\" (Option A) might have more traffic and potential customers, but it does not inherently provide shelter from rain.",
    "A \"town\" (Option B) may or may not offer the same advantages as a big city; its impact on business due to weather would need to be evaluated similarly.",
    "Moving to a \"building\" (Option C) could mean an indoor space that protects customers from rain, allowing the restaurant to operate regardless of weather conditions.",
    "\"New York\" (Option D) refers to a specific city; while it may have advantages in terms of population density, it's not necessarily a guaranteed solution to the restaurant's rain problem.",
    "A \"new place\" (Option E) is vague and could refer to any location, potentially including indoor and outdoor venues, but does not specify an advantage like a building does.",
    "Given that the primary concern is the inability to operate during rain, moving to a \"building\" seems to directly address the problem.",
    "Thus, out of all options considered, Option C is the most practical solution for the restaurant's situation."
