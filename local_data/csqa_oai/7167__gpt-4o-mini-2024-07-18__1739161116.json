  "steps": [
    "Monopoly is a board game typically played with specific rules regarding how the game ends.",
    "The most common condition for ending a Monopoly game is that one player goes bankrupt and cannot pay their debts.",
    "The game can officially end when one player owns all the properties and has eliminated other players from the game.",
    "Another way the game might end is through a predetermined time limit, but this is not the official rule of the game.",
    "Additionally, the game can informally end when players decide to stop playing, often for reasons unrelated to winning or losing.",
    "Looking at the provided options, I need to determine which one aligns with the official ending of the game.",
    "Option A states \"win game,\" which could be interpreted as one player winning, but it lacks specific clarity.",
    "Options B, D, and E speak more to the feelings and experiences of the players rather than the actual rules of the game.",
    "Option C states \"the timer stops,\" which implies a time limit that isn't standard for Monopoly, although it could apply if the players agreed to such a format.",
    "Based on the official rules, the most accurate answer focusing on the end condition is that one person has to win the game, which aligns with option A."
