  "query": "Question: The poet wanted to promote his new literature to literary majors, where did he go to do so?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: book store\nC: university\nD: study\nE: home",
  "steps": [
    "The poet aims to promote his literature specifically to literary majors, indicating he\u2019s targeting an academic audience.",
    "Literary majors are typically found in higher education institutions rather than casual venues.",
    "A university is a place where literary majors study and engage with literature, making it a logical location for promotion.",
    "Classrooms (Choice A) are part of a university, but they are not typically where one would go to promote literature directly, as they are more focused on instruction.",
    "A book store (Choice B) might cater to readers in general but doesn't specifically target literary majors. It's a broader market.",
    "A study (Choice D) usually refers to a personal workspace and would not be a location for public promotion.",
    "Home (Choice E) also doesn\u2019t provide a venue for promotion, as it\u2019s private and not intended for outreach to literary majors.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate and specific location for the poet to promote his literature to literary majors is a university."
