  "query": "Question: Where is the strategic gold reserve in the U.S.?\n\nChoices:\nA: jewelery\nB: fort knox\nC: church\nD: jewelry store\nE: treasure chest",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location of the strategic gold reserve in the U.S. which is a secured site for storing gold reserves.",
    "I need to recall what I know about the locations specifically known for holding gold reserves in the U.S.",
    "One well-known location is Fort Knox, which is famous for holding a large amount of the United States' gold bullion.",
    "I can also consider the other options: jewelry, church, jewelry store, and treasure chest. None of these locations are typically recognized as secure storage locations for gold reserves.",
    "Jewelry and jewelry stores are places where gold might be sold, but they do not serve as reserves for national gold storage.",
    "A church is not related to gold storage or reserves; it serves a different purpose entirely.",
    "A treasure chest might evoke the idea of holding valuables, but it\u2019s not a practical or real location for a strategic gold reserve in the U.S.",
    "Given this analysis, it becomes clear that among the choices, Fort Knox (option B) is the only reasonable and factual answer related to the U.S. strategic gold reserve."
