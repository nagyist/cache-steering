    "Being stuck indoors can lead to feelings of fatigue and a sense of stagnation. Fresh air typically revitalizes the mind and body.",
    "Fresh air often increases oxygen intake, which is beneficial for physical and mental performance.",
    "Breathing in fresh air can improve mood and may help clear the mind, promoting clarity of thought.",
    "Exposure to nature and open air can trigger feelings of happiness and relaxation.",
    "Feeling refreshed is a common sensation after spending time outdoors, particularly after being indoors for an extended period.",
    "All options (A, B, C, D, E) are potential positive outcomes of breathing fresh air after being stuck indoors.",
    "However, the question asks specifically about the primary effect after breathing fresh air following being confined indoors.",
    "Among the options, feeling better (A) and feeling refreshed (E) seem to encapsulate the overall improvement in state that occurs when stepping outside.",
    "In contrast, while options B, C, and D are valid effects of fresh air, they do not directly reflect the overall transformation that occurs most immediately and noticeably.",
