  "query": "Question: Where would you expect to see a white fox?\n\nChoices:\nA: great outdoors\nB: open meadow\nC: forest\nD: arctic tundra\nE: mountains",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of a white fox. They are commonly found in cold environments.",
    "Next, determine if any of the choices represent a typical cold environment. The Arctic tundra is known for its extremely cold temperatures.",
    "Evaluate choice A: the great outdoors is too broad and not specific enough to suggest a cold climate.",
    "Evaluate choice B: an open meadow could exist in various climates and does not specifically imply cold.",
    "Evaluate choice C: a forest could exist in many climates, including warmer ones, and does not specifically denote a cold habitat.",
    "Evaluate choice E: mountains can also be in various climates. While some mountainous regions are cold, they can also be temperate or warm.",
    "Considering all options, return to choice D: the Arctic tundra, which specifically connotes a very cold region, aligning with a common habitat for the white fox.",
    "Finally, reaffirm that the Arctic tundra is not only cold but also supports the characteristics and existence of a white fox population due to its environment."
