  "query": "Question: Susan was attending a meeting of the KKK, even though she did not believe in their cause.  Why might she have been doing so?\n\nChoices:\nA: sharing ideas\nB: sell hotdogs\nC: fall asleep\nD: getting information\nE: sharing information",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider why someone might attend a meeting of a group they do not support.",
    "One possibility is that Susan could be seeking to gather information about the group's beliefs and activities.",
    "Attending the meeting would allow her to understand their perspectives and motives more clearly, which might be useful for various reasons such as research or activism against them.",
    "Another option could be that she might be there to share ideas, although this seems less plausible as she does not believe in their cause.",
    "Selling hotdogs does not seem relevant to the context of attending a KKK meeting, since there is no indication that such an event would involve selling food.",
    "Falling asleep is unlikely to be a motivation for attending a meeting; it suggests a lack of engagement with the situation.",
    "Sharing information could be considered, but if she does not believe in their cause, it's less likely that she would be sharing her perspective or information with them.",
    "Thus, the most logical reason for attending would be to gain insights into the group's activities and objectives, supporting the idea of gathering information."
