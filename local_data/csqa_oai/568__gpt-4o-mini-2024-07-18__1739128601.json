  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a place that is typically used to store dishes but not books.",
    "Let's analyze each option provided to see if it fits the description of storing dishes.",
    "Option A, \"apartment,\" could store both dishes and books, so it doesn't fit.",
    "Option B, \"pantry,\" is specifically used for storing food items and kitchen supplies, including dishes in some cases, but not books.",
    "Option C, \"table,\" is usually where dishes are placed temporarily for serving, but not a storage place, so it doesn't fit well.",
    "Option D, \"living room,\" can have dishes if a dining area is included, but primarily it\u2019s a space for furniture and entertainment rather than a dish storage area.",
    "Option E, \"shelf,\" can store both dishes and books. Therefore, it does not fit the requirement of storing only dishes.",
    "Upon review, the best fit for the requirement of a place that primarily stores dishes and not books is the pantry."
