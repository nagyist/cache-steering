  "query": "Question: Where would a sofabed be used only for guests?\n\nChoices:\nA: sitting room\nB: living room\nC: basement\nD: dinning roam\nE: spare room",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary function of a sofabed, which is to serve as a convertible seating area that can transform into a bed for sleeping.",
    "Next, think about the various rooms listed in the choices and how they might relate to guest accommodations.",
    "The sitting room typically serves as a gathering area for socializing rather than primarily for guests.",
    "The living room is often a central space for entertainment and relaxation, not specifically designed for guest sleeping arrangements.",
    "A basement can be used as an extra living space, but it's not a typical designated room for hosting guests.",
    "The dining room (noted as \"dinning roam\") is primarily for eating meals and isn\u2019t suited for a sleeping arrangement.",
    "The spare room, however, is indeed a room typically allocated for guests to stay overnight, making it the most logical choice for placing a sofabed for guest use.",
    "Considering all the above factors, the only option focused on accommodating overnight visitors directly is the spare room."
