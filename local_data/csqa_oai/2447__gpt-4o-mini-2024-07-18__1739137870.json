  "query": "Question: The lizard was certainly out of its element in the bustling capital of San Jose, where was the lizard?\n\nChoices:\nA: costa rica\nB: captivity\nC: encyclopedia\nD: new mexico\nE: imagination land",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the lizard was out of its element in a busy place, suggesting it is not in a natural habitat but rather somewhere that may not suit its needs.",
    "It specifies the location as the bustling capital of San Jose. This implies a metropolitan area, which is typically filled with human activity and structures.",
    "There are two San Jos\u00e9s that are capitals: one is in California, USA, and the other is in Costa Rica. Since the question mentions the capital specifically, it is likely referring to the San Jose in Costa Rica.",
    "Considering the options given, \u201cCosta Rica\u201d (Choice A) directly relates to San Jose, Costa Rica. Thus, the lizard could be placed there.",
    "The other options do not seem to fit with San Jose, Costa Rica:\n- \"Captivity\" (Choice B) suggests confinement rather than a location.\n- \"Encyclopedia\" (Choice C) is not a location at all.\n- \"New Mexico\" (Choice D) is unrelated to San Jose.\n- \"Imagination land\" (Choice E) is fictional and not relevant.",
    "Since A (Costa Rica) is the only option that fits geographically with San Jose, the lizard\u2019s out-of-element status aligns with the idea that it is in a busy capital, contrasting with its natural habitat.",
    "Therefore, the final answer must relate to where the lizard was located in relation to the context of San Jose."
