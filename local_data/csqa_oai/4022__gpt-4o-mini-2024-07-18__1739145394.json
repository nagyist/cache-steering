  "steps": [
    "I will identify the typical locations where a telephone directory might be found in public spaces.",
    "An office often has various directories, but it is primarily a private space; thus, it may not be considered a public area.",
    "A house is also a private space, and while it may contain a telephone directory, it is not a public location.",
    "A phone booth is designed for public use and historically often contains a directory for individuals to look up phone numbers.",
    "A kitchen is a personal area typically within a household, so it is not a public space where one would find a telephone directory.",
    "An amusement park may have various public facilities, but it is unlikely to have a telephone directory readily available in a common area.",
    "Evaluating all the options, the only choice that stands out as a public place where a telephone directory would typically be found is the phone booth."
