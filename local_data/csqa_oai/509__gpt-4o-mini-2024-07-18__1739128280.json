  "query": "Question: The billionaire donated a large sum to his former college, this allowed them to construct a new science what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fraternity house\nB: bank\nC: big town\nD: big city\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand the context of the sentence, which mentions a donation to a college that enables a construction project.",
    "Consider the common types of construction associated with colleges, such as dorms, libraries, and science facilities.",
    "The key term in the sentence is \"science,\" which implies that the construction is related to science education or research.",
    "Evaluate each option in relation to the term \"science\":\n- A: fraternity house - not directly related to science.\n- B: bank - does not relate to college science.\n- C: big town - unrelated conceptually to construction and science.\n- D: big city - also unrelated.\n- E: building - could refer specifically to a building for science, like a laboratory or classroom space.",
    "Since the context specifically mentions \"science,\" the most likely construction related to this is a \"building\" where scientific work or education takes place.",
    "Eliminate options that do not fit the academic and scientific theme, narrowing down to \"building,\" which aligns with the context.",
    "Reassess and confirm that the choice \"building\" effectively reflects a new science facility appropriate for a college."
