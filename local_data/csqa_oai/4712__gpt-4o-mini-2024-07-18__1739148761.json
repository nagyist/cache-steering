  "query": "Question: What do ships other than cargo ships do when they are in the ocean?\n\nChoices:\nA: bottom out\nB: cross ocean\nC: collide\nD: cross river\nE: carry people",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what types of ships exist apart from cargo ships. These could include passenger ships, fishing vessels, military ships, and research vessels.",
    "Next, we analyze the primary functions of these ships. For example, passenger ships are designed to transport people, while fishing vessels are for catching fish. Military ships engage in defense activities and research vessels gather scientific data.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the options provided. \"Bottom out\" implies a ship hitting the ocean floor, which is not a typical or desired action for any ship while navigating the ocean.",
    "The option \"Cross ocean\" suggests a ship traversing across the ocean, which is possible for many ship types but is not specific enough to illustrate their primary purpose.",
    "\"Collide\" implies accidents between vessels, which is an unwanted scenario and not a service offered by any ship type.",
    "\"Cross river\" pertains to navigation in rivers, which typically does not apply to most ocean-going vessels; they tend to operate in deeper waters.",
    "Finally, \"Carry people\" directly relates to passenger ships and is one of the main functions of certain types of vessels (e.g., cruise ships, ferries). This option aligns with the purpose of some ships other than cargo ships."
