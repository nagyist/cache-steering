  "steps": [
    "First, I identify that the scene involves a wet beaver spotted in a river. This suggests a natural environment where beavers are typically found.",
    "Next, I consider that beavers are generally located in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, and ponds.",
    "I then evaluate the choices provided. A dictionary and books are not natural environments, thus they are not viable options.",
    "Next, I analyze choice C, Australia. Beavers are not native to Australia, so this location is unlikely.",
    "I then assess choice D, seaside. Since beavers inhabit freshwater and not saltwater environments, this option is also unlikely.",
    "Finally, I review choice E, countryside. The countryside often includes rural and natural landscapes, which could realistically support a river environment where beavers live."
