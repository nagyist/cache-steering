  "steps": [
    "The question focuses on what contributes to success alongside preparation.",
    "Preparation is often linked to a planned approach or groundwork that sets one up for achieving goals.",
    "Next, I need to evaluate each of the provided choices to see which aligns best with the concept of success in conjunction with preparation.",
    "Choice A: \"awards ceremony\" does not relate directly to the idea of contributing factors to success; it is more of a recognition event.",
    "Choice B: \"various situations\" is too vague and does not imply effort or input toward achieving success.",
    "Choice C: \"vocation\" may indicate a career, but it doesn't directly connect to the idea of working towards success alongside preparation.",
    "Choice D: \"working hard\" is a well-known factor that directly correlates with achieving success; it embodies effort and determination that, when combined with preparation, yields results.",
    "Choice E: \"promotion\" is a result of success rather than a contributing factor, so it is not suitable.",
    "Since \"working hard\" is the only option that directly complements preparation to achieve success, it stands out as the correct choice."
