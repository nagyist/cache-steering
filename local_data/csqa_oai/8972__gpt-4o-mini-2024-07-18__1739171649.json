  "steps": [
    "To determine where a piano might be kept, I first consider places commonly associated with music and pianos.",
    "I know that a concert hall is a venue for performances, but it is not a place where pianos are typically stored when not in use.",
    "A church often has a piano for music during services, but it may not be the primary location for a piano.",
    "Restaurants might have pianos for entertainment purposes, but this is not common for storage as they usually use them for performances.",
    "On the other hand, a drawing room (or living room) can sometimes house a piano as part of home decor and entertainment.",
    "However, the most relevant answer would be a music room, specifically designed for music practice, teaching, and instrument storage.",
    "Considering all the options, the music room is the most accurate place to keep a piano due to its purpose and design."
