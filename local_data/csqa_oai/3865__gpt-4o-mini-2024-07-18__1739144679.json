  "query": "Question: LEds  are commonly found on kehyboards and other what?\n\nChoices:\nA: television\nB: electronic devices\nC: pc board\nD: electrical machine\nE: dashboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question regarding where LEDs are commonly found in addition to keyboards.",
    "Next, we know that LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are used in various applications. They are often found in devices requiring illumination or visual indication.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the provided options one by one to see which context fits best.",
    "Option A: \"television\" - LEDs are used in televisions, especially in backlighting for LCD panels, but the association with keyboards is not strong.",
    "Option B: \"electronic devices\" - This is a broad category that includes keyboards, TVs, computers, and much more. LEDs are indeed commonly found in many types of electronic devices.",
    "Option C: \"pc board\" - This is a more technical term referring to printed circuit boards, where LEDs may be mounted, but it is not commonly referred to in everyday speech.",
    "Option D: \"electrical machine\" - This seems vague and doesn't specifically relate to the use of LEDs alongside keyboards.",
    "Option E: \"dashboard\" - LEDs are used in dashboards (like in vehicles) for indicator lights, but this does not relate directly to keyboards.",
    "Reviewing all the options, option B (\"electronic devices\") seems to be the most accurate as it encompasses a wide array of devices where LEDs are commonly found, making it the most relevant parallel to keyboards."
