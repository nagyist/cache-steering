  "query": "Question: Where would you find many tables of silverware rolled into nice displayed napkins?\n\nChoices:\nA: silver\nB: park\nC: table\nD: cupboard\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a location where many tables of silverware are nicely arranged with rolled napkins.",
    "The arrangement of silverware and napkins suggests a formal dining setting.",
    "A \"restaurant\" is commonly associated with this type of table setting, especially where meals are served to customers.",
    "The option \"table\" does not refer to a location but rather the object itself where the silverware would be placed.",
    "The option \"cupboard\" typically holds silverware but does not involve the display of it with napkins.",
    "The option \"park\" is unlikely to have tables set up with silverware and napkins as it is typically outdoors without dining setups.",
    "The option \"silver\" refers to the material of the silverware but does not answer the location context of the question.",
    "Comparing the remaining options, \"restaurant\" clearly fits the description of a place where tables are elegantly set with silverware and rolled napkins for diners.",
    "Therefore, the best answer based on the reasoning is \"restaurant.\""
