    "The ficus is known to thrive in environments with high humidity and warmth.",
    "I need to determine which of the choices represents a climate that provides plenty of humidity and suitable weather conditions for the growth of a ficus.",
    "\"Arboretum\" (A) refers to a place where trees and plants are grown for study or exhibition, but does not specifically indicate weather or humidity conditions.",
    "\"Trees\" (B) is too broad and does not indicate a specific environment or conditions relevant to the growth of a ficus.",
    "\"Ecosphere\" (C) also doesn't describe specific weather or humidity conditions relevant to the ficus.",
    "\u201cTropical rainforest\u201d (D) is known for its high humidity and warm temperatures, which are ideal for the growth of many plants, including the ficus.",
    "\u201cSunny window\u201d (E) refers to a location but does not guarantee high humidity, which is an important factor for the ficus's growth.",
    "Among the choices, the one that best matches the conditions mentioned (plenty of humidity and suitable weather) is \"tropical rainforest.\""
