  "query": "Question: Awaking in the middle of the night may cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: depression\nB: irritability\nC: shock\nD: discomfort\nE: alertness",
  "steps": [
    "Assess the implications of waking up in the middle of the night. It disrupts normal sleep patterns.",
    "Consider how disrupted sleep generally affects mood and cognitive function. One common effect is irritability.",
    "Examine the possible feelings and reactions associated with being awoken suddenly from sleep. Shock could be an initial response but is less common.",
    "Evaluate the factor of discomfort. Waking up unexpectedly can lead to feelings of discomfort, but it might not encompass the range of emotional responses.",
    "Look at alertness; while waking up can make some people feel alert, it typically does not apply to night awakenings where one expects to be asleep.",
    "Review the potential for depression as a long-term consequence of poor sleep but recognize that it is not an immediate reaction to being awoken.",
    "Narrow down options: shock and alertness seem less relevant when considering immediate emotional responses to being awoken.",
    "Consider irritability and discomfort: both can be immediate responses, but irritability is a more typical reaction stemming from interrupted sleep.",
    "Based on common reactions, conclude that irritability is the most likely direct consequence of being awakened in the middle of the night."
