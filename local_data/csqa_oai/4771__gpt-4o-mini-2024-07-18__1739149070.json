  "steps": [
    "The question asks where people typically keep their food cans.",
    "I will analyze each option to determine if it is a common place to store food cans.",
    "Option A: Supermarket - This is a place where food cans are sold, not stored by consumers.",
    "Option B: Recycling center - This is a place where people take cans for recycling, not where they keep them.",
    "Option C: Backpack - While someone might carry food cans in a backpack temporarily, it is not a typical storage location.",
    "Option D: Refrigerator - Food cans can be kept in a refrigerator if they contain perishable items, but most cans are stored at room temperature.",
    "Option E: House - People commonly store their food cans in their houses, typically in pantries or cupboards.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best answer is where people generally keep their food cans, which would be their house."
