  "steps": [
    "The question is about what to do when there is no internet connection.",
    "The first choice, 911, is for emergencies and is not appropriate for an internet issue.",
    "The second choice, computer network, is not a person or entity you can call; it refers to a system.",
    "The third choice, company, likely refers to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other tech support services, which would be appropriate to contact for internet issues.",
    "The fourth choice, electrical circuit, refers to hardware and would not be a valid option to call for help.",
    "The fifth choice, airport, is unrelated to internet service and does not provide assistance for connectivity issues.",
    "Evaluating all options, the only reasonable choice for assistance with an internet connection problem is to call the company that provides the internet service.",
    "Thus, the best answer is to contact the company that handles internet services."
