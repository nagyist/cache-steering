  "query": "Question: You'd add pepper and salt to what liquid meal if it's bland?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: water\nC: cellars\nD: soup\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a liquid meal that can be considered bland, which would require adding pepper and salt to enhance its flavor.",
    "Let's analyze the options provided. \"Supermarket\" and \"grocery store\" refer to locations and not liquid meals, so they can be eliminated.",
    "Next, \"water\" is indeed a liquid, but it's not typically considered a meal and generally doesn't get seasoned with pepper and salt.",
    "The term \"cellars\" does not refer to a liquid meal, so we can eliminate that as well.",
    "Now we consider \"soup,\" which is a common liquid meal that can often be bland before seasoning and is frequently enhanced with pepper and salt.",
    "Upon review, the only option that fits the description of a bland liquid meal that would require seasoning is \"soup.\"",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer is \"soup\" because it meets all the criteria of being liquid, meal-like, and bland in its base form."
