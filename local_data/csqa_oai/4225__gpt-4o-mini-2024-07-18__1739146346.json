  "query": "Question: When old conservative people observe a changing society, what do the experience?\n\nChoices:\nA: depression\nB: resentment\nC: hurt\nD: anger\nE: acceptance",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider how old conservative people view changes in society. They often hold traditional values and may feel that rapid changes challenge these values.",
    "Next, think about the emotional responses one may feel when they believe their core beliefs are being threatened. Feelings of negativity could arise when facing substantial societal shifts.",
    "Now, evaluate the options based on common psychological responses. Depression could be a response, but it might not be the most immediate reaction to change.",
    "Resentment is a possibility, as it encompasses feelings of bitterness towards new ideas that seem to undermine traditional values.",
    "Hurt could also apply, but that usually refers to personal loss or feelings, rather than a broad social context.",
    "Anger is another strong emotional response and is commonly expressed when people feel that their way of life is under attack. This could also lead to hostility towards those who advocate for change.",
    "Acceptance implies a willingness to embrace change, which seems less likely for this demographic given the context of the question.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting response, taking into account the common reactions of old conservative individuals toward societal change, would likely be anger, since they may feel a strong emotional resistance."
