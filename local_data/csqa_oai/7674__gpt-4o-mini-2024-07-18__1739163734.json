  "query": "Question: He was the victim of a random punching, what did he find on his body?\n\nChoices:\nA: pain for\nB: bruise\nC: police report\nD: punch\nE: cause pain",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes an incident where he was randomly punched, indicating the likelihood of physical injury.",
    "The most immediate and direct outcome of being punched is physical harm, which is often visible on the body.",
    "Out of the choices provided, options like \"pain for,\" \"police report,\" \"punch,\" and \"cause pain\" are either vague or directly not something one would find on their body.",
    "\"Bruise\" is a common physical result of being struck, particularly with a fist, and would likely appear on his body after the incident.",
    "Since the question asks what he found on his body and taking into account the nature of the incident (a punch), \"bruise\" fits perfectly as a tangible response.",
    "Regarding the other choices:\n- \"pain for\" does not make sense in the context of finding something on the body.\n- \"police report\" would not be found physically on the body.\n- \"punch\" describes the action rather than a result on the body.\n- \"cause pain\" again describes a consequence but is not a physical finding."
