  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the context of the question, which is about gambling and what usually happens to someone who engages in this activity.",
    "Gambling typically involves placing bets with the hope of winning money, but it's important to note that it can also lead to financial losses.",
    "One of the most common outcomes of gambling is that individuals may end up losing money, especially if they gamble frequently or in large amounts.",
    "While options like \"penury\" (A) and \"bankruptcy\" (B) are possible outcomes of extensive gambling, they are not universally applicable to all gamblers.",
    "\"Addiction\" (D) can also be a consequence of gambling but is not something that happens to everyone; many people can gamble without developing an addiction.",
    "\"Risky\" (E) describes the nature of gambling rather than an outcome. Gambling is inherently risky, but that does not specify what usually happens to an individual.",
    "Considering the choices, \"lose money\" (C) is the most direct and common result of gambling as it applies broadly to most gambling scenarios.",
    "We can conclude that while there are several potential consequences of gambling, losing money is a primary and expected outcome for most participants."
