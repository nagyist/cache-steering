  "query": "Question: Before we are able to run what do we need to know how to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: act quickly\nB: learn to walk\nC: stretches\nD: buy shoes\nE: go quickly",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what we need to know how to do before we can run, we should consider the physical skill development process.",
    "Typically, running is a more advanced form of locomotion compared to walking. Therefore, one usually learns to walk first before being able to run.",
    "Choices A (act quickly), C (stretches), D (buy shoes), and E (go quickly) do not necessarily reflect a prerequisite skill for running itself.",
    "Choice B (learn to walk) directly relates to mastering the basic movement required for running, as walking involves similar but less intense physical requirements.",
    "Confirming B is about acquiring the foundational skill necessary for more advanced movement such as running gives it a clear advantage among the options."
