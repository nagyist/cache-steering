  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that James constructed a playroom for his children and mentions that his place was small.",
    "Since the place is described as small, we are looking for a choice that indicates a separate space that is not too large.",
    "The choices provided include various types of facilities or spaces.",
    "\"Preschool\" (A) implies a structured educational environment for children, which doesn't align with the context of a personal playroom.",
    "\"Indoor games\" (B) refers to activities rather than a physical structure, making it an unsuitable answer.",
    "\"Nursery school\" (C) again refers to an educational setting, which is not the same as a personal playroom despite it being related to children\u2019s activities.",
    "\"Building\" (D) is a very general term and could refer to any type of construction, but it does not specifically indicate a children's space, making it ambiguous.",
    "\"Big house\" (E) suggests a large residential structure, but since the question indicates James's place was small, it's unlikely he would have a \"big house.\"",
    "Considering all options, the clue about the size of the place hints that the playroom needs to be a separate space that isn\u2019t overly large, aligning the best with the concept of a \"building\" which could be small and unattached."
