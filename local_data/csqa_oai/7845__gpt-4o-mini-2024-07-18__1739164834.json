  "steps": [
    "The question notes that he was eating too much cabbage and broccoli.",
    "Cabbage and broccoli are both cruciferous vegetables known to be high in fiber and certain compounds that can cause gastrointestinal issues.",
    "When consumed in large amounts, cruciferous vegetables often lead to the production of gas in the digestive tract due to their complex carbohydrates and fiber.",
    "While one might consider weight gain or obesity, the question focuses on the immediate consequence of consuming too much of these specific vegetables.",
    "Feeling full could be a temporary sensation after eating, but it isn\u2019t seen as a \u2018suffering\u2019 condition resulting from excessive consumption.",
    "An empty refrigerator is not a consequence related to the body from eating cabbage and broccoli.",
    "Given this reasoning, the most appropriate answer reflecting discomfort resulting from eating too much cabbage and broccoli is gas."
