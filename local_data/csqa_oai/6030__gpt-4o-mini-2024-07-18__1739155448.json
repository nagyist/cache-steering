  "steps": [
    "To answer the question about what houses require to be built on, we need to consider what is necessary for the structural integrity of a house.",
    "A house must have a solid base to support its weight and withstand various environmental factors. This base is commonly referred to as the foundation.",
    "A foundation is typically made of concrete, brick, or stone and is essential for distributing the weight of the house evenly across the ground.",
    "Options A, B, D, and E do not fit as necessary elements for building a house. A very large space is not specifically required, and pornography is irrelevant. Walls are built after the foundation, and a hole is not a structure for a house.",
    "Out of the available options, only \"foundation\" aligns with the requirements for a house to be built safely and securely."
