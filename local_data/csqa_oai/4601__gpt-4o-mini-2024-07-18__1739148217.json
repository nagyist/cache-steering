  "query": "Question: All the business owners had a monthly committee meeting, it was to introduce new tenants and discuss issues of the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: office building\nC: boardroom\nD: government\nE: city hall",
  "steps": [
    "The context involves business owners having a committee meeting, suggesting a focus on a shared environment or property.",
    "The purpose of the meeting is to introduce new tenants and discuss issues. This typically relates to the management or operation of a specific physical location where tenants would reside or operate their businesses.",
    "Analyzing the options: \nA: town - This is too broad and does not directly relate to the tenants.\nB: office building - This is a specific location, likely where tenants would be.\nC: boardroom - This refers to a specific place for meetings, not for new tenants.\nD: government - This is irrelevant to tenant discussions.\nE: city hall - Although a government building, it does not relate to tenants in the same way as an office or commercial property does.",
    "Between B (office building) and the remaining options, the office building is the most relevant since tenants are typically associated with such locations.",
    "Conclusively, the meeting focuses on tenant-related matters that would directly pertain to an office building rather than the broader options of town or government-related matters."
