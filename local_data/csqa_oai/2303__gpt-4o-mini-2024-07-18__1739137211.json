  "query": "Question: If a person spends a lot of time hitting the bottle, what might he have?\n\nChoices:\nA: passing out\nB: fist\nC: breaking\nD: ticket\nE: alcoholism",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"hitting the bottle\" typically refers to the act of consuming alcohol excessively.",
    "If a person is spending a lot of time doing this, it suggests a pattern of behavior that is related to alcohol consumption.",
    "\"Passing out\" (Choice A) can occur due to excessive drinking, but it's not indicative of a long-term condition.",
    "A \"fist\" (Choice B) does not relate to drinking habits and is irrelevant in this context.",
    "\"Breaking\" (Choice C) alone does not tie into the context of drinking alcohol excessively.",
    "A \"ticket\" (Choice D) implies a legal consequence, which, while possible, does not describe a condition stemming from heavy drinking.",
    "\"Alcoholism\" (Choice E) is a clinical term that reflects a chronic drinking problem, which aligns well with spending a lot of time consuming alcohol.",
    "Given that the question refers to a person spending excessive time drinking, it strongly suggests a potential condition, which is alcoholism.",
    "Among all the choices, alcoholism is the only option directly indicating a well-known consequence of drinking excessively over a period of time."
