  "query": "Question: What do all humans have on the side of their head?\n\nChoices:\nA: two feet\nB: two ears\nC: horns\nD: lay eggs\nE: one head",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what features are commonly found on the side of the human head.",
    "Humans have various structures on their heads, but we are focusing specifically on the side of the head.",
    "The most prominent structures on the side of the human head are the ears.",
    "We should eliminate options that are not found on the side of the human head.",
    "Option A: \"two feet\" are located at the lower extremities of the body, not the head, so this can be eliminated.",
    "Option C: \"horns\" are not a feature of human anatomy, so this also can be eliminated.",
    "Option D: \"lay eggs\" is a reproductive trait, not something physical found on the side of the head.",
    "This leaves us with option E: \"one head\" which is a general characteristic of human anatomy, but not specific to the side of the head.",
    "Upon reviewing, the correct answer that specifically applies to what all humans have on the side of their head is option B: \"two ears.\""
