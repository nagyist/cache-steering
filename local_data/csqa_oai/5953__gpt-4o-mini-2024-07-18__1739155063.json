  "query": "Question: The main part of turkey makes up what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: middle east\nC: balkan peninsula\nD: turkeycock\nE: asia minor",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the main part of Turkey as a geographical entity.",
    "I can identify that Turkey is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia.",
    "The term \"Asia Minor\" is often used to describe the western part of Asia that corresponds to much of modern-day Turkey.",
    "The options provided can be analyzed for relevance to Turkey's geography.",
    "Option A (ocean) does not represent a part of Turkey but rather is a body of water.",
    "Option B (middle east) refers to a region that includes Turkey but is broader than Turkey\u2019s specific geography.",
    "Option C (balkan peninsula) refers to a region that is partly in Southeastern Europe and does not encapsulate Turkey as a whole.",
    "Option D (turkeycock) is not relevant as it refers to a bird, not a geographical part of Turkey.",
    "Option E (asia minor) aligns with my prior research about Turkey being primarily located in this area.",
    "Therefore, the final answer must be \"E,\" as it represents the main part of Turkey geographically."
