  "query": "Question: Where is a traffic artery likely to be clogged?\n\nChoices:\nA: high traffic area\nB: major city\nC: town\nD: traffic lights\nE: highway",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what a traffic artery is: it typically refers to a major road used for heavy traffic flow.",
    "Evaluate the choices and identify locations with concentrated traffic flow.",
    "Choice A (high traffic area) describes locations that generally have heavy traffic.",
    "Choice B (major city) is also known for high volumes of vehicles due to population density and activity.",
    "Choice C (town) could also see traffic, but generally not to the scale of major cities or highways.",
    "Choice D (traffic lights) influence traffic flow but are not a specific location where a traffic artery exists.",
    "Choice E (highway) indicates a primary route for long-distance travel but may not always be considered an artery in urban areas.",
    "Among high traffic areas, major cities are particularly prone to congestion as they have a high density of commuting and business activity.",
    "Thus, if considering a singular location for likely congestion, major cities would consistently experience clogged traffic arteries due to their characteristics."
