  "steps": [
    "The question asks why the diamonds were difficult for the prospectors to find.",
    "We need to analyze the choices given: A (more expensive than sand), B (rare), C (pretty), D (clear), and E (dessert).",
    "Choice A: While it is true that diamonds are more expensive than sand, this does not explain why they are difficult to find. The value of something does not directly impact its visibility or availability.",
    "Choice B: Diamonds are considered rare in nature; therefore, their rarity would contribute to the difficulty in finding them. This makes sense because if something is rare, it is not easily found or encountered.",
    "Choice C: The beauty or aesthetics of diamonds being pretty does not relate to the challenge of locating them. This is subjective and does not influence their availability.",
    "Choice D: Diamonds can appear clear, which might mean they blend into certain environments. However, \"clear\" does not inherently indicate difficulty in locating diamonds since their clarity does not directly affect their rarity.",
    "Choice E: The term \"dessert\" is unrelated to the context of finding diamonds and does not apply to the prospectors' challenge at all.",
    "Given that rarity directly impacts the likelihood of finding diamonds, and none of the other options satisfactorily explain the difficulty in their discovery, choice B emerges as the most logical answer to the question."
