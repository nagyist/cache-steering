  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general characteristics of each location. A lake is a natural body of water, while a pond is typically smaller and also natural. An aquarium is a man-made environment for aquatic life, a playground is a recreational area for children, and stucco refers to a type of plaster used on walls.",
    "Next, assess the likelihood of finding a pebble that has been walked on in each location. Aquariums are controlled environments where pebbles may be present, but they are not where people typically walk. Similarly, stucco would not contain any pebbles in its structure.",
    "Now consider the lake. While it may have pebbles, they are often submerged and not easily walked on by people. Also, the shores might have pebbles people walk on, but consistently walked-on pebbles are less likely here.",
    "Next, look at the playground. Playgrounds often have gravel or pebbles as part of their surface material, which people walk on frequently, potentially leading to smoothened pebbles that fit the description of being \"walked on.\"",
    "Now return to the pond. Similar to lakes, ponds can have pebbles, but again, unless they are near the borders where people walk, they might not be as exposed to foot traffic.",
    "After reviewing these considerations, it becomes clear that the playground is the most viable option as it is a recreational space designed for running and playing where pebbles are likely to be walked upon."
