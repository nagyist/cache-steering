  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"since we aren't immortal,\" implying that mortality is a fundamental aspect of human existence.",
    "Given this context, one can infer that people's actions and thoughts should be aligned with the understanding of life's temporary nature.",
    "Among the given choices, we can analyze which option directly relates to the understanding that we will eventually die.",
    "Option A: \"expect to die\" directly correlates with the recognition of mortality, as it suggests a mindset that acknowledges the inevitability of death.",
    "Option B: \"pay bills\" does not directly relate to mortality, but rather to daily responsibilities.",
    "Option C: \"buy pets\" does not inherently connect to mortality; while pets do have limited lifespans, this is not the central message of acknowledging one's mortality.",
    "Option D: \"stay in\" does not provide a meaningful relationship to mortality; it can be seen as a neutral lifestyle choice.",
    "Option E: \"eat corn\" is unrelated to the concept of mortality and may reference diet rather than life expectancy.",
    "Based on the analysis, the choice that best aligns with the acknowledgment of mortality is option A: \"expect to die.\""
