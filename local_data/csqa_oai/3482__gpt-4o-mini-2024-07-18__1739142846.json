  "query": "Question: A man was called a weasel for \"ambulance chasing,\" where did he likely work?\n\nChoices:\nA: hollow log\nB: backyards\nC: golf course\nD: law office\nE: forrest",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"ambulance chasing\" is commonly associated with lawyers who seek out victims of accidents or legal troubles to offer their services.",
    "Given this understanding, the man referred to as a weasel for this behavior likely works in a profession where such practices might occur.",
    "The choices provided include physical locations or professions. Most of them do not directly correlate with the practice of ambulance chasing.",
    "Options such as \"hollow log,\" \"backyards,\" \"golf course,\" and \"forrest\" do not connect with the legal profession or ambulance chasing activities.",
    "The remaining option, \"law office,\" is a common workplace for lawyers, particularly those who might engage in ambulance chasing.",
    "Since we can rule out the other options based on their lack of relevance to the legal profession, the answer must be the one that relates to law.",
    "Therefore, it is clear that an ambulance chaser ideally operates from a place related to legal work, which strongly implies a law office."
