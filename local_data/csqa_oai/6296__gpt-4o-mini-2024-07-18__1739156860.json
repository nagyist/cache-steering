  "query": "Question: Where do cows graze?\n\nChoices:\nA: green field\nB: dry fields\nC: meat grinder\nD: red barn\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "Cows are herbivores, meaning they primarily eat grass and other plant material.",
    "Grazing typically occurs in environments where there is ample grass available for the cows to consume.",
    "A green field is typically rich in grass and is the most suitable environment for cows to graze.",
    "Dry fields may not provide sufficient grass, making them less ideal for grazing cows.",
    "A meat grinder is not relevant as it is not a location where cows can graze; it's a machine for processing meat.",
    "A red barn is a structure that may house cows, but it is not a place where they would graze.",
    "The countryside often contains green fields and open spaces where cows can graze freely.",
    "While both \"green field\" and \"countryside\" can be associated with where cows graze, a green field is more specific.",
    "To determine the best answer, I compare the specific ideal grazing conditions of a green field with the broader environment of the countryside.",
    "Ultimately, the choice that best describes the typical location where cows graze is a green field."
