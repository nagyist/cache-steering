  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about what a single grain of sand can cause in relation to a precious stone.",
    "A grain of sand can enter a clam, which may lead to the formation of a pearl, a precious material.",
    "The other options do not relate directly to the formation of a precious stone: \"itchy,\" \"eye,\" and \"bathing suit\" do not connect to the context of precious stones.",
    "The option \"beach\" refers to where sand can be found but does not relate to causing a precious stone.",
    "Reviewing the options again, the process of a grain of sand leading to a precious stone aligns best with \"clam.\"",
    "Since clams can create pearls when a grain of sand irritates them, this connects directly with the concept of a precious stone."
