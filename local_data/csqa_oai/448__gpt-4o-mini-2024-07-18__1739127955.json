  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a characteristic or description of love in the context where \"everyone keeps feeling it\". This suggests a widespread emotion that many people experience.",
    "Among the choices, I should consider which of them fits this notion of a collective and persistent experience of love. Terms related to universality or commonality might be more fitting.",
    "\"Contagious\" (Choice A) implies that love spreads from person to person, similar to an infection, which aligns with the idea that everyone is feeling it.",
    "\"Wrong\" (Choice B) seems out of place as it doesn't describe love positively or reflect a common experience. Instead, it conveys a judgment.",
    "\"Last forever\" (Choice C) suggests permanence in love, but it does not directly address the idea of it being felt by everyone at the same time; it's more about duration than universality.",
    "\u201cPainful\u201d (Choice D) implies a negative aspect of love, which may be true for some people, but it doesn't universally apply to everyone's experience of love.",
    "\u201cBlind\u201d (Choice E) refers to the idea that love can overlook faults or shortcomings, which is a well-known phrase, but does not reflect the phenomenon of everyone feeling it.",
    "Considering the definition of \"contagious,\" it is a suitable description when love is felt widely and could confirm its infective nature emotionally among people. Hence, it aligns with the key phrase in the question.",
    "Evaluating against the rest of the choices: \"contagious\" captures both the universality and the phenomenon of love being pervasive; it's a fitting answer compared to the others."
