  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what it means to hit a ball with a stick. This typically involves a controlled environment where such a play is common.",
    "Next, we need to consider the choices provided and see where hitting balls with a stick is a normal action.",
    "A child's hand is not a target for hitting a ball; this would be dangerous and inappropriate.",
    "A pool table is specifically designed for playing billiards or pool, which involves hitting balls using a cue stick. This matches the concept of hitting a ball with a stick into other balls.",
    "A street generally does not involve playing with balls and sticks in a safe manner, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "A toy box is where toys are stored, and while it may contain balls, this doesn\u2019t relate to hitting them with a stick.",
    "A soccer field does involve balls, but typically players use their feet rather than sticks to play.",
    "Now, we can narrow down our choices. The pool table clearly meets the criteria for hitting balls with a stick.",
    "I will confirm that no other option fits the criteria as precisely as the pool table does."
