  "query": "Question: After running twenty six miles, what physical feeling is nearly every person likely to feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: excruciating pain\nB: bloody legs\nC: exhaustion\nD: death\nE: passing out",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens to the human body after running a long distance, such as twenty-six miles, which is equivalent to a marathon.",
    "Next, recognize that running such a distance without adequate training or conditioning typically leads to significant fatigue and depletion of energy reserves.",
    "Additionally, during prolonged physical exertion, the body accumulates lactic acid, which contributes to muscle fatigue and discomfort.",
    "Reflect on the common terminology used to describe the feelings associated with extreme physical activity, particularly in endurance events like marathons.",
    "Evaluate each option in light of the body's typical response to completing an intense physical challenge:\n- A: Excruciating pain can occur, but it is not universally experienced by all runners.\n- B: Bloody legs are not a common outcome unless the individual has suffered severe injuries or abrasions.\n- C: Exhaustion is a normal and expected response for nearly everyone after such an extreme exertion.\n- D: Death is an extreme and thankfully rare outcome; most people do not die after running such a distance.\n- E: Passing out is also possible but not the standard experience for most individuals who are generally fit.",
    "Since exhaustion is a common feeling shared by virtually all runners after completing a marathon, it stands out as the most likely option.",
    "Finally, confirm that exhaustion encompasses a wide range of feelings that can include fatigue, tiredness, and a desire to rest, making it the most appropriate answer."
