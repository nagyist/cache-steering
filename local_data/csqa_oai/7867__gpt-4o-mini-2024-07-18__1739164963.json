  "query": "Question: People went out drinking and threw bottles in the grass.  For that reason, there was a lot of broken glass where?\n\nChoices:\nA: beach\nB: trash\nC: street\nD: field\nE: recycling bin",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that people went out drinking and threw bottles in the grass, which implies they were outdoors.",
    "Considering the option \"beach,\" it's plausible that bottles could be thrown out at a beach, but it specifically states \"in the grass,\" which might imply a more terrestrial location.",
    "The option \"trash\" refers to a disposal method rather than a location where broken glass would accumulate, so it's unlikely to be the answer.",
    "The option \"street\" suggests a paved area, generally not associated with grass. Thus, it's less likely broken glass would be there.",
    "The option \"field\" suggests an open area with grass, which aligns perfectly with the description of throwing bottles in the grass.",
    "The last option \"recycling bin\" indicates a specific disposal unit for recycling; it would not contain broken glass resulting from irresponsible disposal behavior.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most logical answer is \"field\" as it directly aligns with the context of broken glass ending up \"in the grass.\""
