  "steps": [
    "When a person is confronted with something unexpected, their initial emotional response typically involves a reaction to the sudden change or surprise.",
    "This reaction can often manifest as shock or surprise, which is a common way for individuals to respond to unforeseen events.",
    "Anxiety is another potential response, but it tends to arise more in situations that are perceived as threatening or stressful rather than simply unexpected.",
    "Dedication generally implies a commitment to a task or goal, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate response to the unexpected.",
    "Solutions can be a follow-up to an unexpected situation, but they don't capture the immediate emotional response that occurs at first.",
    "Acknowledgment also refers to recognizing or accepting something; while this can happen after the surprise, it isn't the immediate response either.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting emotional response to being confronted with something unexpected is being surprised, as it most directly correlates to an initial reaction."
