  "query": "Question: Sally isn't beautiful.  She looks okay, just plain. But she doesn't think so. She has image issues and thinks that she's what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ugly\nB: overweight\nC: bad\nD: average\nE: hideous",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sally believes she has image issues, which implies that she has a negative perception of herself.",
    "The phrasing \"isn't beautiful\" and \"just plain\" suggests that she does not see herself as attractive by conventional standards.",
    "\"Sally thinks that she's ugly\" would fit the sentiment of self-image issues better than options like \"overweight,\" \"bad,\" \"average,\" or \"hideous.\"",
    "The word \"ugly\" usually connotes a strong negative self-assessment regarding physical appearance, which aligns with her having image issues.",
    "\"Average\" (option D) sounds too neutral compared to the strong negative sentiments implied by the rest of the narrative.",
    "The terms \"overweight,\" and \"hideous\" may imply specific concerns that are not explicitly stated in the passage.",
    "Considering the strong language found in option A (\"ugly\") versus other options, it seems the most fitting conclusion based on her self-image struggles.",
    "Since she thinks negatively about her looks and the other options do not strongly align with her feelings of possible beauty perception, we lean toward the choice that reflects the strongest negative opinion she might hold."
