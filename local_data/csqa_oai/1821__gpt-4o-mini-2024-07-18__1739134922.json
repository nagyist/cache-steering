  "steps": [
    "The phrase mentions multiple rooms including bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom. This indicates a significant amount of space.",
    "A building could potentially have many rooms, but it\u2019s too vague as it doesn\u2019t specify the type of building.",
    "A nursery school usually doesn\u2019t have bedrooms and is more oriented towards children in a structured environment.",
    "A preschool also caters to young children but doesn't imply having multiple different types of rooms such as an office or any bedrooms.",
    "The mention of many bedrooms indicates a home, and the presence of an office and a study further suggests a residential setting rather than a commercial space.",
    "A big house is a fitting description as it indicates a residence that can accommodate many rooms and spaces.",
    "A small house would not be suitable in this context since it does not align with the idea of having multiple specified rooms.",
    "After analyzing all options, a big house (option D) is logically consistent with the context provided, whereas the other options do not fit well."
