  "query": "Question: You might find a dirt highway out where?\n\nChoices:\nA: atlas\nB: repairs\nC: countryside\nD: in the city\nE: united states",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where dirt highways are typically found. They are often associated with rural or less developed areas rather than urban regions.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices. \"Atlas\" (A) references a book of maps and does not pertain to physical locations.",
    "Then, \"repairs\" (B) does not denote a location either, making it an unlikely option for where to find a dirt highway.",
    "Next, consider \"in the city\" (D). Cities are usually developed with paved roads, making it very rare to find a dirt highway there.",
    "The next choice is \"united states\" (E). Although dirt highways can exist in the U.S., this is still a broad geographic term rather than specifying suitable locations.",
    "\"Countryside\" (C) refers to rural areas, which are the most likely locations for dirt highways as they lack the infrastructure of urban settings.",
    "Comparing all options, the countryside is the most suitable answer for where you might typically encounter a dirt highway."
