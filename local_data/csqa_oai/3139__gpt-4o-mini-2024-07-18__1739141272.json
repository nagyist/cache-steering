  "query": "Question: What kind of object would you need to see something dirty underground?\n\nChoices:\nA: bed\nB: ground\nC: bright\nD: clean\nE: sportsmanlike",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what it means to see something underground and what conditions would allow for that.",
    "The question suggests that the object that helps in seeing something underground must provide illumination or a clear view.",
    "I will evaluate the choices based on their relevance to illuminating or clarifying what is underground.",
    "Choice A, \"bed,\" does not relate to seeing underground at all; it is a piece of furniture and does not provide illumination.",
    "Choice B, \"ground,\" is the surface above the underground; it does not help in seeing what is below.",
    "Choice C, \"bright,\" indicates a level of illumination which is necessary to see anything clearly, especially things that might be underground.",
    "Choice D, \"clean,\" suggests a condition but does not pertain to visibility or illumination.",
    "Choice E, \"sportsmanlike,\" is unrelated to the act of seeing or illuminating underground.",
    "After analyzing all options, \"bright\" is the only choice that directly relates to improving visibility to see something underground."
