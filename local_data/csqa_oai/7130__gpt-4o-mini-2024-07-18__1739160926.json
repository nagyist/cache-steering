    "The question suggests that paying attention to the lecture has a purpose or result associated with it.",
    "We need to assess the meaning of each answer choice in relation to paying attention to a lecture.",
    "Choice A: \"know\" - This implies gaining knowledge, which could be a result of attending a lecture.",
    "Choice B: \"of interest to\" - This phrase indicates something may catch one's attention, but it doesn't relate to what one should do as a result of paying attention.",
    "Choice C: \"learn from\" - This means to absorb or gain knowledge through the experience of the lecture, aligning directly with the purpose of paying attention.",
    "Choice D: \"was interesting\" - This is a statement about the lecture itself and does not indicate what one should do.",
