  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that she is trying to show her grandma how to use a smartphone to find the restaurant's information.",
    "The grandma prefers not to use modern technology (the smartphone) for finding information.",
    "Given that this scenario involves finding a restaurant's information, traditional methods of doing so would likely be considered.",
    "The \"yellow pages\" is a well-known traditional method for finding contact information for businesses, including restaurants.",
    "The other options (New York, business sector, Canada, and big city) do not represent traditional methods of looking up restaurant information.",
    "Therefore, the only option that logically fits the scenario of overcoming modern methods with an older traditional approach is the yellow pages.",
    "This leads me to conclude that she prefers using the yellow pages over a smartphone."
