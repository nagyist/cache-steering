  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a roadside location where someone can relax on a couch.",
    "A \"waiting room\" could often be found at places like hospitals or bus stations, but it is not typically associated with roadsides.",
    "A \"neighbor's house\" implies a personal residence, which would be off the road but not a typical roadside location.",
    "An \"apartment\" is also not a roadside location; it's a type of residence usually found in urban areas or buildings.",
    "The term \"exit\" refers to a point on the highway where one can leave the road but does not specify a location for relaxation.",
    "A \"rest area\" is specifically designed for travelers to stop, take a break, and relax. It often includes amenities such as benches, picnic areas, and sometimes couches or seating areas.",
    "Given these points, the only option that meets the criteria of being a roadside location where one can get off the road and relax on a couch is the \"rest area.\"",
    "Thus, I confirm that the best answer is option C."
