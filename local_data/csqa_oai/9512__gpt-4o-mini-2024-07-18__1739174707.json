  "steps": [
    "The phrase mentions running twenty-six miles, which implies significant physical exertion. Exercise is a likely candidate for the cause of any physical change felt afterwards.",
    "The phrase also emphasizes feeling like he had lost weight, which typically relates to how the body reacts to strenuous activities, especially in terms of sweating.",
    "When running long distances, the body loses fluids primarily through sweat. Hence, the sensation of losing weight could relate to the amount of sweat lost during the run.",
    "Options A (exercise) and B (sweat) both appear relevant, but the way the statement is framed suggests a more acute experience of loss, which aligns closely with the act of sweating.",
    "The other options (C: pass out, D: collapse, E: drink water) do not directly relate to the sensation of weight loss from the physical activity described.",
    "This brings the focus back to the idea of sweating being a common and immediate reaction during prolonged exercise, culminating in the perception of weight loss.",
    "Thus, the experience of him feeling as if he lost twenty-six pounds correlates most directly with the fluid lost, primarily through sweat."
