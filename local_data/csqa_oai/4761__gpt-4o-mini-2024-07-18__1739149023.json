  "query": "Question: What do all people have except sociopaths?\n\nChoices:\nA: cheeks\nB: parents\nC: common sense\nD: muscles\nE: feelings",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify what characteristic is generally shared by most people but is absent in sociopaths.",
    "Sociopathy is often associated with a lack of empathy and emotional understanding, which suggests that feelings might be a key factor.",
    "I will evaluate the choices to see which one relates to feelings or emotional understanding.",
    "Choice A, \"cheeks,\" is a physical attribute that everyone generally has, including sociopaths.",
    "Choice B, \"parents,\" can be subjective; not everyone has living parents, but it doesn't specifically relate to sociopathy.",
    "Choice C, \"common sense,\" is often a broader cognitive ability and can be present in both sociopaths and non-sociopaths.",
    "Choice D, \"muscles,\" is again a physical attribute and does not relate to the emotional aspect of sociopathy.",
    "Choice E, \"feelings,\" aligns perfectly with the known traits of sociopaths as they typically are said to lack genuine feelings.",
    "Feelings are crucial for emotional connection and empathy, which sociopaths are recognized to lack.",
    "Thus, the answer that fits the criteria of what people have that sociopaths do not is \"feelings.\""
