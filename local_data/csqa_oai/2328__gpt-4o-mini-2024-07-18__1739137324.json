  "query": "Question: If want to drink something politely, what vessel should I use?\n\nChoices:\nA: use glass\nB: open mouth\nC: eat first\nD: buy alcohol\nE: coffee mug",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which vessel is considered polite for drinking, I need to evaluate the choices based on social norms and etiquette.",
    "Choice A suggests using a glass. Glasses are commonly used for drinks in formal and informal settings, and using one is generally considered polite.",
    "Choice B suggests using an open mouth. This is not a vessel at all and would be seen as an impolite or crude way to consume beverages.",
    "Choice C suggests eating first. While eating could be a part of a dining experience, it does not specify a vessel for drinking and therefore does not fit the question.",
    "Choice D suggests buying alcohol. This does not specify a vessel either and only pertains to the type of beverage, which does not answer the question of politeness regarding the vessel.",
    "Choice E suggests using a coffee mug. While it is a vessel that can be used to drink, it is specific to coffee or hot beverages and may not be suitable in all social settings.",
    "Comparing options, A (glass) is widely accepted and used across many settings, while options B (open mouth), C (eat first), D (buy alcohol), and E (coffee mug) either don't answer the question directly or are less universally applicable in terms of politeness.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer is the choice that specifies a universally acceptable drinking vessel used in polite society."
