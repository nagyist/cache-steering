  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the context of the sentence, which focuses on the buffalo and their population status.",
    "The sentence mentions that the buffalo were big and easy to spot, indicating a once abundant population.",
    "The key part of the sentence is that the buffalo were hunted \"to the point that their numbers were...\" which implies a significant decrease in their population due to hunting.",
    "In evaluating the choices, we are looking for a word that conveys a reduction in their population.",
    "Choice A: \"thin\" does not seem appropriate in this context, as it typically refers to a lack of thickness rather than a population metric.",
    "Choice B: \"stomach\" is irrelevant in this context, as it does not relate to population numbers at all.",
    "Choice C: \"clear\" does not fit well here; it does not effectively describe the status of buffalo population.",
    "Choice D: \"sparse\" suggests that the buffalo population is thinly spread out or less dense, which fits our context of being hunted and decreasing in numbers.",
    "Choice E: \"thickskin\" is not relevant, as it references a physical characteristic and does not relate to their population status.",
    "After evaluating all the options, choice D (\"sparse\") is the most fitting word to describe the reduced numbers of buffalo due to hunting."
