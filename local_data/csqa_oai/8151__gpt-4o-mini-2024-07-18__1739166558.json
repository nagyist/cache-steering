    "First, consider what it means to be \"in nature.\" Typically, this refers to being in an outdoor environment that includes plants, trees, and open spaces rather than urban structures.",
    "Next, look at the provided choices to determine which locations typically offer access to natural environments.",
    "Option A, the movie theatre, is an indoor venue designed for watching films and does not provide any natural surroundings.",
    "Option B, the university, mainly features academic buildings and may have some green areas but is primarily an educational institution not specifically focused on nature.",
    "Option C, the park, usually includes green spaces, trees, and recreational areas, making it a common place for people to enjoy nature within a city.",
    "Option D, Alaska, is a state with vast natural landscapes but is not a specific location within a city.",
