  "query": "Question: James loves judging things, but all he has to go on is his own what?\n\nChoices:\nA: misperception\nB: jury\nC: knowing yourself\nD: ignorance\nE: experience",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James loves judging things, which implies he has a tendency to evaluate or form opinions about various subjects.",
    "The phrase \"all he has to go on\" suggests that James relies on something personal or internal for his judgments, rather than external evidence or information.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, I need to find an option that reflects a personal basis for judgment.",
    "Choice A, \"misperception,\" suggests a misunderstanding, which does not directly imply a basis for judging positively or negatively.",
    "Choice B, \"jury,\" does not apply here since it refers to a group of people who make legal judgments rather than something personal.",
    "Choice C, \"knowing yourself,\" could imply a basis of self-awareness but does not strongly signify a basis for judging external subjects.",
    "Choice D, \"ignorance,\" indicates a lack of knowledge, which would typically impair judgment rather than serve as a basis.",
    "Choice E, \"experience,\" suggests that James's judgments are based on his own life interactions and knowledge gained over time, making it a strong contender.",
    "Considering all the choices, the most logical conclusion is that James\u2019s judgments are based on his personal experiences in life."
