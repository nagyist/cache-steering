    "The question asks for a means of communication used when friends are not physically together.",
    "Option A, \"phone,\" refers to a device that allows for verbal communication, either through calls or messaging.",
    "Option B, \"computer,\" can also be used for various forms of communication, such as emails, video calls, or messaging apps.",
    "Option C, \"having friends,\" does not represent a tool or method for communication, rather it refers to the relationship itself.",
    "Option D, \"smoke,\" does not have any relevance to communication between friends.",
    "Option E, \"printer,\" is a device that produces physical documents and is not used for chatting.",
    "Both options A and B are legitimate tools for chatting with friends remotely. However, both are devices rather than methods.",
    "Considering both devices, one can chat via phone or computer, so additional context may be needed.",
    "In a broad sense, both a phone and a computer facilitate communication with friends who are not present, since both can be used for chatting.",
