  "query": "Question: A person notices popcorn, cotton candy on the grass, where is he likely?\n\nChoices:\nA: soccer game\nB: fairgrounds\nC: movie theatre\nD: countryside\nE: state park",
  "steps": [
    "The presence of popcorn and cotton candy suggests a location where food vendors are commonly found.",
    "A soccer game typically does not have vendors selling popcorn and cotton candy; it is more focused on sports concessions such as hot dogs and nachos.",
    "A movie theatre usually sells popcorn, but cotton candy is not a standard offering and is unlikely to be found on the grass outside a theatre.",
    "The countryside is generally a natural area and wouldn\u2019t typically have popcorn or cotton candy on grass either.",
    "A state park can have picnics but is not commonly associated with vendors that would sell popcorn and cotton candy.",
    "Fairgrounds, on the other hand, are known for carnival-type foods, including popcorn and cotton candy, and often have grassy areas where these items can be found.",
    "Given these considerations, the most plausible location where all the elements (popcorn, cotton candy, and grass) align is a fairground.",
    "Thus, based on the food offerings and typical settings, the correct choice aligns best with option B, which represents fairgrounds."
