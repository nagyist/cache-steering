  "query": "Question: What is something that probably has a lot of testosterone and way too much alcohol?\n\nChoices:\nA: beer\nB: wine\nC: restaurant\nD: fraternity house\nE: pub",
  "steps": [
    "To tackle the question, we need to identify what typically has high levels of testosterone and excessive alcohol consumption associated with it.",
    "Testosterone is often associated with characteristics like aggression, competitiveness, and masculinity.",
    "Examining the choices, a fraternity house might be a setting where young men often consume large quantities of alcohol and adhere to stereotypical masculine behaviors.",
    "Next, I consider if beer, wine, or a pub could be viewed similarly. While they are associated with high alcohol consumption, they may not specifically relate to testosterone in the same way a fraternity house does.",
    "A restaurant usually has a more diverse crowd and typically does not evoke the same associations with high testosterone, making it less likely to meet both criteria.",
    "Comparing fraternity house and pub, a pub is generally a social establishment, but it isn't as closely tied to youth and male bonding as a fraternity house.",
    "So, I conclude that a fraternity house would likely represent a context that embodies both high levels of testosterone due to the typical demographic and social activities, along with elevated alcohol consumption."
