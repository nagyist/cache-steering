  "query": "Question: If I am tilting a drink toward my face, what should I do before the liquid spills over?\n\nChoices:\nA: close eyes\nB: use glass\nC: buy bottle\nD: eat first\nE: open mouth",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the action of tilting a drink toward my face. The primary intention of tilting is usually to bring the drink closer to my mouth for consumption.",
    "Next, assess the potential risk of tilting the drink too far, which may cause the liquid to spill over before I can drink it properly.",
    "Now, think about what to do when tilting the drink to avoid spilling. One logical action is to ensure that my mouth is open, allowing the liquid to flow directly into my mouth instead of spilling.",
    "Analyzing the options provided:\n- A: closing the eyes does not prevent spilling and may hinder awareness of the drink's positioning.\n- B: using a glass is not directly relevant to the act of tilting toward my face as it assumes the liquid is already in a usable container.\n- C: buying a bottle does not help in the immediate situation of spilling.\n- D: eating first is unrelated to the current action of drinking.\n- E: opening the mouth would allow the liquid to flow directly in and prevent spillage.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most relevant and practical action to take before the drink spills is to open my mouth."
