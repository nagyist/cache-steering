  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to find the freshest tomatoes?\n\nChoices:\nA: pizza\nB: squashed\nC: refrigerator\nD: market\nE: on pizza",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context of the question, which asks about the location of the freshest tomatoes.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option provided to see where one might typically find fresh tomatoes.",
    "Considering option A, \"pizza,\" tomatoes are used in pizzas, but they are typically cooked or processed, which would not yield fresh tomatoes.",
    "Moving to option B, \"squashed,\" this suggests tomatoes that are damaged and would not be fresh.",
    "In option C, \"refrigerator,\" while tomatoes can be stored here, they are often kept there after being purchased, not where they are initially found.",
    "Now examining option D, \"market,\" fresh tomatoes are typically sold at markets, especially farmers' markets or grocery stores, where they are often fresh from the farm.",
    "Lastly, option E, \"on pizza,\" is similar to option A, as it refers to cooked tomatoes rather than fresh ones.",
    "After evaluating all options, the market is clearly the best answer for finding fresh tomatoes."
