  "steps": [
    "The context suggests that the former wrestler is contributing to a space where wrestling takes place.",
    "A bathroom is not a location associated with wrestling, so option A can be eliminated.",
    "A public area could potentially host wrestling events, but it is more general and less specific than other options.",
    "A school, on the other hand, is a common place for wrestling programs and activities, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A living room is unlikely to be a location for a wrestling mat, so option D can be eliminated.",
    "A house is too vague and does not specifically link to wrestling activities, so option E can be eliminated as well.",
    "Given the associations with wrestling, the most logical and pertinent choice is a school due to its facilities for such sports.",
    "Thus, the answer must be option C, as this aligns with the common practice of donating sports equipment to schools."
