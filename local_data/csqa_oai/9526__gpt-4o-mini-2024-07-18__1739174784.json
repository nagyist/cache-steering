  "query": "Question: John wants to eat at an Indian restaurant in on top of the space needle, where would he have to go?\n\nChoices:\nA: reservation\nB: curry\nC: britsh town\nD: seattle\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand where the Space Needle is located. The Space Needle is a famous observation tower in Seattle, Washington.",
    "Next, I need to determine which option among the choices would be relevant to Indian restaurants specifically located at or near the Space Needle.",
    "Looking at the choices, option D, \"seattle\", directly refers to the city where the Space Needle is located, making it the most relevant answer.",
    "Options A (\"reservation\") and B (\"curry\") do not specify a location; they relate to aspects of dining but not the actual place to go.",
    "Option C (\"britsh town\") is not related to Indian restaurants or the Space Needle. It's irrelevant in this context.",
    "Option E (\"large city\") is too vague and does not specify Seattle directly, even though Seattle is indeed a large city.",
    "Since John wants to go to an Indian restaurant at the Space Needle, he needs to go to Seattle where the Space Needle is located."
