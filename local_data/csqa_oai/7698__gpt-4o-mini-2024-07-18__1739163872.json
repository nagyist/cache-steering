  "query": "Question: Applying for job after job is part of the grind, but when no calls come back it can lead to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: hope\nB: stress\nC: happiness\nD: frustration\nE: working hard",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to the experience of applying for multiple jobs without receiving any callbacks. This situation often carries emotional consequences.",
    "When someone puts in a lot of effort and does not receive positive feedback, it can create feelings of disappointment.",
    "Disappointment from not hearing back can often lead to heightened emotional responses, particularly negative ones.",
    "Hope (Choice A) might initially be present, but consistently not receiving callbacks can diminish that feeling over time.",
    "Stress (Choice B) can arise from the pressure of job hunting and the uncertainty of employment; however, it may not fully encapsulate the specific situation described.",
    "Happiness (Choice C) seems highly unlikely in this context, as the lack of response is usually more discouraging than uplifting.",
    "While working hard (Choice E) is definitely a part of the job application process, it doesn't directly address the emotional consequences of not receiving callbacks.",
    "Frustration (Choice D) is a direct result of repeated efforts without acknowledgment or success, aligning well with the context of the question.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, frustration best captures the emotional response linked with the scenario of applying for jobs without receiving any callbacks."
