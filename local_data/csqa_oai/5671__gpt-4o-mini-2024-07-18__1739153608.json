  "query": "Question: The game had all sorts of spaces, like chance and what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sure thing\nB: skill\nC: for sure\nD: community chest\nE: bingo",
  "steps": [
    "First, I recall the context of board games, specifically games like Monopoly that contain special spaces with specific functions.",
    "I remember that \"chance\" is indeed a type of space found in such board games, which typically involve drawing cards that can alter the game in various ways.",
    "I think about what other similar spaces exist within these games that are commonly paired with \"chance.\"",
    "One prominent type of space in games like Monopoly is \u201ccommunity chest,\u201d which is another space where players can draw cards.",
    "I consider the options provided and see if any match with \"community chest\" for similarities with \"chance.\"",
    "Looking at the choices, I see A (sure thing), B (skill), C (for sure), D (community chest), and E (bingo).",
    "Out of these, \"community chest\" (D) is the only one that is a recognized game space alongside \"chance.\"",
    "All the other options do not represent spaces commonly found in board games like Monopoly.",
    "Thus, the logical conclusion is that the phrase \"like chance and what\" refers to \"chance and community chest.\""
