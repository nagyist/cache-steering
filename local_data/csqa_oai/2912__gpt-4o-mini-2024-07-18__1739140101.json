  "query": "Question: Helium, magnesium, and sulfur are likely to be found where in a school?\n\nChoices:\nA: chemistry lab\nB: atmosphere\nC: air\nD: supply closet\nE: laboratory",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the elements mentioned: Helium (He), Magnesium (Mg), and Sulfur (S).",
    "Consider the properties and common uses of Helium: it is a noble gas, often used in balloons and can be found in the atmosphere.",
    "Next, consider Magnesium: it is a metal commonly found in laboratory settings for various experiments, and it also has applications in biology and chemistry.",
    "Now consider Sulfur: it is an essential element in chemistry and is commonly used in various experiments, particularly in chemistry labs.",
    "Analyze the context of the question: since the question pertains to a school setting, the focus is likely on where these elements would commonly be found or used.",
    "Reflect on the provided choices: \n- A: chemistry lab \u2013 this would likely be a place where these elements could be used for experiments.\n- B: atmosphere \u2013 Helium is found in the atmosphere, but Magnesium and Sulfur are not prevalent there.\n- C: air \u2013 similar reasoning as the atmosphere; mainly Helium is present, not the others.\n- D: supply closet \u2013 this is less likely to contain these specific elements in a school context.\n- E: laboratory \u2013 could refer to a broader area, similar to a chemistry lab.",
    "Focus on the strongest candidates based on the typical school context: a chemistry lab or a laboratory setting is where the experiments involving Magnesium and Sulfur would take place, and Helium could also be used for experiments.",
    "Decide between \"chemistry lab\" and \"laboratory\": a chemistry lab is more specific and likely includes experiments directly related to these three elements.",
    "Consider the possibility that Helium could also be in the atmosphere or air, but the question specifies a school context which emphasizes usage in labs.",
    "Conclude that a chemistry lab would encompass the studies and uses of Helium, Magnesium, and Sulfur together more effectively than the other options provided."
