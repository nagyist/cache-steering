  "query": "Question: Where is known for powerful storms from the ocean?\n\nChoices:\nA: rain\nB: weather report\nC: tropics\nD: summer\nE: america",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where powerful storms from the ocean occur, I will consider different geographic areas known for such phenomena.",
    "I recall that the term 'tropics' refers to regions near the equator, where warm ocean temperatures can lead to the formation of hurricanes and typhoons.",
    "The 'tropics' are specifically known for tropical storms and cyclones, which are some of the most powerful storms generated by warm ocean water.",
    "I will evaluate the other choices: \n- \"rain\" is a phenomenon but does not specify a geographic area known for powerful storms.\n- \"weather report\" refers to information about weather conditions, not a location.\n- \"summer\" is a season and does not identify a place known for storms.\n- \"america\" could refer to areas like the southeastern United States which experience hurricanes, but it is too broad.",
    "Considering all of the points, I determine that the term 'tropics' specifically includes areas known for strong storms due to oceanic factors.",
    "Upon double-checking, the tropics indeed is the best answer because it is the most recognized region for hurricanes and similar storms compared to the other options."
