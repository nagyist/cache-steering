  "query": "Question: What would you normally expect a cat to say?\n\nChoices:\nA: see king\nB: hello\nC: meow\nD: drink water\nE: live many years",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking what we would normally expect a cat to say. Therefore, I need to consider sounds typically associated with cats.",
    "Cats are known for making a distinct vocalization that humans often recognize. This sound is commonly referred to as \"meowing.\"",
    "Looking at the provided answer choices, I need to determine which options relate directly to what a cat would commonly say.",
    "Among the options, \"meow\" (C) is directly related to the sound a cat makes.",
    "Other choices like \"see king,\" \"hello,\" \"drink water,\" and \"live many years\" do not pertain to sounds made by cats.",
    "\"See king\" appears to be an incorrect phrase altogether, and \"hello\" is not a sound cats make; it sounds like a human greeting.",
    "\"Drink water\" and \"live many years\" are actions or statements about behaviors and life expectancy, which do not relate to vocalization.",
    "Thus, the only choice that makes sense as an expected vocalization from a cat is \"meow.\""

  "solution": "C"
