    "Identify the goal of the question: Humans who want a sweet snack can opt for a healthier alternative instead of candy.",
    "Consider the nature of the options provided: The alternatives should ideally satisfy a sweet craving but also be healthier than candy.",
    "Examine each option in relation to satisfying a sweet craving:\n- A (compete with each other): This does not satisfy a sweet craving.\n- B (eat fruit): Fruits naturally contain sugars and are much healthier than candy, making them a suitable substitute.\n- C (lay eggs): This is biologically incorrect for humans and does not relate to the question's context.\n- D (eat burgers): While satisfying, burgers are not sweet and do not serve as a substitute for a sweet snack.\n- E (draw pictures): This activity is not related to eating or satisfying a craving for something sweet.",
