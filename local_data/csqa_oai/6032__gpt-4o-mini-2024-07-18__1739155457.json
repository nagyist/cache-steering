  "query": "Question: The laughable senator tried to blame video games and use television, but those things don't make somebody what?\n\nChoices:\nA: first turn on power\nB: buy one first\nC: plug in\nD: kill\nE: switch on",
  "steps": [
    "The question presents a context in which a senator is attempting to assign blame for undesirable behavior to video games and television.",
    "The phrase \"but those things don't make somebody\" implies that the answer should describe something that cannot be caused or influenced by video games or television.",
    "We need to analyze the options to find something that is not a result of playing video games or watching television.",
    "Option A (\"first turn on power\") and option E (\"switch on\") both relate to actions that can be associated with operating devices but are not directly relevant to behavioral influences.",
    "Option B (\"buy one first\") also refers to a purchase decision and doesn't relate to behavior changes.",
    "Option C (\"plug in\") again refers to operating devices rather than a person's actions or behavior.",
    "Option D (\"kill\") is a significant behavioral action, and it\u2019s more likely to be influenced by real-life factors rather than television or video games according to common arguments against media influence.",
    "Given the context of blaming video games and television, the implication leans toward behaviors that are serious and not simply influenced by media content.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer aligned with the idea that media doesn\u2019t determine someone doing something extreme like killing is option D."
