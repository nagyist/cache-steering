  "query": "Question: What do teachers encourage a child to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: fight\nB: become adult\nC: play video games\nD: wave goodbye\nE: ask many questions",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the role of teachers in a child's development. Teachers typically aim to promote positive behavior and healthy learning habits.",
    "Next, I review each choice in the context of what teachers would actively encourage in a classroom or educational setting.",
    "Choice A (fight) is generally discouraged by teachers as it promotes aggression and conflict rather than cooperation and learning.",
    "Choice B (become adult) is vague; while teachers guide children towards maturity, they do not explicitly encourage them to rush into adulthood.",
    "Choice C (play video games) can be a form of entertainment, but teachers typically would not prioritize video games over other educational activities.",
    "Choice D (wave goodbye) is a polite action but lacks educational value and is unlikely to be a primary focus for teachers.",
    "Choice E (ask many questions) promotes curiosity and critical thinking, which are fundamental aspects of learning and encouraged by educators.",
    "After analyzing the choices, I find that option E aligns best with the role of teachers in fostering an inquisitive mindset in children."
