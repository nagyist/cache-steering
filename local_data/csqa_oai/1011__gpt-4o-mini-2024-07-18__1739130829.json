  "query": "Question: What emotion does committing murder induce?\n\nChoices:\nA: fear\nB: go to jail\nC: problems\nD: cruel\nE: dead",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the emotion induced by committing murder, which implies we're looking for a feeling that someone might experience after such an act.",
    "Choices A (fear), C (problems), and D (cruel) could potentially relate to emotions or consequences of committing murder.",
    "Choice B (go to jail) refers to a consequence of the act, rather than an emotion, so we can eliminate it from consideration.",
    "Choice E (dead) also does not refer to an emotion, it indicates a state resulting from murder, so this choice is also not relevant.",
    "Considering choice A (fear), one might feel fear of the consequences or fear of being caught after committing murder.",
    "Choice C (problems) could suggest that committing murder leads to many issues, but it does not directly describe an emotion.",
    "Reflecting on the immediate emotions associated with such a violent act, fear appears more relevant compared to the more abstract notion of problems.",
    "Since committing murder often results in severe emotional turmoil, such as fear of repercussions, it stands out as the most appropriate choice.",
    "Therefore, the emotion most directly linked to the act of committing murder is fear."
