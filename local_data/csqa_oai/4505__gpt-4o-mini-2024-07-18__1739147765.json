  "query": "Question: Where is a person doing housework likely to work?\n\nChoices:\nA: house guest\nB: nice home\nC: boredom\nD: become tired\nE: low pay",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what is meant by \"housework.\" Housework refers to chores or tasks that are done within a household to maintain cleanliness and order.",
    "Next, we consider the context in which housework is typically performed. It usually takes place in a residence or an establishment where people live.",
    "Looking at the choices provided: \n- Choice A (house guest) does not seem relevant to a person doing housework, as house guests do not necessarily perform housework.\n- Choice B (nice home) suggests a location where housework could be taking place.\n- Choice C (boredom) is a potential feeling during housework but not a place of work.\n- Choice D (become tired) describes a possible outcome of performing housework but is not a location either.\n- Choice E (low pay) might describe a type of job, but it does not specify a location for where housework is done.",
    "Given that housework inherently takes place at a person's home or a \"nice home,\" it is logical to conclude that choice B is the most appropriate location.",
    "To finalize, verifying if \"nice home\" can be the best answer, it is indeed correct because housework is about maintaining the environment of that home."
