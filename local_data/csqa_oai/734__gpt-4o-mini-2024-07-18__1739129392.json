  "query": "Question: What is a fast but expensive way to send small cargo?\n\nChoices:\nA: airplane\nB: ship's hold\nC: boat\nD: truck\nE: train",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to consider what each mode of transportation offers in terms of speed and cost.",
    "Airplanes are known for their speed and are frequently used for transporting small cargos quickly, but they are also among the most expensive options.",
    "Ships can carry a large volume of cargo and are generally slower than airplanes, especially for small cargos, making them less suitable for fast delivery.",
    "Boats can vary in speed and cost, but generally they are not used for fast small cargo delivery in comparison to airplanes.",
    "Trucks can provide relatively fast delivery, especially over land, but they are generally not as expensive as airplanes for small cargo.",
    "Trains can carry large amounts of cargo efficiently over land but are again not as fast as airplanes and can be expensive depending on the service used.",
    "Comparing all options, the airplane stands out as the fastest means for sending small cargo, despite its high cost, above the others which are more suited to either slower transport or lower costs.",
    "Given the question specifically asks for a fast but expensive option, the airplane is the most fitting choice."
