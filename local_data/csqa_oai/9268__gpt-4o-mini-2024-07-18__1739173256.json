  "query": "Question: What would someone be if he or she is not normal?\n\nChoices:\nA: unconventional\nB: orthodox\nC: ill\nD: reverse\nE: tangential",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine the meaning of \"not normal\" in a general context. \"Normal\" typically refers to being typical or standard, so we are looking for a word that conveys deviation from the norm.",
    "Next, let's analyze each of the answer choices in relation to the term \"not normal\":\n- A: unconventional - This suggests something that does not conform to established customs or practices, aligning with \"not normal.\"\n- B: orthodox - This term means adhering to accepted norms or standards, which is not aligned with \"not normal.\"\n- C: ill - This typically refers to being sick or unwell but does not directly imply a deviation from normality in a broad sense.\n- D: reverse - This implies a turning back or opposite direction but doesn\u2019t specifically relate to normality.\n- E: tangential - This word pertains to something that is only slightly connected or related to the main topic, not directly implying a deviation from normal.",
    "From the analysis, \"unconventional\" stands out as the most fitting word to describe someone who is \"not normal\" since it emphasizes a departure from societal standards.",
    "The other options either imply conformity (orthodox), a specific condition (ill), directional change (reverse), or minimal relevance (tangential).",
    "Therefore, based on this reasoning, the best choice to describe someone who is not normal is \"unconventional.\""
