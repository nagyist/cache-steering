  "query": "Question: He could never remember the last line of the what he was set to perform?\n\nChoices:\nA: transportation system\nB: stanza\nC: park\nD: add information on spreadsheet\nE: electromagnetic spectrum",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of the question. The phrase \"the last line of the what he was set to perform\" suggests that the answer is likely related to a performance, such as a poem, song, or script.",
    "Next, I examine the choices provided. Option A, \"transportation system,\" does not relate to any form of performance and seems irrelevant.",
    "I then consider option B, \"stanza.\" A stanza is a grouped set of lines in poetry, often with a specific rhythm or pattern. It fits the context of a performance because it is something people can recite or perform.",
    "Next, I analyze option C, \"park.\" This does not connect to the concept of a performance. It seems unrelated to a line or stanza.",
    "I review option D, \"add information on spreadsheet.\" This option clearly pertains to data management and is unrelated to any performance context.",
    "Then, I look at option E, \"electromagnetic spectrum.\" This is a scientific term that pertains to physics and does not relate to performances or lines of text.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, the only option that relates to a performance and involves something that can have a \"last line\" is \"stanza.\"",
    "Finally, I confirm that \"the last line\" in a poetic context fits perfectly with the term \"stanza.\""
