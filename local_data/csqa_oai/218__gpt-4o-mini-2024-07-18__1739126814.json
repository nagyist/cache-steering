  "query": "Question: Where would you sit in a chair to watch four-legged animals complete?\n\nChoices:\nA: bookstore\nB: house\nC: race track\nD: friend's house\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the best place to watch four-legged animals compete, I first consider common settings where such events take place.",
    "Four-legged animals competing could refer to various events, such as horse races, dog shows, or other racing competitions involving animals.",
    "Among the provided choices, a race track is a notable venue specifically designed for racing events, particularly those involving horses or dogs, which fits the description of four-legged animals.",
    "A bookstore primarily involves reading and does not align with watching competitions, so option A is irrelevant.",
    "A house or a friend's house (options B and D) would generally not be intended for watching animal competitions, as these are private living spaces.",
    "The term \"building\" (option E) is too vague and does not specify a venue suitable for racing or competitions.",
    "Comparing all the options, the race track stands out as the most suitable venue for watching four-legged animals compete.",
    "Since no other option matches the context of the question regarding watching competitions involving four-legged animals, I confirm race track as the answer."
