  "query": "Question: Major Tom wanted to preserve the weapons. As dangerous as they were, he felt that they could have what in the future?\n\nChoices:\nA: use\nB: street\nC: ruin\nD: rot\nE: waste",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Major Tom wanted to preserve the weapons, indicating he believes they hold some value for the future despite their dangers.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided. Each option implies a potential future scenario for the weapons.",
    "Choice A: \"use\" suggests the weapons could be used in some capacity, which aligns with the idea of preservation for future application.",
    "Choice B: \"street\" doesn\u2019t seem to relate to the context of weapons and preservation, so this option can likely be ruled out.",
    "Choice C: \"ruin\" indicates a negative outcome, but it's not clear how preserving weapons would lead to ruin. This option seems less fitting.",
    "Choice D: \"rot\" suggests deterioration, which again doesn\u2019t align with the act of preservation. Weapons that are preserved are not allowed to rot.",
    "Choice E: \"waste\" implies a loss of potential or value, contradicting the notion that Major Tom wants to preserve them for future importance.",
    "Based on the analysis, choice A (\"use\") appears to be the most compatible response as it reflects the idea that preserved weapons could still serve a purpose in the future."
