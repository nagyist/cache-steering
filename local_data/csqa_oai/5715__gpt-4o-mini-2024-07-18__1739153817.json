  "query": "Question: He left camp following the river down below, his partnered remained where?\n\nChoices:\nA: upstairs\nB: inside\nC: over\nD: upstream\nE: above",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that \"he left camp following the river down below,\" indicating that he is moving in the direction of the river, which flows downstream.",
    "The word \"partened\" refers to the person who stayed behind when \"he\" left camp.",
    "To understand where his partner remained, we need to consider the opposite direction of where he is going.",
    "Since \"he\" is going downstream along the river, his partner must be staying in an upstream location, as \"upstream\" means moving against the current of the river.",
    "The answer choices provide various directions: \"upstream\" (D), \"upstairs\" (A), \"inside\" (B), \"over\" (C), and \"above\" (E).",
    "Among these, \"upstream\" (D) directly correlates with the idea of remaining in the opposite direction of the river's flow compared to \"down below.\"",
    "The other options such as \"upstairs,\" \"inside,\" \"over,\" and \"above\" do not match the context of river navigation or geographical directions in relation to downstream movement.",
    "Thus, the most logical and contextually accurate answer is that his partner remained upstream."
