  "query": "Question: Playing poker takes a lot of luck, but being consistent takes what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ante\nB: happiness\nC: skill\nD: losing money\nE: attention",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that while playing poker requires some luck, consistency is the focus here. We need to analyze what consistency in poker would fundamentally require.",
    "Poker is a game that combines both chance and strategy. While luck plays a role in the short term, successful players rely on consistent strategies over time to win consistently.",
    "Potential answers include aspects of strategy and mental acuity. The concept of 'skill' stands out as it implies proficiency in making decisions that yield favorable outcomes over time.",
    "Options like 'ante', 'happiness', 'losing money', and 'attention' do not directly correlate with the idea of long-term success or consistency in poker.",
    "'Ante' refers to the initial bet made by players in a game and does not address the question regarding consistency.",
    "'Happiness' is an emotional state and is not relevant to the skill needed for playing poker consistently.",
    "' Losing money' implies failure rather than consistency and successful play.",
    "'Attention' is important in poker, but it is more about the process of observing and making decisions rather than a measure of consistent success in the game.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that consistency in poker fundamentally relies on 'skill'. This allows players to apply strategy effectively regardless of the luck involved."
