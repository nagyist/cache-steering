  "steps": [
    "A mammoth is an extinct species of elephant that lived in the Pleistocene epoch.",
    "Mammoths are typically associated with cold, northern environments and were often found in areas that are now more temperate due to their adaptations to Ice Age conditions.",
    "To find a mammoth, one would typically look for fossils or preserved remains, which are often uncovered during archaeological or paleontological excavations.",
    "Excavations specifically focus on discovering ancient biological remains, including those of mammoths, which have been found in various permafrost regions and archaeological sites.",
    "While some places like South Dakota may have specific sites where mammoth fossils have been found, the term \"excavations\" refers more broadly to the process of looking for and studying such remains.",
    "The choice \"D: ancient times\" refers to a period and not a physical location where remains can be currently found.",
    "\"Encyclopedia\" (choice B) would contain information about mammoths but is not a place to find actual mammoth remains.",
    "Lastly, while \"Egypt\" (choice A) is a notable archaeological location, it is not related to mammoth remains, which are more closely linked to colder regions.",
    "Given the options, \"C: excavations\" stands out as the most relevant answer related to the activity of finding mammoth remains."
