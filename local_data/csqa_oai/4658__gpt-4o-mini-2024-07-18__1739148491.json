  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes citizens taking complaints about the disrepair of the roadway. The context indicates they are likely addressing a governing body or authority responsible for road maintenance.",
    "Option A, \"neighborhood,\" seems unlikely since a neighborhood typically doesn't have the authority to address significant roadway issues.",
    "Option D, \"subdivision,\" is also not appropriate as subdivisions refer to smaller housing areas and lack the administrative role needed for road maintenance complaints.",
    "Option E, \"countryside,\" is a geographical term but does not specify any governing authority that would handle the complaints.",
    "Now considering option B, \"city,\" it aligns well because city governments typically manage public infrastructure and would be the appropriate authority for citizens to approach regarding disrepair.",
    "Option C, \"governor,\" could also potentially be correct as governors may oversee state infrastructure, but citizens usually address issues locally before escalating to state officials.",
    "Thus, while option C is a possibility, it is less immediate than option B, which is the local city government.",
    "After evaluating all options, option B stands out as the most direct and logical choice for where the complaints about road disrepair would be directed."
