  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the context in which a dictionary was important for teachers and students before the advent of computers and cellphones.",
    "Dictionaries are primarily used to look up the meanings of words, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and other language-related information.",
    "Considering the function of dictionaries, the phrase \"important tool\" suggests that they were utilized to aid in language comprehension and vocabulary acquisition, particularly in educational settings.",
    "Now let's analyze the choices:\n- A: manual - This doesn't specifically relate to the educational context of using a dictionary.\n- B: shelf - While dictionaries could be placed on a shelf, it does not convey the role they played in education.\n- C: explain meaning of words - This is an accurate description of a dictionary\u2019s primary function, but it does not specify in what context it\u2019s important.\n- D: table - Similar to \"shelf,\" this does not pertain to the actual use or importance of the dictionary in an educational setting.\n- E: classroom - This indicates the physical and educational environment where teachers and students would frequently use dictionaries.",
    "Among the options, both C and E relate to the importance of dictionaries; however, C focuses on the dictionary's function, while E relates specifically to the setting where it is frequently used.",
    "Since we are looking for the context of the dictionary's importance for teachers and students, E: classroom is the best choice because it captures the environment in which dictionaries were considered an important tool."
