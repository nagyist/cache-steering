  "query": "Question: What sort of organization do employees usually work for?\n\nChoices:\nA: a business\nB: meeting\nC: corporation\nD: company\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what sort of organization employees usually work for, we need to consider definitions and typical environments where employees are employed.",
    "A \"business\" refers to an entity engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities. It usually has employees but can also operate with self-employed individuals.",
    "A \"corporation\" is a specific type of business structure recognized by law as a separate entity from its owners. Employees can work for corporations, but not all businesses are corporations.",
    "A \"company\" is a broad term that generally refers to a business organization. It encompasses both corporations and partnerships and typically employs people.",
    "An \"office\" typically refers to the physical space where professional work happens. While it is common for employees to work in an office, an office itself is not an organization.",
    "A \"meeting\" is a gathering of individuals for discussion or decision-making. Employees participate in meetings, but a meeting is not an organization.",
    "Since \"corporation\" is a type of company but not the only type of company, it may not be the best choice as a broad answer.",
    "Both \"business\" and \"company\" are valid general terms for an organization where employees work, but \"company\" may imply a more formalized structure than just \"business.\"",
    "All companies and corporations are businesses, but not all businesses are companies or corporations. Therefore, \"business\" is more inclusive but less specific.",
    "Ultimately, the most suitable answer seems to revolve around the broad applications of the term \"company,\" as it is frequently used in reference to organizations where employees typically work."
