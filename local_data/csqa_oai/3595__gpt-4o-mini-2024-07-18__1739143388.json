  "query": "Question: Punishing innocent people with the death penalty should cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: public outrage\nB: get angry\nC: going to jail\nD: feel guilty\nE: hatred",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the consequences of punishing innocent people with the death penalty. It suggests a failure of the justice system and the ethical implications of executing someone who is not guilty.",
    "Next, such an event is likely to provoke strong emotional responses from the general public, especially among those who believe in justice and the sanctity of human life.",
    "Considering the options provided, the most direct and immediate reaction would likely be public outrage, as this represents a collective disapproval of an unjust act.",
    "Looking at the other options: while getting angry (Choice B) is a potential reaction, it is not as encompassing as public outrage which involves a broader reaction from society.",
    "Going to jail (Choice C) does not apply here as we are discussing the outrage from the public rather than the consequences for the people involved in the execution.",
    "Feeling guilty (Choice D) might apply to individuals in the system who enacted the death penalty, but it doesn't address the collective response of society.",
    "Hatred (Choice E) could be a response to the system or those responsible, but it is generally a more extreme and specific reaction compared to public outrage, which is more inclusive and reflects a broader sentiment.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting response that encapsulates the reaction of society to such an injustice is public outrage, as it signifies a strong collective emotional response."
