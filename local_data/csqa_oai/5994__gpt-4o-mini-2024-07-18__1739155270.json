  "query": "Question: John can't find any legal alternatives to what he's looking for.  It's very illegal, exacerbated by the fact that he's too young to travel out of the country to get it.  Where will he have to get it from?\n\nChoices:\nA: rules\nB: white market\nC: banned\nD: underage\nE: black market",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify that John is searching for something illegal, which suggests he is looking for an item or service that is not permitted or forbidden by law.",
    "Next, I note that legal alternatives are not available to John, which further emphasizes that he is in need of something that is not allowed by law.",
    "It is important to observe that John is too young to travel out of the country, suggesting that he has limited options geographically and legally.",
    "Given that he cannot find a legal way to obtain what he is looking for, I am led to consider that he might be looking for an illegal source to fulfill his needs.",
    "Among the options provided, I can eliminate the choices of \u201crules\u201d (A), which are guidelines rather than sources; \u201cwhite market\u201d (B), which refers to legal commerce; \"banned\" (C), which describes the status of an item but doesn't imply a source; and \"underage\" (D), which relates to his age constraints but doesn't describe the source of what he\u2019s looking for.",
    "That leaves \u201cblack market\u201d (E), which is commonly understood to be a source for illegal goods and services that operate outside of the legal system.",
    "Therefore, considering all the factors from illegality, lack of legal options, and John's inability to travel, the most logical conclusion is that he would have to turn to the black market to obtain what he\u2019s looking for."
