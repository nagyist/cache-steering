  "steps": [
    "To determine where Bob would go to buy pills, I need to consider what locations are typically associated with the purchase of medication.",
    "Pharmacies are the most common places for purchasing pills and other medications, as they are specifically designed for this purpose.",
    "I should evaluate the other options. A \"jar\" does not sell pills and is likely a container for storage.",
    "A \"hospital\" is primarily a place for treatment rather than a retail location for buying regular medication.",
    "A \"medicine bottle\" is also a container for medication and cannot be a place where one would go to buy pills.",
    "A \"medicine cabinet\" refers to a storage area in a home and not a location for purchasing medication.",
    "Given that the other options do not represent a location for buying pills, the pharmacy remains the only suitable choice."
