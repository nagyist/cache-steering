  "query": "Question: You need to take your morning pill. Where in your house would you look for it?\n\nChoices:\nA: medicine cabinet\nB: storage\nC: medicine bottle\nD: old ladies purse\nE: pharmacy",
  "steps": [
    "The task is to find a morning pill, which implies that it should be stored in a location where medication is typically kept.",
    "I will consider the most logical places in a house where medications are likely to be stored.",
    "Option A is \"medicine cabinet,\" which is a common place for storing pills and medications in many homes.",
    "Option B is \"storage,\" but this is too vague; storage could refer to any area and is less specific for medication.",
    "Option C is \"medicine bottle,\" which refers to the container that holds the pill rather than a place where it is stored.",
    "Option D is \"old ladies purse,\" which is quite an unusual location for keeping a morning pill unless that specific person habitually carries their medications in a purse, but it is less common.",
    "Option E is \"pharmacy,\" which, while related to where medications are obtained, is not a place in your house.",
    "After analyzing all options, the most reasonable and commonly used location for finding a morning pill in one's house is the medicine cabinet."
