  "query": "Question: She usually didn't like Adam Sandler, so she found it surprising that she found his latest movie what?\n\nChoices:\nA: startled\nB: important\nC: funny\nD: shocked\nE: laughter",
  "steps": [
    "We start by noting her usual dislike for Adam Sandler, which sets a baseline expectation that she would not enjoy his movies.",
    "The question states that she found his latest movie surprising, which suggests that her experience with this movie was unexpected compared to her usual feelings.",
    "Let's analyze the choices in relation to her previous feelings:\n- Choice A: \"startled\" suggests an unexpected physical reaction, which isn\u2019t typically how one describes movie reactions.\n- Choice B: \"important\" doesn't align with common movie reviews or personal reactions unless specifically discussing themes, which is less likely.\n- Choice C: \"funny\" directly relates to her emotional response to a comedy movie and contrasts with her typical dislike.\n- Choice D: \"shocked\" again suggests a strong emotional response, though similar to \"startled\" in that it does not typically apply to a movie experience.\n- Choice E: \"laughter\" could relate to her reaction but is more of a result than an adjective describing her reaction.",
    "Given that she was surprised by her reaction and considering that Adam Sandler is a comedian, it is reasonable to conclude that finding the movie \"funny\" would be both surprising and fitting for a comedy.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice that aligns with her surprising experience is that she found the movie \"funny.\""
