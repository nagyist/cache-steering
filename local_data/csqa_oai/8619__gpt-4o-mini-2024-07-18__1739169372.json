  "query": "Question: Billy  found that his toilet was overflowing.  Water was splashing onto  the floor and making a huge mess.  He got a mop and tried to clean it up.  Where might the toilet be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: house\nC: bedroom\nD: motel room\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, the situation involves a toilet overflowing, which typically occurs in a location that is designed for plumbing and sanitation purposes.",
    "Second, a common location for a toilet is a bathroom, which is specifically equipped for such facilities.",
    "Third, while toilets can technically exist in other places, such as a motel room or house, a bedroom is not a usual or designated location for a toilet.",
    "Fourth, Billy is using a mop to clean up the mess. Bathrooms usually have mops or cleaning supplies nearby due to the nature of spills and clean-ups.",
    "Fifth, the choices include apartment, house, motel room, and bathroom. Both apartment and house could contain a bathroom, but motel room may also have a bathroom.",
    "Sixth, the essential factor is that the clear association of toilets is primarily with bathrooms rather than other spaces like bedrooms or general living areas.",
    "Seventh, while all other options could technically be relevant, they do not primarily point to where a toilet would be found.",
    "Eighth, focusing on bathrooms leads to a logical conclusion as the most likely place for a toilet, especially in relation to an overflowing scenario.",
    "Ninth, after considering the context and typical household layout, the bathroom stands out since it is the location most directly associated with toilets and plumbing issues.",
    "Tenth, reaffirming that other locations do not logically fit the scenario as clearly as the bathroom does, leads me to the final conclusion."
