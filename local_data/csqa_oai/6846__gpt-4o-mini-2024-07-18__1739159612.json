  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question: \"What might a friend throw a party for another friend?\" This implies we are looking for a reason or occasion that justifies throwing a party.",
    "Next, let's examine the choices given to see which might fit the context of throwing a party.",
    "Choice A: \"keep secret\" - This does not provide a reason for throwing a party; keeping a secret implies confidentiality, not celebration.",
    "Choice B: \"write letter\" - Similar to choice A, this does not relate to a reason for a party. Writing a letter is more of an action than a celebratory occasion.",
    "Choice C: \"steady\" - This word does not denote a specific occasion or reason that would typically warrant throwing a party.",
    "Choice D: \"rely on\" - This also does not provide a clear reason for a celebratory event; it suggests dependence rather than celebration.",
    "Choice E: \"coming home\" - This option suggests a significant event where a friend returns home, which is commonly celebrated with a party.",
    "Having analyzed all the choices, option E clearly stands out as it suggests a genuine occasion to celebrate with a party."
