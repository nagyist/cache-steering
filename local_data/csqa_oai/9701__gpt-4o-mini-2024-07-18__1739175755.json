  "query": "Question: Jane was going to the party.  She didn't care about making friends or gorging on alcohol, she just wanted to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: plan\nB: meet new people\nC: work\nD: have fun\nE: getting drunk",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine Jane's main motivation for going to the party based on the information given.",
    "The statement mentions that Jane \"didn't care about making friends or gorging on alcohol,\" which indicates she is not interested in socializing or drinking excessively.",
    "By ruling out choices B (meet new people) and E (getting drunk), I can focus on the remaining options: A (plan), C (work), and D (have fun).",
    "The phrase \"just wanted to do what\" suggests a more casual and enjoyable motivation rather than a structured task like planning or working.",
    "Since Jane's motivations are not aligned with either planning or working, I can further narrow down the choices to D (have fun) as a reasonable conclusion.",
    "I will double-check that choice D fits well with the context of the statement of looking for a simple enjoyment rather than deep interaction or substance use.",
    "In this social situation, deriving joy from the party atmosphere without needing to network or drink seems to best resonate with just wanting to \"have fun.\""
