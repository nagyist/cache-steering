  "query": "Question: Where can a student find their pens?\n\nChoices:\nA: art class\nB: backpack\nC: school\nD: office\nE: take notes",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where students typically keep their pens. A common item that students use regularly is a pen.",
    "Next, I consider the choices provided. Options like \"art class\" and \"office\" might not be the most accurate as they are specific locations rather than general storage places.",
    "The option \"backpack\" is likely as students often carry their pens in their backpacks along with other school supplies.",
    "While \"school\" encompasses all educational activities, it does not specify a location where pens are stored. It is too broad to be a correct answer.",
    "The option \"take notes\" refers to an action rather than a place and therefore cannot be correct.",
    "I conclude that \"backpack\" is the best choice because it is a common place for students to keep their writing instruments, including pens."
