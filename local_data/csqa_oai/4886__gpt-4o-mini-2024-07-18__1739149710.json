  "query": "Question: Where is a boat always supposed to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: lake\nB: harbor\nC: sailing\nD: water\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider where a boat is commonly used. Boats are designed to operate on liquid surfaces.",
    "Next, I look at the provided choices. The options range from specific locations like \"lake\" and \"ocean\" to more general terms like \"water\" and \"sailing.\"",
    "I analyze \"lake\" (A) and \"ocean\" (E). While a boat can be in either body of water, they are not the only places where a boat might be found.",
    "Then I evaluate \"harbor\" (B). A harbor is indeed a place where boats can dock, but it\u2019s not a universal requirement for all boats.",
    "The term \"sailing\" (C) represents an activity rather than a location where a boat should always be.",
    "Now I focus on \"water\" (D). Boats are inherently designed to be on water, which makes this choice essential and universally applicable.",
    "I reconsider the context of the question: \"Where is a boat always supposed to be?\" This suggests a fundamental characteristic of boats.",
    "Given that all boats must be on the water to function properly, \"water\" is indeed the most appropriate and universal answer.",
    "I again check if any other options could fit better than \"water.\" However, based on my analysis, no option better describes the essential requirement for a boat than being on water."
