  "query": "Question: Where can you find a revolving door at a location you spend the night?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york\nB: apartment\nC: hotel lobby\nD: public place\nE: bank",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a revolving door is and where such structures are commonly found. Revolving doors are typically used in places with high foot traffic to manage entry and exit efficiently while maintaining the internal climate.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices based on where one might spend the night. This involves thinking of locations where overnight stays are permitted and might also feature revolving doors.",
    "Looking at option A, New York is a city, not a specific place. While many buildings in New York may have revolving doors, it does not directly answer the question.",
    "Option B, apartment, typically does not have revolving doors. They usually feature standard entrances.",
    "Option C, hotel lobby, is a strong candidate as hotels often utilize revolving doors to enhance curb appeal and manage guest traffic.",
    "Next, consider option D, public place. This is too vague. While many public places might have revolving doors, this does not specifically address a location for spending the night.",
    "Finally, examine option E, bank. Banks sometimes feature revolving doors; however, they aren\u2019t places where people generally spend the night.",
    "After analyzing each option, it becomes clear that a hotel lobby (option C) is the most suitable answer because it fits both the criteria of having a revolving door and being a location where one can spend the night."
