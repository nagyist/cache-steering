  "query": "Question: What is the opposite of hands?\n\nChoices:\nA: toes\nB: body part\nC: legs\nD: feet\nE: foot",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the opposite of \"hands,\" I need to consider the function or characteristic of hands.",
    "Hands are often associated with grasping, holding, and manipulation. They are often paired with feet in terms of limbs.",
    "Now, I will look at the provided choices to find something that contrasts or complements hands.",
    "Choice A: \"toes\" are associated with feet and serve different functions than hands, but they are not the main counterpart.",
    "Choice B: \"body part\" is too broad and does not provide a specific opposite or counterpart.",
    "Choice C: \"legs\" are different from hands in function and are also limbs, but not a direct counterpart.",
    "Choice D: \"feet\" are the closest opposite to \"hands,\" as they are specifically the counterpart limbs that serve a different purpose.",
    "Choice E: \"foot\" refers to a singular entity and also relates more closely to \"feet\" as a whole.",
    "Thus, since \"feet\" directly engage in activities that are opposite in function to \"hands,\" such as standing and walking instead of grasping and handling, it is the best choice."
