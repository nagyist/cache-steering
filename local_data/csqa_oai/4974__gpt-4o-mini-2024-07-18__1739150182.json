  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"staying healthy\" means, which generally involves maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being.",
    "Next, I will consider each option given and how it relates to maintaining health.",
    "Option A: \"live long\" - Living a long life does not inherently prevent someone from being healthy; in fact, it can be seen as a result of good health.",
    "Option B: \"sadness\" - Chronic sadness or depression can negatively affect mental health and overall well-being, potentially leading to unhealthy behaviors or physical conditions.",
    "Option C: \"injury\" - Sustaining an injury can directly impact physical health and limit capability, thus affecting overall fitness and health.",
    "Option D: \"long life\" - Similar to option A, living a long life is not a negative factor for health and can suggest longevity due to good health practices.",
    "Option E: \"happiness\" - Happiness is generally associated with positive health outcomes and can improve both mental and physical well-being.",
    "Now, I need to determine which of the options could realistically contribute to someone not staying healthy.",
    "Among all options, both \"sadness\" and \"injury\" stand out as factors that could actively prevent someone from staying healthy, but being injured has a more direct and often physical effect on health.",
    "Considering that the question asks for something that could stop someone from staying healthy, the most definitive answer among the choices is \"injury.\""
