  "query": "Question: Where would you put a writing instrument if you are a woman and want to bring it with you?\n\nChoices:\nA: stationery store\nB: ball stopped\nC: pocket\nD: purse\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which involves a woman wanting to bring a writing instrument with her.",
    "Consider typical places where a woman might keep items when going out. Common options include pockets, bags, or purses.",
    "The option \"stationery store\" is not valid because it implies a location rather than a method of carrying a writing instrument.",
    "The term \"ball stopped\" does not make sense in this context; it does not refer to a place or method of carrying.",
    "The \"classroom\" option again is not a place for carrying but an environment where writing instruments may be used.",
    "Pockets are a possible option for carrying small items, but they may not be spacious enough for some writing instruments.",
    "A purse is typically carried by women and serves as a suitable place to store various items, including writing instruments.",
    "Therefore, considering practicality and common usage, a purse is the best option for carrying a writing instrument."
