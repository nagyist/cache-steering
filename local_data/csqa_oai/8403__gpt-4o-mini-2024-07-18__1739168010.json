  "query": "Question: The cars were all fully loaded, and had spacious whats?\n\nChoices:\nA: bumpers\nB: windows\nC: seat belts\nD: trunks\nE: heavy",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of the sentence which mentions \"cars\" that are \"fully loaded\" and \"spacious.\" This indicates a need to look for a term that relates to something inside the car or something that holds capacity.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided: bumpers, windows, seat belts, trunks, and heavy. I note that \"bumpers\" and \"windows\" are features of the car but do not relate to loading or spacious capacity.",
    "I then focus on \"seat belts\" and \"trunks.\" While seat belts are essential for safety, they do not contribute to the concept of 'fully loaded' or spaciousness.",
    "Now, I evaluate \"trunks,\" which are specifically designed to hold items. A trunk being spacious aligns with the idea of the car being fully loaded as it would have space for more cargo.",
    "I consider the last option, \"heavy.\" This does not fit with the context as it does not imply spaciousness nor does it relate to being fully loaded in the same way as a trunk does.",
    "After eliminating the irrelevant options, \"trunks\" stands out as the only sensible choice that conveys the idea of a fully loaded car with adequate space for storage.",
    "I re-evaluate the definitions: trunks are storage compartments of cars where additional items can be placed, making them crucial for maximizing capacity\u2014thus matching the notion of being \u201cfully loaded.\u201d",
    "None of the other options provide a viable reasoning path that relates closely to \"spacious\" or \"fully loaded,\" confirming the choice of \"trunks\" as the final answer."
