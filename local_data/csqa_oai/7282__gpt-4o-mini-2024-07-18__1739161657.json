    "The question implies that if one is not staying, they would need to store or pack their belongings for travel.",
    "Out of the listed options, some suggest temporary storage, while others suggest a more permanent storage solution.",
    "A \"drawer\" and a \"dresser\" typically indicate a more permanent storage location, which doesn't align with the notion of not staying.",
    "A \"closet\" also suggests a permanent storage situation similar to a drawer or dresser and is not suitable for someone who is packing to leave.",
    "The \"floor\" indicates a less organized option, but it doesn't imply storage or packing.",
    "A \"suitcase\" is specifically designed for travel and packing items, making it the most suitable option for someone who is not staying.",
    "Thus, among the remaining options, the suitcase clearly stands out as the best place to keep a shirt if the person is leaving."
