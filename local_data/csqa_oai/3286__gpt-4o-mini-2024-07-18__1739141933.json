  "query": "Question: What does hitting the side of a horse cause?\n\nChoices:\nA: movement\nB: fear\nC: stiffness\nD: running\nE: bouncing",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to consider what happens when a horse is hit or tapped on its side.",
    "Hitting a horse can cause it to respond in various ways, depending on the intensity and context of the action.",
    "One common response to being hit on the side is movement; horses may react by moving away from the stimulus.",
    "However, it's also important to consider the psychological effects; hitting a horse may incite fear or anxiety if the horse perceives it as a threat.",
    "I need to evaluate the options given: \n- Movement (A) makes sense, as horses often move away when startled.\n- Fear (B) could also be a response; a horse may become fearful from being hit.\n- Stiffness (C) does not seem directly correlated with being hit\u2014stiffness is typically related to pain or muscle issues rather than immediate reactions.\n- Running (D) might occur, but it is more of an extreme response, where the horse may bolt instead of just moving.\n- Bouncing (E) doesn't apply to a horse in this situation as horses do not bounce in the conventional sense.",
    "Based on this evaluation, I feel that the most direct and likely immediate effects of hitting the side of a horse are either movement or fear.",
    "Considering that movement is a typical reflex response to physical stimulus, I will select movement as the most straightforward answer."
