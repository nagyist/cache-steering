  "query": "Question: Where would I buy beer if I ran out?\n\nChoices:\nA: casino\nB: fridge\nC: bottle\nD: grocery store\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the question which asks where to buy beer if you ran out. This indicates looking for a retail location rather than a storage location.",
    "Next, evaluate each of the choices. \"Casino\" (A) may sell beer, but it's not a primary place to buy beer if you specifically ran out at home.",
    "\"Fridge\" (B) refers to a storage appliance and not a place where beer can be purchased.",
    "\"Bottle\" (C) does not represent a location; rather, it is a type of container.",
    "\"Grocery store\" (D) is a regular retail outlet where beer is typically sold. This is a primary candidate.",
    "\"Refrigerator\" (E) is similar to \"fridge\" in that it refers to an appliance for storage, not a purchasing location.",
    "Assessing the options, the only logical location to buy beer when running out is the grocery store, as it is designed to sell consumables including alcoholic beverages.",
    "Confirm that no other option fits the criteria of a purchase location for beer."
