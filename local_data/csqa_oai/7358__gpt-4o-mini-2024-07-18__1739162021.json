  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the context of the question, which involves an uncle getting a divorce. This scenario may indicate that he is leaving his marital home or a situation related to his family.",
    "Next, I consider the possible places an uncle might go after a divorce; he could move in with family members or friends for support during the transition.",
    "I examine the answer choices to see which options relate to potential places where the uncle might stay post-divorce.",
    "Option A \"most families\" is too vague and does not suggest a specific destination.",
    "Option B \"act in loco parentis\" refers to taking on parental responsibilities, which is not relevant to where he might move.",
    "Option C \"aunt's house\" is a plausible option, as he may choose to stay with a sibling or relative for support.",
    "Option D \"grandmas\" could also be a possible location, as many people turn to their grandmothers for support during tough times.",
    "Option E \"older generation\" also does not point to a specific location, but rather describes a demographic group.",
    "To narrow down between the plausible options C and D, I consider the social dynamics; staying with an aunt may be more common than staying with a grandmother, depending on family relationships.",
    "Ultimately, while both C and D are valid, \"aunt's house\" (C) seems like the most likely immediate destination for someone going through a divorce seeking close family support."
