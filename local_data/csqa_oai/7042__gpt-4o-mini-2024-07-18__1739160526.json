  "steps": [
    "The question states that the farmer is scooping out eyes to plant in the ground. This suggests that the \"eyes\" are something that can be planted.",
    "In the context of gardening and farming, \"eyes\" commonly refer to the small buds found on certain tubers, which can sprout into new plants.",
    "Potatoes are known to have \"eyes\" from which new potato plants can grow. This aligns with the activity of planting.",
    "The other options do not fit the context of planting. For example, an elephant, a person's head, and faces do not produce anything that can be scooped and planted.",
    "Selecting option C, potato, makes sense since it is a commonly cultivated crop that is propagated using its eyes.",
    "Options A, B, D, and E do not represent something that can be scooped out and planted, reinforcing that option C is the only logical choice.",
    "Thus, the context of farming and planting leads me to conclude that the farmer must be scooping out eyes from potatoes."
