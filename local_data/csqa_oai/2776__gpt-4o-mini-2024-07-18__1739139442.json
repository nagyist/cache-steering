  "query": "Question: James is driving to work.  He's late and he's going very quickly.  What is he at risk of getting?\n\nChoices:\nA: boredom\nB: use gas\nC: get to work\nD: diabetes\nE: speeding ticket",
  "steps": [
    "James is driving quickly because he is late to work, which suggests he is exceeding the speed limit.",
    "When a driver exceeds the speed limit, they are often at risk of being pulled over by law enforcement.",
    "Being pulled over for driving too quickly typically results in a speeding ticket.",
    "The other options do not apply to the scenario: boredom (A) is unlikely as he is trying to hurry, using gas (B) is a normal part of driving, getting to work (C) may happen but is not a risk, and diabetes (D) is unrelated to driving behavior.",
    "Thus, the most relevant risk in this context is the possibility of receiving a speeding ticket."
