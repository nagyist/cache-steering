  "query": "Question: If one sees a fox and is standing in a landlocked, southern state, where is this person?\n\nChoices:\nA: at the zoo\nB: south carolina\nC: hen house\nD: louisiana\nE: arkansas",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the person is in a landlocked, southern state. This means the state does not have access to the ocean.",
    "Looking at the choices, South Carolina (B) is not landlocked as it has a coastline along the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "Next, Louisiana (D) also has a coastline along the Gulf of Mexico and is therefore not landlocked.",
    "Arkansas (E) is landlocked and located in the southern part of the United States, which aligns with the first part of the question.",
    "The choice C (hen house) is not a state or location; it\u2019s simply a structure, and while it could contain a fox, it doesn\u2019t fulfill the requirement of being a state.",
    "Thus, we are left with Arkansas (E) as the only landlocked southern state in the choices presented.",
    "Revisiting the specific wording, the presence of a fox doesn\u2019t directly indicate where the person is, but the geographical requirement points to Arkansas.",
    "Since we have eliminated all other options based on the criteria of being landlocked and southern, I can conclude that Arkansas (E) is the correct answer."
