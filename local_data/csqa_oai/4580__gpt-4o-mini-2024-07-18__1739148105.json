  "query": "Question: If I am in an auditorium watching an amateur play, where am I likely?\n\nChoices:\nA: crowd\nB: street performance\nC: high school\nD: city\nE: lights",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the most likely place I could be watching an amateur play, I should consider common venues for such performances.",
    "Amateur plays are typically performed in settings where local talent can showcase their skills, such as community centers, schools, or small theaters.",
    "The term \"auditorium\" suggests that this is an enclosed space designed for performances, which aligns with locations like schools and community centers, rather than outdoor settings.",
    "Now, evaluating the choices: \n- A: crowd is not a specific location.\n- B: street performance would not be in an auditorium.\n- C: high school could have an auditorium for performances.\n- D: city is too broad and does not specify a venue.\n- E: lights is not a location, but rather an element of performance.",
    "Among the options, \"C: high school\" stands out because high schools often have auditoriums and frequently host amateur plays.",
    "None of the other options directly relates to a place where amateur plays typically occur with an auditorium setup.",
    "Considering all this information, the conclusion is that the most likely scenario is being in a high school."
