  "query": "Question: It may have many an eye but it doesn't see you peel it's skin off, what is it?\n\nChoices:\nA: potato\nB: faces\nC: lizard\nD: person's head\nE: mammal",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the clue \"It may have many an eye.\" The word \"eye\" could refer to \"eyes\" in terms of appearance or structure, such as spots or designs.",
    "Next, I consider the phrase \"but it doesn't see you.\" This suggests that whatever is being described does not possess the ability to see, which eliminates options that are distinctly animals with eyesight.",
    "The next phrase \"peel its skin off\" indicates that the item can be skinned or has a skin layer that can be removed.",
    "I evaluate each option against these clues:\n- A: potato - Potatoes have \"eyes\" (the small sprouts) and can be skinned. They do not see, fitting the clues.\n- B: faces - Faces do have \"eyes,\" but they see, so this doesn't fit.\n- C: lizard - Lizards have eyes and can see, so this option is eliminated.\n- D: person's head - A person's head has eyes and they can see, so this is ruled out.\n- E: mammal - Mammals have eyes and can see, so this option is not fitting either.",
    "Since the only option that fits all clues - many eyes that do not see and can be peeled - is the potato, I confirm this choice."
