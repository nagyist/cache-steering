  "query": "Question: What kind of wine list can I expect to see in Paris?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: french\nC: boston\nD: canadian\nE: resturant",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the type of wine list you can expect to see in Paris, which is known for its wine culture.",
    "Paris is located in France, where French wines are prevalent and celebrated worldwide.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"french\" is the most directly related to wines commonly found in Paris.",
    "The other choices, such as \"boston\" and \"canadian,\" refer to places or types of wines that do not specifically relate to Paris.",
    "The option \"restaurant\" is more general and does not specify the type of wine list that would be unique to Paris.",
    "The option \"resturant\" appears to be a misspelling of \"restaurant\" and does not add value to the question regarding wine lists.",
    "Therefore, the logical conclusion is that a Paris wine list is primarily French in origin and style."
