    "I need to identify the phrase \"shoots water up someone's butt\" and what could cause that to happen.",
    "Commonly, the term that involves water being injected into the body for various purposes is 'enema.'",
    "An enema is a procedure where liquid is introduced into the rectum, which fits the description of shooting water up someone's butt.",
    "Next, I will consider the other options to see if any match the description more closely.",
    "A thunderstorm can produce rain but does not specifically shoot water into anyone's body.",
    "A restaurant serves food and drink but doesn\u2019t relate to shooting water in that manner.",
