  "steps": [
    "The question posits a scenario where kids experience aging, which is a process that naturally leads to growing into adulthood.",
    "Considering the choices, \"become adults\" directly correlates to the natural outcome of experiencing aging.",
    "The other options, B (hatred), C (distracting), D (open door), and E (wonder about), do not inherently relate to the effects of kids aging.",
    "In the context of aging, we generally associate it with maturation and development, which aligns well with the idea of becoming adults.",
    "Out of the provided options, \"hatred,\" \"distracting,\" \"open door,\" and \"wonder about\" do not represent a logical or expected response to aging.",
    "Thus, the only option that fits the question about what happens when kids experience aging is that they would \"become adults.\""
