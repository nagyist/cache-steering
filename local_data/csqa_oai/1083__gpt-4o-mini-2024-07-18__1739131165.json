  "query": "Question: If you were looking for a grape, where is one place where you probably wouldn't find one?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: plate\nC: field\nD: winery\nE: fruit stand",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of each choice and where grapes are typically found.",
    "Option A: kitchen - Grapes are commonly found in kitchens, especially if someone is preparing food or snacking.",
    "Option B: plate - Grapes can be served on a plate, therefore it\u2019s a plausible place to find them.",
    "Option C: field - A grape field is where grapes are grown, so it\u2019s likely to find grapes there.",
    "Option D: winery - Winemaking involves grapes, so a winery would definitely have grapes.",
    "Option E: fruit stand - Fruits, including grapes, are sold at fruit stands, making this another likely place to find them.",
    "Now we analyze which choice is least likely to have grapes. The field is where they grow, and all other options directly involve grapes in some way.",
    "Considering that grapes are grown in fields and are consumed or sold in other places, the field would logically be a place where we can find grapes.",
    "Thus, we look for a choice that lacks direct association with grapes.",
    "All options except one either contain grapes directly or are commonly associated with grapes.",
    "A kitchen, plate, winery, and fruit stand all have a strong connection to grapes.",
    "Since all other choices (A, B, D, and E) are places where grapes are likely to be found directly, we should look for one without this association, which is the \u201cfield\u201d thriving with grapevines, meaning it\u2019s more of a growing area rather than a direct place to find grapes for consumption."
