  "query": "Question: Where would you keep paper files you're currently working on?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk\nB: filing cabinet\nC: harddisk\nD: drawer\nE: computers",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what \"currently working on\" means in terms of file management. It suggests that these files are readily accessible and frequently referenced.",
    "Evaluate each option based on accessibility and usage for files being actively worked on.",
    "Option A (desk) typically has a surface for working but may not be suitable for storing files securely.",
    "Option B (filing cabinet) is usually for storing completed files or records, making it less suitable for current work materials.",
    "Option C (hard disk) refers to digital storage rather than physical file management, which doesn't align with the question about paper files.",
    "Option D (drawer) can hold files but is often less organized than a filing cabinet and may not have easy access while working.",
    "Option E (computers) involves digital files, again deviating from the specification of paper files.",
    "From the above evaluations, the desk stands out as the most likely place to keep paper files that are currently being worked on, as it allows for easy access while working."
