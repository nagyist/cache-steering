  "query": "Question: Where would you find a spare pillowcase in a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: linen closet\nC: coverning pillow\nD: bathroom\nE: linen cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the choices to determine where spare pillowcases are most likely stored in a house.",
    "The first option is the bedroom. While there may be pillows in the bedroom, it is not common to store spare pillowcases in the bedroom itself.",
    "The second option is the linen closet. Linen closets typically store various bed linens, including sheets and pillowcases. This is a strong candidate.",
    "The third option is \"covering pillow.\" This phrase doesn't refer to a location where spare pillowcases would be stored but rather to a use of pillowcases.",
    "The fourth option is the bathroom. Bathrooms usually store toiletries and towels, not bed linens or pillowcases.",
    "The fifth option is the linen cupboard, which is essentially synonymous with a linen closet. This option also strongly suggests a place where spare pillowcases might be kept.",
    "I now compare the two likely options: linen closet (B) and linen cupboard (E). They're fundamentally the same, just different terminologies.",
    "Since both the linen closet and the linen cupboard are equally valid options for storing spare pillowcases, I will choose the more general term that is most commonly used, which is \"linen closet.\"",
    "Thus, I conclude that the correct answer must be option B, as it is the most widely accepted term in most households for storing bedding items."
