  "query": "Question: How might praying make someone feel as they wait for an outcome?\n\nChoices:\nA: relief\nB: meditation\nC: confusing god\nD: being comforted\nE: contemplation",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of praying. Many people pray as a way to seek guidance, support, or help from a higher power while waiting for an outcome.",
    "Next, think about the emotional response that comes with prayer. For many, praying can provide feelings of peace and comfort during uncertain times.",
    "Now, analyze the choice \"relief.\" While praying may help relieve anxiety, relief specifically implies a release of pressure or stress, which is not universally applicable to everyone who prays.",
    "Evaluate \"meditation.\" While prayer can resemble meditation in its contemplative aspects, it specifically emphasizes communication with a higher power, so it may not capture the complete essence of praying while waiting.",
    "Consider \"confusing god.\" This choice seems negative and does not reflect the typical emotional responses people have when they pray; it implies a misunderstanding rather than comfort or solace.",
    "Look at \"being comforted.\" This option aligns with the typical feelings that arise when someone prays, as it often leads to a sense of support and reassurance.",
    "Finally, review \"contemplation.\" Similar to meditation, it can describe a state of deep thought but doesn't convey the emotional relief or comfort tied to the act of praying in anticipation of an outcome.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, \"being comforted\" (D) emerges as the most fitting response because it encapsulates how prayer can provide emotional solace while waiting for something uncertain."
