  "steps": [
    "To find people who are active in the same field, I need to consider places where professionals gather or share knowledge related to their careers.",
    "Conferences are known for hosting gatherings of professionals from specific industries or fields, where networking and knowledge sharing take place.",
    "A theater is primarily for performances and entertainment, and does not typically attract individuals from a specific professional field for networking purposes.",
    "A supermarket is a place for grocery shopping and is not relevant for professional networking or finding peers in the same field.",
    "A town is too broad of a concept and does not specifically refer to a place where people from a particular industry would gather.",
    "A cinema is another entertainment venue, focusing on movies rather than professional interactions or networking among individuals in a specific field.",
    "Based on these evaluations, the only option that aligns with a professional setting where networking occurs is a conference."
