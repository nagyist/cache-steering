    "The question describes a situation where someone is about to watch a favorite program.",
    "To watch a program, one typically uses a device that displays video content.",
    "Options A (concert) and B (opera) refer to types of performances rather than devices.",
    "Option E (lamp) is not a device for watching programs; it is for lighting.",
    "This leaves us with options C (computer) and D (television), both of which can be used to watch programs.",
    "However, the word \"program\" strongly implies a television program, which is commonly understood in the context of TV viewing.",
    "While a computer can also be used, \"program\" in this context is more closely associated with television shows or broadcasts.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer considering common usage and context is television."
