  "query": "Question: He called his friend to go fishing, but his friend surprised him by saying he was already out there what?\n\nChoices:\nA: catching fish\nB: catch fish\nC: driving\nD: wade in\nE: buy bait",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the friend was already engaged in an activity related to fishing when he received the call.",
    "The phrase \"he was already out there\" suggests that the friend is already at the fishing location, implying that he is involved in a fishing-related action.",
    "Looking at the choices, A (catching fish) aligns well with the idea of already being engaged in a fishing activity.",
    "B (catch fish) is grammatically incorrect because it lacks the necessary context for the tense and ongoing action implied by \"was.\"",
    "C (driving) does not relate specifically to fishing and does not fit the context of being at a fishing location.",
    "D (wade in) is an action that could also relate to fishing but does not definitively indicate that he is fishing.",
    "E (buy bait) is an action that would not typically occur while already being at the fishing site.",
    "Between A and D, \"catching fish\" is a more direct response to the context since it specifies an ongoing action related to fishing.",
    "Thus, the best choice that makes the most sense in this scenario is A, as it directly implies that the friend is actively participating in fishing."
