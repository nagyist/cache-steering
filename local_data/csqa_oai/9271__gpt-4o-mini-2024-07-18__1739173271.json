  "query": "Question: How would chicken be served?\n\nChoices:\nA: freezer\nB: eaten\nC: plate\nD: fast food restaurant\nE: dish",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks how chicken would be served, indicating a focus on the presentation or serving method rather than storage or location.",
    "Choice A, \"freezer,\" refers to a storage method and is not a way to serve chicken.",
    "Choice B, \"eaten,\" although related to the consumption of chicken, does not directly address the serving aspect.",
    "Choice C, \"plate,\" is a common item used to serve food, including chicken, and indicates a method of presentation.",
    "Choice D, \"fast food restaurant,\" suggests a place where chicken might be sold but does not specify how it is served.",
    "Choice E, \"dish,\" can refer to the food item itself or the serving container, which is somewhat related but not as direct as \"plate.\"",
    "Among the choices, \"plate\" (C) clearly denotes the physical act of serving food, which aligns directly with how chicken is commonly served.",
    "\"Dish\" (E) could also apply but is more ambiguous and less specific than \"plate\" (C) regarding the serving context.",
    "Considering all options, the most direct answer that specifically addresses serving is choice C."
