  "query": "Question: What is the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early?\n\nChoices:\nA: go to bed early\nB: fix up alarm\nC: go sleep early\nD: dawn\nE: ask spouse to wake",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the goal: The person wants to get up early.",
    "Consider the outcomes of going to bed early: If a person goes to bed early, they are likely to get enough sleep and be able to wake up early without feeling too tired.",
    "Evaluate the option of fixing an alarm: Setting an alarm might help them wake up, but if they don't get adequate sleep, they may still feel fatigued.",
    "Examine the suggestion of going to sleep early: This option is very similar to going to bed early, with the intent being to enable an earlier rise.",
    "Consider the choice of \"dawn\": This does not directly help someone to wake up early, as it simply refers to the time of day.",
    "Think about asking a spouse to wake them: This could be helpful, but it depends on the spouse being available to assist, and does not improve the total amount of sleep.",
    "Compare options A, C, and E: While A (going to bed early) and C (going to sleep early) have similar outcomes, they both ensure ample sleep is achieved, while E relies on someone else's involvement.",
    "Determine if A and C are interchangeable: Both mean essentially the same thing and point towards achieving the goal effectively. However, A uses \"bed\" while C uses \"sleep.\"",
    "Conclude which among A and C is best worded to imply the action needed: \"go to bed early\" is a clear action step that directly addresses behavior needed before sleep, while \"go sleep early\" is more about the state of sleeping rather than the action of going to bed.",
    "Decide between the most actionable options (A and C): Since both effectively lead to the same result, the clear actionable phrase is to \"go to bed early.\""
