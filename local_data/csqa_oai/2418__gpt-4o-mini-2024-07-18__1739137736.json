  "query": "Question: James found two abandoned garbage cans behind an old building.  Where might they have been concealed?\n\nChoices:\nA: driveway\nB: alley\nC: garage\nD: street\nE: own backyard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the context of abandoned garbage cans; they are commonly found in areas where waste is typically disposed of or collected.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the options for places where garbage cans could be concealed. A driveway is usually a public access area where parked vehicles are kept, making it less likely for garbage cans to be concealed there.",
    "Then, I will analyze the alley option. Alleys often serve as secondary access points to buildings and can sometimes be used for waste disposal, making it a plausible choice for concealed garbage cans.",
    "Next, I will examine the garage option. While garbage cans may be stored in a garage, an abandoned state suggests they wouldn't be regularly placed there, making this option less likely.",
    "Now, I will consider the street option. Similar to the driveway, streets are public areas where garbage is typically collected, and it's unlikely for garbage cans to be hidden here.",
    "After that, I will reflect on the own backyard option. While it's common for residences to store garbage cans in backyards, the specific mention of \"abandoned\" suggests a lack of ownership or maintenance, lowering the plausibility of this option.",
    "Summarizing the evaluations, the most likely place for the garbage cans to be concealed, based on common patterns of disposal and abandonment, is the alley.",
    "Lastly, I will conclude based on the analysis that the alley is the best-fit option for where the abandoned garbage cans might have been concealed."
