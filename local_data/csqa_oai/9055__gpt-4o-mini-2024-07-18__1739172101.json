  "query": "Question: You may drink from a cup in what small dwelling that are normally grouped together in one building?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: apartment\nC: closet\nD: table\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a \"small dwelling\" where one can drink from a cup and is typically found in a group within a single building.",
    "To analyze the options: \n- A \"school\" is not a dwelling but rather an educational institution; hence it doesn't fit.",
    "- An \"apartment\" is a small residential space and can certainly have cups and is usually part of a larger building with multiple units, making it a potential fit.",
    "- A \"closet\" is a storage space and not a dwelling; it is too small and does not facilitate drinking from a cup comfortably.",
    "- A \"table\" is a piece of furniture and not a dwelling at all, so it also does not fit the criteria.",
    "- A \"restaurant\" is a place where one can drink from a cup, but it is not considered a dwelling, as it serves food and drinks to the public.",
    "Since the definition of a \"small dwelling\" is most closely matched by \"apartment,\" and it can be reasonably deduced that one can drink from a cup in an apartment, it becomes the most suitable answer."
