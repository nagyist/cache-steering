  "query": "Question: You go through a lot of training to be a soldier, this is to prepare you to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: follow orders\nB: wait for orders\nC: follow instructions\nD: fight for freedom\nE: fight enemy",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what military training primarily focuses on. A fundamental aspect of military training is to prepare soldiers for combat and operational effectiveness.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. \"Follow orders\" suggests compliance with commands from superiors, which is definitely a part of military training.",
    "Then consider \"wait for orders.\" While following orders is crucial, waiting itself doesn\u2019t encapsulate the active readiness required in combat situations, making this option less relevant.",
    "Next, analyze \"follow instructions.\" This option is similar to following orders but is broader and can imply various contexts beyond military operations, which may not fully capture the essence of military training.",
    "Now consider \"fight for freedom.\" While fighting can be part of a soldier's duties, it\u2019s not explicitly the goal of training; rather, it can be a consequence of the training and duty.",
    "Finally, analyze \"fight enemy.\" This choice directly relates to one of the primary objectives of military training, which is to prepare soldiers to engage in combat against opposing forces.",
    "Weighing all these considerations, \"follow orders\" and \"fight enemy\" are the most relevant. However, the ultimate goal of training is to prepare soldiers to engage in actions against threats, which aligns closely with fighting the enemy."
