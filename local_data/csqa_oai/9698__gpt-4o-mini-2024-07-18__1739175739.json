  "query": "Question: You may see a beaver when visiting what state known as \"Big Sky Country\"?\n\nChoices:\nA: kentucky\nB: zoo\nC: montana\nD: river or stream\nE: canada woodlands",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which state is commonly referred to as \"Big Sky Country.\"",
    "Montana is widely known as \"Big Sky Country\" due to its expansive natural scenery and sky views.",
    "Next, I should consider whether beavers are native to Montana.",
    "Beavers are indeed native to Montana, living in areas with rivers, streams, and other bodies of water.",
    "Now, let\u2019s look at the options provided: \n- A (Kentucky) is not \"Big Sky Country.\"\n- B (Zoo) does not specify a location and is not fitting as a state.\n- C (Montana) aligns with both the nickname and the presence of beavers.\n- D (River or stream), while beavers do inhabit these, does not indicate a specific state.\n- E (Canada woodlands) does not refer to Montana and instead indicates a broader region.",
    "Since Montana is the only option that fulfills both the nickname \"Big Sky Country\" and the possibility of seeing beavers, it is the correct answer."
