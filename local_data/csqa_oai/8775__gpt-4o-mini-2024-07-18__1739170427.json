  "query": "Question: What do people want to minimize by surprising rather then prepping?\n\nChoices:\nA: expectation\nB: known about\nC: planned\nD: obvious\nE: knowingly",
  "steps": [
    "To tackle this question, I need to analyze what \"surprising\" entails compared to \"prepping.\" Surprising usually involves delivering something unexpected or unpredictable.",
    "On the other hand, prepping involves preparing and setting expectations for what is to come.",
    "In general, the goal of providing a surprise is to create a reaction that is not anticipated or prepared for. This suggests minimizing some level of predictability and planning.",
    "Now, let's examine the choices given in light of this reasoning. Option A, \"expectation,\" relates closely to predictability. If something is surprising, it is designed to minimize prior expectations.",
    "Option B, \"known about,\" suggests something that is already in public knowledge or awareness which doesn't necessarily connect with the surprise itself.",
    "Option C, \"planned,\" implies things that were prearranged or intended. Again, if we are surprising someone, we are acting against what was planned, thus minimizing planning in the moment.",
    "Option D, \"obvious,\" refers to things that are easily understood or seen. Surprising someone typically aims to create an event that is not obvious.",
    "Option E, \"knowingly,\" implies an awareness that would again run counter to the essence of a surprise.",
    "Among these options, \"expectation\" (A) and \"planned\" (C) seem to be the most relevant to the idea of minimizing through surprising.",
    "However, \"expectation\" (A) directly refers to the anticipatory aspect of a surprise, indicating that the surprise seeks to minimize what one expects to happen."
