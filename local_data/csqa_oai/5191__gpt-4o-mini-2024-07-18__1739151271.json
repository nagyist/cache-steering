  "query": "Question: What are built up areas near the highway called?\n\nChoices:\nA: subways\nB: desert\nC: mexico\nD: atlas\nE: developed land",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what \"built up areas near the highway\" refers to. These areas typically consist of urban development, including homes, businesses, and infrastructure that support transportation.",
    "Next, we should consider the choices provided. \"Subways\" primarily refer to underground transit systems, which does not relate to areas near highways.",
    "\"Desert\" usually refers to arid land with little vegetation, which contradicts the concept of a built up area.",
    "\"Mexico\" is a country name and does not specifically describe a type of area, especially in relation to highways.",
    "\"Atlas\" usually refers to a collection of maps, which is again unrelated to the concept of built up urban areas.",
    "Now, let's analyze \"developed land.\" This term accurately describes areas that have been built for residential, commercial, or industrial use, fitting the definition of built up areas.",
    "Since \"developed land\" is the only option that directly refers to areas characterized by construction and urbanization, it logically must be the correct answer.",
    "Finally, reviewing the reasoning shows that all other options are either unrelated or incorrectly related to areas near highways."
