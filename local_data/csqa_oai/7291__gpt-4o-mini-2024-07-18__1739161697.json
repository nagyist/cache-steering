  "query": "Question: Where does a bald eagle like to fly?\n\nChoices:\nA: wildlife refuge\nB: mountains\nC: pine tree\nD: colorado\nE: open country",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the habitat preferences of a bald eagle. They are known to thrive in areas where there is a good supply of fish, which is their primary food source.",
    "Next, analyze the choices given. A wildlife refuge suggests a protected area that could support a healthy ecosystem for eagles.",
    "Examine the second choice, mountains. Bald eagles are often spotted flying in mountainous regions, especially near water bodies such as lakes and rivers.",
    "Now, consider choice C, pine tree. While eagles do perch in trees, particularly for nesting, this answer refers to a stationary habitat rather than flying.",
    "Next, analyze choice D, Colorado. While bald eagles can be found in Colorado, this is a specific location rather than a broader habitat preference.",
    "Lastly, evaluate choice E, open country. Bald eagles often soar over wide-open spaces, such as fields and wetlands, where they can spot prey.",
    "Based on the above analysis, both open country and mountains are suitable environments for bald eagles to fly, but open country is more indicative of their flying habits, as it allows them to cover extensive areas.",
    "However, since the question emphasizes where they like to fly, and considering both options, open country seems to be the most appropriate choice."
