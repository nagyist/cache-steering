  "steps": [
    "The context of the sentence suggests that he is revealing something important at a trade show, which typically involves showcasing a product.",
    "To effectively show off a product, it's common to present a demonstration or showcase its features to potential customers or the public.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"demonstration\" directly aligns with the idea of showing off a product, as it involves explaining and showing how the product works.",
    "The other options do not fit the context: \"store\" refers to a place for selling goods, \"shelf\" is where products are displayed, \"market\" can refer to the industry or a venue but doesn't fit the action of showing off, and \"dance\" is unrelated to product showcases.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most appropriate choice that fits the context of showcasing a product at a trade show is \"demonstration.\""
