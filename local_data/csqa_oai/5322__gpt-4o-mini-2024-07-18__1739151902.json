  "query": "Question: Where do monkeys hang out?\n\nChoices:\nA: south africa\nB: tree tops\nC: zoos\nD: great outdoors\nE: tropical areas",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of monkeys. They are primarily arboreal, meaning they live in trees.",
    "Next, evaluate the choice of \"tree tops.\" Monkeys are known to spend much of their time climbing and living in the canopy of forests.",
    "Now, look at the other options. \"South Africa\" is a geographical location; while some monkeys may reside there, it is not a definitive answer as monkeys are found in various places globally.",
    "Consider \"zoos.\" While many monkeys do live in zoos, this is an artificial environment and not where they naturally hang out.",
    "Think about \"great outdoors.\" This is a broad term and could apply to many animals, but it doesn't specify the trees that monkeys prefer.",
    "Finally, assess \"tropical areas.\" This is valid since many monkeys are found in tropical regions; however, it doesn\u2019t convey the specific behavior of monkeys hanging out in trees.",
    "Weighing the options, the most accurate answer regarding where monkeys typically hang out in their natural behavior is \"tree tops\" since that reflects their arboreal lifestyle."
