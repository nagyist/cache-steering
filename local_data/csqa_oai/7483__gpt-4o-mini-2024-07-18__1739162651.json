  "query": "Question: Two bookends were on the shelf.  They supported a line of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: librarian\nB: pair\nC: school library\nD: library book\nE: bookshelf",
  "steps": [
    "Bookends are typically used to support a collection of items on a shelf.",
    "The most common use for bookends is to support books, preventing them from tipping over.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"library book\" refers specifically to books that are part of a library, which aligns with the purpose of bookends.",
    "While \"bookshelf\" could be a possibility, it describes the entire structure, not what the bookends directly support.",
    "The other options like \"librarian\", \"pair\", and \"school library\" do not relate directly to what bookends hold.",
    "Therefore, \"library book\" is the most appropriate choice as it directly refers to a collection of books that would typically be supported by bookends."

  "solution": "D"
