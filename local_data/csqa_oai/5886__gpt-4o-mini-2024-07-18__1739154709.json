  "query": "Question: Ones and zeroes are how computers do everything, you could say they simply what?\n\nChoices:\nA: addition\nB: do work\nC: do arithmetic\nD: multitask\nE: share files",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine what phrase or concept best encapsulates what computers do using ones and zeroes (binary). This form of representation typically refers to fundamental operations in computing.",
    "Computers operate using binary digits (bits), which are represented as ones and zeroes. These bits are used to represent data and perform operations.",
    "Among computing functions, arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.) are essential, as they form the basis of computations that computers perform.",
    "\"Addition\" (Choice A) is only one type of arithmetic operation. This choice doesn't encompass the broader range of actions computers perform.",
    "While \"do work\" (Choice B) is a general statement that can apply to computers, it doesn\u2019t specifically highlight the binary aspect of how they operate using ones and zeroes.",
    "\"Do arithmetic\" (Choice C) directly indicates the types of operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) which are fundamentally conducted using binary.",
    "\"Multitask\" (Choice D) refers to the capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously, which is not the primary concept being highlighted through the binary aspect.",
    "\"Share files\" (Choice E) pertains to a specific operation that computers can perform but is not directly related to the essence of binary code itself.",
    "Given that the question focuses on what computers fundamentally do with binary (ones and zeroes), \"do arithmetic\" (Choice C) captures this concept best."
