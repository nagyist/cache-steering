  "query": "Question: Where can someone keep a digital file?\n\nChoices:\nA: suitcase\nB: filing cabinet\nC: computer\nD: desk drawer\nE: cloud",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the nature of a digital file, which is an electronic item that requires electronic storage.",
    "Consider the options provided and determine which of them can store digital files.",
    "A suitcase is designed for physical storage and is not suitable for digital files; it cannot hold electronic data.",
    "A filing cabinet is traditionally used for physical documents, whereas digital files need electronic storage solutions.",
    "A computer can store digital files, as it has the necessary hardware and software to handle electronic data.",
    "A desk drawer generally stores physical items and thus cannot effectively keep digital files in their original format.",
    "The cloud is a modern storage solution that allows users to store and access digital files over the internet.",
    "From the reasoning above, I can conclude that both a computer and the cloud are valid options for storing digital files.",
    "Given the selections, I must identify an answer that fits the context of digital storage, so it would be prudent to choose 'C' for computer or 'E' for cloud.",
    "Since both answers C and E are valid, I will choose the most standard and direct option, which is C for computer."
