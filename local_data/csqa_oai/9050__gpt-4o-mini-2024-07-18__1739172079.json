  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the individuals found it hard to get local news.",
    "If it was hard for them to obtain local news, it suggests that their geographical location was not close to where this news was generated.",
    "The word \"local\" refers to news pertaining to a specific area, often limited to a city or region.",
    "To struggle with accessing local news implies being situated far away from that news source or location.",
    "Considering the options, \"distant\" implies being a long way away, which aligns with the difficulty of accessing local news.",
    "\"Remote\" also suggests a far-off location, which could similarly affect the ability to access local news.",
    "\"Fluidly\" refers to a smooth or flowing quality, which is not relevant to geographical distance.",
    "\"National\" relates to news that spans a country, which would further confirm their separation from local news.",
    "\"Foreign\" indicates news from another country, suggesting an even greater distance.",
    "Both \"distant\" and \"remote\" could fit the context, but \"remote\" more strongly connotes a sense of isolation from local news sources."
