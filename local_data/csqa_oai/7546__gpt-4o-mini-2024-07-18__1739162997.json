  "query": "Question: He couldn't have peanuts or cracker jacks because of his allergies, but he still had fun where?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: basketball game\nC: ballpark\nD: plane\nE: jar",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the sentence. The subject has allergies to peanuts and cracker jacks, which are typically sold at events or venues rather than in a home environment.",
    "Consider the implications of having fun despite the allergies. It suggests an environment conducive to enjoyment and social activities, likely outside the home.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: \n- A: container - not a relevant place for having fun.\n- B: basketball game - a venue but not specifically related to peanuts or cracker jacks.\n- C: ballpark - a location where peanuts and cracker jacks are commonly sold, but he can still have fun there in other ways.\n- D: plane - not typically a place for social fun, especially considering allergies.\n- E: jar - similar to container, not a venue for having fun.",
    "Focus on choice C \"ballpark\", which aligns with the mention of peanuts and cracker jacks and the context of having fun despite the allergies.",
    "Confirm that a ballpark is a likely location where someone could have fun while avoiding specific food items due to allergies.",
    "Distract the possibilities of a basketball game as an option; while it\u2019s a public venue, the mention of peanuts and cracker jacks strongly suggests a ballpark environment.",
    "Finalize by concluding that the ballpark is the best fit because it\u2019s a common place for enjoying a game or social gathering while maintaining awareness of food allergies."
