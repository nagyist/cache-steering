  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the natural behavior of a weasel. Weasels are carnivorous and tend to hunt smaller animals, such as birds and rodents.",
    "Next, let's analyze the options based on environments where weasels could cause significant destruction. A hen house is populated with chickens, which are relatively easy prey for a loose weasel.",
    "In addition, weasels are known to kill multiple birds in a single visit, making them particularly destructive in a hen house setting.",
    "On the other hand, a beach does not provide a suitable habitat for weasels. Similarly, Michigan as a state does not have a direct correlation with the destructive potential of a weasel.",
    "Great Britain could be home to wild weasels; however, the potential for mass destruction of livestock is still lower than in a hen house.",
    "A forest could allow for a weasel to hunt, but the overall impact on wildlife would be spread out and less noticeable than in a confined space like a hen house.",
    "Given all these considerations, the most likely place for a loose weasel to cause the most damage is where its prey is concentrated and defenseless, which is clearly in a hen house."
