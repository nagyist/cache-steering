  "query": "Question: What does living life too hard lead to?\n\nChoices:\nA: over age\nB: early death\nC: valuable\nD: joy\nE: happiness",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze what \"living life too hard\" means. It could refer to engaging in extreme behaviors, excessive stress, or unhealthy lifestyle choices.",
    "Next, let's consider the potential consequences of living life in such a manner. High levels of stress and unbalanced living could negatively impact health and well-being.",
    "One significant consequence of leading a life filled with stress or intense experiences is the potential for health problems, which can lead to reduced lifespan.",
    "Now, let's look at the answer choices given:\n- A (over age) doesn't align with the consequences of stressful living.\n- B (early death) aligns with the idea of poor health outcomes due to extreme lifestyle choices.\n- C (valuable) is subjective and doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with living hard.\n- D (joy) and E (happiness) seem unlikely outcomes from an overly intense life.",
    "Among the choices, B (early death) is the most plausible outcome that results from living life too hard, as it connects with health issues stemming from stress and unhealthy habits.",
    "Finally, it's important to note that while some people may find value or joy in intensity, the question is specifically about the negative consequences, which point towards early death."
