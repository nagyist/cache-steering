  "query": "Question: The man's goals were noble, but his methods were what?\n\nChoices:\nA: peasant\nB: inferior\nC: ignoble\nD: plebeian\nE: uneducated",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that the man's goals were noble, which implies a positive intention or purpose.",
    "The question then contrasts the nature of his goals with the nature of his methods, suggesting that they differ significantly.",
    "I need to find a word among the choices that reflects a negative or dishonorable quality in the man's methods.",
    "Choice A: \"peasant\" does not directly contrast with noble goals, as it refers to a social class rather than a moral or ethical quality.",
    "Choice B: \"inferior\" implies a lower quality but does not necessarily convey a moral judgment; it could just refer to standards.",
    "Choice C: \"ignoble\" means not noble in character or purpose; it directly contrasts with the noble intentions of the man's goals.",
    "Choice D: \"plebeian\" also refers to common people and does not carry the negative connotation required in this context.",
    "Choice E: \"uneducated\" describes a lack of education instead of a moral failing in methods, and does not fit the contrast needed.",
    "Considering all the options and the context of the question, \"ignoble\" is the most fitting choice because it suggests that while the man's goals were high-minded, his methods were low or dishonorable."
