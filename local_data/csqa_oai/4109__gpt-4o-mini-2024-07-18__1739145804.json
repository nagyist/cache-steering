  "query": "Question: John spent hours polishing his tires, because he wanted to take his vehicle where?\n\nChoices:\nA: car show\nB: home\nC: truck\nD: airport\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John spent hours polishing his tires. This implies that he was preparing his vehicle for a specific occasion or location where the appearance of the tires is significant.",
    "Among the choices provided, a car show is the most logical reason for someone to spend time polishing their vehicle, as appearance is crucial at such events.",
    "While \"home\" and \"airport\" could be potential destinations, they do not generally require extensive polishing of tires. \"Repair shop\" also does not align with the action of polishing tires, as that setting is more focused on mechanical work.",
    "The choice of \"truck\" is inappropriate since it does not denote a specific location or event; it's merely a type of vehicle.",
    "Considering all choices, the car show stands out as the most plausible reason for John to have polished his tires for an event that emphasizes vehicle aesthetics."
