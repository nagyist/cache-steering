  "steps": [
    "James is from out of town, which means he is likely staying in a temporary location rather than his own home.",
    "The options provided include locations where he might have lost his key. A hotel seems like a plausible place since he is out of town.",
    "If he were at his own home, he would not be considered \"out of town,\" so that option can be eliminated.",
    "The bus depot is not a typical place where one would stay overnight, making it less likely he would have lost a key there.",
    "A pub could be a location where he might misplace belongings, but it is not a living arrangement, making it unlikely that he would have kept his room key there.",
    "The most logical place for him to lose his room key is at the hotel where he is staying, as that is where he would be using the key.",
    "Since he is out of town and likely staying at a hotel, the most reasonable choice is that he lost his key specifically at the hotel."
