    "The question asks about the activities of early humans specifically related to cave walls.",
    "Among the provided choices, laying eggs (A) is not an activity attributed to humans but rather to birds and reptiles.",
    "Making tools (C) is a significant aspect of early human behavior, but this does not relate directly to cave walls.",
    "Competing with each other (D) is a social activity and does not specifically involve cave walls.",
    "Eating fruit (E) is also unrelated to activities that would take place on cave walls.",
    "Drawing pictures (B), on the other hand, is well-documented in archaeological findings, with many caves featuring cave paintings created by early humans.",
    "Cave paintings are considered a form of communication, expression, and documentation of early human life and culture.",
    "Based on historical and archaeological evidence, early humans engaged in the activity of drawing pictures on cave walls.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer that directly corresponds to the question is drawing pictures."
