  "query": "Question: If I wanted to find out the hours that Marmot was open, I might look where?\n\nChoices:\nA: hiding place\nB: ocean\nC: high mountains\nD: north america\nE: yellow pages",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine what type of information is being sought. The question asks for the hours of operation for a place called Marmot, which sounds like a business or establishment.",
    "Next, consider the context in which one normally finds hours of operation. Businesses usually publish their operating hours in certain places that are easily accessible to the public.",
    "Evaluate the options given. Option A (hiding place) does not relate to a publicly accessible location for business hours. Similarly, option B (ocean) is irrelevant as it doesn\u2019t pertain to business information.",
    "Consider option C (high mountains). While this might relate if Marmot were a mountain name or ski resort, it's unlikely to provide specific business hours.",
    "Option D (north america) is a broad geographic area and doesn\u2019t directly offer specific information about a business's hours.",
    "Now examine option E (yellow pages). This is a traditional directory service where businesses often list their contact information, including hours of operation.",
    "Weigh the relevance of the remaining options. The yellow pages (option E) would logically be a reliable source for finding business hours, especially for local establishments.",
    "Confirm that the other options do not provide a better alternative for finding business operational times.",
    "Thus, the best answer that aligns with the objective of finding operational hours is the yellow pages."
