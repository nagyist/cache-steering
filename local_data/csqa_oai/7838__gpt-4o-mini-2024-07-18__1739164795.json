  "query": "Question: Where can someone find the freshest green beans?\n\nChoices:\nA: fields\nB: mouth\nC: farmer's market\nD: container\nE: plate",
  "steps": [
    "First, it's important to consider where green beans grow naturally. They are grown in fields or farms where they are harvested.",
    "Next, green beans need to be collected and sold after harvesting. This suggests that farmers or markets play a role in selling fresh produce.",
    "A farmer's market is a place specifically designed for farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, often including fresh vegetables, such as green beans.",
    "Looking at the options, 'fields' (A) is where green beans grow, while 'farmer's market' (C) is where they are sold fresh.",
    "While 'mouth' (B), 'container' (D), and 'plate' (E) are places where green beans can end up, they are not sources of freshness.",
    "Considering freshness, it's logical to conclude that the freshest green beans would be found at a farmer's market (C), where they come directly from the farmer.",
    "Cross-checking the options: while fields (A) could offer fresh beans, they are not a location for purchasing. The farmer's market (C) is specifically for fresh produce, so it is a stronger choice.",
    "Finalizing the thought process, other options do not correspond to places known for fresh produce. Therefore, the best choice remains the farmer's market."
