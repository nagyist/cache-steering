  "steps": [
    "The question is about what two people competing might experience during their competition.",
    "Competitors are often under pressure and can experience various emotions as they try to outperform each other.",
    "In a competitive context, \"stress\" can occur as individuals feel the pressure to succeed.",
    "\"Debate\" suggests a discussion or exchange of ideas rather than a direct competition between two individuals.",
    "An \"argument\" implies a disagreement that may arise from differing opinions or frustrations during the competition.",
    "\"Winning or losing\" describes the outcomes of a competition but does not imply any direct emotional experience between the competitors.",
    "\"Tension\" refers to the strain or pressure felt during competition, which is closely related to stress but may not involve outright conflict.",
    "Among the choices, both \"argument\" and \"tension\" imply more direct interpersonal dynamics that can arise in a competitive environment.",
    "However, \"argument\" specifically suggests a conflict, whereas \"tension\" is more about the overall atmosphere and emotional state.",
    "Considering the nature of competition, an argument is a more definitive interaction that could occur as competitors clash over their motivations or frustrations."
