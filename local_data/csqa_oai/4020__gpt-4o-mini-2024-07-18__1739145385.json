  "query": "Question: The boy's mind was not right.  He couldn't care for himself, so he had to be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: play tricks on\nB: form images\nC: tended\nD: michigan\nE: mindblown",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context provided in the question. It mentions that the boy's mind was \"not right,\" indicating that he is struggling with mental health or cognitive issues.",
    "Next, I consider the implications of the phrase \"He couldn't care for himself.\" This statement suggests that the boy requires assistance or someone to look after him due to his inability to manage on his own.",
    "Now, I review the choices given to find which one aligns with the notion of someone needing care or support.",
    "Choice A (\"play tricks on\") does not fit the context of needing care, as it implies mischievous behavior rather than requiring assistance.",
    "Choice B (\"form images\") also does not relate to needing care, as it suggests creativity or visualization rather than being cared for.",
    "Choice C (\"tended\") means to take care of or look after someone, which directly relates to the boy's need for assistance due to his condition.",
    "Choice D (\"michigan\") is unrelated to the context; it refers to a place and does not connect with the theme of care or mental state.",
    "Choice E (\"mindblown\") suggests being overwhelmed or shocked, which does not fit as a response to the boy needing care.",
    "Given that \"tended\" directly refers to the act of being cared for, and it aligns perfectly with the situation described, I conclude that this is the correct choice."
