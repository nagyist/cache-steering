  "steps": [
    "To determine where someone might have a statement printed, we consider the context in which statements are typically printed or published.",
    "The options include places: mail, newspaper, smartphone, press release, and letter.",
    "\"Mail\" generally refers to postal services, which might not be a direct source of printed statements; it's more often used for delivery rather than printing.",
    "\"Newspaper\" is a traditional medium for printing news and statements, as they often include articles, opinions, and public statements from various entities.",
    "\"Smartphone\" does not match the context of printing; it is a digital device used for viewing content rather than printing it.",
    "\"Press release\" is a specific type of statement, often printed or disseminated electronically for media outlets to read or report on. It can be printed but is more specifically a format than a location.",
    "\"Letter\" refers to a written communication that can be printed on paper, but it is usually one person's statement directed toward another person rather than a public statement.",
    "Among all these options, \"newspaper\" stands out as a primary medium for printing public statements intended for widespread distribution.",
    "Although a \"press release\" can also be printed, it is often associated with its delivery method rather than being the primary medium itself.",
    "Ultimately, the most common answer for a printed statement in the context of public dissemination would be \"newspaper.\""
