  "query": "Question: What mammal has a diaphragm?\n\nChoices:\nA: homunculus\nB: drugstore\nC: human\nD: woman's body\nE: person's chest",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what a diaphragm is and its function in mammals.",
    "A diaphragm is a muscular structure that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity in mammals. It plays a crucial role in respiration.",
    "Determine which of the provided options are mammals.",
    "Out of the options given, \"homunculus\" is often used in a theoretical context related to human biology, and thus is not an actual mammal; \"drugstore\" is not a living organism; \"woman's body\" and \"person's chest\" refer to body parts, rather than organisms; the only option that refers to a specific organism is \"human.\"",
    "Confirm that humans are mammals.",
    "Humans belong to the class Mammalia, which universally possess a diaphragm as part of their anatomical structure.",
    "Evaluate if any of the other options could refer to creatures with a diaphragm.",
    "Since \"homunculus,\" \"drugstore,\" \"woman's body,\" and \"person's chest\" do not refer to actual mammals and do not inherently possess a diaphragm, they can be disregarded.",
    "Conclude that the only logical choice representing a mammal with a diaphragm is \"human.\""
