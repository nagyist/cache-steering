  "steps": [
    "To determine where light comes from, I need to consider the sources of light in the natural and artificial world.",
    "The most common natural source of light is the sun, which is part of the universe.",
    "Other sources of light include stars, which are also found in the universe.",
    "Artificial sources of light include light bulbs and candles, often found in places like homes and offices, but these do not specify a source.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the given options: \n- \"A: hope\" does not relate to light physically.\n- \"B: universe\" is closely associated with natural light sources.\n- \"C: attic\" might contain light but is not a source itself.\n- \"D: ocean\" sometimes reflects light but does not create it.\n- \"E: desk\" is an item that may have light sources on it, but again, is not a source itself.",
    "Since the universe contains stars and the sun, which are major sources of light, it follows that \"B: universe\" is the most fitting answer."
