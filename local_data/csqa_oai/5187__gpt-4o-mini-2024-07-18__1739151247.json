  "query": "Question: Lisa was driving down the highway when she saw a billboard telling her that she was near the border.  Where might she be?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: in the usa\nC: texas\nD: every city\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Lisa saw a billboard indicating she was near the border, which usually suggests proximity to an international boundary.",
    "In the context of the USA, there are multiple international borders, but a prominent one is the border between the USA and Mexico.",
    "Texas is a state in the USA that shares a significant border with Mexico, making it a likely location where someone could see a billboard about being near the border.",
    "The other choices, while they may seem relevant, do not specifically indicate a border. For example, \"street\" (A) is too vague, \"in the USA\" (B) is overly broad, \"every city\" (D) is unrealistic as not all cities are near a border, and \"countryside\" (E) doesn\u2019t indicate a specific location related to borders.",
    "Considering all the reasoning points, the choice that aligns best with Lisa being near a border is Texas."
