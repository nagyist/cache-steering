  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"goes to work\" indicates an action that is usually associated with employment.",
    "If someone is going to work, it implies that they are engaged in a professional activity.",
    "Engaging in professional activity typically means that the person holds a job.",
    "Therefore, the action of going to work directly suggests that the individual must have a position of employment.",
    "Alternately, while going to work may imply other actions like taking the bus, shaving, brushing teeth, or getting ready, these actions are generally considered preparatory and do not necessarily confirm employment.",
    "Out of all these options, \"have job\" is explicitly related to the requirement of going to work.",
    "The other choices describe potential behaviors that could occur before going to work, but do not directly indicate that someone is employed.",
    "Based on the implications of the phrase \"goes to work\", it can be concluded that it fundamentally means the person has a job."
