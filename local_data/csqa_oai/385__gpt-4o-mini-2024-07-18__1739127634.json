  "query": "Question: Where could you find a fox hunting when not in a forest?\n\nChoices:\nA: open meadow\nB: arctic tundra\nC: beach\nD: great outdoors\nE: england",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the natural habitat of a fox. They are versatile animals that can adapt to various environments, not just forests.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices provided. An \"open meadow\" is an area that can attract small mammals, which are prey for foxes. This makes it a plausible habitat.",
    "For the \"arctic tundra,\" while foxes do live in such regions (specifically arctic foxes), this environment is much colder and not typically associated with hunting behavior for red foxes.",
    "In the case of a \"beach,\" this environment doesn\u2019t usually support the types of prey that foxes hunt, which primarily include rodents and small mammals. Thus, it's less likely for fox hunting.",
    "The option \"great outdoors\" is very broad and can include many environments where foxes might hunt, but it lacks specificity.",
    "Finally, \"England\" is known for having foxes, especially the red fox, which are often seen in various habitats, including countryside areas that could support hunting.",
    "However, foxes can indeed be found in open meadows, which provides a specific location where they hunt outside of forests.",
    "Given the analysis of each option, \"open meadow\" directly matches the behavior of a fox hunting in a non-forest environment."
