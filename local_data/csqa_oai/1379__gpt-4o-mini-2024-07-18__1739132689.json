  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a magician guessing that it was a king. This suggests a setting where guessing or predicting is key.",
    "In card games, a magician might guess a playing card. \"King\" is a specific card in a deck.",
    "Among the options, \"deck of cards\" directly relates to playing cards and includes the king.",
    "A \"chess game\" or \"chess set\" also features kings, but these are more complex games and less associated with magic or guessing.",
    "A hierarchy and court do not directly connect to the act of guessing a king in a game or performance context.",
    "Since the magician is performing a trick, a deck of cards fits the context as it is often used in magic tricks involving card guessing.",
    "Comparing the options, \"deck of cards\" is the most compatible association with a magician and relates to the guess of a king."
