  "query": "Question: What is it called when life has an end date?\n\nChoices:\nA: finite\nB: over\nC: good\nD: important\nE: ending soon",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a term that describes life having an end date.",
    "I need to understand the meaning of the term \"finite.\" In general usage, \"finite\" describes something that has limits or bounds.",
    "Since life is often seen as having a definite beginning and end, \"finite\" seems to apply to life's nature.",
    "Next, I'll analyze the other options. \"Over\" does not specifically refer to having an end date but rather indicates that something has already concluded.",
    "The term \"good\" relates to positive qualities and does not pertain to the concept of an end date.",
    "\"Iimportant\" refers to significance or value, but again, it doesn't denote an ending or finality.",
    "Finally, \"ending soon\" implies a near conclusion but lacks the broader concept of a life that has a defined end date.",
    "Having analyzed all the options, \"finite\" stands out as the most fitting term to describe life in terms of having an end date."
