  "query": "Question: Dancing poorly in public may make you feel what?\n\nChoices:\nA: exhaustion\nB: recognizance\nC: blisters\nD: humiliation\nE: fatigue",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotional aspect of dancing poorly in public. How does one typically feel when they believe they are not performing well in front of others?",
    "There is a significant chance that performing poorly can lead to negative self-perception and feelings of embarrassment, especially in a public setting.",
    "Examine the choices given: exhaustion and fatigue relate to physical feelings, while blisters usually result from physical strain or poorly fitting shoes, and recognizance does not seem to apply in this context.",
    "The feeling of humiliation is closely connected to performing poorly in front of others, as it often brings a sense of shame or embarrassment about one's abilities.",
    "Both exhaustion and fatigue involve physical feelings, which don't quite apply in the context of dancing poorly.",
    "While someone could possibly develop blisters from dancing, it doesn\u2019t directly relate to the emotional impact of dancing poorly in public.",
    "Considering all options with respect to the context of performing poorly and the immediate accompanying feelings, \"humiliation\" stands out as the most relevant and likely response.",
    "After analyzing the emotional responses and discarding the less relevant options, it's clear that humiliation is the most appropriate answer."
