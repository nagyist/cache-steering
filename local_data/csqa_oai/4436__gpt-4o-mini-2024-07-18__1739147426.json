  "steps": [
    "Billy was doing his homework at the last minute, which often indicates that he may have delayed his responsibilities or was overwhelmed with tasks.",
    "He could barely think straight, suggesting a cognitive impairment or lack of mental clarity, which is often associated with being tired or stressed.",
    "Since he was doing homework, it's likely that he was under pressure to complete a task, which could lead to mental fatigue or exhaustion.",
    "Sneezing (Choice A) does not explain his inability to think straight and relates more to respiratory issues.",
    "Cleanliness (Choice B) is not relevant to the symptoms described, as it does not affect cognitive functioning.",
    "A seizure (Choice D) would likely involve more severe symptoms than just a lack of concentration and would require medical attention.",
    "Allergies (Choice E), while they can cause cognitive difficulties, typically come with other symptoms like sneezing, which was not mentioned in the scenario.",
    "Considering all factors, the best explanation for Billy's lack of clarity and inability to think straight is likely exhaustion, which can be caused by last-minute studying."
