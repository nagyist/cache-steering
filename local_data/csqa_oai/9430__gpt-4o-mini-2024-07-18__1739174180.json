  "query": "Question: Where will the stage for the students' graduation be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: theatre\nB: show\nC: concert hall\nD: auditorium\nE: opera",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature of a graduation ceremony, which traditionally involves speeches, performances, and the presentation of diplomas.",
    "Identify common locations where such ceremonies are typically held. These include venues capable of accommodating a large audience and having a stage.",
    "Evaluate each option: \n- A theatre is usually designed for plays and performances but could work for a graduation ceremony.\n- A show is not a physical location; it refers to an event.\n- A concert hall typically hosts musical performances, which might not be the primary use for a graduation ceremony.\n- An auditorium is specifically designed for presentations and has facilities for addressing an audience, making it suitable for a graduation.\n- An opera house is focused on operatic performances rather than general events like graduations.",
    "Rank the suitability of each location for hosting a graduation:\n1. Auditorium - most suitable\n2. Theatre - also suitable\n3. Concert hall - less suitable\n4. Opera - least suitable\n5. Show - not a location",
    "Since the question asks for the best choice for where the stage will be found for a graduation, I deduce that the auditorium is the most appropriate venue."
