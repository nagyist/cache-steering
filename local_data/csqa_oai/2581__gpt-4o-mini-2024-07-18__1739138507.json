  "query": "Question: What is a country that is known for a high population of beaver?\n\nChoices:\nA: woodlands\nB: rivers\nC: ontario\nD: canada\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the question. It asks for a country known for a high population of beavers.",
    "I need to consider where beaver populations are typically found. Beavers are known to thrive in aquatic habitats with abundant tree coverage.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option to see which corresponds to a known high population of beavers.",
    "Option A, \"woodlands,\" is not a country but a type of ecosystem where beavers are found.",
    "Option B, \"rivers,\" similarly is a type of habitat, and not a country.",
    "Option C, \"Ontario,\" is a province in Canada known for its wildlife, including beavers, but it is not a country.",
    "Option D, \"Canada,\" is a country and is known for having a large population of beavers due to its vast forests, lakes, and rivers.",
    "Option E, \"zoo,\" refers to a place where animals are kept and is not relevant to the concept of a country with a high beaver population.",
    "Thus, the only appropriate choice that answers the question regarding a country specifically is \"Canada,\" as it is home to a significant population of beavers."
