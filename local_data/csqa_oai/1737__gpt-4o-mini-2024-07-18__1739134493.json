  "query": "Question: As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sound well\nB: fly\nC: become broken\nD: gain speed\nE: fall into hole",
  "steps": [
    "The object is round, which suggests it could either be a ball or any spherical item.",
    "As the object rolls down a ramp, it is subjected to the force of gravity.",
    "Gravity causes objects to accelerate downwards, which means the object will gain speed as it rolls down the ramp.",
    "Rolling implies that the object is in motion, and therefore, it will not sound well, fly, or fall into a hole by default; it will stay on the ramp unless interrupted.",
    "The options given do not indicate that the object is likely to break, as there are no stresses indicated that would lead to breakage from rolling down a ramp.",
    "Gaining speed is the physical expectation for any object rolling due to gravity.",
    "None of the other options fit the scenario of a round object rolling down a ramp except for gaining speed."
