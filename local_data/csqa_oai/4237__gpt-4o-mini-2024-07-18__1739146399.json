  "query": "Question: The committee had more responsibility, they were a fast growing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: doughnut shop\nB: church\nC: office building\nD: business\nE: government",
  "steps": [
    "I will first analyze the phrase \"fast growing\" to determine what type of organization or entity typically exhibits rapid growth.",
    "Businesses often expand quickly due to increasing demand, market opportunities, or successful strategies.",
    "Next, I will consider the relationship between a committee and the possible answers. A committee that has more responsibility suggests it is likely organized, possibly managing some form of operations or services.",
    "Out of the options given, \"business\" seems to fit well since businesses often have committees to handle various responsibilities and decision-making processes.",
    "I'll examine the other options to confirm they are less suitable. A \"doughnut shop\" is specific and doesn't contextualize growth as broadly as a business.",
    "Next, \"church\" is generally stable in growth and doesn't align with the notion of a fast-growing entity in the same way.",
    "For \"office building,\" this refers more to physical spaces rather than entities that would have committees, making it less relevant.",
    "Lastly, \"government\" includes structures that may not see fast growth in the same sense as businesses. Government entities tend to grow to a steady state rather than rapidly expanding.",
    "Thus, the option that best aligns with \"fast growing\" and the nature of a committee is \"business.\""
