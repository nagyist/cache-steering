  "query": "Question: A blowfish lives free. He lives on his own. Where does he live?\n\nChoices:\nA: fish market\nB: pet shop\nC: great outdoors\nD: river\nE: little mermaid",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the blowfish lives free and on his own, suggesting a natural setting rather than a commercial or domestic environment.",
    "The options provided include a fish market, pet shop, great outdoors, river, and little mermaid.",
    "A fish market is a place where fish are sold, not a natural habitat, so this option does not fit.",
    "A pet shop is a commercial establishment where pets are sold, and again, this does not align with the concept of living free.",
    "The term \"great outdoors\" generally refers to natural environments, which could encompass various ecosystems where wildlife lives.",
    "A river is a specific type of habitat, but \"great outdoors\" is broader and could include rivers, oceans, forests, etc.",
    "The option \"little mermaid\" references a fictional character; therefore, it is not a plausible living situation for a real blowfish.",
    "Considering the need for the blowfish to live freely and independently, the best options are between \"great outdoors\" and \"river.\"",
    "However, \"great outdoors\" encompasses more than just freshwater habitats and would be a more accurate classification for where a free-living blowfish might be found.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is \"great outdoors.\""
