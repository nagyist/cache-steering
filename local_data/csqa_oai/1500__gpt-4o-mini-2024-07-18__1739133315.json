  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"free from guilt\" suggests a sense of inner peace and emotional well-being.",
    "When someone does not carry guilt, they are likely more relaxed and can enjoy life more fully.",
    "One important aspect of being free from guilt is the ability to rest and rejuvenate properly, which can lead to peaceful sleep.",
    "Considering the choices, peaceful sleep (A) seems plausible as it aligns with the emotional state resulting from being free from guilt.",
    "Now, let\u2019s assess the other options.",
    "\u201cFreedom from want\u201d (B) does not directly relate to being free from guilt; it suggests a different kind of emotional state tied to material needs.",
    "A \u201cmedal\u201d (C) implies achievement or recognition that might not necessarily be linked to a guilt-free state. While one can receive a medal free from guilt, it does not exclusively relate to the emotional state described.",
    "A \u201cheadache\u201d (D) is more associated with stress or anxiety, which could result from guilt, so this is the opposite of being free from guilt.",
    "Lastly, acquiring a \u201cnew computer\u201d (E) is unrelated to the emotional context of guilt and would not logically follow from being free from it.",
    "Based on the analysis of the choices, the one that most directly ties to being free from guilt and the emotional state that it entails is peaceful sleep (A)."
