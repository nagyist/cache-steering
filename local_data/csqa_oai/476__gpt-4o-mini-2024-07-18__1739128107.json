  "query": "Question: Where will a native lemur be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: india\nB: hole\nC: cage\nD: habitat\nE: rain forest",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what a native lemur is. Lemurs are primates that are endemic to Madagascar and the nearby Comoros islands.",
    "Consider the geographical locations provided in the choices. India is not a native habitat for lemurs.",
    "Evaluate whether a hole is a suitable location for native lemurs. A hole doesn\u2019t represent a habitat but rather a space that could provide shelter.",
    "Analyze the term \"cage.\" A cage represents an artificial environment, typically found in zoos rather than a natural habitat for lemurs.",
    "Now, examine the choices \"habitat\" and \"rain forest.\" Both terms are related to natural environments.",
    "Determine what a habitat means in the context of lemurs. A habitat is essentially the natural home or environment of an organism.",
    "Consider the significance of rain forests. Many species of lemurs are found in rain forests, as they provide sufficient food and shelter.",
    "Since lemurs are native specifically to Madagascar, it is important to recognize that Madagascar's rain forests are a critical part of their natural habitat.",
    "With the aforementioned deductions, the best and most fitting answer involving where a native lemur could be found is \"rain forest.\""
