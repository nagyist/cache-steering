  "steps": [
    "The question states that the servant was asked where to put the flowers, indicating that he is likely in a subordinate or supporting role at the wedding.",
    "The term \"servant\" typically refers to a person employed to perform duties for others, which aligns more with a subordinate status rather than that of a boss, celebrity, or rich person.",
    "The choices available include \"free person,\" \"celebrity,\" \"boss,\" \"in charge,\" and \"rich person.\" Given that \"servant\" implies someone who serves, options like \"celebrity,\" \"boss,\" and \"rich person\" do not fit his role.",
    "The choice \"free person\" could refer to someone who is not enslaved or bound, but does not indicate a position of authority or responsibility. It does not correlate with the role of a servant.",
    "The choice \"in charge\" implies a leadership status which is incompatible with the duty of a servant who is being given instructions.",
    "The servant's status at a wedding typically suggests he is part of the support staff, rather than enjoying the privileges associated with being a guest, celebrity, or hosts.",
    "Considering the context again, though option \"A\" (free person) exists, it does not signify his role or status at the wedding effectively.",
    "None of the other options imply a relationship that fits the role of a servant either, as they all suggest a higher status than being a service provider.",
    "As the servant is performing a specific function at the wedding, this reinforces his role further as secondary or supportive rather than leading or being influential in any capacity on the day of the wedding.",
    "Thus, combining these insights leads me to conclude that the servant is likely a non-privileged support role rather than \"free,\" \"celebrity,\" \"boss,\" \"in charge,\" or \"rich.\""
