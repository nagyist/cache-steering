  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the main goal of the farmer. This typically relates to what farmers primarily aim to achieve through their work.",
    "Farmers generally work to produce food or other agricultural products. Therefore, I need to evaluate each option to see which aligns best with a farmer's primary goal.",
    "Option A, \"farm land\", refers to the physical space where farming occurs rather than a goal in itself.",
    "Option B, \"beer cans\", does not directly relate to farming unless it specifies the production of ingredients for beer, which is not typical for understanding a farmer's goal.",
    "Option C, \"can produce\" is vague without context. It refers to the capacity to produce something but does not specify what.",
    "Option D, \"raise crops,\" directly refers to the act of growing crops, which is a fundamental goal of many farmers. This option is highly relevant to the main objective of farming.",
    "Option E, \"seed plants,\" refers more to the process of planting seeds rather than the ultimate goal. While seeding is important, it\u2019s generally part of the larger goal of raising crops.",
    "Considering the options, the most straightforward and representative goal for a farmer is to raise crops, which aligns well with basic agricultural practices."
