  "query": "Question: Where would you find a desk drawer which has people nearby whose age could be orders of magnitude different from each other?\n\nChoices:\nA: superman\nB: room\nC: school\nD: closed position\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where desk drawers are typically found. Desk drawers are usually part of furniture like desks and are commonly found in various environments such as offices, schools, and workspaces.",
    "Next, I need to analyze the second part of the question regarding the ages of people being \"orders of magnitude different.\" This suggests a setting where there is a diverse age range among the individuals present.",
    "In a school, for instance, there are students of various ages, from young children to older teenagers, which could represent a wide age range.",
    "In an office, the age range could also be diverse since it may include professionals at different stages in their careers, but typically the range might not be as extreme compared to a school setting with minors and young adults.",
    "\"Superman\" and \"closed position\" do not seem relevant to the presence of a desk drawer and nearby people.",
    "To further narrow down between \"school\" and \"office,\" I consider the extreme difference in ages. Schools tend to have a more pronounced age range than an office, where most employees are likely to be adults.",
    "Moreover, in a school, teachers (who are generally older) are present alongside students (who are generally younger), thereby fulfilling the condition of having individuals whose ages could differ significantly, even by orders of magnitude.",
    "Finally, since \"school\" fulfills both the presence of desk drawers (in classrooms or administrative areas) and a wide range of ages, it is the most fitting choice."
