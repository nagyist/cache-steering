  "query": "Question: Jane was beautiful on the inside, but on the outside she wasn't much to look at.  How might she be described?\n\nChoices:\nA: sleepy\nB: homely\nC: misshapen\nD: bad\nE: overcast",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that Jane possessed inner beauty, meaning she had good qualities or virtues, while the emphasis on not being \"much to look at\" suggests that her outward appearance is not attractive.",
    "Considering the options, I need to understand what each term means in relation to appearance.",
    "Option A: \"sleepy\" does not directly relate to physical attractiveness; it's more of a state of being or expression.",
    "Option B: \"homely\" is a term used to describe someone who is unattractive or plain in appearance, fitting well with the idea of not being much to look at.",
    "Option C: \"misshapen\" suggests a form that is deformed or not normal which may not apply here since it isn't specified that Jane's features are deformed.",
    "Option D: \"bad\" is too vague and doesn't specifically describe appearance, instead focusing on a moral quality.",
    "Option E: \"overcast\" does not relate to a person; it's used to describe weather conditions and wouldn\u2019t apply here in the context of beauty.",
    "Given the definition and implications of \"homely\" as it relates specifically to physical appearance, it directly matches the description provided in the question.",
    "None of the other options effectively capture the essence of Jane's described appearance compared to \"homely.\""
