  "query": "Question: Sarah opened his chest and found a second heart.  Her patient might not be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: istanbul\nB: animal\nC: antique shop\nD: human being\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario presents Sarah finding a second heart in the chest of her patient, which suggests a medical or biological context.",
    "In medical terms, humans typically have one heart. So, finding a second heart may imply that the patient is not a normal human being.",
    "Istanbul is a city, while an antique shop is a type of store, both of which have no relevance to a patient with a second heart.",
    "The term \"animal\" could potentially apply, as certain animals may have unusual heart structures, but generally, they do not have a second heart as a norm.",
    "\"Bedroom\" refers to a type of room, which again has no connection to the context of a patient with medical conditions.",
    "The only choice that directly correlates with the idea of having a second heart in a chest, and diverges from common expectations of a human, is D: a human being.",
    "Hence, since the discovery of a second heart implies abnormalities typically not found in humans, it suggests that the \"patient might not be a human being.\""
