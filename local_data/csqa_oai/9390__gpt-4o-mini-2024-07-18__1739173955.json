  "query": "Question: If you follow a road toward a river what feature are you driving through?\n\nChoices:\nA: north america\nB: valley\nC: town\nD: road\nE: bridge",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates a scenario where a road is being followed toward a river.",
    "Following a road typically means traveling along a path that may pass through various geographical features.",
    "A river is often found at a lower elevation compared to surrounding land, which suggests that one is likely driving downhill.",
    "A valley is a low area between hills or mountains, and rivers commonly run through valleys.",
    "If the road is leading toward a river, it suggests that the driver is likely traversing a path commonly associated with valleys, as they often contain routes leading to rivers.",
    "The other options\u2014north america, town, road, and bridge\u2014do not specifically describe a feature that one would be driving through on the way to a river in a generic sense.",
    "North America is a continent and does not represent a localized geographical feature.",
    "A town could be near a river, but it does not specifically describe being \"driven through\" on the way to the river.",
    "The road is simply the path taken and does not represent the geographical feature being traversed.",
    "A bridge would only apply if the road crosses over a river, which is not indicated in the question."
