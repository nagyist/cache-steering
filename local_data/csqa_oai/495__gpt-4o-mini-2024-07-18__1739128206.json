  "query": "Question: When someone falls from a mountain it will lead them to?\n\nChoices:\nA: too much\nB: act dead\nC: die\nD: rush\nE: explode",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general outcome of someone falling from a mountain. In such a scenario, the fall can lead to serious injuries or death due to the height and impact.",
    "Next, analyze the provided choices in relation to the potential outcomes of falling from a mountain.",
    "Choice A, \"too much,\" does not clearly relate to a specific outcome resulting from the fall.",
    "Choice B, \"act dead,\" is not a likely response to the scenario of falling from a mountain; it suggests a behavior rather than a consequence.",
    "Choice C, \"die,\" directly corresponds to the potential fatal outcome of a fall from a mountain, assuming it is sufficiently high.",
    "Choice D, \"rush,\" does not make sense as a consequence of falling; it implies speed rather than an outcome.",
    "Choice E, \"explode,\" is an extreme and unrealistic outcome that does not logically follow from the scenario of falling.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, the most logical and probable outcome of falling from a mountain is death due to the severe nature of such an accident."
