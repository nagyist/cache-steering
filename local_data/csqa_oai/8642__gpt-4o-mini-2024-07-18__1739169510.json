  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the problem: Sam ran out of clipboards, which are typically used for writing or holding papers.",
    "Consider where clipboards are commonly found or purchased. Common retailers for office supplies should be considered.",
    "Analyze the choices: \n- A: Windows 95 is an operating system and not related to clipboards. \n- B: School could be a place where clipboards are used, but it's not a store or retailer.\n- C: Ammunition shop does not sell office supplies like clipboards.\n- D: Office supply store is a place specifically designed to sell items like clipboards.\n- E: Desk is a piece of furniture where one might use a clipboard, but it's not a location to buy more clipboards.",
    "From the analysis, the only option that is a store and sells clipboards is D: office supply store.",
    "Double-check the other options to confirm that no other answer fits the requirement for purchasing more clipboards.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the best answer is the office supply store, where Sam can find clipboards."
