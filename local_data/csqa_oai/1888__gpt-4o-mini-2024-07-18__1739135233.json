  "query": "Question: what can one add to a building to increase it's size?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: town\nC: rooms\nD: fall down\nE: urban area",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that can be added to a building to increase its size.",
    "Let's analyze each choice to see which one pertains to increasing a building's size.",
    "Choice A: \"city\" does not directly pertain to a building itself; it refers to a larger area.",
    "Choice B: \"town\" similarly refers to a larger locality and is not directly related to a building.",
    "Choice C: \"rooms\" is a specific addition to a building that can genuinely increase its size by adding more space within the structure.",
    "Choice D: \"fall down\" implies a negative outcome where a building loses its size rather than gaining any.",
    "Choice E: \"urban area\" refers to a larger geographical section and does not directly enhance a single building's size.",
    "So far, the only choice that directly contributes to increasing the size of a building is \"rooms.\"",
    "I will now review the analysis to confirm there are no errors in reasoning.",
    "Choices A, B, D, and E do not relate to increasing the size of a building; thus, they can be eliminated.",
    "The conclusion is that adding \"rooms\" is the only viable option for increasing the size."
