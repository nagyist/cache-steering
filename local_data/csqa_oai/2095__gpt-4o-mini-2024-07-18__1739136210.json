  "query": "Question: Where in a town would you see trees near houses?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchard\nB: conservation land\nC: countryside\nD: yard\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which is about locations within a town that would typically have trees near houses.",
    "Next, evaluate option A: \"orchard.\" Orchards are primarily areas devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees, typically found outside of residential zones. This is not a place where you would generally find trees next to houses.",
    "Now, look at option B: \"conservation land.\" Conservation land usually aims to protect natural habitats and wildlife, and while it may have trees, it's less common to find houses in close proximity.",
    "Evaluate option C: \"countryside.\" The countryside typically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that have open fields and farms, which can have houses, but it doesn\u2019t specifically suggest trees close to houses.",
    "Consider option D: \"yard.\" A yard is an area of land surrounding a house where trees and plants can be present. This is a direct fit for the question since trees are often planted in or near yards.",
    "Lastly, examine option E: \"surface of earth.\" This option is too broad and vague, as it does not specify any particular setting and does not indicate the presence of trees or houses specifically.",
    "Given the considerations of all the options, the one that most accurately describes a situation where trees would be found near houses is option D: \"yard.\""
