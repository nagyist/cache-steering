  "query": "Question: Where could you find a seat that sometimes vibrates?\n\nChoices:\nA: mall\nB: in cinema\nC: airplane\nD: martorell\nE: auditorium",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options where seats are commonly found. Locations like a mall, a cinema, an airplane, Martorell, and an auditorium come to mind.",
    "Next, assess each location for features of their seating arrangements.",
    "In a mall, seats are mostly static and not designed to vibrate.",
    "In a cinema, while some premium seats might vibrate during action scenes, it is not a common feature of all cinema seating.",
    "On an airplane, the seats do not vibrate inherently, but can feel a vibration during takeoff or turbulence.",
    "Martorell is a location rather than a type of seat, so it can be dismissed in terms of finding a vibrating seat.",
    "In an auditorium, similar to a cinema, some might have vibrating seats, particularly in specialized venues that focus on performance with sound and special effects; however, this is less common overall.",
    "Now, evaluate more specific instances: seats designed to vibrate are commonly found in interactive or immersive experiences.",
    "Among the options, the most common and widespread use of vibrating seats is in airplanes during turbulence or movement.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that an airplane is the location most associated with experiencing a seat that sometimes vibrates."
