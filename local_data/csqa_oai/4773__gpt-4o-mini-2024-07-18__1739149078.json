  "query": "Question: What sort of life event might draw a large crowd of people together to celebrate?\n\nChoices:\nA: wedding\nB: bus stop\nC: crowd\nD: convention\nE: supermarket",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider events that typically inspire celebration and attract a large number of people.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option to see if it is an event that fits this description.",
    "Option A: wedding - Weddings are traditionally celebrated events and they often involve large gatherings of family and friends.",
    "Option B: bus stop - A bus stop is a transit point and does not typically serve as a celebratory event. It usually does not draw crowds for celebration.",
    "Option C: crowd - A crowd itself is not an event; it is simply a large number of people gathered together. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Option D: convention - Conventions bring together people for a specific purpose, but they are not always celebratory in nature (e.g., trade shows, professional gatherings).",
    "Option E: supermarket - A supermarket is a place where people shop and does not involve a significant life event that would draw a crowd to celebrate.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only one that represents a life event drawing a crowd to celebrate is option A (wedding)."
