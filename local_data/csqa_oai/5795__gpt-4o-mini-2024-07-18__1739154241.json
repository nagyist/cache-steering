  "query": "Question: Where can customers shop outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: mall\nB: market\nC: the ocean\nD: found in restaurant\nE: bookstore",
  "steps": [
    "First, review the question, which asks where customers can shop outside.",
    "Next, examine the options provided: mall, market, ocean, found in restaurant, and bookstore.",
    "Consider the term \"shopping outside\" and identify venues typically associated with outdoor environments.",
    "The \"mall\" is usually an indoor shopping center, so it wouldn't qualify as outdoor shopping.",
    "The \"market\" can refer to outdoor markets, which are often held outside, allowing for an open-air shopping experience.",
    "The \"ocean\" is not a shopping venue; it's a body of water, so it doesn\u2019t classify as a place to shop.",
    "\"Found in restaurant\" does not represent a shopping location; it's rather ambiguous and does not indicate shopping.",
    "A \"bookstore\" is typically a physical store that is indoors, suggesting it is not an outdoor shopping location.",
    "After analyzing all options, the only one that fits the definition of shopping outside is the market.",
    "Confirm that the conclusion aligns with the question's requirement of \"shopping outside\"."
