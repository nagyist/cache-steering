  "query": "Question: He bought a warranty for the fragile objects just it case they what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sound well\nB: become broken\nC: patch up\nD: disappear from sight\nE: gain speed",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the context of the sentence. The phrase mentions a warranty for fragile objects, suggesting a concern for their condition.",
    "The purpose of a warranty typically involves protection against some form of damage or loss, especially for items that are delicate.",
    "Next, we evaluate the choices available:\n- A: sound well - does not relate to the condition of fragile objects.\n- B: become broken - aligns well with the concept of a warranty for fragile items.\n- C: patch up - implies repairing but does not directly indicate why a warranty would be purchased.\n- D: disappear from sight - does not relate to the physical condition of fragility.\n- E: gain speed - is unrelated to the concept of fragility or warranty protection.",
    "Out of the choices, \"become broken\" not only makes logical sense but also reflects the typical concern regarding fragile objects.",
    "We conclude that the warranty was bought to cover the possibility of damage to these fragile objects."
