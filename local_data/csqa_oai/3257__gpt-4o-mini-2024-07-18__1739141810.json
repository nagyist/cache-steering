  "query": "Question: Where do you find leather horseback riding equipment?\n\nChoices:\nA: car seats\nB: department stores\nC: stable\nD: merry go round\nE: handbag",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what horseback riding equipment entails. It generally includes saddles, bridles, reins, and other gear used for riding horses.",
    "Next, I think about where horseback riding equipment is typically located or sold. It's likely to be found in places associated with horses and riding.",
    "Option A, car seats, seems unrelated as they are primarily meant for vehicles, not for horseback riding.",
    "Option B, department stores, might carry some equestrian items but are not specialized for horseback riding equipment.",
    "Option C, stable, is a location where horses are kept. It would logically have horseback riding equipment available for use or sale.",
    "Option D, merry go round, refers to a carnival ride that doesn't relate to horseback riding equipment.",
    "Option E, handbag, is a personal item used for carrying belongings and has no connection to horseback riding.",
    "Given the analysis, option C is the most appropriate as a stable would logically have leather horseback riding equipment."
