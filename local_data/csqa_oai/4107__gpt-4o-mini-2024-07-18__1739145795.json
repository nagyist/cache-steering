  "query": "Question: The child asked what a mammoth was, so his grandpa got a volume of the what out to show the child?\n\nChoices:\nA: ancient times\nB: excavations\nC: south dakota\nD: encyclopedia\nE: backyard",
  "steps": [
    "The child is asking about a mammoth, which is a prehistoric creature.",
    "To explain what a mammoth is, it's likely the grandpa would use a source that provides comprehensive information on various historical subjects.",
    "Out of the choices given, \"ancient times\" is too vague and doesn't refer to a specific source of information.",
    "\"Excavations\" refers to archaeological digs and would not be a direct source of information about mammoths.",
    "\"South Dakota\" is a location, which may not necessarily provide direct information about mammoths in a generalized context.",
    "\"The backyard\" does not seem to relate to the inquiry about a mammoth at all.",
    "The option \"encyclopedia\" suggests a comprehensive reference work that covers a wide range of topics, including extinct species such as mammoths.",
    "Given that encyclopedias are designed to provide definitive information on various subjects, this would be the most logical choice the grandpa would turn to.",
    "Thus, the best answer that fits the context of the grandpa showing the child information about mammoths is \"encyclopedia\"."
