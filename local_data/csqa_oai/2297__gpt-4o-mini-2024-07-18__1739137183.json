  "steps": [
    "The question asks about marital status after getting a divorce, which implies a change in relationship status.",
    "The term \"marital status\" refers specifically to whether someone is married, single, divorced, etc.",
    "After a divorce, an individual's previous marital status of \"married\" changes to a new status.",
    "With a divorce finalized, an individual cannot still be considered married; instead, they are no longer in that status.",
    "The term that describes the status of someone who is no longer married is \"single.\"",
    "Therefore, after a divorce, the correct term defining an individual's marital status is \"single.\"",
    "The other options provided (B, C, D, and E) do not relate to marital status but rather describe emotional states or feelings following a divorce, which are not the same as marital status.",
    "This confirms that the correct answer should denote the change in marital status rather than emotional impacts."
