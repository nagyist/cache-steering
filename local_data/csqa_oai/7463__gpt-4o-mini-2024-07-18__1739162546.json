  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the crossroads were deserted of traffic\" suggests a place that is not busy or congested with vehicles.",
    "Typically, busy crossroads are found in urban areas or cities where traffic is common.",
    "Deserted crossroads imply a lack of vehicles and possibly a lack of human activity as well.",
    "Considering the options, \"life\" and \"journey\" do not represent physical locations, so they can be eliminated.",
    "The term \"desert\" relates to barren landscapes, but it does not directly associate with crossroads.",
    "The \"countryside\" indicates rural areas which tend to have less traffic compared to cities.",
    "In the countryside, it is plausible to encounter deserted crossroads due to lower population density and fewer vehicles.",
    "Therefore, the best answer should reflect a location where deserted crossroads are more likely to be found.",
    "Comparing \"countryside\" with \"city,\" the countryside fits better with the idea of deserted traffic conditions.",
    "Thus, \"countryside\" is the most suitable choice based on the context provided."
