  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"famous bridge\" that is red, which likely refers to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California.",
    "Considering the bridge's significance, it\u2019s reasonable to associate it with a vacation spot.",
    "The mention of \"highlights of the family vacation\" suggests that the location is a well-known tourist destination.",
    "Out of the options provided, California is a state known for its famous landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge.",
    "The other options (river valley, over water, dentist, neverland) do not fit well as vacation destinations that would prominently feature a red bridge.",
    "Thus, I can infer that California is the logical choice since it houses the specific landmark referenced."
