  "query": "Question: Where can someone keep a small clock?\n\nChoices:\nA: office building\nB: house\nC: department store\nD: lodge\nE: desk",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general purpose of a small clock, which is to keep time and be visible in a certain location.",
    "Next, analyze each option to see if it is a reasonable location for placing a small clock.",
    "Option A: An office building could have many small clocks, but it might not be personal to an individual.",
    "Option B: A house is a private space where people often have clocks in various rooms, making it a common location for a small clock.",
    "Option C: A department store is more of a commercial space where clocks might be displayed for sale rather than kept for personal use.",
    "Option D: A lodge could have a small clock, but it is less common to keep personal items there since it is usually a temporary stay.",
    "Option E: A desk is a specific piece of furniture where small clocks are frequently kept, making it a very suitable option.",
    "Now, compare options B and E. While both are suitable, a house as a general space and a desk as a specific location both allow for a small clock to be kept.",
    "However, considering the aspect of specific versus general, a desk is an actual furniture location for keeping a small clock, while a house is a broad category.",
    "Thus, the most fitting choice for keeping a small clock focuses on the immediate and specific utility, which is best represented by option E."
