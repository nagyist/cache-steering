  "steps": [
    "The question states that their living conditions put restrictions on pet ownership. This suggests that they do not have the space for larger pets.",
    "A small dog is suitable for limited living space, which indicates the importance of the type and size of the dwelling they occupy.",
    "A small apartment is typically associated with limited square footage and minimal outdoor space, making it a likely reason for having only a small dog.",
    "A backyard usually implies a larger property where larger pets might also be permitted, which contradicts the idea of restrictions on pet ownership.",
    "A big house generally provides enough room for various types of pets, contradicting the notion of restrictions.",
    "A living room and especially a mansion do not inherently restrict pet ownership; rather, they suggest that there is enough space for larger pets.",
    "Considering all options, the only situation that aligns with the concept of restrictions on having pets while owning a small dog is living in a small apartment.",
    "None of the other options adequately explain the living conditions where only a small dog is a feasible pet choice."
