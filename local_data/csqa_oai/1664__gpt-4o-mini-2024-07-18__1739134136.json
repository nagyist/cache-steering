    "First, Sean went home to put his groceries away, which suggests he had just returned from shopping.",
    "Next, teabags are typically part of groceries that would be put away somewhere in the kitchen or a pantry.",
    "Among the choices provided, a mug (A) is where tea might be made but not where groceries are typically stored.",
    "A refrigerator (B) is used for perishable items but is not a common storage place for teabags, which are dry goods.",
    "A teapot (C) is where tea is brewed but is not a storage location for teabags.",
    "An internet cafe (D) is unrelated to groceries and does not serve as a storage location.",
    "A cupboard (E) is a standard place to store dry goods, including teabags, in the kitchen.",
