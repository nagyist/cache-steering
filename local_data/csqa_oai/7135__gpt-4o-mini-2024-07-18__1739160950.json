  "query": "Question: What has happened to ice if it is not ice any more?\n\nChoices:\nA: vaporate\nB: cool off\nC: form crystals\nD: melt\nE: keep things cold",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what happens to ice when it is no longer ice.",
    "Ice is solid water, and it can change states due to temperature changes.",
    "If ice is subjected to heat, it will undergo a phase change from solid to liquid.",
    "The process of ice changing to liquid water is known as melting.",
    "The term \"melt\" specifically describes this transformation of solid ice into liquid water.",
    "Option A (vaporate) refers to the process where liquid water changes to gas, which is not the immediate transformation from ice to a non-ice state.",
    "Option B (cool off) does not describe the state change of ice; instead, it suggests a decrease in temperature without indicating a change of state.",
    "Option C (form crystals) implies a process of solidification or crystallization, which does not apply to ice turning into water.",
    "Option D (melt) is the process that occurs when ice turns into liquid water; therefore, it fits the context of the question perfectly.",
    "Option E (keep things cold) is a characteristic of ice, but it does not describe the process of ice no longer being ice."
