  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze each option to find a suitable place for a large clock to be located outside.",
    "A forest is a natural setting, and it typically does not contain large structures like clocks. It's unlikely to have a large clock outside.",
    "An office building often has large clocks as part of its architecture or landscaping, especially in urban areas where they might display the time for pedestrians. This is a possible location for a large clock outside.",
    "A desk is an indoor piece of furniture and would not be an appropriate place for a large clock outside.",
    "A house, while it may have clocks, typically has them indoors. It\u2019s unlikely to have a large clock prominently displayed outside.",
    "A shelf, similar to a desk, is an indoor piece of furniture and would not be an appropriate place for a large clock outside.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the only reasonable option where a large clock could be found outside is an office building."
