  "query": "Question: What happens often when traveling to a new time zone?\n\nChoices:\nA: motion sickness\nB: jet lag\nC: relocation\nD: fatigue\nE: anxious",
  "steps": [
    "When traveling to a new time zone, the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) can be disrupted.",
    "The disruption of the circadian rhythm can lead to a variety of symptoms because the body has not yet adjusted to the new time.",
    "One of the most common symptoms of this disruption is jet lag, which occurs when traveling across multiple time zones.",
    "Jet lag manifests as fatigue, disorientation, and difficulty sleeping, but it specifically refers to the experience of adjusting after a long flight.",
    "While fatigue (option D) is indeed a symptom, it is part of the broader condition known as jet lag.",
    "Motion sickness (option A) is typically related to travel conditions (like flying or driving) rather than time zone changes.",
    "Relocation (option C) refers to permanently moving to a new place and is not directly linked to traveling across time zones.",
    "Feeling anxious (option E) can occur when traveling, but it is not specifically a result of changing time zones in the same way jet lag is.",
    "Given the context of the question, the best option that relates directly to the experience of traveling to a new time zone is jet lag."
