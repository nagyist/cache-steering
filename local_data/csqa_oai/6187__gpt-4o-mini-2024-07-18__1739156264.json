  "query": "Question: If a person isn't being honest they are practicing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: live in poverty\nB: bad feelings\nC: deception\nD: bipolar\nE: schizophrenia",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the meaning of \"not being honest.\" This typically implies that the person is not telling the truth.",
    "Next, when someone is not telling the truth, they are often trying to hide or distort the truth. This behavior suggests a level of manipulation.",
    "The act of hiding or distorting the truth can be categorized under a general term. A suitable term for this would be \"deception,\" which specifically pertains to changing or hiding the truth.",
    "Now, I can examine the options provided. I need to find a term that aligns with the idea of being dishonest.",
    "Option A, \"live in poverty,\" does not relate to dishonesty.",
    "Option B, \"bad feelings,\" is also unrelated to the concept of honesty or deception.",
    "Option C, \"deception,\" directly relates to the act of being dishonest and aligns perfectly with my earlier reasoning.",
    "Option D, \"bipolar,\" refers to a mental health condition and does not connect with honesty or dishonesty.",
    "Option E, \"schizophrenia,\" is another mental health diagnosis and similarly does not fit the context of the question.",
    "Since option C, \"deception,\" is the only option directly tied to not being honest, it is the correct choice."
