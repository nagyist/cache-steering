  "steps": [
    "First, if Brian received word that he was called back to active service, it implies that he is required to return to military duties.",
    "Second, the phrase \"called back to active service\" typically means that a soldier needs to fulfill his obligations and prepare to go back to his unit.",
    "Third, soldiers are usually required to report to their base or the location specified in the orders upon being called back.",
    "Fourth, among the choices provided, \"report for duty\" directly corresponds to the action a soldier must take after being called back.",
    "Fifth, while waiting for orders or receiving orders are part of the process, they are not the immediate action he has to take.",
    "Sixth, the options \"fight for freedom\" and \"obey\" do not directly indicate the required action after being notified of active service.",
    "Thus, the most relevant and immediate action for Brian after being called back is to \"report for duty.\""
