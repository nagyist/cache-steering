  "query": "Question: Steve needed a place to sleep so he asked around and found a place to stay.  Where might he be staying?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: friend's house\nC: tent\nD: outside\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of someone needing a place to sleep, which suggests they are looking for a shelter or temporary accommodation.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices: an apartment typically implies a more permanent residency, which may not suit the idea of someone urgently needing a place to stay.",
    "I consider the option of a friend's house. It is quite plausible for someone to stay at a friend's place for a short period, making this a strong possibility.",
    "Then, I evaluate the choice of a tent. While it is a valid option for temporary shelter, it might not be what someone first considers when reaching out for a place to stay.",
    "Next, I look at the option of staying outside. This typically indicates a lack of choices rather than a preferred option for sleeping.",
    "I also consider the living room option. While it is a place within a house, the phrasing suggests a more personal space rather than a temporary arrangement.",
    "After evaluating the rationale behind each choice, the idea of staying at a friend's house feels the most natural for someone seeking a place quickly.",
    "I re-check to ensure I haven't overlooked any significant implications of each choice. The urgency implied in the question supports a casual arrangement, reinforcing the likelihood of staying with a friend.",
    "Considering all these elements, I eliminate the less favorable options and confirm that the most reasonable answer is staying at a friend's house."
