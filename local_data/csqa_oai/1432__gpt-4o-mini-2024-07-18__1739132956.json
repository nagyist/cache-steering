  "query": "Question: What doorway is likely to have a large wooden door?\n\nChoices:\nA: home\nB: airport\nC: skyscraper\nD: castle\nE: every building",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what a large wooden door typically signifies in terms of construction and aesthetics. Large wooden doors are often used in buildings that have a traditional, grand, or sturdy appearance.",
    "Next, I examine the options provided. \"Home\" could have large wooden doors, but they are generally not as large or prominent as those found in more grand structures.",
    "Now, looking at \"airport,\" it's uncommon for airports to feature large wooden doors, as they typically use metal and glass for modern design and security.",
    "Next, \"skyscraper\" doesn\u2019t usually have large wooden doors either; they tend to have glass or metal entrances to suit contemporary architecture.",
    "Next, I focus on \"castle.\" Castles are often associated with large wooden doors, especially in historical contexts, as they were designed for defense and grandeur.",
    "Lastly, \"every building\" is too broad of a statement. While many buildings can have wooden doors, not every building will have the features that make a door large or prominently wooden.",
    "Considering all these points, the most logical answer that specifically fits the criterion of having a large wooden door is \"D: castle.\""
