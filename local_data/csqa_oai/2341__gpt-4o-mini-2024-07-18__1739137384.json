  "query": "Question: If you started killing people for no reason, what are you likely to lack?\n\nChoices:\nA: prison sentence\nB: going to jail\nC: feelings of guilt\nD: die\nE: hunger",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies a scenario where a person is committing murder without any justification or motive.",
    "One possible outcome of killing people without any reason is a lack of feelings of guilt, as the act itself suggests a detachment from normal moral considerations.",
    "Option A (prison sentence) would typically follow such actions, meaning that one would fairly expect to be penalized if caught, which is contrary to the idea of not feeling guilt.",
    "Option B (going to jail) also is a consequence likely to occur if one is caught after committing such acts, and it suggests accountability, implying the presence of guilt.",
    "Option D (die) does not directly relate to the lack of something; it describes a potential consequence rather than a psychological or emotional state.",
    "Option E (hunger) is unrelated to the mental state of guilt or lack thereof, as hunger pertains to a physical condition rather than moral or emotionality.",
    "Thus, after weighing the options, it seems logical that in the context of casually killing without reason, a person would likely lack guilt."
