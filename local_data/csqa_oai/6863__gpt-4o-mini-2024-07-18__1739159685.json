    "The question presents a scenario where people are helping others without expecting anything in return.",
    "To analyze this behavior, we need to consider the motivations behind helping others without expecting reciprocation.",
    "If individuals are helping out of kindness and a desire to support others without any ulterior motives, this suggests a selfless attitude.",
    "The term \"altruistic\" describes actions taken to benefit someone else without regard for oneself, often associated with genuine goodwill.",
    "On the other hand, the term \"naive\" implies a lack of experience or judgment, suggesting that such behavior may overlook potential manipulation.",
    "The options \"deceptive\" and \"cruel\" do not match the description, as they imply harmful or misleading intentions.",
    "The option \"weird\" might suggest something abnormal or outside the norm, which is not appropriate for a kind act of helping.",
    "Considering all the options, the most fitting term for people who help others without expecting anything in return is \"altruistic.\""
