  "query": "Question: Where might students have to attend more than one period?\n\nChoices:\nA: end of line\nB: math\nC: end of sentence\nD: school\nE: history",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which involves students and periods.",
    "\"Periods\" typically refer to class sessions in schools.",
    "Consider the options given: A: end of line, B: math, C: end of sentence, D: school, E: history.",
    "Options A, C do not relate to school or class structures; they refer to grammar and writing.",
    "Options B (math) and E (history) are specific subjects that students might study.",
    "However, these subjects alone don't imply attending more than one period; they could be part of a daily schedule with multiple classes.",
    "Option D (school) logically relates to the setting where students attend multiple classes (or periods) throughout the day.",
    "In most educational systems, students typically attend a series of classes across different subjects, thus they attend multiple periods at school.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable answer that encompasses multiple periods for students is \"school.\""
