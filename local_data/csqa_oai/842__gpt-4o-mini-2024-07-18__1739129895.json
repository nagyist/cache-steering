  "query": "Question: Where is disease often spread but shouldn't be?\n\nChoices:\nA: ghost town\nB: third world country\nC: human body\nD: rug\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what is meant by \"disease often spread but shouldn't be.\" This suggests we are looking for a location or scenario where diseases are transmitted more frequently than desired or logically expected.",
    "Next, consider each of the options given and analyze their characteristics regarding the spread of disease.",
    "Option A, \"ghost town,\" is generally deserted, implying lower chances of disease spread, rather than an area where spread is unwanted.",
    "Option B, \"third world country,\" could imply a higher prevalence of diseases, but it is not indicative of a place where diseases should not be spread; lower health resources often contribute to the spread.",
    "Option C, \"human body,\" is naturally where diseases occur and can be spread, suggesting that while it is a common venue for disease spread, it often involves immune response and health management.",
    "Option D, \"rug,\" is a inanimate object, yet it can harbor germs; however, it is not a typical \"spread\" area in the same manner as a living being.",
    "Option E, \"hospital,\" is traditionally associated with healing but paradoxically can be a site for the spread of hospital-acquired infections, making it a space where disease spread is indeed unwanted.",
    "Upon reevaluating, both options C and E fit the criteria. However, hospitals are designed for care and prevention of diseases, making disease spread therein particularly undesirable.",
    "Comparing C (human body) and E (hospital), the latter more directly showcases unexpected disease spread due to many susceptible individuals."
