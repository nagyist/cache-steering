  "query": "Question: John heard loud noise coming from below him, which was perfectly normal.   It always happened this time of day.  He really hated living here.  Where did he live?\n\nChoices:\nA: upstream\nB: roof\nC: aloft\nD: upstairs\nE: upwards",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question indicates that John hears loud noises from below him, which is a common occurrence at a certain time of day.",
    "The phrase \"perfectly normal\" suggests that the noise is expected and part of the daily routine, indicating that it comes from a location beneath John.",
    "The word \"hated\" indicates that John is not pleased with his living situation.",
    "We need to find a term that describes a location where he could be positioned above something making noise.",
    "The choice \"upstream\" (A) relates to water flow and is not applicable to living situations.",
    "The choice \"roof\" (B) suggests being at the highest point of a building but doesn't logically connect with the idea of noise coming from below.",
    "The choice \"aloft\" (C) is a general term for being high up but does not specifically imply a dwelling.",
    "The choice \"upstairs\" (D) describes a location in a multi-level building above another floor where noises could reasonably come from below.",
    "The choice \"upwards\" (E) refers to a direction rather than a location and does not fit the context of where John lives.",
    "Given the analysis, the only option that fits all the contextual clues about living above noisy activities is \"upstairs.\""
