  "steps": [
    "The question describes someone who has been lying to many people and the consequences of those lies.",
    "The possible answers need to be evaluated in the context of the emotional and social outcomes likely resulting from lying.",
    "Option A: \"lack of confidence\" - While lying might affect someone's confidence, the immediate consequence of lying typically involves more external factors.",
    "Option B: \"problems\" - This is a vague option and seems to encompass the situation but does not specifically address what the subject feels or experiences as a result of the lies.",
    "Option C: \"being fired\" - This is a specific outcome, but it is contingent upon the nature of the lies and their context, which we cannot definitively conclude from the information provided.",
    "Option D: \"hurt feelings\" - This could be a direct consequence for those being lied to, but it does not necessarily address the internal consequence for the person who was lying.",
    "Option E: \"feeling guilty\" - Lying typically leads to a sense of guilt, as the individual becomes aware of the dishonesty and the negative impact it has on others.",
    "Among all the options, \"feeling guilty\" seems to be the most direct and likely result of the act of lying to many people, affecting the liar most acutely.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice reflecting the consequences of the described behavior is option E."
