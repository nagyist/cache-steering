  "query": "Question: The fat man wanted to make a change in his life and make sure it stayed what?\n\nChoices:\nA: concretely\nB: permanent\nC: remain stable\nD: stagnant\nE: constant",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the fat man wanted to make a change in his life, which implies that he is looking for a significant and lasting transformation rather than a temporary one.",
    "The phrase \"make sure it stayed\" indicates his desire for this change to last over time, implying stability or permanence after the initial change.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, we need to consider which choice aligns with the idea of lasting change.",
    "Choice A, \"concretely,\" does not fit the context, as it doesn't convey the essence of permanence.",
    "Choice B, \"permanent,\" directly suggests that the change the fat man wants to make should be lasting and not temporary.",
    "Choice C, \"remain stable,\" could imply some degree of lasting quality but does not directly convey the idea of a fundamental change being made to last.",
    "Choice D, \"stagnant,\" has a negative connotation of not moving or changing, which contradicts the idea of making a change.",
    "Choice E, \"constant,\" suggests something that doesn\u2019t change, but again doesn't quite capture the transformative aspect implied in the phrase \"make a change.\"",
    "After analyzing all the choices, it becomes clear that \"permanent\" is the strongest candidate as it captures both the desire for change and the wish for that change to endure over time."
