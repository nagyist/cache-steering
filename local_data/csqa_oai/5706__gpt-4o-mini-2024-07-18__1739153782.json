  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what an \"odd number\" is. An odd number is any integer that cannot be divided evenly by 2, meaning it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.",
    "Next, we should look for the term that describes numbers which can be evenly divided by 2. This kind of number is referred to as an \"even number.\"",
    "Now, we can evaluate the given choices to find the term that describes this concept of a number being evenly divisible by 2, which would serve as the opposite of an odd number.",
    "Choice A, \"expected,\" does not relate to numbers and does not have a mathematical meaning relevant to odd or even numbers.",
    "Choice B, \"even,\" fits our requirement since it directly describes numbers that are not odd but rather divisible by 2 without a remainder.",
    "Choice C, \"irregular,\" does not correspond to the concept of odd or even numbers in mathematics.",
    "Choice D, \"habitual,\" is unrelated to number classification, and it has no mathematical context.",
    "Choice E, \"regular,\" also does not have relevance in terms of categorizing numbers as odd or even.",
    "After analyzing all the options, only choice B directly provides a numerical classification that serves as the opposite of an odd number."
