  "query": "Question: Billy and Marge were a couple.  They weren't serious and they didn't get frisky, but they always enjoyed going and doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: dance\nB: marry each other\nC: french kissing\nD: make sex\nE: plan to marry",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy and Marge weren't serious, which implies that their relationship did not involve deep romantic elements or physical intimacy.",
    "Since it mentions they \"didn't get frisky,\" that indicates a lack of physical affection, such as sexual activities or intimate gestures like kissing.",
    "The phrase \"always enjoyed going and doing\" suggests they participated in activities together that were enjoyable but not romantic in nature.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, anything that implies serious commitment or intimacy, such as \"marry each other,\" \"french kissing,\" \"make sex,\" or \"plan to marry,\" does not align with the description of their relationship.",
    "The only option that remains that aligns with their enjoyment of doing activities together is \"dance.\" This is typically a social activity that couples can enjoy without deep romantic involvement.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that their activities together were light-hearted and fun, rather than serious or intimate."
