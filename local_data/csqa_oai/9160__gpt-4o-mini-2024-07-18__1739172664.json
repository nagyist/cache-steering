  "query": "Question: Where would you put an electric razor to protect it from water?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: k mart\nC: medicine cabinet\nD: man's suitcase\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environment of each option. An electric razor needs to be protected from water, which can damage its components.",
    "Next, the bathroom (Option A) is generally a high-moisture area, as it's where people shower and wash, so putting an electric razor there would not be wise.",
    "Moving to K Mart (Option B), while it\u2019s a store where you can purchase items, it does not provide a storage solution for protecting an electric razor.",
    "Now, let's think about the medicine cabinet (Option C). It is often located in the bathroom but offers a closed-off space that can protect items from direct water exposure, making it a more suitable option than leaving it out in the open.",
    "Considering the man's suitcase (Option D), while it could shield the razor from water temporarily, the suitcase would not be a practical daily storage solution, nor would it ensure consistent protection from moisture exposure.",
    "Lastly, the refrigerator (Option E) is not a logical storage place for an electric razor; this could lead to food contamination issues, and it does not provide relevant protection from water.",
    "Now compare the remaining viable options: Option C (medicine cabinet) definitely provides better protection than using the suitcase or other locations.",
    "Since it is crucial to keep the electric razor in a dry place where it won't be at risk from water, Option C stands out as the best choice."
