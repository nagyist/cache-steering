  "query": "Question: When someone moves to another state, they are what from you?\n\nChoices:\nA: there\nB: nearby\nC: far\nD: in sight\nE: being here",
  "steps": [
    "When someone moves to another state, they are likely no longer living in close proximity to you.",
    "The term 'nearby' implies being close in distance, which is typically not the case when someone relocates to another state.",
    "The term 'there' suggests that they are located in a different place, but it does not indicate distance.",
    "The term 'far' indicates a significant distance, which makes sense if someone moves to another state.",
    "'In sight' implies they are visible or within your line of sight, which is not applicable if they have moved to another state.",
    "'Being here' suggests that they are still physically present in your location, which contradicts the fact that they have moved away.",
    "After analyzing the choices, 'far' seems the most appropriate, as moving to another state generally means they are at a considerable distance from you."
