  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Sarah aimed to surprise her husband but failed in doing so. This suggests that something about the trip was already known to him.",
    "Looking at the options, we need to find a choice that indicates prior knowledge or awareness of the trip.",
    "Option A, \"predictable,\" implies that the trip was foreseeable, but it doesn't strongly indicate that he knew about the specifics.",
    "Option B, \"known about,\" directly suggests that her husband had prior knowledge of the trip, which is crucial for understanding why the surprise failed.",
    "Option C, \"bland,\" does not relate to the failure of the surprise and doesn't indicate knowledge of the trip.",
    "Option D, \"bought tickets,\" implies that he might have been involved in planning rather than just knowing about the trip. Such involvement would make the surprise harder to execute but still does not emphasize prior awareness broadly.",
    "Option E, \"sneaky,\" suggests deceitfulness but does not connect directly to knowledge of the trip and therefore doesn't fit the context of the surprise.",
    "Given that Sarah's surprise failed because her husband was already aware of the trip, option B, \"known about,\" is the most fitting answer that directly addresses the reason for the failure."
