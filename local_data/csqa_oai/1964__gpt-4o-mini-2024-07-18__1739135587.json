  "query": "Question: What place has many coasts and is a place where you could find a sloth?\n\nChoices:\nA: commercial\nB: costa rica\nC: dictionary\nD: civil service\nE: paraguay",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what types of places are known for having coasts. Coastal areas are typically near oceans, seas, or large lakes.",
    "Next, I consider locations that are associated with sloths. Sloths are native to Central and South America, particularly in tropical rainforests.",
    "Now, I will examine each of the choices provided to see which one has coastlines and is known for sloths.",
    "Choice A, \"commercial,\" does not refer to a geographic location, so it can be ruled out.",
    "Choice B, \"costa rica,\" is a Central American country that has coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It is also well-known for its biodiversity, including sloths.",
    "Choice C, \"dictionary,\" again does not refer to a geographic location, so it can also be ruled out.",
    "Choice D, \"civil service,\" does not point to any geographic location or coastline, making it irrelevant.",
    "Finally, choice E, \"paraguay,\" is a landlocked country in South America. While it does have fauna including sloths, it does not have coastlines.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, \"costa rica\" stands out as the only option with both coastlines and a habitat for sloths."
