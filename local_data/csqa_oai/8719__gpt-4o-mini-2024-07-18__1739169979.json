  "query": "Question: Where would you find out what a lemur is?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: hole\nC: wilderness\nD: dictionary\nE: sunshine",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the term \"lemur.\" A lemur is a type of primate that is primarily found in Madagascar.",
    "Next, consider where one might go to learn about animals in general, including lemurs. Options like a zoo or wildlife reserve come to mind, but let's focus on the provided choices.",
    "Among the choices, \"wilderness\" might suggest a natural habitat where lemurs live, but it does not specifically provide information about what a lemur is.",
    "\"House\" and \"hole\" are irrelevant as they do not pertain to any context of learning about animals.",
    "\"Sunshine\" is also not relevant; it relates to weather rather than educational content about animals.",
    "This leads us to examine \"dictionary,\" which is a resource for definitions and information about words and their meanings, including that of \"lemur.\"",
    "Therefore, if you want to find out what a lemur is, the most straightforward answer among the options provided would be to refer to a \"dictionary.\""
