  "query": "Question: What meal usually has carrots and mostly leafy vegetables?\n\nChoices:\nA: cellar\nB: salad\nC: store\nD: refrigerator\nE: soup",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the types of meals that typically include carrots and leafy vegetables.",
    "Carrots are known as a crunchy vegetable and are often paired with leafy greens in various dishes.",
    "Now, narrow down the choices provided, focusing on those that can contain both carrots and leafy vegetables.",
    "A salad is a common dish that includes a variety of vegetables, including leafy greens and often carrots for added flavor and nutrition.",
    "Next, consider what the other options represent:\n- Cellar refers to a place for storage, not a meal.\n- Store is also a location, not applicable to meals.\n- Refrigerator is an appliance for storing food, not a meal.\n- Soup can contain vegetables, but typically is more liquid-based and the use of leafy vegetables isn\u2019t as prominent as in salads.",
    "Thus, salad stands out as the meal that predominantly features both carrots and leafy vegetables.",
    "After analyzing all options and their relevance to the question, the answer is clearly related to option B."
