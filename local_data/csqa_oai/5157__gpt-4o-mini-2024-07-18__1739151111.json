  "query": "Question: Where can one find a wide variety of chocolate?\n\nChoices:\nA: candy store\nB: box\nC: drug store\nD: movies\nE: christmas stocking",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations that typically sell or contain chocolate.",
    "A candy store is specifically designed to sell various types of candy, including a wide range of chocolates, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A box can contain chocolates, but it is not a place or location where one can find a variety of chocolates.",
    "A drug store may sell a limited variety of chocolate, but it is not primarily known for offering a wide selection.",
    "The movies may sell chocolate snacks, like chocolate bars or candies, but again, the variety would be limited compared to other options.",
    "A Christmas stocking can be filled with chocolates as a festive treat, but it\u2019s not a place to find a wide variety.",
    "Since a candy store is explicitly focused on candy, including many varieties of chocolate, it is the best option among the choices.",
    "Reevaluating the other options confirms that they do not match the criteria of offering a wide variety of chocolate like a candy store does."
