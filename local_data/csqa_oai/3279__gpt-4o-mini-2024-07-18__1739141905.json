  "query": "Question: These days, what is the one place you are guaranteed to find a telephone?\n\nChoices:\nA: television\nB: party\nC: friend's house\nD: office\nE: desktop",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider where telephones are commonly found today.",
    "Televisions generally do not have telephones integrated into them, though smart TVs may have communication features.",
    "Parties usually feature social gatherings where telephones may be present, but there's no guarantee that every guest will have a phone or that a phone will be available.",
    "A friend's house could have a phone, but it depends on individual circumstances, such as whether they have a landline or a mobile phone available.",
    "An office typically has telephones available as they are a standard means of communication within professional settings.",
    "Desktops mostly refer to computers and while they can facilitate communication through applications, they don't inherently guarantee the presence of a telephone device.",
    "Among the options, the office is the most reliable place to find a telephone, as phones are generally used in this environment for communication.",
    "I will compare my conclusion about the office with the other options one more time to ensure accuracy.",
    "The friend's house is less certain, a party doesn\u2019t guarantee a phone, desktop also doesn\u2019t imply a telephone device, and television doesn\u2019t have phones integrated.",
    "Therefore, the office stands out as the location where a telephone can still be expected without doubt."
