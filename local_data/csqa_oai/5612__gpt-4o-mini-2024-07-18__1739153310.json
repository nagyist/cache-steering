  "query": "Question: Where is a large city hall usually located?\n\nChoices:\nA: detroit\nB: major city\nC: downtown area\nD: dallas\nE: towns",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the common location of a large city hall.",
    "City halls are typically important government buildings that serve as the administrative center for a city.",
    "They are often situated in locations that are easily accessible to the public and are symbolically significant.",
    "Large cities usually have a designated area known as the \"downtown\" where major government and commercial buildings are located.",
    "In most cities, the downtown area is the hub of activity, making it a prime spot for city halls.",
    "Given this context, the downtown area is likely where many large city halls are found.",
    "While options A (Detroit) and D (Dallas) refer to specific cities, and E (towns) refers to smaller municipalities, they do not generalize the location of city halls effectively.",
    "Option B (major city) could imply that a city hall is located in such cities but does not specify a location within it.",
    "Comparatively, option C (downtown area) explicitly states a common location within major cities for large city halls.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing all options, the most appropriate answer that directly addresses the question is option C: downtown area."
