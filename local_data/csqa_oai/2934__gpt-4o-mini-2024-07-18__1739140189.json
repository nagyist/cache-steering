  "query": "Question: The toilet were somewhat built into the suits of the zero gravity travelers on the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: aircraft\nB: space shuttle\nC: stadium\nD: restaurant\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"zero gravity travelers,\" which implies a setting related to space or outer space travel.",
    "In space travel, especially for long durations, certain amenities are adapted for weightlessness, including toilets.",
    "Among the given choices, \"aircraft,\" \"space shuttle,\" \"stadium,\" \"restaurant,\" and \"bathroom,\" we need to identify which is relevant to zero gravity travel.",
    "\"Aircraft\" does not generally deal with zero gravity as it operates within the Earth's atmosphere.",
    "\"A space shuttle\" is specifically designed for travel in outer space and would be applicable for zero gravity scenarios.",
    "\"Stadium,\" \"restaurant,\" and \"bathroom\" do not inherently relate to zero gravity travel as they refer to terrestrial locations or functionalities.",
    "Since the toilet was built into the suits of zero gravity travelers, it is most logically associated with a space shuttle, which is directly linked to space and zero gravity experiences.",
    "Concluding from the above steps, the logical answer that best fits the context of zero gravity travelers is \"space shuttle.\""
