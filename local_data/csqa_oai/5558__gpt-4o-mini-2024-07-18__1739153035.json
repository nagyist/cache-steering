  "query": "Question: If I am working in a ticket booth and a livestock competition is happening nearby, where am I likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: amusement park\nB: auditorium\nC: orpheum\nD: fairgrounds\nE: venue",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what type of event typically has a livestock competition. Livestock competitions are commonly associated with fairs, exhibitions, and agricultural events.",
    "Next, I analyze the provided choices. An amusement park is more oriented towards rides and entertainment, which doesn\u2019t typically include livestock competitions.",
    "An auditorium primarily hosts concerts, speeches, and other performances, which again doesn\u2019t align with a livestock competition.",
    "The term \"orpheum\" specifically refers to a type of theater and is not related to livestock or agricultural events.",
    "The term \"venue\" is very general and can refer to any location for events, but it lacks specificity regarding livestock competitions.",
    "Finally, I focus on the option \"fairgrounds.\" Fairgrounds are specifically designed to host various events, including livestock competitions, agricultural shows, and fairs.",
    "Given the context of working in a ticket booth and the nature of the event, \"fairgrounds\" aligns perfectly with both a livestock competition and ticket sales."
