  "query": "Question: What do I cook on the stove when I want to make tacos?\n\nChoices:\nA: brown meat\nB: mexico\nC: open can\nD: bake bread\nE: warm food",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what is typically involved in making tacos.",
    "Tacos generally require a protein or meat component, which is often cooked on the stove.",
    "I recall that brown meat is a common step in preparing taco filling, such as ground beef or turkey.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the other options:\n- \"Mexico\" is a country and does not relate to cooking directly.\n- \"Open can\" might refer to using canned ingredients, but does not specify any cooking process.\n- \"Bake bread\" is unrelated as tacos do not involve baking bread on the stove.\n- \"Warm food\" is too vague and does not pinpoint a specific action related to taco preparation.",
    "Given the above analysis, the most relevant option to cook on the stove when making tacos is \"brown meat.\""
