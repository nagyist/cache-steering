  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to get food for most people?\n\nChoices:\nA: fridge\nB: oven\nC: supermarket\nD: kitchen\nE: table",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the options provided for places to get food.",
    "The options are: fridge, oven, supermarket, kitchen, and table.",
    "I consider the function of each place in relation to food. The fridge is primarily for storing food, not obtaining it.",
    "The oven is used to cook food, thus it is not a place to get food directly.",
    "The kitchen is typically a location where food is prepared and stored but not primarily where food is obtained (in a general sense).",
    "The table is often where food is served but does not serve as a source to obtain food itself.",
    "The supermarket is a place where people go to purchase food items and therefore offers a variety of food options.",
    "Since the question asks for a good place to get food, the supermarket stands out as the most appropriate choice among all the options.",
    "I verify that the supermarket is accessible for most people, making it a widely accepted answer."
