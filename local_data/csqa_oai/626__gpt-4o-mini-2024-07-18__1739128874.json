  "query": "Question: Where does a shadow usually appear?\n\nChoices:\nA: suface of moon\nB: building\nC: bridge\nD: ground\nE: bright light",
  "steps": [
    "First, a shadow is created when an object blocks light from a source.",
    "Next, shadows can appear on various surfaces depending on the position of the light source and the object.",
    "Common surfaces where shadows are cast include the ground and walls of buildings.",
    "The options provided include several surfaces, but we need to identify the most typical place for a shadow to appear.",
    "Among the choices, the \"ground\" is the most common surface for shadows to appear, especially when created by sunlight.",
    "While buildings can also have shadows, they usually cast shadows onto the ground and are not a primary surface for a shadow.",
    "Bridges also cast shadows, but again, those shadows fall onto the ground or surface beneath them.",
    "The moon is not a typical location for shadows to appear as it is not a constant light source on Earth.",
    "\"Bright light\" is not a surface, but rather a source; shadows form away from the light source.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the ground is the primary, most straightforward answer for where a shadow usually appears."
