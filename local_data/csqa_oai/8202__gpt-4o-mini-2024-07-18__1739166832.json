  "query": "Question: What separates a snake from other reptiles?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical forest\nB: nest full of babies\nC: scales\nD: no legs\nE: forked tongue",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the distinguishing features of snakes compared to other reptiles. Snakes are a specific subgroup of reptiles.",
    "Next, we consider the common characteristics of reptiles in general. Most reptiles have scales and lay eggs.",
    "Now, we analyze the provided options to see which feature is unique to snakes and not commonly found in other reptiles.",
    "Looking at option A, tropical forests: While many snakes live in tropical forests, this habitat is not exclusive to snakes and does not differentiate them from other reptiles.",
    "Next, option B, nest full of babies: Many reptiles, including some snakes, can lay eggs and have nests, so this does not separate snakes from all reptiles.",
    "Then, we evaluate option C, scales: All reptiles, including snakes, have scales, so this does not distinguish them either.",
    "Now, let\u2019s examine option D, no legs: Snakes notably lack legs, which is a significant difference from most other reptiles like lizards and turtles.",
    "Lastly, we consider option E, forked tongue: While many snakes have a forked tongue, this feature is not universally unique to them, as some lizards also possess forked tongues.",
    "From all the analyses, we find that the characteristic that distinctly separates snakes from other reptiles is the absence of legs."
