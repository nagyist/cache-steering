  "query": "Question: The back courtyard led to a walkout basement, where was it attached to?\n\nChoices:\nA: suburbs\nB: large house\nC: farm house\nD: palace\nE: country estate",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the term \"walkout basement.\" This typically implies that the basement has direct access to the outdoors, which is more common in larger residential properties rather than smaller buildings or some types of apartments.",
    "Next, I analyze the options presented. A \"suburbs\" can refer to a broad area that may include various property types, so it is less specific.",
    "Considering \"large house,\" this fits well with the idea of a walkout basement, as many large homes include basements designed for easy access to the yard or courtyard.",
    "Next, I evaluate \"farm house.\" Farmhouses often have walkout basements due to their spacious plots and design; however, they may not be as common as in large residential houses.",
    "Now, I look at \"palace\" and \"country estate.\" These are both grand properties, which might also include walkout basements, but they suggest grander elements than what may typically be included in a basic description.",
    "I also consider the practical scenarios for a walkout basement leading to the courtyard, which would often be found in a suburban large house since these homes often balance size and residential functionality.",
    "Hence, a walkout basement typically suggests a structure designed for family living, which fits the definition of a \"large house\" well.",
    "Finally, while both \"farm house\" and \"large house\" could potentially apply, I find that \"large house\" is a more universal classification that encompasses a greater variety of homes, making it the best choice."
