  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to see many stars?\n\nChoices:\nA: night sky\nB: outer space\nC: constellation\nD: galaxy\nE: universe",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location where many stars can be seen.",
    "Option A, the night sky, is where we commonly observe stars from Earth during the nighttime.",
    "Option B, outer space, contains a vast number of stars, but we cannot see all of them directly from our vantage point.",
    "Option C, constellation, refers to a pattern made by stars; you see many stars when looking at a constellation, but it\u2019s not a specific location of many stars.",
    "Option D, galaxy, is a large system that contains millions to billions of stars, but it is more abstract in terms of visual observation from Earth.",
    "Option E, universe, contains everything including galaxies, but is again too broad to specify where many stars can be observed from an Earthly perspective.",
    "Comparing the options, the night sky (A) is where we actually see and identify stars regularly, while outer space (B) is where stars exist but are not directly observable in entirety from Earth.",
    "Given the context of the question and the opportunities to see stars, the night sky (A) would be the most appropriate answer."
