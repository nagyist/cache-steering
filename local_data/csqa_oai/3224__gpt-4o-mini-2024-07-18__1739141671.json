  "query": "Question: When you are eating a meal you normally place a cup on this.\n\nChoices:\nA: dishwasher\nB: table\nC: shelf\nD: coaster\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what surfaces are typically used during a meal for placing items such as cups.",
    "The most common surface for dining would be a table, where people sit down to eat.",
    "A dishwasher is not a suitable surface since it is a machine for cleaning dishes, not for placing food or drink during a meal.",
    "A shelf is typically used for storage rather than for placing items during a meal.",
    "A coaster is used to protect surfaces from moisture and might hold a cup, but it is not a primary surface where meals are typically served.",
    "A closet is used for storage and is not a place where meals are eaten.",
    "Given that people generally eat at a table, it is the logical choice for where to place a cup during a meal.",
    "Evaluate the other options: while a coaster can hold a cup, it is not the surface where meals are typically placed.",
    "Hence, the most appropriate answer that aligns with the common eating practice is a table."
