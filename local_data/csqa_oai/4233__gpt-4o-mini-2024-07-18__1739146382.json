  "query": "Question: What would a sick person do if he or she is not treated?\n\nChoices:\nA: get better\nB: train\nC: battle cancer\nD: throw up\nE: take medicine",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the possible outcomes for a sick person who is not treated.",
    "The term \"sick person\" generally indicates an illness that requires medical attention.",
    "If the person is not treated, it is unlikely that they could simply \"get better\" by themselves, especially in cases involving serious illnesses.",
    "Training, or exercising, is generally not advisable for a person who is ill, as doing so could worsen their condition. Thus, option B is unlikely.",
    "Considering option C, \"battle cancer,\" this suggests an active struggle against a serious illness like cancer. However, if not treated, battling cancer may not be feasible since it typically requires medical interventions.",
    "Option D, \"throw up,\" could be a symptom of some illnesses but is not a definitive outcome for all sick people and doesn't encompass all illnesses.",
    "Finally, option E, \"take medicine,\" contradicts the initial premise that the person is not treated, as taking medicine is a form of treatment.",
    "Based on this reasoning, if a sick person is not treated, they are less likely to get better, less likely to train, less likely to effectively battle serious illness, and less likely to take medicine.",
    "The most reasonable conclusion is that they may experience worsened symptoms, which could include throwing up."
