    "Committing perjury involves lying under oath, usually in a legal setting such as a court or during a deposition.",
    "Since perjury is considered a serious offense, it is likely to attract legal consequences.",
    "One potential consequence of committing perjury is arrest, as law enforcement may take action against someone who lies in a legal proceeding.",
    "In addition to arrest, perjury can lead to criminal charges and, if found guilty, the individual could serve a prison sentence.",
    "There are other potential outcomes of committing perjury, such as social repercussions, but the most severe legal ramifications are most significant.",
    "While shame, embarrassment, or tension may accompany the act of committing perjury, they are not as direct or severe compared to legal consequences.",
    "As such, of the options provided, \"arrest\" and \"go to jail\" are the most likely outcomes, but the legal systems focus on arrest first.",
