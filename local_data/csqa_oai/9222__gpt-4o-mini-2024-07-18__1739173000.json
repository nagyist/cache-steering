  "query": "Question: Where is known for a multitude of wedding chapels?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: texas\nC: city\nD: church building\nE: nevada",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general knowledge about locations known for wedding chapels. One place that comes to mind is Las Vegas, which is located in Nevada.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided. Options A (town), B (texas), C (city), and D (church building) do not specifically identify a location known for a multitude of wedding chapels in the same way as a region or state does.",
    "Evaluate option E, which is Nevada. This state is famous for its wedding chapels, particularly in Las Vegas, which is known as a wedding destination.",
    "Compare the options again: while \"city\" (option C) could be interpreted to refer to Las Vegas specifically, it is not as precise as Nevada (option E), which encompasses the entire state known for these chapels.",
    "Consider if there are any other places mentioned in the choices. Texas does have wedding venues, but it is not as prominently recognized for chapels as Nevada is.",
    "Review if multiple chapels interpreting the question could lead to confusion. However, the issue lies specifically with the notion of a large number of wedding chapels being concentrated in a particular known area, which relates back to Nevada.",
    "Reconfirm that the most widely recognized area in the context of wedding chapels is indeed Las Vegas, Nevada.",
    "Conclude that the best answer based on the reasoning is option E, which clearly identifies the state associated with many wedding chapels."
