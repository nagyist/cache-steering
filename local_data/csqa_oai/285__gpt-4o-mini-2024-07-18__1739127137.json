  "steps": [
    "First, I need to interpret the question, which asks for signs of potentially not living soon, implying something related to health or mortality.",
    "I will analyze each option to see if they can be related to a significant health concern or a sign of death approaching.",
    "A: Growing older is a natural process that everyone experiences and doesn't directly indicate that someone might not be living soon.",
    "B: Reproducing is a biological process that generally indicates the continuation of life rather than a sign of nearing death.",
    "C: Shuddering could be associated with various physical conditions, but it is somewhat vague and does not specifically imply impending death.",
    "D: Perspiration is a normal physiological response and doesn't specifically indicate a lack of life or health issues.",
    "E: Palpitations can indicate serious heart issues or distress and could be a sign of a significant health risk that might lead to life-threatening conditions.",
    "Between the options, E seems most closely related to a health condition that could suggest a more immediate risk to life.",
    "I will review my analysis to ensure that E is indeed the correct response based on the context of potential health issues."
