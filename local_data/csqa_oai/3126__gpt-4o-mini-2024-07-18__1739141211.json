  "query": "Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a result that is orders of magnitude larger?\n\nChoices:\nA: written down\nB: divided\nC: added up\nD: multiplied\nE: get headache",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a method to manipulate positive integers to achieve a result that is significantly larger, described as \"orders of magnitude larger.\"",
    "To analyze the options, I will consider the effect of each operation on positive integers.",
    "Option A: \"written down\" does not change the numbers, so it cannot create a larger result.",
    "Option B: \"divided\" would generally reduce the size of numbers unless the divisor is less than one, which is not applicable since we are only dealing with positive integers.",
    "Option C: \"added up\" would increase the size of the resulting number but generally not by \"orders of magnitude\" unless extremely large sums are involved.",
    "Option D: \"multiplied\" clearly increases the size exponentially. For example, multiplying any two positive integers will result in a significantly larger number, especially as the integers increase.",
    "Option E: \"get headache\" does not pertain to a mathematical process but rather describes a possible reaction to math problems.",
    "After evaluating all options, multiplication stands out as the most effective operation for dramatically increasing the size of positive integers."
