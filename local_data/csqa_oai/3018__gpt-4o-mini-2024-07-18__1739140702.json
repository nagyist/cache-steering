  "steps": [
    "The question asks what type of food is a safe bet if no one wants chicken. This suggests looking for alternatives that are generally popular and widely accepted.",
    "First, I will consider the options available: freezer, plate, pizza, beef, and fast food restaurant.",
    "The choices \"freezer\" and \"plate\" do not directly refer to food items; rather, they refer to storage or serving methods. Therefore, these options can be eliminated.",
    "Now, I will look at the remaining options: pizza, beef, and fast food restaurant. I need to consider which of these options is typically more popular.",
    "Pizza is known for being a widely favored meal; it can be customized and is often popular in social situations, making it a likely candidate.",
    "Beef is a popular food option, but it may not be as universally accepted as pizza, especially among vegetarians or those who prefer lighter meals.",
    "Fast food restaurants offer a variety of options, but they can vary widely in what is available; not everyone prefers fast food.",
    "Comparing all three options, pizza stands out as a safe and popular choice that appeals to a wide audience and doesn't depend on the specific context of other food preferences."
