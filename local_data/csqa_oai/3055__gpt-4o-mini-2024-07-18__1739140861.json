  "query": "Question: The lizard looked longingly out of its cage, what was the lizards status?\n\nChoices:\nA: captivity\nB: costa rica\nC: river\nD: encyclopedia\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"looked longingly out of its cage\" suggests that the lizard is confined or restricted in some way.",
    "Captivity refers to being kept in confinement, which aligns with the idea of the lizard being in a cage.",
    "The other options such as Costa Rica, river, encyclopedia, and garden do not directly relate to the idea of being in a cage or confinement.",
    "Costa Rica is a location and does not imply the lizard's status being inside a cage or its confinement.",
    "While a river or garden could theoretically be places where a lizard might live, they do not fit the context of the lizard being in a cage.",
    "An encyclopedia is a book and does not relate to the lizard's status at all.",
    "Since the only option that maintains the idea of confinement is captivity, it is the most logical choice.",
    "Therefore, after reviewing all the options and the reasoning related to the context, the only fitting choice is A: captivity."
