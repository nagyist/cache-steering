  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to find just a few words?\n\nChoices:\nA: books\nB: sentence\nC: newspaper\nD: mouth\nE: ring true",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze each option to understand where just a few words might typically be found.",
    "Option A: books usually contain many pages and thus contain many words, so this option is unlikely to fit.",
    "Option B: a sentence generally consists of a limited number of words, often just a few. This could be a strong candidate.",
    "Option C: newspapers have a lot of articles and information, thus containing many words, so they are less likely to have just a few words.",
    "Option D: the word \"mouth\" doesn't provide a context for words; it could contain any number of words depending on the situation.",
    "Option E: \"ring true\" is a phrase that also consists of only a few words, but it does not fit the broader context as well as a sentence does.",
    "Comparing option B and option E, while both can have a limited number of words, option B stands out because it explicitly references a sentence, which is fundamentally structured to be concise.",
    "Thus, option B seems to be the best answer since a sentence is specifically known to contain just a few words, fulfilling the context of the question."
