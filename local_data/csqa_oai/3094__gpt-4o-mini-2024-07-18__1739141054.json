  "query": "Question: The referee wasn't specialized in one thing. He refereed many games.  He was offered a job but wasn't sure what it would be.  What did he know it would be?\n\nChoices:\nA: side with opponent\nB: football\nC: hockey game\nD: part two boxers\nE: sporting event",
  "steps": [
    "The referee is described as someone who referees many games, indicating a level of versatility and experience in officiating different types of sports.",
    "The statement mentions that he was offered a job but was not sure what it would be, suggesting that the job is related to his officiating experience but does not specify what type of game it involves.",
    "We have to analyze the choices given: A mentions siding with an opponent, which does not relate to officiating; B indicates football, which the referee may or may not specialize in; C specifies a hockey game, which is a possibility; D concerns boxing and suggests a more specific role; E is broader and includes all types of sporting events.",
    "Given that the referee was not specialized in one sport, he likely has the capability to referee different kinds of sporting events, rather than being limited to just one sport.",
    "Choice E, which is \"sporting event,\" is the most inclusive option and aligns with the idea that the referee has refereed various games.",
    "If the job offered to him could encompass any type of event he could officiate, \"sporting event\" would be the correct way to interpret what he would know about the job.",
    "Choices A, B, C, and D are either too specific or unrelated to the breadth of the referee's experience.",
    "Thus, evaluating all the above points, the most relevant and logical conclusion is that he knew the job would relate to a sporting event, given that it is the most comprehensive option."
