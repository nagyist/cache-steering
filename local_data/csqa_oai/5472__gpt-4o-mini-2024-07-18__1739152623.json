  "query": "Question: What should a savvy consumer do when being presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seem too good to be true?\n\nChoices:\nA: exasperation\nB: change of heart\nC: scrutinizing\nD: boredom\nE: read",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves evaluating a situation where a consumer encounters a claim about a product's effectiveness that appears overly optimistic or unrealistic.",
    "A savvy consumer would need to critically assess the situation instead of immediately accepting the claims made.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"scrutinizing\" stands out since it implies a detailed examination or careful analysis of the evidence presented.",
    "\"Exasperation\" indicates frustration but does not encompass a proactive consumer response to evaluate a product's claims.",
    "\"Change of heart\" suggests a shift in opinion or belief without the implication of careful evaluation or consideration of the evidence.",
    "\"Boredom\" implies disinterest and failure to engage with the claims presented, which is not a behavior expected of a savvy consumer.",
    "\"Read\" could suggest engaging with material, but it doesn\u2019t imply the critical evaluation necessary in this context.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate response for a savvy consumer faced with extraordinary claims is to \"scrutinize\" the evidence."
