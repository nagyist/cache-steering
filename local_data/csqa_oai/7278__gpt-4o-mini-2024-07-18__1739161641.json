  "query": "Question: The company printer was out of paper, so the IT guy went and got another what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ream\nB: copy machine\nC: clear out\nD: notebook\nE: stock certificate",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the company printer was out of paper. This suggests that the IT guy needs to get something related to printing.",
    "Looking at the choices, we need to identify which option relates to paper or printing.",
    "Option A is \"ream,\" which refers to a quantity of paper (typically 500 sheets). This directly relates to the need for more paper.",
    "Option B is \"copy machine,\" which is another type of printer but does not directly address the need for paper.",
    "Option C is \"clear out,\" which does not relate to acquiring paper or anything associated with printers.",
    "Option D is \"notebook,\" which is not related to printer paper, as it is a bound collection of paper for writing.",
    "Option E is \"stock certificate,\" which is a legal document and unrelated to the printer or paper supply.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the only option that directly addresses the issue of the printer being out of paper is option A, a ream of paper."
