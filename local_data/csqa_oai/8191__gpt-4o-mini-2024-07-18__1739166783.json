    "Playing cards is a common pastime that provides entertainment, suggesting that the prisoners likely did this to alleviate some negative feelings associated with their situation.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"bored\" stands out as a feeling that can be alleviated by engaging in an activity like playing cards.",
    "The other options like \"afraid,\" \"have fun,\" \"winning,\" and \"good at\" do not directly correlate with the reasoning behind why they play cards to escape their reality.",
    "\"Afraid\" is more about a feeling of fear which isn't directly addressed by the act of playing cards.",
    "\"Have fun\" is a possible outcome of playing cards, but the primary motivation suggested in the question is to prevent boredom.",
    "\"Winning\" and \"good at\" do not relate closely to the basic need to engage in the game for the purpose of avoiding a state; they focus more on the outcome of playing rather than the need to avoid a negative state.",
