  "query": "Question: Where does a television often display sports?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: living room\nC: bar\nD: apartment\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environments where televisions are commonly found and where sports events might be displayed.",
    "Restaurants often have TVs for entertainment, but they are typically focused on dining rather than solely on sports.",
    "Living rooms are common places for family entertainment, including watching sports, but they are private spaces.",
    "Bars are specifically designed to cater to patrons who want to enjoy drinks and often have large TVs for showing sports events.",
    "Apartments, like living rooms, might have televisions, but they are also private spaces and don't necessarily have a focus on sports viewing.",
    "A house may include living rooms or dens where sports can also be watched, similar to apartments, but it's a broader category that might not emphasize sports as much as bars do.",
    "Comparing the environments, bars are more centered on social gatherings that focus on sports, making them a popular choice for displaying sports events.",
    "Thus, while all choices could involve having a television, bars stand out as a location specifically associated with sports viewing."
