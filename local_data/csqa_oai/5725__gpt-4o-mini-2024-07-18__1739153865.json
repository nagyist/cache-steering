  "steps": [
    "Bill has a desire to learn, which indicates he is seeking an educational environment.",
    "He does not know any personal teachers, which suggests he may need a structured setting to find guidance.",
    "The choices presented include options that imply different levels of educational engagement\u2014some are more formal than others.",
    "\"Attend school\" (choice C) implies a formal educational setting where teachers are available.",
    "\"Read book\" (choice D) is a self-directed way to learn, but it lacks interaction with teachers or guidance.",
    "\"Understand better\" (choice B) suggests a goal but does not indicate a location or action Bill could take.",
    "\"Memorize\" (choice A) focuses on rote learning, which again does not provide interaction with educators.",
    "\"Church\" (choice E) might provide some learning opportunities but is not primarily an educational institution.",
    "Based on the need for learning from guided instruction, \"attend school\" is the most appropriate option for Bill given his circumstances."
