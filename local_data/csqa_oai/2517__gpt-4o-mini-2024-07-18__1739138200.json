  "steps": [
    "The context of the question indicates that John and his roommate are playing chess \"between classes,\" which suggests they are in a college or university environment.",
    "Considering that they are likely students, a common place for them to set up a chess game would be within their living space, where they have easy access to the chess set throughout the day.",
    "Options like \"Canada\" do not fit as a location for setting up a chess set, as it refers to a country rather than a specific location relevant to their chess game.",
    "\"Cupboard\" and \"drawer\" refer to storage locations and are unlikely to be places where they would actively play chess. These options imply storing the chess set rather than having it set up for gameplay.",
    "The \"sitting room\" could be a viable option; however, it is less likely for students to have a designated sitting room if they are residing in a dorm.",
    "\"Dorm\" stands out as the most fitting option since students typically have their chess set set up in their dorm rooms or student housing where they can conveniently play during breaks.",
    "To further clarify, the fact that they are making moves between classes suggests a need for a nearby and easily accessible location, supporting the choice of dorm.",
    "Given all the considerations, the most likely answer is that the chess set is set up in their dorm where they can continue their game as needed."
