  "query": "Question: Why is someone likely to use an iron when cleaning clothes?\n\nChoices:\nA: wrinkles\nB: sanitation\nC: attractive appearance\nD: looks good\nE: ruined",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks why someone would use an iron specifically when cleaning clothes, which implies that the focus is on the end result of the ironing process.",
    "The primary function of an iron is to remove wrinkles from clothes, which is a common concern after washing garments.",
    "When clothes are washed, they often come out wrinkled and need to be smoothed out to look presentable, making wrinkle removal a key reason for using an iron.",
    "While sanitation is an important aspect of laundering, it is not directly connected to the act of ironing itself.",
    "The concepts of \"attractive appearance\" and \"looks good\" relate to the result of ironing but are not the primary reason for using the iron. People generally associate ironing with ensuring clothes are wrinkle-free rather than just making them attractive by other means.",
    "The option \"ruined\" is not applicable as ironing is used to repair or improve the condition of clothes rather than being a cause of ruin.",
    "Comparing the relevance of all options presented, \"wrinkles\" is the most direct and relevant reason for the use of an iron."
