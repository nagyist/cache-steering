  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a lizard tries to warm itself, indicating it seeks a location that absorbs heat from the sun.",
    "Lizards are ectothermic and rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature.",
    "Among the options provided, a \"sunny place\" is the most directly associated with warmth and sunlight, which lizards prefer.",
    "A \"porch\" could be sunny or shady, and thus may not consistently provide warmth.",
    "\"Rocky areas\" could potentially be warm, but they are not guaranteed to provide consistent sunlight exposure.",
    "A \"garden\" could have sunny spots, but it is not explicitly defined as such in the choices.",
    "A \"shady spot\" would imply a lack of sunlight and therefore not a suitable choice for a lizard looking to warm itself.",
    "In evaluating all options, \"sunny place\" stands out as the most appropriate choice for a lizard seeking warmth."
