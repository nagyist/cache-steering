    "The sentence indicates that he is focused on a formula and trying to contemplate it, which suggests a cognitive effort related to mathematics or a problem-solving process.",
    "Since the term \"formula\" is specifically used, it would be reasonable to expect that he would be communicating or recording related content.",
    "The options presented include different terms, some of which do not logically fit contextually with the task of contemplating a formula.",
    "Options A (math) and E (answers) seem related to the context of working with formulas.",
    "\"Math\" (A) refers to the broader subject, whereas \"answers\" (E) suggests specific results or solutions derived from contemplating the formulas.",
    "Considering that one typically fills out answers in relation to questions or formulas, option E might be the most relevant response when contemplating a formula.",
    "While \"think of\" (B) and \"wonder\" (D) are related cognitive processes, they do not fit as well with what he is doing when he is contemplating a formula.",
    "Option C (become distracted) is contradictory to the action of contemplating a formula, as it implies a lack of focus.",
    "Among the options, E (answers) aligns best with the idea of contemplating a formula and subsequently recording the results of that contemplation."
