  "query": "Question: In America, the courthouse of any given town has a likely location, where is it?\n\nChoices:\nA: electrical circuit\nB: getting married\nC: capital city\nD: center of town\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the function of a courthouse in a town. A courthouse is often the center for legal proceedings and public services.",
    "Next, we can think about where such important civic buildings are typically situated. They are usually located in areas that are easily accessible to the public.",
    "In many towns, courthouses are strategically placed in the middle of the town to ensure that they are central to the community.",
    "We should also consider that courthouses serve as a focal point for local governance and legal matters, which indicates that they would be in a prominent, easily recognizable location.",
    "Looking through the answer choices, \"capital city\" refers to a larger geographic area rather than a specific location within a town.",
    "The options \"electrical circuit\" and \"getting married\" are irrelevant to the location of a courthouse, as they do not relate to the physical positioning of civic buildings.",
    "Lastly, the choice \"Michigan\" refers to a state rather than a town and does not indicate a specific location for a courthouse.",
    "Thus, the only choice that logically aligns with the common placement of courthouses in towns is \"center of town\"."
