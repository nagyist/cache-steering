  "query": "Question: If something's weight isn't light, what is it?\n\nChoices:\nA: crucial\nB: darkness\nC: cumbersome\nD: heavy\nE: darkness",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what \"isn't light\" means, we need to consider the various interpretations of \"light\" in this context. One common meaning is referring to weight.",
    "If something isn't light in terms of weight, it suggests that it has substantial weight.",
    "The opposite of something that is light in weight is typically described as \"heavy.\"",
    "Now, we can analyze the choices given in the question: \nA: crucial - relates to importance, not weight.\nB: darkness - unrelated to weight.\nC: cumbersome - implies bulkiness but not necessarily weight.\nD: heavy - directly indicates significant weight.\nE: darkness - again unrelated to weight.",
    "The choice that aligns with the interpretation of \"not light\" as having significant weight is \"heavy.\"",
    "Cumbersome suggests that something is difficult to manage due to its size or shape, not directly indicating weight as \"heavy\" does.",
    "Thus, \"heavy\" fits the description best as it is the precise opposite of \"light\" in terms of weight."
