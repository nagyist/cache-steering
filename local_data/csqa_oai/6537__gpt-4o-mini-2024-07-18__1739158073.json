  "query": "Question: When is a garden the most beautiful?\n\nChoices:\nA: backyard\nB: own yard\nC: full of mud\nD: full bloom\nE: back yard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what makes a garden considered beautiful. Typically, gardens are seen as beautiful when they are colorful, vibrant, and in a thriving state.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options presented. A garden that is \"full of mud\" (C) is generally not seen as beautiful, as mud does not represent growth or color.",
    "The options that mention \"back yard\" (A and E) and \"own yard\" (B) do not inherently imply beauty; they just refer to locations where gardens can be found.",
    "The option \"full bloom\" (D) suggests a time when flowers are at their peak and the garden is likely rich in colors and life, which typically represents beauty.",
    "Comparing the keywords and themes, \"full bloom\" directly emphasizes the visual appeal that defines a garden at its most beautiful state.",
    "Since options A, B, C, and E do not indicate that a garden is in its prime, they can be eliminated in favor of option D.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that a garden is at its most beautiful when it is in full bloom."
