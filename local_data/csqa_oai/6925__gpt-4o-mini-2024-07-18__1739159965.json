    "A \"strapline\" is a term used in advertising and marketing, but it does not relate to a physical object with straps.",
    "A \"chemise\" is a type of garment that can have straps, but it's typically not labeled as having straps that require tightening.",
    "A \"brace\" usually refers to a supporting device for the body or as a term in dental practices; they are not typically known for adjustable straps for tightening.",
