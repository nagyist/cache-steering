  "query": "Question: What causes hard breathing when you are sick\n\nChoices:\nA: live\nB: sigh\nC: blood\nD: respiration\nE: cough",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the symptoms that accompany being sick. Common illnesses often involve respiratory issues that can make breathing difficult.",
    "Next, analyze the potential choice options provided. \"Live\" doesn't directly relate to hard breathing; it is too vague.",
    "\"Sigh\" involves a breath but does not explain a condition causing hard breathing; it seems more like an action rather than a cause.",
    "\"Blood\" plays a role in overall health and oxygen transport but isn\u2019t a direct cause of hard breathing in the context of being sick.",
    "\"Respiration\" refers to the process of taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide, but it\u2019s a broad term that doesn't specify what causes difficulties in breathing when sick.",
    "\"Cough\" is often a symptom experienced during illnesses, particularly those that affect the respiratory system like colds or flu. Coughing can be both a symptom and an involuntary mechanism to clear airways, indicating that one is struggling to breathe.",
    "Thus, out of the choices, \u201ccough\u201d is a direct reaction that correlates with and causes hard breathing during illnesses.",
    "Now, reevaluating the other options: none of them signify a clear connection to the act of having difficulty breathing when ill as cough does.",
    "Therefore, it becomes evident that \"cough\" is the most appropriate answer since it directly relates to the difficulty in breathing experienced during sickness."
