  "steps": [
    "The woman had a dirty plate, and the question asks where she put it.",
    "A dirty plate is typically not put in a kitchen cupboard, as that is for clean dishes.",
    "The choices involve different locations where the woman could potentially place the dirty plate.",
    "Garbage (Choice A) is a possible option but usually, one would first clean a dirty plate rather than discard it if it could still be used.",
    "A flea market (Choice D) is irrelevant, as one would not typically place a dirty plate there.",
    "Placing the dirty plate on a table (Choice C) would be a temporary action if she was preparing to clean it or decide what to do with it.",
    "The dishwasher (Choice E) is a common place to put dirty dishes for cleaning.",
    "Since the question specifically asks where she put it and considering common actions regarding dirty plates, the dishwasher seems the most logical choice.",
    "Now comparing all the options, the dishwasher (Choice E) is the most appropriate place for a dirty plate."
