  "query": "Question: Where can you find an upright piano in a building that you live in?\n\nChoices:\nA: band\nB: living room\nC: college\nD: moving truck\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where an upright piano can typically be found in a building where you live.",
    "An upright piano is a type of piano that is designed to be compact and can fit in smaller spaces, making it suitable for residential settings.",
    "The options given are: A) band, B) living room, C) college, D) moving truck, and E) house.",
    "A \"band\" is not a building where one would typically live, so that option is not suitable.",
    "The \"living room\" is a common area in homes where a piano might be placed for family enjoyment or practice.",
    "\"College\" could imply student housing or shared living spaces, which might have a piano, but it's less common than in personal residences.",
    "The option \"moving truck\" is clearly not a place where a piano would be set up; it is a means of transportation.",
    "Comparing \"living room\" and \"house,\" the former is a specific room where an upright piano can be placed, but a \"house\" is a complete residential building where such pianos are often found.",
    "Since a house encompasses all the rooms within it, including the living room, a house is indeed a more correct and broader answer for where an upright piano is typically found.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer considering all options and typical scenarios is E) house."
