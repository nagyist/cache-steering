  "query": "Question: Where can someone view a county highway as a line?\n\nChoices:\nA: from the sky\nB: map\nC: cross counties by car\nD: country\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what is meant by viewing a county highway \"as a line.\" This suggests a representation that simplifies the highway into a linear format.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices to see which option can provide such a representation.",
    "Choice A: \"from the sky\" implies an aerial view, but it does not necessarily represent the highway as a line; it would show the highway in its actual geographical context.",
    "Choice B: \"map\" is a tool that typically represents roads and highways as lines, making it a strong candidate for representing a county highway as a line.",
    "Choice C: \"cross counties by car\" refers to traveling on highways but does not involve a representation of the highway itself as a line.",
    "Choice D: \"country\" is too vague and does not specifically refer to the representation of highways.",
    "Choice E: \"michigan\" is a specific location, but it does not inherently provide a representation of highways as lines.",
    "Considering the analysis, the most fitting choice that allows for viewing a county highway as a line is the map, as it provides a simplified, abstract representation of the highway."
