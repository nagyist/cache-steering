  "steps": [
    "The question states that a locally owned beauty salon had its grand opening, and there are people hoping for economic benefits.",
    "To boost the economy, we need to determine the context of the location where the beauty salon is situated. The term \"locally owned\" suggests it serves a community nearby.",
    "The options provided are clerk, barber shop, neighborhood, city, and strip mall. We can eliminate some options based on context.",
    "\"Clerk\" does not relate to the concept of an area benefiting economically; it is more of a job title. Hence, option A can be eliminated.",
    "\"Barber shop\" is a type of business but does not refer to the broader area that could experience economic changes. Therefore, option B can also be eliminated.",
    "\"City\" refers to a larger area and while economic benefits may extend to the city, the focus is typically on a more localized impact, which makes this option less fitting as the primary focus of the salon.",
    "\"Strip mall\" could be relevant, but it specifically refers to a type of commercial property rather than the community aspect. While it also might benefit, it does not quite capture the collective area that is more directly impacted.",
    "\"Neighborhood\" captures the essence of a community where the beauty salon could have a direct economic influence. This is consistent with the idea of supporting local businesses impacting local residents.",
    "Given that \"neighborhood\" fits both the context and the focus of the intended economic boost, we conclude that this is the best choice."
