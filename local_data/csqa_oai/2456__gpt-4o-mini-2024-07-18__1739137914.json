  "query": "Question: Where is a pack horse likely to work?\n\nChoices:\nA: women's literature\nB: race track\nC: belmont park\nD: dude ranch\nE: a movie",
  "steps": [
    "A pack horse is typically used for carrying loads, especially in rural or mountainous regions.",
    "Women's literature does not involve horses or packing, so this option is not relevant.",
    "A race track is primarily for horses competing in races, which does not involve packing work.",
    "Belmont Park is a specific race track location renowned for horse racing and is also not related to packing work.",
    "A dude ranch is a type of guest ranch where people can experience Western lifestyle activities, which often includes the use of pack horses for trail rides and outdoor excursions.",
    "Since pack horses are used to carry supplies on trails and are often associated with ranch-style activities, the environment of a dude ranch is suitable for their work.",
    "Comparing the relevance of all the choices, A, B, and C do not pertain to the work of a pack horse, while D directly connects to activities involving pack horses.",
    "E, being a movie environment, is also unrelated to the practical working use of a pack horse.",
    "Thus, the only choice where a pack horse is likely to work is D: dude ranch."
