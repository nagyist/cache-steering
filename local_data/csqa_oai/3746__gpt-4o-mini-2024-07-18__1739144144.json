  "query": "Question: Humans tend to be born two ways, these two ways are what?\n\nChoices:\nA: emotional\nB: very adaptable\nC: left or right handed\nD: male or female\nE: selfish",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the two ways humans tend to be born, we should look at characteristics or classifications that are inherently biological or physical.",
    "The options include various traits: emotional (A), adaptable (B), handedness (C), sex (D), and selfishness (E).",
    "Option A (emotional) does not represent a biological classification but rather a psychological trait, so it's unlikely to be one of the two ways humans tend to be born.",
    "Option B (very adaptable) refers to a general characteristic rather than a specific categorization at birth, and thus is not a valid answer.",
    "Option C (left or right handed) is a physical characteristic related to how individuals use their hands. However, handedness is not a primary method of categorization at birth.",
    "Option D (male or female) refers to biological sex, which is one of the fundamental ways humans are categorized at birth. This is a clear and established classification.",
    "Option E (selfish) is a behavioral trait and does not classify humans at birth. Therefore, it is not a suitable answer.",
    "Since D captures a primary biological classification and C, while relevant to physicality, does not serve as one of the two primary ways humans are categorized at birth, we prioritize D.",
    "Thus, after analyzing the options, it becomes clear that the two ways humans tend to be born can be summarized as related to biological sex."
