  "query": "Question: Where should I not put these boxes if my house is likely to flood?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: cellar\nC: basement\nD: kitchen\nE: attic",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the areas in a house that are most likely to experience flooding.",
    "Common areas that can flood include basements, cellars, and garages since they are often at or below ground level.",
    "The kitchen is typically at ground level but is usually designed to handle some water exposure, making it less risky for flooding.",
    "The attic is located at the highest point of the house, making it the least likely to flood.",
    "From the options available, the garage, cellar, and basement are all potential flooding zones due to their positions relative to the ground.",
    "I need to determine which of these areas poses the highest risk.\"",
    "Basements and cellars are often fully below ground, making them the most vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains or water seepage.",
    "Although garages are also at risk, they might not flood as severely as basements or cellars, which typically collect more water.",
    "Considering I need to avoid placing boxes in areas that could flood, the best option is to select the area with the highest flood risk.",
    "The basement is generally the lowest part of a house and thus has the highest likelihood of flooding."
