  "query": "Question: Where does a furnace usually heat?\n\nChoices:\nA: basement\nB: antarctic\nC: house\nD: cellar\nE: heat building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a furnace is typically used for. A furnace is a device that heats air or water for heating buildings.",
    "Next, consider the typical locations where furnaces are installed. In many homes, furnaces are often located in areas like basements, attics, or utility rooms.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices provided. \"Basement\" (A) is a common place for a furnace, but it is not where it primarily heats.",
    "The term \"antarctic\" (B) does not apply to the function or location of a furnace, as it is a geographic location and not a suitable context for heating.",
    "Looking at \"house\" (C), this is a broad term that encompasses any building where people live, which is indeed the primary purpose of a furnace\u2014to heat the living spaces within a house.",
    "The choice \"cellar\" (D) is similar to basement, but again, it refers to a specific location. It does not encompass the primary function of heating.",
    "Lastly, \"heat building\" (E) is somewhat ambiguous, as it is not a specific location but rather a general idea of what a furnace does.",
    "Given that the furnace is designed to heat spaces where people reside, the most accurate and encompassing answer is \"house\" (C)."
