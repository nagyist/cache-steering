  "query": "Question: Illegitimate designer handbags will not have a certificate of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: actions\nB: legal\nC: authentic\nD: logical\nE: legitimate",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what an illegitimate designer handbag will lack, we need to understand the typical characteristics of legitimate designer products.",
    "Legitimate designer handbags often come with certificates of authenticity, confirming that they are genuine products from the brand.",
    "Illegitimate designer handbags are counterfeits and, therefore, cannot possess a genuine certificate of authenticity from the designer brand.",
    "Looking at the choice options, \"certificate of authentic\" logically follows, as the authenticity is what the certificate represents.",
    "The other options such as \"actions,\" \"legal,\" \"logical,\" and \"legitimate\" do not specifically relate to the documents typically associated with designer products.",
    "Thus, \"certificate of authentic\" directly aligns with what a counterfeit would lack, as it is a definitive marker of legitimacy."
