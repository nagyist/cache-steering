  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of the question, which involves creating a comfortable reading and coffee-drinking area.",
    "Focus on the type of furniture that would typically be placed next to a side chair for support or utility.",
    "Analyze each option provided: \n- A: office - does not fit the context of a reading and coffee-drinking spot.\n- B: library - not typically next to a side chair.\n- C: table - logically fits as a place to hold a coffee cup and perhaps a book or reading material.\n- D: building - not a type of furniture or practical in a reading context.\n- E: coffee shop - while relevant to where one might drink coffee, it doesn't fit next to a side chair in a home setting.",
    "Out of all the options, a \"table\" is the most suitable item to place next to a side chair, serving as a supportive surface.",
    "Conclude that the primary purpose is to enhance the functionality of the space next to a side chair without introducing unrelated concepts."
