  "query": "Question: What usually happens to people who are models?\n\nChoices:\nA: very ugly\nB: appear beautiful\nC: free slaves\nD: pay bills\nE: suffering pain",
  "steps": [
    "We need to analyze what typically occurs in the lives of models, which involves aspects like appearance, societal perception, and lifestyle.",
    "Models are often hired based on their physical appearance, which suggests they are perceived as attractive or beautiful by others.",
    "The industry frequently emphasizes aesthetics, leading to the notion that models represent beauty ideals in various forms (fashion, commercial, etc.).",
    "The choices provided need to be evaluated based on their relation to models' common experiences and societal expectations.",
    "Choice A (very ugly) contradicts the perception of models, who are generally seen as attractive.",
    "Choice B (appear beautiful) aligns with the typical public and industry perception of models, as they are often celebrated for their beauty.",
    "Choice C (free slaves) does not relate to the profession of modeling at all.",
    "Choice D (pay bills) is a mundane responsibility not specifically tied to being a model.",
    "Choice E (suffering pain) might relate to the demands of the modeling industry but does not capture the essence of what models are typically known for.",
    "Thus, among all the choices, B (appear beautiful) is the most fitting representation of models based on their societal role and expectations."
