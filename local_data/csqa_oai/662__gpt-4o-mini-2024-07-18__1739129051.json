  "query": "Question: Where is a road known as a motorway?\n\nChoices:\nA: scotland\nB: europe\nC: race track\nD: new jersey\nE: england",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what a motorway is. A motorway is a high-capacity road designed for fast-moving traffic, usually with multiple lanes and limited access points.",
    "Next, consider where the term \"motorway\" is commonly used. The term is primarily associated with the United Kingdom, particularly in England.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices. Scotland, while part of the UK, has its own regional roads but also recognizes motorways.",
    "In Europe, many countries have similar road systems but do not commonly use the term \"motorway\" universally; the terminology can vary by country.",
    "A race track, usually designed for specific competitive racing, does not qualify as a motorway.",
    "New Jersey, a state in the U.S., has highways and turnpikes but does not use the term motorway.",
    "Therefore, out of the choices presented, the most accurate option is England, where the term \"motorway\" is officially used to describe its unique road system.",
    "Finally, cross-reference the understanding of motorways in Scotland and England\u2014both have them, but England is where the term is predominantly recognized."
