  "query": "Question: What is eating too much dinner likely to result in?\n\nChoices:\nA: tiredness\nB: living longer\nC: stomach ache\nD: illness\nE: acid reflux",
  "steps": [
    "Eating too much dinner often leads to an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach since the body has to work harder to digest the excessive amount of food.",
    "A stomach that is overfull can cause physical pain and discomfort, commonly referred to as a stomach ache.",
    "Tiredness could be a potential result of eating too much, as the body diverts energy to digestion, but it is not as direct as a stomach ache.",
    "Living longer is unlikely to be a result of overindulging at dinner; rather, it may lead to detrimental health effects over time.",
    "Illness could be a broad term, but not all cases of overeating lead to an illness immediately; they could also lead to temporary discomfort.",
    "Acid reflux is another potential issue caused by overeating, as excess food can push against the stomach lining, promoting reflux symptoms.",
    "Among all the options, a stomach ache is the most common immediate consequence of overeating.",
    "While acid reflux is also a close contender, it is more specific and may not occur in everyone who overeats.",
    "Based on the immediate consequences of eating too much, the most likely result is a stomach ache, as it is a common and recognizable outcome."
