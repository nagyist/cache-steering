  "query": "Question: Where can you get a yoyo?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy shop\nB: brother's room\nC: own home\nD: game store\nE: toy store",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the places where yoyos are commonly available for purchase or found.",
    "Recognize that a toy shop is specifically designed to sell toys, including yoyos.",
    "Consider that a brother's room may or may not contain a yoyo, but it is not a guaranteed place to obtain one.",
    "A private home (own home) could potentially have a yoyo, but that depends on previous ownership or purchase; it is not a reliable place to acquire one.",
    "A game store may offer a variety of games and toys, but it is less likely to specialize in traditional toys like yoyos compared to a toy store.",
    "A toy store, like a toy shop, is likely specially stocked with various toys, which would include yoyos, making it a strong candidate for where to find one.",
    "Compare options A (toy shop) and E (toy store), recognizing they essentially refer to the same type of establishment.",
    "Since options A and E are essentially equivalent, they reinforce that a yoyo can be found in such a store.",
    "Conclude that while the brother's room and own home may have existing yoyos, they are not definite outlets for acquiring a yoyo.",
    "Therefore, the most concrete options for obtaining a yoyo are the toy shop and toy store."
