  "query": "Question: The bird took flight by moving its what?\n\nChoices:\nA: two legs\nB: feathers\nC: entertain yourself\nD: head\nE: two wings",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what body part the bird uses to take flight.",
    "When considering the anatomy of a bird, the primary appendages used for flying are its wings.",
    "While birds do have legs, they primarily use them for perching and walking, not for flying.",
    "Feathers are important for flight, but they are not the part that initiates the flight; rather, they assist in the process by providing lift and control.",
    "The head of a bird is important for navigation and balance in flight, but it is not directly involved in the act of taking off.",
    "Given the choices, \"two wings\" specifically refers to the appendages that allow birds to generate lift and fly.",
    "The other options do not accurately answer the question as they do not pertain to the primary means by which a bird takes flight.",
    "Thus, after analyzing the options, the best answer that directly relates to how a bird takes flight is \"two wings.\""
