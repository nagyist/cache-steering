  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"she was in a kitchen of people who just moved in to town.\" This suggests she is in a place associated with new residents.",
    "Since the people just moved into town, it is likely that they would be living in a residential area.",
    "The options provided include home, tree house, friend's house, neighbor's house, and restaurant. A home would typically belong to residents, but the mention of \"people who just moved in\" could imply she is not in her own home.",
    "A tree house is less likely to have a full kitchen, making that option less suitable in this context.",
    "The option of a restaurant implies a public place, which is not consistent with the idea of being in the home of new residents.",
    "The term \"kitchen\" implies a private dwelling, which aligns more with options like \"home,\" \"friend's house,\" or \"neighbor's house.\"",
    "Friends can also live in the area, making \"friend's house\" a possibility. However, saying \"people who just moved in\" might imply they are neighbors.",
    "Considering \"neighbor's house,\" it is logical that she could be visiting neighbors who are new to the area.",
    "The final choices are thus narrowed down to either \"friend's house\" or \"neighbor's house.\" The context of new residents leans more toward the neighbors."
