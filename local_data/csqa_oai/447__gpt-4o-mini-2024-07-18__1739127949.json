  "query": "Question: Where might a yard be tiny?\n\nChoices:\nA: farmland\nB: neighborhood\nC: city\nD: property\nE: subdivision",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of where yards are typically found. Yards are commonly associated with residential properties, which can exist in various settings such as cities, neighborhoods, subdivisions, and farmland.",
    "Next, analyze the choices. In a city setting, especially in densely populated areas, properties often have very limited outdoor space due to the size and infrastructure of urban environments.",
    "Then, compare neighborhoods and subdivisions. While both can have varying sizes of yards, neighborhoods may still have larger spaces than those found in city settings, particularly in urban neighborhoods where space is constrained.",
    "Now, consider farmland. Farms generally cover large areas, implying that yards on farmland would be large rather than tiny.",
    "Evaluate the choice \"property.\" A property can refer to any type of land, including those in cities, farmland, or otherwise, but it does not specifically indicate size.",
    "Given that cities typically have smaller areas allotted for yards due to higher population density, it is reasonable to assume that a yard in a city would be more likely to be tiny compared to other settings.",
    "Confirm the logic: a yard in a city (choice C) is constrained by the size of the buildings surrounding it and the limited open space available.",
    "Reassess the choices to ensure all have been considered. We\u2019ve established that while neighborhoods and subdivisions can also have small yards, cities are more likely to have the tiniest due to the nature of urban living.",
    "Conclude that when considering where a yard might be tiny, the urban environment of a city is the most fitting answer based on the analysis of space constraints."
