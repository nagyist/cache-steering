  "query": "Question: Debbie doesn't want a plain dress, she wants something unusual and attention-getting.  What would be a good adjective to describe the sort of dress she wants?\n\nChoices:\nA: exotic\nB: decorative\nC: bells and whistles\nD: silly\nE: extravagant",
  "steps": [
    "Debbie desires a dress that is not plain, indicating she wants something that stands out and captures attention.",
    "The term \"unusual\" suggests that the dress should have unique or distinctive features that differentiate it from standard dresses.",
    "\"Attention-getting\" implies that the dress should have elements that draw people's focus, appealing to those who view it.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices to see which most closely aligns with her desires.",
    "Choice A: \"exotic\" suggests a dress that is unusual and appealing, likely with unique patterns or styles, which fits Debbie's preferences.",
    "Choice B: \"decorative\" implies that the dress may have embellishments, but it may not necessarily be unusual in design.",
    "Choice C: \"bells and whistles\" is a metaphor for something that is equipped with extra features, but it's not a clear adjective describing a dress directly.",
    "Choice D: \"silly\" indicates a lack of sophistication and likely would not appeal to someone seeking a stylish, attention-getting outfit.",
    "Choice E: \"extravagant\" suggests a dress that is luxurious and possibly flamboyant, which might work, but isn\u2019t as specific about being unusual.",
    "Evaluating A and E, \"exotic\" is more directly tied to the uniqueness and attention aspect that Debbie seeks, as \"extravagant\" may not necessarily imply unusualness."
