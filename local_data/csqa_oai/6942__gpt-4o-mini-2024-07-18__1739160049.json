  "query": "Question: What grows well in the sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: west\nB: beach\nC: beans\nD: universe\nE: plants",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what typically grows well in sunny conditions. Generally, most plants thrive when they receive adequate sunlight, as it is essential for photosynthesis.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the provided options based on the concept of growth in sunlight. \"Beans\" (C) and \"plants\" (E) are both biological entities that can grow with the help of sunlight.",
    "Now, looking at option E, \"plants,\" this is a broad category that encompasses many organisms, including beans. All plants require sunlight for growth.",
    "Considering option C, \"beans,\" these are specific types of plants that grow well in the sun. They indeed need sunlight to photosynthesize and flourish.",
    "Now let\u2019s assess the other options. \"West\" (A) does not relate to growth, instead, it refers to a direction. \"Beach\" (B) is a geographical feature but does not grow. \"Universe\" (D) is too vast and abstract to be associated with growth under sunlight.",
    "Between the two relevant options, beans (C) and plants (E), while both are correct, \"plants\" encompasses a wider range of organisms, including beans.",
    "However, since the question focuses on something specific that grows well in the sun and we have the option that specifically mentions a type of plant that thrives, beans (C) can be considered a direct answer.",
    "Hence, both options C and E are correct in the broader context, but since we aim for a more specific answer relating to something that grows well in the sun, beans (C) fits well."
