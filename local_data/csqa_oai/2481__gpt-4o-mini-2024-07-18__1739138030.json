  "query": "Question: The committee represent the rest of the members, they met every Sunday right after what?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: park\nC: business\nD: government\nE: city hall",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the committee's meetings and their frequency.",
    "The committee meets every Sunday, suggesting they likely gather after a community or routine event that takes place on that day.",
    "Consider typical activities that occur on Sundays. Church services are common in many communities on Sunday mornings.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: \nA: church - aligns well with Sunday meetings.\nB: park - not a typical scheduled event for Sundays.\nC: business - less likely as businesses usually do not have meetings on weekends.\nD: government - meetings are not commonly on Sundays for government entities.\nE: city hall - similar reasoning as government.",
    "Given the commonality of church services on Sundays, it's reasonable to conclude that the committee likely meets after church.",
    "Review the other options to ensure there are no better alternatives.",
    "Church remains the most logical event preceding the committee's Sunday meetings based on typical community behavior."
