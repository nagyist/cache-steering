    "The main function of a clock is to keep track of time.",
    "Option A (eat food) does not relate to the function of a clock.",
    "Option B (tell time) directly describes the primary purpose of a clock.",
    "Option C (wind down) suggests a state of relaxation but does not involve the primary use of a clock.",
    "Option D (stop working) is a behavior that could be related to the time shown on a clock but is not a direct use of the clock.",
