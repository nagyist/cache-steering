  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the master control for electricity, which typically refers to where you would manage or control electrical systems and distribution.",
    "Option A mentions \"big factory.\" While factories have electrical systems, they are usually managed by on-site personnel rather than a master control.",
    "Option B mentions \"helm of ship.\" This location is more relevant to navigation and command of the ship rather than electrical control.",
    "Option C refers to \"main office.\" This is a place where administrative tasks are conducted, but it's not typically where master controls for electricity are located.",
    "Option D mentions \"basement.\" Many buildings place their electrical panels, including circuit breakers and fuses, in the basement for safety and accessibility.",
    "Option E states \"center.\" This is vague and doesn\u2019t imply a specific location relevant to controlling electricity.",
    "Comparing the options, the basement is commonly known as a location where electrical controls or panels would be found, making it the most logical answer.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer based on the reasoning is option D (basement)."
