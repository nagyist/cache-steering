  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the geographic range of the bald eagle. Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, including the continental United States, parts of Canada, and Mexico.",
    "Next, I should consider the options provided to see which one could correspond to a location where bald eagles might also be spotted.",
    "Option A is \"utah,\" which is a state in the USA where bald eagles can be found.",
    "Option B is \"france,\" which is in Europe and not a location where bald eagles are naturally found.",
    "Option C is \"chemotherapy,\" which is not related to geographical locations at all.",
    "Option D is \"rocky mountains,\" which refers to a mountain range that spans several US states and Canada where bald eagles are also present.",
    "Finally, option E is \"british columbia,\" which is a province in Canada and part of the bald eagle's range, particularly along its coastal regions and river systems.",
    "Bald eagles indeed can be found in both the USA (synonymous with it) and British Columbia in Canada.",
    "Based on this evaluation, the two-word province where bald eagles can be found, in addition to being synonymous with the USA, is British Columbia."
