  "query": "Question: Animals do what from birth to death?\n\nChoices:\nA: fight each other\nB: need to eat\nC: drink water\nD: live lives\nE: feel pain",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the lifespan of animals from birth to death. Animals go through various stages and experiences throughout their lives.",
    "Next, we consider the options provided. \"Fight each other\" (A) is not something all animals do throughout their lives; it depends on their species and circumstances.",
    "Option B, \"need to eat,\" is essential for the survival of most animals. They require food continuously from birth to death, but it's not a comprehensive description of their existence.",
    "Option C, \"drink water,\" is also necessary for survival, as all animals need water, but again, this does not cover the entirety of an animal's life experience.",
    "Now considering option D, \"live lives,\" this phrase encompasses all the experiences, needs, and interactions animals have throughout their existence, making it a very broad yet accurate statement.",
    "Lastly, option E, \"feel pain,\" while relevant, does not apply universally to all animals across their entire lifespan; not all experiences are related to pain.",
    "Out of all the options, \"live lives\" (D) best summarizes the overall journey of animals from birth to death, as it encapsulates all their needs, actions, and experiences."
