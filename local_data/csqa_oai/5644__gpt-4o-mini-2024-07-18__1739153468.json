  "query": "Question: What do fish have to aid in oxygen exchange?\n\nChoices:\nA: gills\nB: bones\nC: tail\nD: no legs\nE: see work",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a specific anatomical feature that fish have for the purpose of exchanging oxygen.",
    "Fish live in water and need to extract oxygen from it to breathe.",
    "Oxygen exchange in fish occurs primarily through specialized structures that are adapted for this function.",
    "Gills are the organs in fish that facilitate the transfer of oxygen from water into the fish's bloodstream.",
    "Other options listed do not directly aid in oxygen exchange: \n- Bones provide structure but do not participate in gas exchange.\n- A tail assists in movement but does not help in breathing.\n- The term \"no legs\" is irrelevant, as fish do not have legs in the first place.\n- \"See work\" does not pertain to a biological function.",
    "Therefore, the only correct option that represents an organ responsible for oxygen exchange in fish is gills."
