  "query": "Question: Bobby sat on the examination table.  Happy that this was a simple procedure, and he could do it here instead of staying overnight some place else.  Where might he be?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospital\nB: school\nC: obituary\nD: doctor's office\nE: vets office",
  "steps": [
    "Bobby is sitting on an examination table, which suggests he is in a medical setting. This could eliminate some options immediately.",
    "The mention of a \"simple procedure\" indicates that it is likely not an emergency situation, and Bobby is in a place where outpatient procedures are conducted.",
    "Staying overnight implies that at least some facilities could serve this purpose, but Bobby is happy about not needing that, which typically excludes hospitals since they often require overnight stays for procedures.",
    "Options like \"school\" and \"obituary\" do not fit the context of being on an examination table for a medical procedure.",
    "An \"obituary\" is not a physical location and would not involve being on an examination table.",
    "A \"vets office\" could potentially involve an examination table, but it is more likely to relate to pets rather than a human like Bobby.",
    "The \"doctor's office\" is a common place for outpatient procedures, examinations, and would be where a patient could sit on an examination table without needing to stay overnight.",
    "Considering all the options, the scenario aligns most closely with being in a doctor's office due to the nature of the procedure mentioned."
