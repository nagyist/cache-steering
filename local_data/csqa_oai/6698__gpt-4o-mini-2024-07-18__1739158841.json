  "query": "Question: I needed more knowledge and had a reputation for truancy, what did I need to go to more of?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: meeting\nC: encyclopedia\nD: university\nE: class",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions a need for \"more knowledge,\" indicating a desire to learn or gain information.",
    "The term \"truancy\" refers to being absent from school without permission, which suggests a previously problematic relationship with formal education.",
    "Given the context of truancy, the person likely did not engage with educational institutions effectively.",
    "Options such as \"church\" and \"meeting\" do not directly relate to obtaining formal knowledge or education.",
    "An \"encyclopedia\" is a resource that provides knowledge but does not imply interactive or structured learning.",
    "A \"university\" is an institution for higher education which may be appealing, but it generally involves a commitment that may not align with the history of truancy.",
    "The option \"class\" suggests participatory learning, which can provide the necessary education in a structured way and may also accommodate a more flexible approach to learning.",
    "Considering all options, \"class\" appears to be the most direct means to address the need for more structured knowledge while taking into account the history of truancy."
