  "query": "Question: I typically use a travel website to book my flights is implying i used the travel site when?\n\nChoices:\nA: story\nB: now\nC: knowledge\nD: at least few page\nE: past",
  "steps": [
    "The statement \"I typically use a travel website to book my flights\" indicates a regular behavior or practice of the speaker regarding flight booking.",
    "The use of the word \"typically\" suggests that this is something the speaker does often rather than just suggesting a once-off event.",
    "The context of the sentence implies the speaker has used the travel website multiple times, reinforcing the idea that this is a habitual action.",
    "Given that \"typically\" suggests a frequency over time, it implies that the speaker has used the website repeatedly in the past.",
    "The mention of \"book my flights\" indicates an action that requires prior choices and decisions, which would have occurred in prior time frames.",
    "The options provided need to be evaluated in terms of time. Choices include references to present, past, process, or knowledge.",
    "The direct reference to booking indicates we are referring to actions previously taken as the speaker has a routine of using the site.",
    "\"Now\" (B) and \"knowledge\" (C) refer to current states rather than past actions. \"At least few page\" (D) does not connect directly to the temporal context of using the travel site.",
    "Therefore, the only option remaining that accurately reflects the timing of the action described is \"past\" (E), as it involves actions that have been completed previously."
