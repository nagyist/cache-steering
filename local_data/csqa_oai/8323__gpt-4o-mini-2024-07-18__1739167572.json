  "query": "Question: The overbearing father told his son he had to earn his value, in left the child with feeling of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: discounted\nB: expensive\nC: cheap\nD: invaluable\nE: worthlessness",
  "steps": [
    "The father\u2019s statement suggests he believes value must be earned rather than inherently possessed. This implies a conditional approach to self-worth.",
    "By stating that the son must \"earn\" his value, the father is indirectly communicating that he does not see innate worth in his son, which could lead to feelings of inadequacy.",
    "The term \u201cworthlessness\u201d stands out because it captures a sense of having no value at all, which aligns with the feeling of needing to prove one\u2019s worth through effort or achievements.",
    "On the other hand, \"discounted\" (A) and \"cheap\" (C) also imply low value but do not necessarily convey the emotional impact of the father's words as clearly as \"worthlessness\" (E).",
    "The word \"expensive\" (B) generally suggests high value, which is opposite to the emotional implications of the father\u2019s statement.",
    "The term \"invaluable\" (D) similarly indicates high worth, which contradicts the father's directive to earn value.",
    "Considering all interpretations, the child's feelings are likely to stem from a perception of inadequacy and low self-esteem rather than simply low value or high value characterizations.",
    "Thus, following the reasoning, the most fitting answer that captures the potential emotional fallout of the statement is \"worthlessness.\""
