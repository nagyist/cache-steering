  "query": "Question: Where would a restaurant put a candle?\n\nChoices:\nA: dimly lit room\nB: kitchen\nC: wall\nD: table\nE: birthday cake",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical purpose of a candle in a restaurant setting, which is often to create ambiance or mood lighting.",
    "Next, identify locations where candles are most commonly placed in restaurants. Table settings are a frequent choice for enhancing the dining experience.",
    "Examine the other choices: a dimly lit room is not a specific location for placement, and while candles may be present in a kitchen, it's not the primary purpose as kitchens are typically more practical and functional.",
    "The option 'wall' suggests mounting a candle or using wall sconces, but this is less common for ambiance in dining areas compared to tabletop usage.",
    "The option 'birthday cake' suggests a specific use of candles for celebratory purposes, but it is not a general use of candles in a restaurant scenario.",
    "Reviewing all options again, the most appropriate placement for a candle in a restaurant is on the table, as this enhances the dining experience."
