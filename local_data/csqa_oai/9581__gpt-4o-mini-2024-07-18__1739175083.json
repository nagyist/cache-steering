  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a specific type of container that can hold gallons of beer.",
    "We know that beer can be stored in various containers, but we need to find one that specifically holds \"gallons\" of beer.",
    "Looking at the choices, A (outside) does not refer to a container at all.",
    "B (friend's house) and C (neighbor's house) suggest locations but do not indicate a specific container for holding beer.",
    "E (refrigerator) is indeed a common place to store beer, but it doesn\u2019t specifically denote a large container for holding gallons.",
    "D (keg) refers to a specific type of container used for storing and serving beer, and kegs are designed to hold significant quantities, often several gallons.",
    "Since the query explicitly asks for a container that can hold a large volume of beer, D (keg) is the most appropriate choice."
