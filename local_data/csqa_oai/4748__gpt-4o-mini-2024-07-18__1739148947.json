  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question, which pertains to the cessation of killing in a war. This suggests a resolution or transformation that leads to peace.",
    "Next, option A (\"going to jail\") does not logically conclude the acts of violence, as imprisonment of some may not affect the ongoing conflict or killing.",
    "Then, consider option B (\"punishment\"). While punishment may deal with accountability, it does not directly enforce an end to killing. Conflicts can still persist even after punishment is administered.",
    "Now let's evaluate option C (\"recognizes their true oppressors\"). This option suggests an ideological or cognitive shift that could potentially lead to understanding and possibly peace, but it does not guarantee that all killing stops.",
    "Next, we look at option D (\"death of\"). This option is incomplete as it requires a subject; we cannot conclude that killing stops if we don't specify who or what must die.",
    "Finally, consider option E (\"dies\"). This suggests that killing ends when a person simply dies, which makes sense in a war context where the death of all opposing forces could lead to the cessation of violence.",
    "Comparing the options, E straightforwardly indicates a definitive end to conflict based on the ultimate fate of individuals involved.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that killing in a war ends with the death or demise of individuals, as this removes them from the conflict entirely."
