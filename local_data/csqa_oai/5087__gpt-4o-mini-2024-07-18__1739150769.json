  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of storing dry food. Dry food includes items like rice, pasta, flour, and canned goods, which need to be stored in a cool, dry place.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided for their suitability for dry food storage.",
    "Option A, \"shelf,\" is a common and practical place for storing dry food as it allows easy access and organization.",
    "Option B, \"supermarket,\" is not a viable option for storage as it is a place to buy food rather than store it.",
    "Option C, \"military base,\" is unlikely to be a typical storage location for everyday dry food for civilians.",
    "Option D, \"neighbor's house,\" is not a practical or dependable choice for storing dry food, as it relies on someone else's space and agreement.",
    "Option E, \"in the garage,\" could be a suitable place depending on the garage's conditions, but it typically may not provide the ideal environment for long-term storage due to temperature fluctuations and potential pests.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most logical and common choice for storing dry food is a shelf, as it provides direct access and is customarily used for that purpose."
