  "query": "Question: He needed a computer program to do a certain task and he knew how to make it, so he began to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: get frustrated\nB: write code\nC: debug\nD: damage\nE: compile",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that he needed a computer program and knew how to make it, indicating he has the necessary skills to create the program.",
    "Given that he is aware of how to create the program, the logical first step in the process would be to write the code for the program.",
    "The process of creating a computer program typically begins with writing code, which forms the foundation of the program's functionality.",
    "While debugging (C) and compiling (E) are also important steps in software development, they would occur after the code has been initially written.",
    "Getting frustrated (A) is an emotional response that does not align with the intention of beginning to create a program.",
    "Damaging (D) does not make sense in the context of needing to create a program since it implies negativity that contradicts the goal of programming.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate choice, given the context of starting to create a computer program, is to write code."
