  "query": "Question: Where would a special ficus be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: botanical garden\nB: doctor's office\nC: in a sea\nD: public place\nE: arboretum",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what a \"special ficus\" refers to. Ficus is a genus of plants that includes many species, some of which are popular as ornamental plants.",
    "Next, I consider where such ornamental plants, especially a special or unique variety, would likely be found. Botanical gardens frequently house a variety of plant species, including unique or special varieties.",
    "I also consider the other choices. A doctor's office could have plants, but it's less common to find a special or unique type of ficus there. It is more likely to have simple, low-maintenance plants.",
    "The option \"in a sea\" is not plausible, as ficus plants are terrestrial and do not grow in marine environments.",
    "A public place could theoretically have ficus plants, but it would be more generalized and not specifically a \"special\" variety.",
    "An arboretum is another option that focuses on trees and could have a range of unique plant specimens, including special ficus plants.",
    "Now I compare the two most relevant options: botanical garden and arboretum. Both locations often display unique varieties of plants, but botanical gardens generally have a broader mission of education and conservation, often showcasing many different species.",
    "Considering the emphasis on displaying a variety of special plant specimens, a botanical garden is likely to be the most appropriate setting for a \"special ficus.\"",
    "Thus, after weighing all the options, the best place for a special ficus to be found is in a botanical garden."
