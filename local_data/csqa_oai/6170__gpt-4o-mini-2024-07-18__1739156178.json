  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of raking leaves. People typically rake leaves to clean up yards and gardens, which implies they want to collect them for a specific reason.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. The first option, \"forrest,\" doesn't make sense because people don't rake leaves into forests as that is a natural habitat.",
    "The second choice, \"floral arrangement,\" is inappropriate as well because leaves are not used in floral arrangements in a way that requires raking them.",
    "The third option, \"basement,\" seems irrelevant because a basement is not a location where leaves would be raked into or stored.",
    "The fourth option, \"trees,\" does not make sense because raking leaves into trees would be counterproductive, as the leaves have already fallen from them.",
    "The final choice, \"compost pile,\" is a logical and practical answer. Composting is a common method for recycling leaves into nutrient-rich soil, making it a suitable destination for raked leaves.",
    "After assessing all options, the only sensible and practical place for raking leaves to go is into a compost pile."
