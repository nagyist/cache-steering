  "steps": [
    "Identify the primary component of milk that is known for contributing to bone health and development.",
    "Consider the known nutrients in milk that support skeletal structure. Calcium is widely recognized for its role in bone density and structure.",
    "Examine the choices given. \"Metal\" (A) is not specific to milk nor related to bone development. \"Lactose\" (B) is a sugar found in milk but does not aid bone development. \"Water\" (D) is essential for bodily functions but not specifically for bone health. \"Fridge\" (E) refers to storage and has no biological relevance.",
    "Confirm that among the choices, only calcium (C) is explicitly linked to bone health and is abundant in dairy products.",
    "Conclude that based on its importance in bone development and prevalence in milk, the answer must be calcium."
