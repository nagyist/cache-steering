  "query": "Question: What do you add to you dough when making bread to make it rise?\n\nChoices:\nA: yeast\nB: oven\nC: mess\nD: flour\nE: biscuit",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what ingredient makes bread dough rise, we should think about the leavening agents commonly used in bread making.",
    "Yeast is a biological leavening agent that ferments and produces gases, causing the dough to rise.",
    "Ovens are used to bake the dough, but they don't contribute to rising; rather, they are a place of baking.",
    "A mess is not an ingredient, but rather a potential outcome of the process of making bread.",
    "Flour is a primary ingredient in bread but does not make the dough rise; it provides structure.",
    "Biscuit is a type of bread product, but it is not an ingredient used to make another type of bread rise.",
    "By eliminating options that do not contribute to the rising process, we find that yeast is the only correct answer that actively causes dough to rise.",
    "There are no alternative leavening agents mentioned in the question or relevant to standard bread-making practices that would replace yeast for this purpose.",
    "Therefore, the clear choice that matches the requirement for making bread dough rise is yeast."
