  "steps": [
    "To begin, I need to interpret what \"a living thing with a lip\" means. This suggests that I am looking for something that is alive and possesses lips.",
    "Next, I will analyze the given choices to identify which ones are living things.",
    "Choice A: \"mouth\" is not a living thing, but rather an anatomical part of living organisms.",
    "Choice B: \"can\" is an inanimate object and therefore not a living thing.",
    "Choice C: \"human\" is a living organism that indeed has lips as part of the mouth.",
    "Choice D: \"snake\" is also a living thing, but snakes do not have lips; they have scales and a jaw structure that differs from mammals.",
    "Choice E: \"kentucky fried chicken\" is food, and while it came from a living animal (chicken), it itself is not a living thing.",
    "From the analysis, the only option that is a living thing and has lips is \"human.\""
