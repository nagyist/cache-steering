  "query": "Question: He was studying anatomy, he knew that the main artery in his neck provided blood to his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: own brain\nB: busy city\nC: thruway\nD: hand\nE: neck",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that he was studying anatomy and is inquiring about the main artery in his neck.",
    "In human anatomy, the main artery in the neck that supplies blood is predominantly the common carotid artery.",
    "The common carotid arteries bifurcate (split) into the internal and external carotid arteries.",
    "The internal carotid artery primarily supplies blood to the brain.",
    "The question asks what the main artery in his neck provides blood to, implying a connection to the brain.",
    "Among the provided options, \"own brain\" is directly related to the function of the common carotid artery.",
    "The other options (busy city, thruway, hand, neck) do not logically connect to the anatomical function of a blood supply to the main artery in the neck.",
    "Therefore, the most accurate answer regarding what the main artery in his neck provides blood to is \"own brain.\""
