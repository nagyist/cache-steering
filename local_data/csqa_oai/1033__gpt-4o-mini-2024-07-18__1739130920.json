  "query": "Question: Where might I find pens with a company logo?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: on a pencil\nC: write sentences on paper\nD: school\nE: backpack",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where promotional items like pens with a company logo are commonly distributed or found.",
    "Promotional pens are often provided at events, office supply stores, or during corporate giveaways.",
    "Next, evaluate the options given: \"office,\" \"on a pencil,\" \"write sentences on paper,\" \"school,\" and \"backpack.\"",
    "The \"office\" is a strong candidate because it is a common place where companies give away branded items.",
    "\"On a pencil\" does not make sense as it implies that a pen could be physically located on a pencil.",
    "\"Write sentences on paper\" merely describes the function of a pen, not its location.",
    "\"School\" could also be a place for finding pens with school branding or company logos, but it is less common than an office setting.",
    "A \"backpack\" could potentially contain pens, but it is not a primary location for finding pens with logos.",
    "The most reasonable option based on the analysis of distribution locations for promotional items is \"office.\"",
    "Therefore, after revisiting each choice and considering promotional practices, it confirms that the best fit for where one might find pens with a company logo is at an office."
