  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"a dime a dozen\" typically refers to something that is very common or easily obtained. This sets the context that the large container being described is not unique or rare.",
    "The question mentions \"hundreds of rows,\" which suggests a setting that is organized and possibly commercial in nature, rather than a small scale or casual setting like a garden or garage.",
    "Let's analyze each of the choices in relation to where large containers might be found in such frequency:\n- A factory might have large containers, but typically these would be oriented towards machinery, raw materials, or production processes rather than rows of containers that would suggest retail.\n- A garden is unlikely to have hundreds of rows of large containers, as gardens typically focus on plants and their arrangements.\n- A supermarket often has large containers for products, especially in bulk aisles, which could easily be organized in rows. However, it might not have \"hundreds\" in rows.\n- A garage usually does not have hundreds of rows of containers; it is more personal space oriented.\n- A warehouse is a place designed for storage and inventory management, where large containers can be stored in organized rows, making it a very likely candidate for having \"hundreds of rows.\"",
    "Comparing supermarkets and warehouses, while supermarkets typically stock containers for consumer goods, warehouses specialize in storing products, making them more likely to have multiple rows of the same types of large containers.",
    "Given that \"hundreds of rows\" implies a very large quantity typically associated with storage rather than direct retail, the best choice seems to be a warehouse.",
    "Since the context emphasizes the vastness and commonality of these large containers, and a warehouse fits this description better than a supermarket, the logical choice is clearer."
