  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question. The mention of siblings fighting suggests that their behavior was disruptive enough to warrant intervention from their mother.",
    "Next, we consider the phrase \"make a rule for every.\" This implies that the rules are meant to address specific behaviors or situations that arise frequently due to the fights.",
    "Looking at the choices, we need to identify which option reflects a comprehensive scope of situations where rules could be applied.",
    "Choice A, \"everything,\" seems too broad and unlikely as it is impractical to create rules for absolutely everything.",
    "Choice B, \"text book,\" doesn't quite fit as it doesn\u2019t relate to family dynamics or behavior.",
    "Choice C, \"family situation,\" suggests that the rules are specifically tailored to situations that arise within the family context, which seems plausible.",
    "Choice D, \"lawbook,\" isn't relevant as it implies legal rules rather than familial guidelines.",
    "Choice E, \"dinner time,\" is too specific and does not encompass the idea of fighting in various situations.",
    "Upon evaluating the reasoning, it becomes clear that choice C adequately captures the essence of the mother making rules regarding the various situations that occur as a result of sibling conflicts."
