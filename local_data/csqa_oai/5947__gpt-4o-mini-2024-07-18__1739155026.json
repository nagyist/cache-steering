  "query": "Question: James needed storage for 500 tons o beans in crates.  What sort of facility might he use?\n\nChoices:\nA: attic\nB: garage\nC: building\nD: warehouse\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the volume and weight of 500 tons of beans in crates. 500 tons is a substantial amount, and I should consider facilities capable of accommodating large weights and volumes.",
    "Next, I need to consider the choices provided and their suitability for such a heavy and bulky storage requirement.",
    "An attic is generally used for light storage and may not support the weight of 500 tons. Therefore, option A (attic) is likely not suitable.",
    "A garage typically has limited space and may not be designed to handle the storage of such a large quantity of goods. Thus, option B (garage) also seems inappropriate.",
    "A general building could potentially be used, but without specific functions like those needed for bulk storage, it often is not designed for large quantities of goods. So, option C (building) is not a strong candidate.",
    "On the other hand, a warehouse is specifically built for storing large quantities of goods and can handle heavy loads like 500 tons of beans in crates. This makes option D (warehouse) a strong candidate.",
    "Lastly, option E (Michigan) is not a type of facility but a geographical location, making it irrelevant to the question about storage options.",
    "Based on the evaluation of each option's suitability for storing 500 tons of beans, the most appropriate facility would clearly be a warehouse."
