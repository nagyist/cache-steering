  "query": "Question: What does a virus primarily do to a person?\n\nChoices:\nA: infect\nB: reproduce\nC: mutate\nD: eat food\nE: make computer malfunction",
  "steps": [
    "A virus is a type of pathogen that invades living cells to replicate itself.",
    "The primary mechanism of a virus involves entering a host cell and hijacking the cell's machinery to produce more viruses.",
    "This process of invading and replicating primarily leads to infection in the host organism.",
    "While viruses reproduce, this occurs mainly as a consequence of them first infecting a host.",
    "Mutation occurs in viruses over time, but it is not the primary action they perform on a person.",
    "Eating food does not apply as viruses do not consume food like living organisms.",
    "Making a computer malfunction pertains to computer viruses, which are not the focus of this question about biological viruses.",
    "Based on the analysis, the action that most directly describes what a virus does to a person is to infect them."
