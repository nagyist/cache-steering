  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a situation involving shattered glass, blood, and a gun, which typically indicates a violent incident or crime has occurred.",
    "In such situations, law enforcement would need to secure the area where the incident took place to preserve evidence and prevent contamination.",
    "The term \"perimeter\" in this context refers to the boundaries of the area that should be taped off to control access.",
    "Given the presence of key evidence (shattered glass, blood, and a gun), it strongly suggests that the incident happened in a location relevant to a crime, rather than within a police station or military facility.",
    "Among the options listed, a \"crime scene\" is the most appropriate designation for the area requiring a perimeter to be taped off.",
    "The other options (A, B, C, and E) deal with locations that are less relevant to the act of crime occurring and would not necessitate securing in the context of immediate crime investigation.",
    "Thus, the detective's instruction to tape off the perimeter would logically be directed towards the location of the crime.",
    "The final conclusion is that the area taped off would be specifically referred to as the \"crime scene.\""
