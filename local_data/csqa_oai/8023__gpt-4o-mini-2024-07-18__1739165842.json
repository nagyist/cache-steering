  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the reasons why drinking alcohol can lead to a car crash.",
    "Alcohol consumption affects cognitive functions and motor skills, leading to impaired judgment.",
    "Driving under the influence can reduce reaction times, making it difficult to respond quickly to hazards on the road.",
    "Disorientation occurs when a person's balance, coordination, and focus are compromised, which is a common effect of alcohol.",
    "When someone is disoriented, they may misjudge distances, speeds, and the behavior of other drivers and pedestrians.",
    "Other options such as sickness and throwing up could potentially distract a driver, but they are not direct effects of alcohol that typically lead to crashes.",
    "Snapchatting is an unrelated activity and not inherently caused by alcohol consumption, although it can contribute to distraction.",
    "Among the choices, \"disorientation\" is the primary consequence of drinking alcohol that directly relates to an increased risk of a car crash."
