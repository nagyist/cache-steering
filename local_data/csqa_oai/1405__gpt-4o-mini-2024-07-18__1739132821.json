  "query": "Question: If you have an empty glass and are thirsty, where would you put the glass?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: table\nC: dishwasher\nD: water cooler\nE: dining room",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of the glass which is to hold a beverage. Since I am thirsty, I would place the glass where I can fill it with a drink.",
    "Next, evaluate each option based on where I might obtain a drink. The refrigerator is a source of cold drinks, but it is not where I would put the glass in this situation if I am going to fill it.",
    "The table is a common place to put a glass, but it does not lead to solving the thirst issue in a practical way.",
    "The dishwasher is meant for cleaning and would not be a place to put a glass if I needed it to drink from.",
    "The water cooler is often associated with having water readily available, so this is a very suitable option for quenching thirst.",
    "The dining room is generally a sitting area; while it might be appropriate to have a glass there, it doesn't specifically help in solving the thirst problem directly.",
    "Given the considerations above, the best option for putting the glass to fulfill the need for a drink is next to the water cooler."
