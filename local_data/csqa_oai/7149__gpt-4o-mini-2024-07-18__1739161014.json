  "query": "Question: The student chefs were instructed to start the tacos with the main ingredient, adding it to a hot pan to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stir the water\nB: prepare food\nC: brown meat\nD: prepare meals\nE: make food",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies the \"main ingredient\" for making tacos, which is typically meat (such as beef, chicken, or pork).",
    "In cooking, when meat is added to a hot pan, a common purpose is to cook the meat, which often involves browning it to enhance flavor and texture.",
    "The term \"brown\" in cooking refers to the process of cooking meat until it develops a browned crust, indicating flavor development and doneness.",
    "The options include actions related to food preparation: A (stir the water), B (prepare food), C (brown meat), D (prepare meals), and E (make food).",
    "Among the choices, A (\"stir the water\") does not relate to the process of starting tacos with the main ingredient, which is meat.",
    "B (\"prepare food\") is too vague and does not specifically indicate the action taken with the meat.",
    "D (\"prepare meals\") is also broad and does not specifically refer to the immediate action of cooking the meat in a hot pan.",
    "E (\"make food\") is similarly broad and lacks specificity regarding the action taken with the meat in the context of tacos.",
    "C (\"brown meat\") accurately reflects the specific action taken when the main ingredient (meat) is placed in a hot pan for taco preparation."
