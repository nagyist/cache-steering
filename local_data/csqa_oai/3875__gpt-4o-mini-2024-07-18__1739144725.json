  "query": "Question: Too much shopping could lead to?\n\nChoices:\nA: overdraft\nB: calluses\nC: tiredness\nD: spending money\nE: bankruptcy",
  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the consequences of excessive shopping behavior.",
    "Excessive shopping often means spending more money than one has, which can lead to financial issues.",
    "Among the options, overdraft and bankruptcy relate directly to financial consequences of overspending.",
    "Overdraft occurs when spending exceeds the available balance in a bank account, which is a possible outcome.",
    "Bankruptcy is a legal status that could also result from chronic overspending, especially if debts become unmanageable.",
    "Additionally, excessive spending can lead to tiredness, as shopping can be a physically and mentally draining activity.",
    "Calluses generally don\u2019t relate to shopping but rather to friction and physical activity, so it\u2019s not relevant here.",
    "Spending money is a direct outcome of shopping; however, it does not capture the consequences of \"too much\" shopping.",
    "Both overdraft and bankruptcy are serious financial consequences but bankruptcy is the more severe outcome of continued overspending.",
    "Considering the range of impacts, I will now prioritize the severity of each consequence and determine the best answer."
