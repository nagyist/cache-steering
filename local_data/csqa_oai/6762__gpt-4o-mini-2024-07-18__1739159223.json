  "steps": [
    "We need to determine what a good musician is particularly adept at compared to a normal person.",
    "The question suggests that a good musician's ability to perceive nuances or details in sound goes beyond the normal experience.",
    "The choices provided include specific instruments and general terms related to sound.",
    "Option A (play violin) refers to a specific instrument that may not necessarily highlight the broader auditory perception.",
    "Option B (hear sounds) suggests the simple act of hearing, which doesn't reflect the enhanced ability of a musician's ear.",
    "Option C (ocean) does not relate to musicianship or auditory skills directly.",
    "Option D (blow trumpet) again refers to a specific instrument but lacks a focus on the enhanced auditory perception.",
    "Option E (stage) suggests a performance context but does not specifically relate to auditory perception skills either.",
    "Analyzing the options, B (hear sounds) is the only choice that aligns with the enhanced listening capability of a musician.",
    "Therefore, the answer is that a good musician has a keen ear when they \"hear sounds,\" as it captures the essence of their superior auditory perception."
