  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens when a person who is not accustomed to jogging begins to jog. They may experience physical reactions that their body is not used to, which could lead to fatigue.",
    "Next, evaluate the likelihood of exhaustion occurring in someone who is new to jogging. Since their body has not developed the stamina required for this activity, exhaustion is indeed a possibility.",
    "Additionally, consider the respiratory changes during physical exertion. A beginner may struggle to breathe properly while jogging due to lack of conditioning, leading to shortness of breath.",
    "Next, analyze the effects of jogging on the body over time. While someone may become fitter or lose weight as they continue jogging, these outcomes typically do not occur immediately at the start of a new jogging routine.",
    "Furthermore, examine the physical effects of jogging on the feet. New joggers might develop blisters, especially if they are not wearing proper footwear or if they push themselves too hard on their first attempts.",
    "Now, gather the most immediate and common occurrences for someone unfamiliar with jogging. Exhaustion and shortness of breath are particularly prevalent reactions as the body adjusts to the new exercise.",
    "Consider the context of the question, which suggests possible immediate effects rather than long-term benefits or conditions, such as better fitness or weight loss.",
    "Since both exhaustion and shortness of breath are valid responses, hone in on which one is likely to occur first during the initial experience of jogging.",
    "Based on the severity of symptoms, exhaustion might be a consequence of physical activity, but shortness of breath is more directly related to the act of jogging itself.",
    "Thus, upon reviewing the reactions and considering the immediate context of doodling, the final answer is shortness of breath, which is a common experience among beginners during the activity."
