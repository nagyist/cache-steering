  "query": "Question: What is the worst outcome of an injury?\n\nChoices:\nA: cause death\nB: cause bleeding\nC: falling down\nD: become infected\nE: claim insurance",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's evaluate the options provided as potential outcomes of an injury.",
    "Option A mentions \"cause death.\" This is a severe outcome, as it leads to the loss of life, which is widely regarded as the worst possible outcome.",
    "Option B states \"cause bleeding.\" While bleeding can be serious and sometimes life-threatening, it is generally treatable and does not equate to the worst possible outcome of an injury.",
    "Option C refers to \"falling down.\" Falling down is typically an event that can be associated with injury but doesn't itself represent a worsening outcome of an injury\u2014it is more of a cause than an effect.",
    "Option D suggests \"become infected.\" Infections can complicate injuries and lead to more serious medical situations, but they usually occur after the initial injury and can be treated, making them not as severe as death.",
    "Option E mentions \"claim insurance.\" Claiming insurance is related to the financial consequences of an injury rather than a direct outcome affecting health or life.",
    "Based on the evaluation of the consequences related to each option, \u201ccause death\u201d (option A) clearly represents the most extreme and dire outcome of an injury.",
    "Other outcomes, while serious, do not surpass the finality of death. Therefore, it stands out as the worst outcome of all listed."
