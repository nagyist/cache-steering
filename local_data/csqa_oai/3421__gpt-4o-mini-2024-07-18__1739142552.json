  "query": "Question: The tool was stored in what part of the house with the car?\n\nChoices:\nA: basement\nB: garage\nC: hardware store\nD: living room\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies a location where a tool was stored alongside a car.",
    "Typically, tools and cars are stored in places that are functional for maintenance or storage.",
    "Among the options provided, a \"garage\" is a common location for both cars and tools, as garages are designed for vehicle storage and often contain tools for repairs.",
    "Considering the other options: \n- A basement typically stores household items and is not suited for cars. \n- A hardware store is a place to buy tools, not store them. \n- A living room is for leisure and has no relevance to tools or cars. \n- A repair shop is related to fixing items, but it's not a place for personal storage.",
    "The garage is unique in that it is specifically designed for vehicles and often holds tools as well.",
    "Therefore, the most logical and relevant answer is \"garage\" as the correct storage location for both a tool and a car."
