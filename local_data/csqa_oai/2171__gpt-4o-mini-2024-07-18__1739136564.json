  "query": "Question: Where do you have to fan yourself in public watching people run and throw balls?\n\nChoices:\nA: sports stadium\nB: sauna\nC: living room\nD: appliance store\nE: hot room",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by interpreting the context of the question, which involves fanning oneself in public while observing others participating in physical activities such as running or throwing balls.",
    "Next, I consider the environments in which such activities typically occur. A sports stadium is a prominent location where people gather to watch sports.",
    "The act of fanning oneself suggests that the environment is likely warm or hot, leading me to think of places with a high level of physical activity and crowds.",
    "I evaluate the other choices: \n- A sauna is a place where people typically fan themselves because of the heat, but it is not a public environment for watching sports. \n- A living room is usually a private space and is unlikely to fit the context of the question, as it does not accommodate public gatherings for sports events. \n- An appliance store typically does not involve physical activity observed by onlookers. \n- A hot room is vague, but it's not defined as a public place for watching unless specified.",
    "Focusing on the sports stadium, it fits the description of a public area where many spectators watch individuals participate in various sports, where the weather may warrant the need to fan oneself.",
    "Thus, weighing the options, the best fit for the activity of watching others run and throw balls in a public setting while also needing to fan oneself due to warmth is a sports stadium."
