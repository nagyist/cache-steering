  "query": "Question: What is learning about the world and it's injustices  likely to cause?\n\nChoices:\nA: anger\nB: loss of innocence\nC: happiness\nD: pleasure\nE: enlightenment",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what learning about the world and its injustices entails. It typically involves recognizing social, economic, and political inequalities and hardships faced by marginalized groups.",
    "As individuals become more aware of injustices, they may feel a range of emotional responses. Among these, anger is a common reaction when one learns about the suffering and unfair treatment of others.",
    "Another possible response is the loss of innocence. When the realities of the world become apparent, especially for those who have previously been sheltered from such information, there can be a sense of disillusionment.",
    "On the other hand, learning about injustices can also lead to feelings of enlightenment. This realization can inspire individuals to seek change and promote justice, which is a positive outcome.",
    "However, the question specifically asks what learning about injustices is \"likely\" to cause, suggesting a more immediate emotional reaction rather than a transformative or long-term enlightenment.",
    "Among the choices A (anger) and B (loss of innocence) seem to fit the emotional and psychological impacts more immediately felt when confronting the harsh realities of injustice.",
    "Considering the social context, anger is a very vivid reaction that often arises when individuals witness or learn about inequities and the suffering of others.",
    "Loss of innocence, while significant, may not be as universally felt because it depends on a person's previous level of awareness or exposure to such issues.",
    "Therefore, anger seems to be a more common reaction that underscores a sense of urgency and injustice, making it a likely outcome of this learning process."
