  "query": "Question: Most building are located overground, not?\n\nChoices:\nA: tall\nB: huge\nC: underground\nD: small\nE: overground",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that most buildings are located overground and asks for confirmation with \"not,\" which implies a comparison against locations that aren't overground.",
    "The term \"overground\" means above the ground, so other terms to consider must relate to being below ground or in a different context.",
    "Looking at the choices, we need to identify which option contradicts the statement about buildings being overground.",
    "Choice A \"tall\" doesn\u2019t relate to being above or below ground; it describes height.",
    "Choice B \"huge\" also describes size and does not refer to the location of buildings.",
    "Choice C \"underground\" explicitly indicates a position below ground, which directly contradicts \"overground.\"",
    "Choice D \"small\" describes a size and has no relation to the question about location.",
    "Choice E \"overground\" is a repetition of the original statement and does not provide a contrasting idea.",
    "Since choice C \"underground\" presents an alternative location that stands in contrast to \"overground,\" it fits the implication of the question."
