  "query": "Question: Some people go their whole life doing what for love?\n\nChoices:\nA: live life\nB: wait for\nC: emotion affection\nD: kiss\nE: entertain",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question. It asks about what some people do their whole life for love.",
    "Next, review the choices given: A, B, C, D, and E.",
    "Choice A: \"live life\" doesn't specifically relate to love; it\u2019s a general statement about existence.",
    "Choice B: \"wait for\" implies a sense of anticipation but doesn\u2019t denote a continuous action done for love.",
    "Choice C: \"emotion affection\" seems abstract and might not correspond well to a specific action someone would do for love.",
    "Choice D: \"kiss\" is a specific action people may do as an expression of love but is not something one would do their whole life.",
    "Choice E: \"entertain\" also feels vague in this context and doesn\u2019t directly tie to an act committed for love.",
    "Among the choices, \"wait for\" could imply that some people dedicate their lives to waiting for a loved one or love to come, which resonates with the sentiment of spending life for love.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating all options, the best fit is B, as it captures the idea of a lifelong commitment based on the hopeful nature of love."
