  "steps": [
    "The situation describes a caregiver who was busy on her cell phone while a patient needed care.",
    "The use of a cell phone in this context implies that the caregiver was not paying attention to the patient\u2019s needs.",
    "The fact that the patient died as a result of this inattention suggests a failure to provide necessary care.",
    "Negligence is defined as the failure to take proper care in doing something, which corresponds closely with the caregiver ignoring the patient.",
    "The options presented include several negative traits or behaviors, such as antipathy and being mean, which do not directly relate to carelessness or lack of attention.",
    "Indifference could suggest a lack of concern, but it does not specifically imply an active failure to care.",
    "Recollect does not apply to this situation as it refers to remembering something rather than an action or behavior related to care.",
    "The option 'negligence' clearly encapsulates the caregiver's failure to fulfill her duties, resulting in the patient's death.",
    "A, B, C, and D do not fit as clearly as E does in describing the consequence of the caregiver being occupied and not tending to the patient.",
    "Thus, after reviewing the definitions and the implications of the situation, negligence is the most appropriate term that describes the caregiver\u2019s actions."
