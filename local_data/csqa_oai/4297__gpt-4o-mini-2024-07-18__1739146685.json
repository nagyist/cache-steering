  "query": "Question: Where would you buy a brand new mandolin with a storage box?\n\nChoices:\nA: spain\nB: grocery store\nC: musical instrument store\nD: music store\nE: instrument case",
  "steps": [
    "The question requires identifying the location where one can buy a brand new mandolin.",
    "A mandolin is a stringed musical instrument, implying that it would typically be sold at a store that specializes in musical instruments.",
    "The choices include a mix of general and specific locations.",
    "Choice A (Spain) is a geographical location but does not specify a store that sells musical instruments.",
    "Choice B (grocery store) is unlikely to sell a mandolin, as grocery stores primarily sell food and household items.",
    "Choices C (musical instrument store) and D (music store) both seem to imply stores that would sell musical instruments, including mandolins.",
    "Choice E (instrument case) refers to a product rather than a store, thus it is not a valid option for buying a mandolin.",
    "Between choices C and D, they both can potentially sell mandolins. However, \"musical instrument store\" (C) is more specific than \"music store\" (D) and indicates a wider focus on instruments.",
    "It's more likely that a specialized musical instrument store (C) would have a brand new mandolin and potentially a storage box available for it as well.",
    "Therefore, considering all the reasoning, choice C is the most appropriate place to buy a brand new mandolin with a storage box."
