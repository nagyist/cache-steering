  "query": "Question: An American might hike a mountain north to get to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: switzerland\nC: orlando\nD: austria\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the geographical context of the question: An American hiking north suggests a journey that leads to a different country or region located north of the United States.",
    "Consider the options provided. Canada is directly north of the United States, while Switzerland and Austria are located across the Atlantic Ocean in Europe, which doesn\u2019t have a direct northward route from the U.S.",
    "Evaluate the options further: \"Orlando\" is a city in Florida, which is located south of many places in the U.S., thus not applicable to a northward journey. The \"surface of earth\" is too vague and doesn\u2019t signify a specific destination.",
    "Given that the goal is to find a specific viable destination for an American hiking north, the only appropriate option is Canada, as it is the closest and most logical northward destination from the U.S.",
    "Confirm the other options: Switzerland and Austria require initial travel east, while the \"surface of earth\" does not represent a distinct target."
