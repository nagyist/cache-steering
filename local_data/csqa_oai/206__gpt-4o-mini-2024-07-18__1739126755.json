  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what the term \"peace\" implies in this context. It suggests a positive emotional state toward others, such as goodwill or compassion.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided. \"Names\" (A) do not correlate with fostering peace. Having names for people doesn't inherently imply any strong emotional connection.",
    "Then, consider \"words\" (B). While words can convey messages of peace, they do not capture the depth of emotional connection or empathy toward others.",
    "Looking at \"naval\" (C), this term pertains to the navy or sea, which is irrelevant to emotional interactions among humans.",
    "Next, \"bladders\" (D) refers to a bodily organ and does not relate to feelings or interpersonal relationships, and therefore is not relevant.",
    "Finally, we examine \"feelings\" (E). This term directly relates to emotions, which align with wanting peace and harmony with other humans. Strong feelings would underpin the desire for peace.",
    "Since \"feelings\" is the only choice that accurately reflects a strong emotional desire for peace, we confirm our answer."
