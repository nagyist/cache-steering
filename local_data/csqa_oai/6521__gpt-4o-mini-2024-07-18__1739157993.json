  "query": "Question: what do you extend to have a bigger back yard?\n\nChoices:\nA: suburb\nB: back of house\nC: forest\nD: property\nE: neighborhood",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what one would extend in order to increase the size of a backyard.",
    "A backyard is typically part of a property, specifically the area behind a house.",
    "Among the given options, 'property' directly relates to ownership of land, which includes the backyard.",
    "'Suburb' refers to a residential area, which does not directly indicate extension of a backyard.",
    "The 'back of house' is where a backyard exists but extending this wouldn't logically increase the size of the backyard.",
    "A 'forest' is not an extension of a backyard as it is a distinct ecosystem and not a property extension.",
    "A 'neighborhood' includes multiple properties and is also not something one can extend to increase a specific backyard size.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer that directly relates to extending a space to create a larger backyard is 'property'."
