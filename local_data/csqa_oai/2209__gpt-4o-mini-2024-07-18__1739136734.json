  "query": "Question: Where is a small dog likely to be well groomed?\n\nChoices:\nA: animal shelter\nB: backyard\nC: park\nD: dog show\nE: georgia",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations where small dogs are likely to receive grooming services.",
    "Animal shelters often focus on caring for the dogs and may not prioritize grooming unless it's essential for health or adoptability.",
    "Backyards may not have the necessary grooming tools or expertise, as they are typically private spaces for the dog to play or relax.",
    "Parks are generally outdoor spaces for recreation and might not provide any grooming services. They're more for walking and socializing.",
    "Dog shows are events specifically designed to showcase dogs, and grooming is an essential part of preparing them for such presentations.",
    "Therefore, small dogs at a dog show are likely to be well-groomed due to the competitive nature of those events and the emphasis on appearance.",
    "Meanwhile, small dogs in the other options (animal shelter, backyard, park) may not receive as much attention to their grooming.",
    "Given this analysis, the option that stands out as the most likely place for a small dog to be well-groomed is a dog show."
