  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"the shower obviously wasn't in the living room,\" which indicates we need to consider places where showers are typically found.",
    "Showers are generally found in areas specifically designed for bathing and personal cleanliness rather than social or communal living spaces like a living room.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided:\n- A: spa - Spas have showers for relaxation and hygiene.\n- B: at hotel - Hotels typically include showers in the guest rooms.\n- C: motel room - Motels also usually provide showers within their rooms for guests.\n- D: bathroom - This is the most common place to find a shower.\n- E: locker room - Locker rooms often have showers available for personal hygiene after sports or workouts.",
    "From the analysis, options A, B, C, D, and E all can contain showers in some context.",
    "However, the living room is a clear indicator that the shower must be somewhere more appropriate for bathing.",
    "Among the options, D: bathroom stands out as the most likely answer since it directly corresponds to where one would find a shower in a typical home setting.",
    "While A, B, C, and E are valid locations for showers, they don't fit the context of \"home\" as precisely as D: bathroom does.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that if the shower is not in the living room, it is most likely in the bathroom."
