  "query": "Question: The tennis court suffered from fraternity pranks, where was it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: college campus\nB: michigan\nC: health club\nD: wimbledon\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a \"fraternity prank\" usually involves. Such pranks are typically associated with college students, particularly those in fraternities, suggesting a college environment.",
    "Next, I consider the term \"tennis court.\" While tennis courts can be found in various locations, including health clubs, colleges, and public towns, the association with fraternity pranks indicates a campus setting.",
    "Now, looking at the options provided, the majority point towards a college-related context. The presence of fraternities implies a college campus where such sports facilities would likely exist.",
    "Choices B (Michigan) and D (Wimbledon) specify locations but do not inherently relate to the context of fraternity pranks. While Michigan may have college campuses, it does not directly imply that pranks occurred there. Similarly, Wimbledon is primarily known for its prestigious tennis championship, rather than fraternity culture.",
    "Choice C (health club) is a location where tennis courts can exist, but it lacks the collegiate context relevant to fraternity pranks.",
    "Choice E (town) is too broad and does not specifically point to a location associated with fraternity culture.",
    "Thus, after analyzing the nature of fraternity pranks and the types of locations associated with them, college campus emerges as the most fitting option."
