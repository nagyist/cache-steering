  "steps": [
    "To stop being a lover, one must take actions that diminish emotional or physical connection.",
    "Distance can play a crucial role in reducing feelings of love; therefore, distancing oneself can weaken the bond.",
    "Alternately, falling in love with someone else can also divert attention and emotions away from the current partner, thus stopping the act of being a lover.",
    "However, making love typically reinforces the loving relationship rather than ceasing it.",
    "Loving more and touching tenderly clearly strengthen the emotional ties rather than breaking them.",
    "Considering all of the options, the two most likely choices to lead to stopping being a lover are A (distance themselves) and B (fall in love).",
    "Distance seems a more direct approach to explicitly cutting ties than the more ambiguous act of falling in love.",
    "While both options might work, A appears more straightforward and targeted at ending a relationship.",
    "B could result in a new relationship without necessarily ending the previous one, depending on the circumstances."
