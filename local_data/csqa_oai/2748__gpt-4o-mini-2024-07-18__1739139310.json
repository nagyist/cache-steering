  "steps": [
    "Marmosets are small primates native to the New World, specifically to South America. Therefore, they are commonly found in southern areas of this region.",
    "The question asks for a southern area outside of the US, which helps narrow down the options since the US does not have native populations of marmosets.",
    "Looking at the choices given, Latin America is the only region that accurately represents a geographic area in which marmosets are naturally found, including Brazil and other surrounding countries.",
    "The other options (mountains, burrow, home, New Hampshire) do not refer to geographical areas in Latin America. A mountain range is not an area where marmosets are specifically found, and 'burrow' and 'home' are not relevant geographic indicators.",
    "New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern US, which is not part of the natural habitat for marmosets.",
    "Thus, the only appropriate and relevant answer that matches the description of a southern area where marmosets are likely found is Latin America."
