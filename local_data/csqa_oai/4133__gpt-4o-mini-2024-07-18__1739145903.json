  "query": "Question: In what sort of container should you keep your ficus?\n\nChoices:\nA: refigerator\nB: screened porch\nC: clay pot\nD: shady places\nE: arboretum",
  "steps": [
    "I need to understand what a ficus plant is and its care requirements. Ficus plants generally thrive in containers that allow for proper drainage and aeration for their roots.",
    "Next, I consider the container options provided in the question. A refrigerator is not suitable for a ficus as it is too cold and dark.",
    "The screened porch is an option, but it doesn't specify the type of container, and being outdoors could expose the plant to varying weather conditions.",
    "A clay pot is often recommended for many indoor plants, including ficus, because it allows for good air circulation and drainage.",
    "Shady places could refer to where to position the plant rather than the type of container, and it\u2019s important for the ficus to get adequate light.",
    "An arboretum is generally a place where trees and plants are grown for research and display, and not a container. It would not be practical for keeping a home plant like a ficus.",
    "Given the options, the clay pot stands out as the best choice for keeping a ficus plant healthy.",
    "I also double-check all options to ensure that none of the other containers could potentially provide the correct environment for a ficus.",
    "After considering all factors, the clay pot is clearly the most suitable option for a ficus plant."
