    "The question asks what is likely to happen when someone is eating healthier and exercising.",
    "Eating healthier typically leads to improved nutrition and better overall health.",
    "Exercising regularly often results in physical fitness improvements, such as increased strength and endurance.",
    "Both healthy eating and exercising combined can lead to a reduction in body fat and an increase in lean muscle mass.",
    "Losing body fat is closely associated with weight loss, which is one of the options provided.",
    "While exercising can lead to sweating, and feeling tired after workouts is common, these are not direct outcomes of healthier eating.",
    "Getting in shape can be a broader outcome of healthier lifestyle choices, but it doesn't specifically define weight loss.",
    "Diet may imply improvements in nutritional intake but doesn't directly state a result of eating healthier and exercising.",
    "Among the choices, \"weight loss\" directly fits as a plausible and expected outcome of combining healthy eating and exercise."
