  "steps": [
    "The context is about investigating a shipwreck, which typically occurs underwater.",
    "Robotic devices are often used for preliminary inspections in underwater explorations.",
    "When sending a human down to explore a shipwreck more closely, they would typically be placed in a safe, specialized vehicle designed for underwater use.",
    "A rowboat is not suitable for deep underwater exploration as it is meant for traveling on the surface.",
    "A chair does not provide appropriate safety or technical support for underwater exploration.",
    "The term \"school\" does not relate to underwater exploration or human safety.",
    "An internet cafe is irrelevant in this context as it does not assist with underwater exploration.",
    "The best fit among the options for sending a human down for underwater exploration is a submarine, which is designed for such purposes.",
    "A submarine provides the necessary technology and life support systems for a human to operate underwater safely while exploring the shipwreck."
