  "query": "Question: Where did many municipalities have their cemetery?\n\nChoices:\nA: churchyard\nB: personal homes\nC: most cities\nD: populated area\nE: field",
  "steps": [
    "I start by considering the historical context of cemeteries and their typical locations in municipalities.",
    "Traditionally, many municipalities established cemeteries in churchyards, particularly in earlier centuries when churches were central to community life.",
    "I recall that churchyards are associated with church property and were often used for burials in communities that followed Christian practices.",
    "While cemeteries can indeed be located in various places, the question asks specifically about municipalities, which implies a regular and organized practice.",
    "I think about the other options: personal homes are less common as places for cemeteries due to space and regulation issues.",
    "\"Most cities\" could suggest a variety of locations but is too vague in the context of organized burial practices.",
    "\"Populated area\" is also a broad term and does not specifically indicate a typical burial site within municipalities.",
    "Lastly, \"field\" implies a more rural setting, which does not align with the historical practice of having cemeteries in municipalities.",
    "Thus, the answer that best fits the historical and organized nature of burial sites within municipalities is likely \"churchyard.\""
