  "query": "Question: John is drinking down the highway and he's quite lost.  Where might he go to buy a map?\n\nChoices:\nA: taco bell\nB: truck stop\nC: amusement park\nD: atlas\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "John is currently on the highway and is lost, indicating that he needs assistance with navigation.",
    "To navigate effectively, he would require a physical map or some navigation tools, which are typically found at specific types of locations.",
    "Taco Bell is a fast-food restaurant primarily for food and does not provide maps or navigational aid. Hence, it's not a suitable choice.",
    "An amusement park generally caters to entertainment and attractions, and while there may be maps for the park itself, it would not serve as a resource for a highway map.",
    "An atlas is a book of maps that can provide information about roads, highways, and navigation; however, \"atlas\" is not a place to buy a map but rather a type of map.",
    "A classroom is a place for educational purposes, and while it may contain maps, it is not meant for purchasing or buying maps.",
    "A truck stop is a common place for travelers, especially those on highways, to refuel, eat, and often purchase travel necessities, including maps.",
    "Considering all the options, the most logical and fitting location for John to buy a map while he's traveling down the highway is a truck stop."
