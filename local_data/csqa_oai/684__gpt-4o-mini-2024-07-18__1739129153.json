  "steps": [
    "The question asks which white meat goes well with potatoes. We need to identify options that are classified as white meat.",
    "White meats typically include poultry and certain types of fish. In the options provided, we will look for candidates that fit this category.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"chicken\" (option C) is a well-known type of white meat and is commonly paired with potatoes in various dishes.",
    "Next, we consider \"tuna\" (option D), which is actually classified as a fish and is usually not considered white meat in the same way poultry is. While tuna can be light in color, it is not typically paired with potatoes as a main dish.",
    "The other options, \"maryland\" (option B), and \"kitchen cupboard\" or \"pantry\" (options A and E), do not pertain to types of meat. \"Maryland\" might refer to a style of chicken preparation but is not directly a type of meat itself.",
    "To further evaluate, chicken is versatile and is often served with potatoes in various cuisines, confirming it as a strong candidate.",
    "Since we are comparing only viable options, we've determined that chicken (option C) is the only appropriate answer based on the criteria of being white meat that goes well with potatoes."
