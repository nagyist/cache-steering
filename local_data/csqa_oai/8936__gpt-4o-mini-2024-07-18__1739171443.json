  "steps": [
    "First, consider what steam is. Steam is the gaseous form of water and is produced when water is heated to its boiling point.",
    "Next, evaluate the concept of condensation. Condensate is the liquid formed when steam cools down and turns back into water, which would not encourage steam to turn into vapor.",
    "Now, consider rain. Rain is also liquid water falling from the sky, and exposure to it would lead to cooling rather than vaporization.",
    "Next, analyze liquid water. If steam is exposed to liquid water, this could lead to heat absorption by the water, and thus it does not promote the quick transition of steam into vapor.",
    "Now let's look at ice. Ice is solid water and additionally would require heat to melt, which again does not help steam become vapor.",
    "Lastly, examine cold air. Cold air would likely cool down the steam, causing it to condense instead of vaporizing.",
    "Having ruled out all other options, assess which condition could allow steam to quickly transition to vapor. Steam generally vaporizes more quickly when it is in cool air, as it will expand and lose heat quickly.",
    "Upon final evaluation, it's apparent that the best choice for steam to turn to vapor quickly is when it is exposed to cold air, as this permits the gaseous state to remain and expand without condensing back into liquid."
