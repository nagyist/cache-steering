    "Consider the context of creating art, which is typically viewed positively, but can also have negative effects.",
    "Examine the choices one by one to see which one might relate to a negative effect.",
    "Option A: communication. Art often serves as a medium for communication and can foster understanding; thus, it is unlikely to be a negative effect.",
    "Option B: pride. While artists may feel proud of their creations, this usually doesn\u2019t constitute a negative effect in general.",
    "Option C: pleasure. Generally, art is associated with pleasure and enjoyment, so it is not considered a negative effect.",
    "Option D: controversy. Art can often evoke strong opinions and provoke discussions, which may lead to disagreement and controversy, making it a plausible negative effect.",
    "Option E: recognition. While artists may seek or gain recognition, this is typically viewed as a positive outcome, not a negative effect.",
    "Based on this analysis, option D (controversy) stands out as a negative effect of creating art due to its potential to provoke unrest or heated debates."
