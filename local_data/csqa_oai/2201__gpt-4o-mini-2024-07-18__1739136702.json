  "query": "Question: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty?\n\nChoices:\nA: oil refineries\nB: wall\nC: show\nD: own home\nE: water fountain",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what types of plumbing would not serve the purpose of quenching thirst.",
    "I consider what plumbing typically consists of, such as pipes, fixtures, and connections for water distribution, drainage, and possibly heating systems.",
    "I reflect that plumbing systems generally are meant to transport water or convey waste and are therefore crucial for various facilities, including residential homes, industrial sites, and public services.",
    "I will analyze the options provided one by one to understand their contexts and how plumbing fits into each.",
    "In option A, \"oil refineries,\" plumbing would not serve any purpose related to drinking water; rather, it might be for transporting oil or chemicals, making it unhelpful for thirst.",
    "In option B, \"wall,\" plumbing inside a wall may not be accessible for drinking, as walls are static structures without direct functionality for quenching thirst.",
    "In option C, \"show,\" this is ambiguous, but typically it would not relate to any plumbing useful for drinking water unless there happened to be water features.",
    "In option D, \"own home,\" this can encompass plumbing meant for potable water, which can certainly serve thirst.",
    "In option E, \"water fountain,\" this is usually designed explicitly to provide drinking water and thus directly serves thirst.",
    "After reviewing all options, I conclude that \"oil refineries\" would represent plumbing that offers little to no use for someone who is thirsty."
