  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"type of science.\" It refers to a specific field or area of study within the broader scientific community.",
    "Next, let's analyze the options provided to see which one best fits the definition of a type of science.",
    "Choice A, \"space lab,\" refers to a facility where scientific research is conducted in space. While it supports scientific research, it is not a type of science itself.",
    "Choice B, \"nanotechnology,\" represents a specific branch of science focused on the manipulation of matter at the nanometer scale. This fits the definition of a type of science.",
    "Choice C, \"university,\" is an educational institution that can offer multiple types of sciences but is not a type of science by itself.",
    "Choice D, \"methodology,\" refers to the system of methods used in a particular area of study or activity. It is related to the scientific process but is not a type of science.",
    "Choice E, \"school,\" typically refers to an educational institution for learning and does not specify any type of science.",
    "Among all the choices, \"nanotechnology\" is the only one that explicitly describes a specific discipline within science."
