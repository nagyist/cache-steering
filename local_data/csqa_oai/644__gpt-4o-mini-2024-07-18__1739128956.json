  "query": "Question: Where would one find a captive monkey?\n\nChoices:\nA: rain forest\nB: tree tops\nC: toy store\nD: zoological gardens\nE: great outdoors",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of monkeys. Monkeys are typically found in tropical rainforests, but they can also inhabit other environments such as savannas and mountainous regions.",
    "Next, evaluate the options given. A rain forest (A) is a natural habitat for many species of monkeys, but it doesn't necessarily imply captivity.",
    "The tree tops (B) also refer to a natural environment where monkeys would be found, but again this does not indicate a captive setting.",
    "A toy store (C) would not be a suitable place to find a real captive monkey, as this location is designed for selling toys, not housing animals.",
    "Zoological gardens (D) are established specifically to house animals in captivity for educational and conservation purposes. This option clearly indicates that the monkey would be captive.",
    "The great outdoors (E) generally refers to natural, wild areas, making it unsuitable for a captive monkey.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that aligns with the concept of finding a captive monkey is the zoological gardens (D).",
    "To confirm, a zoological garden is one of the most common places one would actually find monkeys held in captivity, as opposed to the other options which refer to either wild habitats or irrelevant locations."
