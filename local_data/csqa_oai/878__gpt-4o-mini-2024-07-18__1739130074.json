  "steps": [
    "The act of putting on makeup is often associated with enhancing one's appearance.",
    "Looking attractive is a common motivation for people who use makeup, as many use it to emphasize their features.",
    "While feelings of pleasure can be a byproduct of applying makeup, it is not necessarily the primary goal.",
    "Receiving compliments might be a secondary goal for some individuals, but it typically arises from the desire to look attractive.",
    "Interesting experiences and joy are broader terms that don't specifically target the activity of applying makeup.",
    "I can conclude that the main intent here is tied directly to appearance and social perception.",
    "Out of all the options, looking attractive is the most relevant to the act of wearing makeup.",
    "Thus, while compliments and pleasure are possible outcomes, they don't represent the primary goal as clearly as the desire to enhance attractiveness."
