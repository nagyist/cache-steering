  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options to determine which object is more likely to have a plastic handle.",
    "Option A: A watering can typically has a plastic handle, making it a possible candidate.",
    "Option B: A coffeepot often has a plastic handle as well, which fits the description.",
    "Option C: \"Carrying things\" is not an object and does not apply here.",
    "Option D: A baseball bat usually does not have a plastic handle; it is typically made of wood or metal, so this is unlikely.",
    "Option E: A glass bottle generally does not have a handle at all, ruling it out.",
    "Next, we need to consider functionality. When a typical object like a coffeepot spills, it is usually due to being dropped.",
    "Thus, we should focus on A (watering can) and B (coffeepot) since they both can be used to hold hot liquids and have handles.",
    "According to common practical scenarios, coffeepots are more likely to contain hot liquid, making it plausible for a significant spill when dropped.",
    "Considering the context of \"the hot liquid spilled everywhere,\" a coffeepot seems to fit this description better than a watering can."
