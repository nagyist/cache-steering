  "query": "Question: Everybody seemed to have a horse not just the regular gamblers, which event always brings out the biggest crowds to the sport?\n\nChoices:\nA: race track\nB: kentucky derby\nC: american southwest\nD: triple crown\nE: horse derby",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that everyone seemed to have a horse, implying a major event where many people participate or have a vested interest.",
    "Next, it states that this event always brings out the biggest crowds to the sport, indicating that it's a highly popular and significant event in the horse racing world.",
    "Looking at the options, I identify the Kentucky Derby, which is one of the most famous horse racing events in the world and is typically characterized by large crowds and widespread participation.",
    "The Triple Crown is also a major series in horse racing, but it consists of three separate races, so it's less likely to be seen as a single event that brings out the biggest crowds.",
    "The term \"race track\" refers to a venue rather than a specific event, thus it cannot be the answer for the event bringing the biggest crowds.",
    "The \"American Southwest\" does not relate to horse racing directly and seems out of context.",
    "The last option, \"horse derby,\" is not specific enough and does not directly refer to the most recognized event. The Kentucky Derby is the more prominent event compared to a general horse derby.",
    "Considering the popularity and uniqueness of the Kentucky Derby, which has a storied history and attracts numerous spectators, it stands out as the event that brings the biggest crowds.",
    "I will double check the reasoning: the context implies an annual event with wide appeal, the Kentucky Derby fits this description perfectly."
