    "The sentence indicates that the person was not in control of the situation and was misled by someone he trusted (his partner).",
    "The word \u201cpawn\u201d suggests a context where the person's role is minor and manipulated, which is commonly used in the context of strategy games like chess.",
    "The phrase \"grand scheme\" is a common expression that refers to a large plan or strategy that has been devised, aligning with the word \u201cscheme\u201d in the choices.",
    "The other choices (C, D, E) do not effectively convey the connotation of manipulation and strategy as well as \"scheme\" does.",
    "\"Chess game\" could also fit as it uses the term \"pawn,\" but it does not fully encompass the idea of a broader plan as well as \u201cscheme.\u201d",
    "We are looking for a phrase that implies manipulation and does not fit well with other choices like \u201cbusiness idea\u201d or \u201cplaying chess,\u201d which are unrelated to the overarching idea of being a pawn.",
    "Upon reviewing all choices, \"scheme\" stands out as the most fitting term that encapsulates the idea of deceit and manipulation in this context."
