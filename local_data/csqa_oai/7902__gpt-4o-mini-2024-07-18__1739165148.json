  "query": "Question: The fox  wants to hide, where does it go?\n\nChoices:\nA: hen house\nB: english hunt\nC: cave\nD: burrow\nE: rural area",
  "steps": [
    "To find a suitable place for a fox to hide, I must consider the natural habitats and behaviors of foxes.",
    "Foxes are known to be wild animals that prefer to create their dens in secluded areas where they feel secure from predators and humans.",
    "A cave could provide shelter and protection, but it may not be the most common choice for a fox in terms of denning.",
    "A burrow is a more typical choice for a fox as it involves digging into the ground to create a hidden nest.",
    "A hen house would be risky as it could attract attention from farmers or owners protecting their chickens.",
    "An English hunt is not a hiding place but rather an activity involving tracking and hunting, which does not provide shelter.",
    "A rural area provides general space, but without specific features such as a den or burrow, it won't ensure safety.",
    "Considering all the options, a burrow would be the most logical and safest choice for a fox to hide."
