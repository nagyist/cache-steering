  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a prom. Proms are typically school-organized events, often formal dances held for high school students.",
    "Next, think about the usual venue settings for such school events. In many schools, traditional venues would include auditoriums or gymnasiums, rather than movie theaters or opera houses.",
    "Now, evaluate the option of a football field. Although it could potentially host events, a football field would not be a common choice for a prom due to its outdoor nature and lack of a formal setting.",
    "Assess the given choices: A movie theater typically does not cater to school proms, as it is not a formal venue suited for dances.",
    "The end of line doesn't correlate with a physical place relevant to the prom venue concept.",
    "Auditoriums, however, are commonly used for school events like proms because they provide the necessary space and appropriate atmosphere for such formal gatherings.",
    "Among the options, the auditorium stands out as the most likely choice for where the couple entered for their prom, being the typical venue for such an event.",
    "Finally, since other options are ruled out as unlikely venues, the most sensible answer given the context is the auditorium."
