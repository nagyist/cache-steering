  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the components of a computer that hold memory and processing chips.",
    "The memory chips store data temporarily for quick access (like RAM), and the processing chips execute instructions (like the CPU).",
    "Based on common computer terminology, the part of the computer that houses both memory chips and processing chips is typically known as the motherboard.",
    "I will evaluate the choices provided:\nChoice A: pantry - This is not related to computers, as it refers to a storage area for food.",
    "Choice B: motherboard - This refers to the main circuit board in a computer, which indeed holds the memory and processing chips.",
    "Choice C: bar - This refers to a place that serves beverages, not a computer component.",
    "Choice D: casino - This refers to a place for gambling, unrelated to computer hardware.",
    "Choice E: supermarket - Like pantry, this is related to grocery shopping and has no connection to computers.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only choice that aligns with the description of holding memory and processing chips is indeed the motherboard."
