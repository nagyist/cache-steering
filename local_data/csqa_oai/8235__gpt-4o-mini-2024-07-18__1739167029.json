  "query": "Question: What is a front yard generally filled with?\n\nChoices:\nA: grass\nB: neighborhood\nC: playhouse\nD: barbeques\nE: suburb",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what a front yard is. A front yard is the area of land that lies between the front of a house and the street.",
    "Next, consider what is typically found in a front yard. Common elements include landscaping features such as grass, flowers, shrubs, or trees.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the answer choices individually for their relevance to what is generally found in a front yard.",
    "Choice A: grass. Grass is a very common feature in most front yards and serves as a primary ground cover.",
    "Choice B: neighborhood. While one could argue that a front yard is part of a neighborhood, a neighborhood itself is not something that fills a front yard.",
    "Choice C: playhouse. Playhouses are often found in backyards more so than front yards, and they are not a typical feature.",
    "Choice D: barbeques. Barbeques are typically associated with patios or backyards rather than front yards.",
    "Choice E: suburb. Like choice B, suburb is a broad term referring to a type of area and does not directly describe a physical item typically found in a front yard.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it is clear that grass is the most universally applicable answer as it is an essential component found in nearly all front yards."
