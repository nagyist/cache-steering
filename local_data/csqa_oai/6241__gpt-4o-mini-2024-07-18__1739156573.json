  "steps": [
    "The context suggests the discussion involves strategies to address inflation, which typically revolves around monetary policy or economic adjustments.",
    "Raising interest rates is a common strategy to combat inflation, as it makes borrowing more expensive and tends to reduce spending.",
    "Lowering prices is generally not a policy decision but rather an outcome. While businesses may lower prices, it is less likely to be a strategy discussed in the context of fighting inflation.",
    "The mention of \"a certain percentage\" could likely relate to monetary policy decisions, which often incorporate specific rates, such as interest rates or inflation targeting, rather than simply \"money.\"",
    "The terms \"more money\" and \"have money\" relate more to liquidity and money supply, but they are less specific as strategies to control inflation than raising interest rates.",
    "Given the phrasing of the question and the context of inflation, the focus appears to be mainly on policy measures implemented by financial institutions.",
    "Now, out of the choices, raising interest rates (A) directly indicates a common response to inflation.",
    "The other options (B, C, D, E) do not align as specifically with a formal policy measure aimed at combating inflation when contrasted with A.",
    "Therefore, the strongest and most relevant choice based on the given context of fighting inflation with a certain percentage is raising interest rates (A)."
