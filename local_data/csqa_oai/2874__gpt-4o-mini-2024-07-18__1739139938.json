  "query": "Question: Farmers will plant an apple tree because they do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: bud\nB: state park\nC: provide shelter\nD: back yard\nE: produce fruit",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the primary reason why farmers would plant an apple tree.",
    "Apple trees are cultivated primarily for the fruits they produce. Farmers plant these trees to harvest apples for consumption and sale.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the options given to see which one directly indicates the purpose behind planting an apple tree.",
    "Option A, \"bud,\" does not directly relate to planting an apple tree for a specific purpose; it's more about a phase in growth.",
    "Option B, \"state park,\" is irrelevant to the question since it doesn't pertain to the act of planting or the purpose regarding fruit trees.",
    "Option C, \"provide shelter,\" is not the primary reason for planting apple trees, as shelter is not their main function.",
    "Option D, \"back yard,\" relates more to where they could be planted rather than the motivation for planting them.",
    "Option E, \"produce fruit,\" directly states the main reason farmers plant apple trees, as they do it to harvest apples.",
    "After reviewing all the options, it is clear that the best answer to the question is that farmers plant apple trees to \"produce fruit.\""
