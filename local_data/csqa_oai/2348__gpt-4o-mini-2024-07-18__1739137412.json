  "steps": [
    "The question asks where humans store urine, which is a biological process.",
    "I need to identify which of the provided options corresponds to an organ in the human body.",
    "Options A (feelings) and B (names) are abstract concepts and not organs, so they can be eliminated.",
    "Options C (naval) does not refer to an organ relevant to urine storage; it likely is a misspelling of \"navel,\" which is also not related to urine.",
    "Options D (bladders) and E (bladders) are the same answer presented twice.",
    "The bladder is the anatomical structure where urine is stored before it is expelled from the body.",
    "Since both D and E are the same, I need to confirm that the correct answer based on biological knowledge is indeed \"bladder.\"",
    "As there are no other relevant anatomical structures or functions related to urine storage among the options, the answer must be the bladder."
