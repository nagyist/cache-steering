  "query": "Question: If you want to make a big splash in a river with a rock, from where should you throw it?\n\nChoices:\nA: mountains countryside\nB: ground\nC: bridge\nD: mountain range\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "To make a big splash in a river with a rock, we need to consider the height from which the rock is thrown. The higher the point of release, the more potential energy the rock has when it hits the water.",
    "Throwing a rock from the ground level (Choice B) would not generate enough height to create a significant splash because the rock would just fall a short distance.",
    "Throwing the rock from the surface of the earth (Choice E) is the same as throwing it from the ground, which will also not create a big splash.",
    "Throwing from the mountains countryside (Choice A) might provide some elevation over the river, but it's not necessarily the highest point.",
    "Throwing from a bridge (Choice C) would provide exceptional height directly over the river, maximizing the impact and creating a larger splash when the rock hits the water.",
    "A mountain range (Choice D) usually implies more distance from the river itself, which would not allow for a controlled throw and would not guarantee the rock would even hit the river.",
    "Evaluating all the options, throwing from a bridge (Choice C) stands out as the most effective way to create a big splash because it provides height and proximity to the water."
