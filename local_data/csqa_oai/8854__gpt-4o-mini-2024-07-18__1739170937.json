  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to purchase a toy balloon?\n\nChoices:\nA: birthday party\nB: church\nC: amusement park\nD: parade\nE: circus",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify locations where toy balloons are typically sold or distributed.",
    "Birthday parties often have decorations, which can include balloons. Stores may sell toy balloons specifically for this occasion.",
    "Churches are more focused on spiritual gatherings and services, making the sale of toy balloons less common there.",
    "Amusement parks often have vendors selling various souvenirs, including toy balloons, as they are popular among children visiting these parks.",
    "Parades frequently have floats and giveaways, and it's common for participants to distribute balloons to the crowd.",
    "Circuses often have entertainers and clowns who might sell or give out toy balloons to children attending.",
    "Now I will compare the locations for their suitability: \n- While birthday parties are a final destination for balloons, they don't sell them on-site regularly.\n- Church is an unlikely place for purchasing balloons.\n- Amusement parks are a frequent site for balloon vendors targeting families.\n- Parades are potential locations but primarily for giveaways rather than purchases.\n- Circuses usually have balloons, but again, it might focus on entertainment rather than a point of sale.",
    "Based on the analysis, amusement parks are specifically suited for purchasing toy balloons due to dedicated vendors present."
