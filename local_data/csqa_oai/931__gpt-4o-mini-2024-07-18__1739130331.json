  "query": "Question: Where could you find a theater which only has unpaid actors?\n\nChoices:\nA: shopping mall\nB: hospitals\nC: populated area\nD: school\nE: military base",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what is meant by \"unpaid actors.\" Typically, unpaid actors are found in community theater productions or educational settings, where performances are done for non-financial motivations.",
    "Next, looking at the options, a shopping mall (A) is generally not a place where theater productions occur regularly, especially not with unpaid actors.",
    "Hospitals (B) usually focus on healthcare services and do not typically have theaters or performances involving actors, paid or unpaid.",
    "A populated area (C) could refer to various types of community events, and although it could potentially have unpaid actors, it is too broad and does not specifically indicate a theater.",
    "Schools (D) often have drama programs that feature unpaid student actors in productions or plays, making this a strong candidate.",
    "A military base (E) is generally focused on military activities and typically does not house theater productions, especially with unpaid actors.",
    "By evaluating the options, the strongest possibility for finding a theater with unpaid actors comes from the school setting, where students perform in school plays without financial compensation."
