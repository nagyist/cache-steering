  "query": "Question: How does a flea locomote?\n\nChoices:\nA: attack\nB: suck blood\nC: stay\nD: lay eggs\nE: jump",
  "steps": [
    "Fleas are known for their remarkable ability to move quickly and efficiently, primarily using their powerful legs.",
    "The primary mode of locomotion for a flea is by jumping, which allows them to travel great distances relative to their body size.",
    "Fleas have long, strong hind legs that are specially adapted for jumping; they can leap up to 200 times their body length.",
    "This jumping ability is crucial for escaping predators and moving between hosts, as fleas are ectoparasites that live on mammals and birds.",
    "While fleas do have other behaviors such as blood-sucking, laying eggs, and evading threats, these do not pertain to their locomotion.",
    "By analyzing the choices given, \"jump\" directly corresponds to the method of locomotion most specifically associated with a flea.",
    "Other options like \"attack,\" \"suck blood,\" \"stay,\" and \"lay eggs\" refer to different actions not related to their mobility or locomotion.",
    "Thus, the correct answer focuses on the primary locomotion behavior of fleas."
