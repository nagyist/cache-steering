  "query": "Question: Where would you find a computer near very young people learning?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: house\nC: classroom\nD: hallway\nE: demonstration",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of \"very young people learning.\" Typically, this refers to a school environment where learning takes place, particularly with children or students.",
    "Next, evaluate the most obvious location associated with learning and young people. A classroom is specifically designed for teaching and learning, making it a primary setting for educational activities.",
    "Look at the other options: \n- An apartment (A) and a house (B) are residential spaces and are not primarily focused on structured learning.\n- A hallway (D) is a passageway and would not be considered a place where computers are primarily used for learning.\n- A demonstration (E) could involve computers but is not a location in itself; it typically describes an activity or event that might occur in a classroom or other venue.",
    "Given that a classroom is tailored for educational purposes and is where young people would commonly find computers during learning activities, it stands out as the best option.",
    "Finally, confirm that the presence of computers in classrooms is common in modern educational settings. Schools integrate technology for teaching, reinforcing that this is the correct answer."
