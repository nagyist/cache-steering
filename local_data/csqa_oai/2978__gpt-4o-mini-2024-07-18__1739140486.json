  "query": "Question: Where could you find passengers that are planning to travel to another continent?\n\nChoices:\nA: car\nB: bus depot\nC: bus stop\nD: library\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It asks about where passengers planning to travel to another continent can be found.",
    "Traveling to another continent typically requires a mode of transportation that covers long distances, often necessitating air travel.",
    "I will review the options provided and see which corresponds to air travel or is commonly associated with international travel.",
    "Option A: car does not inherently indicate international travel. A car is more associated with local or domestic travel.",
    "Option B: bus depot is also primarily associated with local or regional travel. While buses can cross state lines, they typically do not cross continents.",
    "Option C: bus stop would similarly align with regional or local travel, not primarily international travel.",
    "Option D: library is not associated with travel at all, making it irrelevant.",
    "Now I consider option E: airport, which is specifically designed for international travel. Airports are the primary locations where passengers can board flights to other continents.",
    "Given that the question is about passengers planning to travel internationally, the airport is the most logical choice.",
    "I conclude by confirming that the only suitable answer that specifically relates to passengers traveling to another continent is the airport."
