  "query": "Question: Where would you find a cottage that gets flooded often?\n\nChoices:\nA: desert\nB: painting\nC: fairy story\nD: mountains\nE: rural area",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a location where a cottage often experiences flooding.",
    "Let's analyze each option regarding the likelihood of flooding.",
    "Option A: A desert is characterized by low rainfall and arid conditions, making flooding extremely unlikely.",
    "Option B: A painting is a representation or artwork, not a physical location, so it cannot experience flooding.",
    "Option C: A fairy story often includes fictional and fantastical elements, and while a fairy tale cottage might get flooded in a story, it's not a real-world location.",
    "Option D: Mountains generally have higher elevations and tend to have good drainage. While there can be flash floods in mountain areas due to rain or melting snow, it's not common for cottages themselves to be regularly flooded.",
    "Option E: A rural area can often include valleys or floodplains, which are more susceptible to flooding, especially if near rivers or low-lying lands.",
    "Considering the analysis, option E seems to be the most plausible answer because rural areas have a higher likelihood of encountering flooding events compared to the other choices."
