  "query": "Question: Where can you find someone's number written on paper?\n\nChoices:\nA: math book\nB: mathematics\nC: office\nD: lottery\nE: phonebook",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze each option to determine where someone's phone number might typically be found written on paper.",
    "Option A, \"math book,\" typically contains mathematical problems and concepts rather than personal information such as phone numbers.",
    "Option B, \"mathematics,\" is a subject and does not refer to a physical item where a phone number would be found.",
    "Option C, \"office,\" may contain various personal documents, so it is possible that a phone number could be found written on a paper in an office context.",
    "Option D, \"lottery,\" does not imply any connection to personal information, as lottery tickets do not generally contain phone numbers.",
    "Option E, \"phonebook,\" is specifically designed to list people's names and their associated phone numbers, making it a very likely place to find someone's number written on paper.",
    "Now, I will compare options C and E since both could potentially contain a phone number.",
    "While an office may have phone numbers on various papers, the phonebook is a dedicated source for finding phone numbers explicitly, suggesting it is the best answer.",
    "Therefore, after considering the possible contexts for written phone numbers, it is clear that option E is the most direct and relevant answer."
