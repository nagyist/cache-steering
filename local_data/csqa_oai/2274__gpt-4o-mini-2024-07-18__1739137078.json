  "query": "Question: Joe kept all of his school books on a shelf where he could easily get to them when he wanted to study.  Where was this shelf likely located?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: school building\nC: bank\nD: bookstore\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the context of the question. Joe kept his school books, which typically belong to a student and are used for studying.",
    "The shelf needs to be in a convenient location for someone who wants to study easily, indicating it must be close to where Joe spends time studying.",
    "Let's analyze the options:\n- A: cabinet - While a cabinet could be a storage space, it\u2019s not specifically mentioned as being easy to access for studying.\n- B: school building - This could be a potential option, as schools typically have designated areas for students to study.\n- C: bank - A bank is an unlikely place for school books as it is not relevant to studying.\n- D: bookstore - Although books are found here, it\u2019s not a place where someone would store their personal school books for easy access.\n- E: bedroom - A bedroom is a common place for students to study and store their personal belongings, including school books.",
    "Now comparing the most feasible options between B (school building) and E (bedroom). A bedroom would provide a private and personal space conducive to studying regularly.",
    "Considering Joe likely would want regular access to his books while studying, a bedroom seems to be the most logical location as it combines both easy access and functionality for study purposes.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the shelf where Joe kept his school books was most likely in his bedroom."
