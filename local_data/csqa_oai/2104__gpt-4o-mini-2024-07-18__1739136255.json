    "Next, let\u2019s evaluate each answer choice to see how it relates to a career and whether it fits the theme of curiosity.",
    "A: \"use television\" - This does not suggest a career. It is more of an activity, and it doesn't directly connect to curiosity.",
    "B: \"see exhibits\" - This could suggest a career in museums or exhibitions, which does align with curiosity, as one might be driven by a curiosity for knowledge or history. However, it is still more of an activity.",
