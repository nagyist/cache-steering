  "query": "Question: John doesn't like seeing new movies. He thinks that they're bad, and excessive.   What emotion might he experience where he sees one.\n\nChoices:\nA: curiosity\nB: excitement\nC: education\nD: wonder\nE: fear",
  "steps": [
    "John has a negative opinion towards new movies, believing they are bad and excessive.",
    "Since he doesn't like them, he is unlikely to feel positive emotions like excitement or wonder when he sees one.",
    "Curiosity generally arises from interest or intrigue, which John's dislike does not suggest he would feel towards new movies.",
    "Education suggests a proactive desire to learn something new; however, John\u2019s negative view suggests he wouldn\u2019t expect to gain any value from them.",
    "Fear could result from seeing something he deems bad or excessive. This emotion could arise out of concern or anxiety regarding the movie's content.",
    "Given his feelings about new movies, it is plausible to deduce he might experience fear when he encounters one, based on his beliefs about their quality.",
    "Other options (curiosity, excitement, education, wonder) seem less likely given John's strong aversion to new movies.",
    "Considering all the options and his opinions, fear stands out as the emotion he might most likely experience."
