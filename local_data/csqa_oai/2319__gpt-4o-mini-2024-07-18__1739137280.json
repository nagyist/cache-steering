    "The question is asking what might have been thrilling for Jamie when she started fiddling at 13.",
    "The context indicates that Jamie had never played an instrument before, suggesting that learning and experiencing music could be thrilling for her.",
    "Option A, \"dancing about,\" while potentially exciting, does not specifically relate to her experience of starting to fiddle.",
    "Option B, \"being happy,\" is a general emotion and does not directly encompass the thrill from a specific experience.",
    "Option C, \"snapped fiddle string,\" is generally a negative experience and not something that would typically be thrilling for anyone.",
    "Option D, \"square dancing,\" might be enjoyable, but it is unrelated to the act of fiddling specifically.",
    "Option E, \"discovery,\" fits well since discovering a new skill and the joys of music would likely be thrilling for someone beginning to play an instrument.",
    "Since \"discovery\" relates directly to the excitement and novelty of learning to play the fiddle, it stands out as the most relevant and fitting answer."
