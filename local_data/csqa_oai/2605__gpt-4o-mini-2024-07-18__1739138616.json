  "steps": [
    "The question implies that certain individuals do not have a positive experience when they get drunk.",
    "Being drunk typically involves experiencing some form of intoxication, which is often considered enjoyable; however, the question states that some do not enjoy it.",
    "Next, I must consider common negative effects associated with getting drunk. These effects may lead to discomfort or unpleasant experiences.",
    "In the list of choices, I see 'nausea,' which is a common negative side effect of excessive alcohol consumption.",
    "I can also recognize that \u2018fights\u2019 can occur when people are drunk, but it is not something that happens to everyone who drinks; it is more of a consequence rather than a direct effect.",
    "The option 'death' is an extreme outcome of excessive drinking, but it is not something that typically affects individuals in the short term of getting drunk.",
    "The effects of 'intoxication' or 'relaxation' are inherently associated with drinking in the opposite sense; they are usually considered positive rather than negative for those who enjoy drinking.",
    "Thus, I should focus on the direct unpleasant experience people might get from drinking, which aligns best with 'nausea.'",
    "Having ruled out the other options, it\u2019s clear that those who do not enjoy getting drunk may often suffer from nausea as a result of it."
