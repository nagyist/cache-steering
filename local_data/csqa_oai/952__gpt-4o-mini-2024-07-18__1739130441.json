  "query": "Question: During the brainstorming session there was a lot of talking and what?\n\nChoices:\nA: obtaining information\nB: exchange of ideas\nC: sharing information\nD: conversation\nE: gathhering of information",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the context of a \"brainstorming session.\" Such sessions are typically characterized by the freeflow of thoughts and ideas among participants.",
    "Next, in a brainstorming session, the primary goal is to generate and develop new ideas rather than merely talking.",
    "Now, let\u2019s analyze the provided choices. Option A: \"obtaining information\" does not fit well, as brainstorming is more about idea generation than information gathering.",
    "Looking at option B: \"exchange of ideas\" could be relevant, as brainstorming often involves participants sharing their ideas with each other.",
    "For option C: \"sharing information,\" this is also applicable, but sharing is often a more one-sided approach compared to the collaborative nature of brainstorming.",
    "Now evaluating option D: \"conversation,\" while talking happens during brainstorming, it doesn't specifically capture the essence of generating ideas.",
    "Lastly, option E: \"gathering of information\" seems less fitting, as brainstorming focuses more on collaboration and ideation rather than simply gathering data.",
    "Considering options B and C are the strongest contenders, we observe that the nature of brainstorming heavily relies on participants exchanging varying thoughts and ideas, which aligns closely with option B.",
    "Thus, while \"sharing information\" could work, \"exchange of ideas\" captures the collaborative and dynamic nature of a brainstorming session more accurately."
