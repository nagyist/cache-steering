  "query": "Question: If you are setting up folding chairs before a sermon where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: room\nB: school\nC: auditorium\nD: party\nE: church",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions setting up folding chairs before a sermon, which implies a gathering for a religious or formal event.",
    "\"Folding chairs\" are commonly used in various settings, but the combination with \"sermon\" narrows down the possibilities significantly.",
    "A \"sermon\" is typically delivered in a religious context, often in a place associated with worship.",
    "The potential places where a sermon is given include a church, auditorium, or similar settings but not in a school or a party per se.",
    "While an auditorium may hold events that include sermons, it is more often used for lectures, performances, or public meetings rather than strictly religious gatherings.",
    "A \"church\" is the most direct answer, as it is specifically designed for conducting religious services, including sermons.",
    "The context involved makes \"party\" and \"school\" less relevant since they do not typically involve sermons.",
    "Comparing \"church\" and \"auditorium\", since the question specifically indicates a sermon, \"church\" is the most accurate choice."
