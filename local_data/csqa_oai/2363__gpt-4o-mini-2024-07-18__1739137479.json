  "query": "Question: What divider is found in a house that has couches and chairs in it?\n\nChoices:\nA: living room\nB: street\nC: binder\nD: notebook\nE: office suite",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a house containing couches and chairs, which typically indicates a living space where people gather and relax.",
    "The living room is the area in a house specifically designed for socializing and comfort, featuring seating arrangements such as couches and chairs.",
    "Other options listed (street, binder, notebook, office suite) do not typically describe areas within a house.",
    "A street is an outdoor area, which does not fit the context of a house.",
    "A binder and a notebook are office supplies, not areas within a house, making them irrelevant to the question.",
    "An office suite, while associated with workspaces, does not typically contain couches and chairs in a home context, making it an unlikely option.",
    "Given that the only reasonable choice which specifically describes an area in a house suitable for couches and chairs is the living room, this must be the answer."
