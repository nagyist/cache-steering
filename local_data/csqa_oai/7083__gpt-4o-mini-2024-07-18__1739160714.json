  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"shelter in the woods\" means. It implies some form of protection or cover found naturally or artificially in a wooded area.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option to determine if it can provide shelter in a wooded environment.",
    "Option A: house. A house does provide shelter but is typically found in residential areas rather than in the woods.",
    "Option B: shelterbelt. A shelterbelt is a line of trees or shrubs planted to protect against wind and erosion, which does offer some form of shelter but is not a standalone shelter like a structure.",
    "Option C: bus stop. A bus stop is a designated area for public transport, not specifically designed for shelter from the elements, especially in a woods setting.",
    "Option D: tree. A tree offers natural shelter from rain and sun, making it a significant contender as a source of shelter in the woods.",
    "Option E: plants. While plants contribute to shelter in terms of providing some cover, they don\u2019t provide a significant protective structure like a tree does.",
    "Comparing the strongest candidates, I find that trees provide substantial shelter and are inherently present in the woods, while other options either do not offer significant shelter or are not relevant to a wooded environment."
