  "query": "Question: Where would my son place his paper plate?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: his bedroom\nC: dishwasher\nD: cabinet\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where a paper plate might typically be used. In general, paper plates are often used during meals or snacks.",
    "Next, evaluate the most common places where someone would use a paper plate. A table is commonly used for eating.",
    "Now, think about the other choices. His bedroom is not a logical place for a paper plate, as it is primarily meant for sleeping and personal items rather than eating.",
    "Next, consider the dishwasher. While a used paper plate could be placed there after a meal, it is not where he would first place it after use.",
    "Then, evaluate the option of a cabinet. Cabinets are generally used to store utensils and dishes, not to place used items like paper plates.",
    "Consider the option of a restaurant. While a restaurant would have paper plates, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for a son to place his paper plate there if he is not at the restaurant.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most logical place for him to place his paper plate after using it during a meal would be the table.",
    "Thus, upon reviewing the context and evaluating the options, the final answer can be concluded."
