  "query": "Question: The storm was started due to warm waters, what kinds of places does this happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: caribbean\nB: arctic\nC: weather report\nD: america\nE: tropical seas",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the storm was started due to warm waters. This means that we are looking for places characterized by warm water temperatures.",
    "The Caribbean is known for its warm waters, particularly during the hurricane season when storms often develop in the region.",
    "The Arctic, on the other hand, is characterized by cold waters, making it unlikely for storms to start there due to warm water conditions.",
    "A weather report itself is not a location; it is a service that provides information about weather conditions. Therefore, it doesn't fit the criterion of a place with warm waters.",
    "America is a large continent that includes both warm and cold regions. Without specifying a particular area (like tropical regions), it doesn\u2019t necessarily relate to warm waters generating storms.",
    "Tropical seas are designated as areas with warm waters, and they are well-known for being breeding grounds for tropical storms and hurricanes.",
    "Comparing the Caribbean and tropical seas, the Caribbean is part of the larger category of tropical seas, both known for warm water conditions leading to storm formation.",
    "Given that both the Caribbean and tropical seas are associated with warm waters, but tropical seas more broadly cover several regions where warm waters can contribute to storm development, the best answer related to the question is tropical seas.",
    "While the Caribbean is a specific example, the phrase \"tropical seas\" encompasses a wider range of warm water areas that can lead to storm development."
