  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where food can stay cold. We need to evaluate each option in terms of whether it can keep food cold.",
    "A cupboard is typically a storage space at room temperature and does not maintain a cold environment, so it cannot keep food cold.",
    "A fridge is specifically designed to keep food cold by maintaining a low temperature, making it a suitable option.",
    "An oven is used for cooking food, which involves heat, so it cannot keep food cold, and in fact, would heat food up.",
    "A glass is a container that can hold food or beverages. While it can be cold if it contains cold substances (like ice water), it does not inherently keep food cold over time without external means.",
    "A table is just a piece of furniture and does not provide any cold storage. Food placed on a table will warm up to room temperature.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only location that actively keeps food cold is the fridge."
