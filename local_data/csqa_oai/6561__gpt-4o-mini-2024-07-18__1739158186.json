  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Greg's performance was \"mediocre,\" which indicates that it was average or not particularly good.",
    "Given this context, we should consider what kind of habits might align with a mediocre performance. This would likely suggest that his habits are not particularly distinguished or outstanding.",
    "The choices provided are: A (distinguished), B (unique), C (peculiar), D (exceptional), and E (outstanding). Since we are looking for habits that reflect mediocre performance, we should eliminate obvious choices that imply high quality.",
    "Choices A (distinguished), D (exceptional), and E (outstanding) all indicate a higher level of performance or uniqueness, which contradicts the notion of mediocrity.",
    "This leaves us with choices B (unique) and C (peculiar). \"Unique\" suggests something that stands out, while \"peculiar\" implies something that is odd or unusual.",
    "Peculiar habits might suggest inconsistency or a lack of standard practice, which could contribute to mediocre performance. This aligns more closely with the idea of not being part of the norm, hence potentially leading to average results.",
    "On the other hand, \"unique\" might imply something special that could lead to noteworthy performance, which again contradicts the initial statement of mediocrity.",
    "Therefore, considering all of the above points, the term \"peculiar\" best fits the description of habits resulting in mediocre performance."
