  "query": "Question: The farmer could raise a good chicken, but he wasn't ready to move up to a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: rooster\nB: hen\nC: bought at store\nD: cow\nE: tuna",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions the farmer could raise a good chicken, implying he is skilled in raising chickens.",
    "The phrase \"move up to\" suggests progressing to a different or more advanced type of livestock or animal.",
    "Among the options, A (rooster) and B (hen) are types of chickens, which would not be a significant step up for a farmer already raising chickens.",
    "C (bought at store) is not an animal but rather a reference to acquiring animals or goods, which isn\u2019t applicable here.",
    "D (cow) is another type of livestock, and cows are generally considered a step up from raising chickens due to their different care and production requirements.",
    "E (tuna) is a type of fish, which is also a significant step but less relevant in terms of traditional farm animals compared to cows.",
    "Considering the context of the farmer's livestock capabilities, moving up to a cow (D) is more logical than moving to a rooster, hen, or tuna.",
    "Additionally, cows provide different products (milk, beef) compared to chickens (eggs, meat), thus representing a meaningful increase in the type of agribusiness the farmer could engage in."
