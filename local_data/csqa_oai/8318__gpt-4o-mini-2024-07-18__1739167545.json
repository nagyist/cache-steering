  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"Even drinking was difficult after the surgery.\" This suggests that the person had difficulties related to the act of drinking.",
    "To understand what exactly was difficult, we should consider what is required for drinking. The main physical action involved in drinking is swallowing.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, we need to identify which option relates to the act of drinking.",
    "Choice A, \"coloring,\" is unrelated to drinking, as it pertains to an entirely different action.",
    "Choice B, \"glass,\" does not directly relate to the actions necessary for drinking, as it merely describes the container and not the difficulty of the action.",
    "Choice C, \"swallowing,\" ties directly to the process of drinking\u2014one must swallow to get the liquid down.",
    "Choice D, \"use glass,\" is similarly focused on the container rather than the action itself.",
    "Choice E, \"mouth,\" is too vague and does not specify the action, as it could imply several things that are not directly linked to the act of drinking.",
    "After evaluating all choices, it\u2019s clear that \"swallowing\" is the most logical choice when considering the difficulties associated with drinking post-surgery."
