  "query": "Question: Where does a beaver leave?\n\nChoices:\nA: wooded area\nB: body of water\nC: the ocean\nD: british columbia\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the habitat or environment where a beaver is typically found.",
    "Beavers are known to be semi-aquatic mammals, which means they spend a significant amount of their lives in or near water.",
    "They build their dams and lodges in bodies of water, such as rivers, streams, and ponds.",
    "While beavers can be found in wooded areas, this does not necessarily indicate where they leave. They prefer locations that provide both water and trees for building and food.",
    "The ocean is not a typical habitat for beavers, as they do not thrive in saltwater environments.",
    "British Columbia is a region where beavers are certainly found, but it is not a general answer applicable to all beavers.",
    "A zoo could have beavers, but this is not their natural habitat; it is a controlled environment created by humans.",
    "Thus, choosing the option that best describes the natural habitat of a beaver is critical.",
    "Given all of this reasoning, it is clear that the most suitable answer revolves around water."
