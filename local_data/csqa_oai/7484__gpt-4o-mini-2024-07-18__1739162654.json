    "The question mentions that \"the electricity went out,\" indicating that the situation took place indoors, where artificial lighting would typically be needed.",
    "The context involves people \"worshiping.\" This suggests a setting that is commonly associated with religious practices or gatherings.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"concert,\" \"garden,\" \"bedroom,\" \"church,\" and \"opera,\" we can analyze which of these locations is relevant for worship.",
    "A \"concert\" and an \"opera\" are performance venues that typically do not involve worship; rather, they are venues for entertainment.",
    "A \"garden\" is an outdoor location where people might gather but is not specifically related to worship.",
    "The \"bedroom\" might imply a private, personal space, which is not commonly associated with a communal act of worship.",
    "The \"church\" is a traditional venue specifically designed and used for worship activities, making it a strong candidate for the location.",
