  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a specific location where people use bleachers, which are raised, tiered seating often found outdoors.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option in relation to outdoor seating on bleachers.",
    "Option A: \"gymnasium\" - This is typically an indoor space where bleachers may exist, but it does not refer to an outdoor area.",
    "Option B: \"sporting event\" - This is commonly associated with outdoor activities like games or competitions where bleachers are often found to accommodate spectators.",
    "Option C: \"seat with view\" - While this is a valid description of what bleachers provide, it does not specify a location, making it less fitting.",
    "Option D: \"pharmacy\" - This is an indoor establishment where you would not find outdoor bleachers.",
    "Option E: \"picnic\" - While people do sit outdoors during picnics, this is not typically where bleachers are used.",
    "After analyzing the options, it is clear that \"sporting event\" (Option B) is the most appropriate answer as it pertains directly to the common use of bleachers at such events."
