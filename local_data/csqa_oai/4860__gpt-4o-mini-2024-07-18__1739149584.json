  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that the IMAX screen was bigger than the subject imagined, which suggests they were expecting a typical viewing experience.",
    "Since IMAX screens are known for their enormous size and immersive experience, the subject likely felt overwhelmed and as if they were outside due to the scale of the screen.",
    "We need to consider what type of venue would contrast sharply with the size and experience of an IMAX theatre.",
    "A drive-in movie has a large screen but is an outdoor experience, which does not fit the sense of being enclosed like in a theater.",
    "A monitor is typically much smaller than an IMAX screen and wouldn\u2019t fit the context of movie viewing in this scenario.",
    "The term \"movies\" is very general and doesn\u2019t imply a specific viewing setting, so it doesn\u2019t contrast with the immensity of an IMAX experience.",
    "The option \"home\" suggests a cozy, small viewing space typically equipped with a smaller screen, which again differs in scale from an IMAX screen.",
    "\"Theatre\" specifically refers to a location designed for watching films, and in many instances, a traditional theater screen would be significantly smaller than an IMAX screen.",
    "Therefore, feeling outdoors rather than in a movie theater emphasizes the difference in scale and environment that the IMAX experience provides.",
    "Based on the reasoning of contrasting experiences, the answer that best fits is \"E: theatre.\""
