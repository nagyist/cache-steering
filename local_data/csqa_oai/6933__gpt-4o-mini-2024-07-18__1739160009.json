  "query": "Question: Where would a business man keep a plane ticket with other documents?\n\nChoices:\nA: briefcase\nB: boarding plane\nC: airport\nD: pocket\nE: shirt sleeve",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider what a business man typically carries when traveling, especially by plane. A business man would generally have important documents with him, including a plane ticket.",
    "Next, we analyze where the business man is likely to store these important documents for easy access during travel.",
    "We evaluate the options provided:\n- A briefcase is commonly used by business professionals to keep important documents organized and secure.\n- A boarding plane is not a storage option; it is where the ticket is used.\n- An airport can be a location but is not a place where documents are stored.\n- A pocket is a possible but less secure place for important documents, and it may not provide adequate protection.\n- A shirt sleeve is impractical for storing important documents like a plane ticket.",
    "Considering security and easy access to the ticket before boarding, we can eliminate options B, C, and E as unsuitable storage locations.",
    "Between the remaining options A and D, a briefcase is more suitable for keeping it organized with other documents, while a pocket would be less secure and easier to lose.",
    "Thus, the most logical and practical choice for a business man to keep a plane ticket with other documents is in a briefcase."
