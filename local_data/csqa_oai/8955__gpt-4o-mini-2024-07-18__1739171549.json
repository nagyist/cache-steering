  "query": "Question: There are lights for safety at what performance?\n\nChoices:\nA: golf course\nB: building\nC: concert\nD: carnival\nE: plane",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question, which is focused on safety lights at a performance.",
    "Next, we consider each option provided to determine which context typically involves performances that require safety lights.",
    "Looking at \"A: golf course,\" while golf courses may have some lighting for nighttime play or safety, they aren't typically associated with a performance.",
    "For \"B: building,\" buildings themselves don't constitute a performance, so this option does not apply to the question.",
    "Examining \"C: concert,\" concerts involve live performances with large crowds, and safety lights are commonly used in such contexts for crowd control and safety during events.",
    "Next, looking at \"D: carnival,\" carnivals do have performances and often feature lights, but they are generally more focused on attractions and rides, rather than structured performances.",
    "Finally, considering \"E: plane,\" while safety lights are important in aviation, they are not related to a performance.",
    "Based on the examination of each option, \"C: concert\" emerges as the most appropriate choice since it directly relates to performances where safety lights are crucial."
