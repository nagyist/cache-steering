  "steps": [
    "The context of the statement indicates that the bully said mean words, which typically implies an intention to harm emotionally or psychologically.",
    "I need to evaluate the choices based on the potential effects of saying mean words.",
    "Choice A, \"mean many things,\" is vague and does not specifically address the effect of the bully's words on others.",
    "Choice B, \"hurt people,\" directly suggests that the words had a negative impact on individuals, which is a common consequence of bullying.",
    "Choice C, \"hurtful,\" is an adjective that describes the nature of the words but does not specify the effect on others in the same clear manner as choice B.",
    "Choice D, \"ring true,\" does not relate to the emotional harm caused by mean words and seems irrelevant.",
    "Choice E, \"fighting,\" could imply a response to bullying but it is not a direct effect of the mean words themselves.",
    "Based on the analysis, choice B clearly articulates the impact of the bully's words as it involves the emotional suffering of others, which is likely the intended understanding."
