  "steps": [
    "To determine what causes water to come out of the sky, we need to consider the natural processes involved in precipitation.",
    "Precipitation occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall to the ground.",
    "This condensation is primarily influenced by the presence of clouds, which are formed from water vapor that originates from various sources, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers.",
    "While oceans cover a significant portion of the Earth's surface and supply most of the water vapor through evaporation, they do not directly cause water to fall as rain or snow.",
    "Thunderstorms, on the other hand, are specific weather phenomena characterized by heavy rainfall and are quintessentially related to the release of precipitation.",
    "Lakes also contribute to the water cycle by adding moisture to the atmosphere through evaporation, but they do not directly cause precipitation like thunderstorms do.",
    "A restaurant has no direct relevance to the natural processes that lead to rainfall and does not contribute to precipitation.",
    "An enema is a medical procedure involving water and has no connection to weather or precipitation.",
    "Given all considerations, the only clear choice that represents a direct cause of water falling from the sky is a thunderstorm."
