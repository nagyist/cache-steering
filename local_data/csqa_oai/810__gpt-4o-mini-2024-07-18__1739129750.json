  "query": "Question: Where do you buy treats for kids over a counter?\n\nChoices:\nA: candy store\nB: butcher shop\nC: kitchen\nD: auto repair shop\nE: post office",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what kind of treats are typically bought for kids. Treats usually refer to sweets, candy, or snacks.",
    "Next, we assess the choices provided to see which places are likely to sell these types of treats.",
    "Option A, the candy store, primarily sells candy, which fits the description of treats for kids.",
    "Option B, the butcher shop, sells meat products and is not relevant for treats.",
    "Option C, the kitchen, is not a retail location; it\u2019s a part of a home where food is prepared.",
    "Option D, the auto repair shop, focuses on car maintenance and repairs, which would not include food or treats for kids.",
    "Option E, the post office, deals with mail and packages rather than food items, so it wouldn\u2019t sell treats either.",
    "Considering all options, the candy store is the only location that directly aligns with buying treats for kids over a counter.",
    "We can conclude therefore that the best answer is A, since it directly provides the items in question."
