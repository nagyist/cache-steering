  "query": "Question: John's took his appointment book with him to a checkup but couldn't find it anywhere. He looked and he looked but he didn't know where it was.  It wasn't until he bought a new one, went home, took a shower that he found it.  Where was it?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: wallet\nC: doctor's office\nD: handbag\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "John initially could not find his appointment book during his checkup visit.",
    "He searched for it thoroughly but did not find it, indicating it was not in the immediate vicinity of the doctor's office during the appointment.",
    "After the appointment, John bought a new appointment book, which shows that he did not have it with him at that point.",
    "John then went home, suggesting he left the doctor's office without the appointment book.",
    "He took a shower at home, indicating he was at his residence and had time away from the original location.",
    "Upon finishing his shower, he found the appointment book.",
    "This suggests the appointment book must have been somewhere in his home, likely in a place he overlooked initially when he returned.",
    "Given the options, finding it at home does not align with options A (office supply store), C (doctor's office), or D (handbag).",
    "The most plausible location where it could have been found after he returned home and before the shower is in his own pocket, suggesting he could have overlooked it previously.",
    "Since he found it at home after all this, the most logical choice given the context and timeframe is E (pocket)."
