  "query": "Question: The merchant wanted a place to sell his wares, what did he build?\n\nChoices:\nA: business\nB: mall\nC: store\nD: sell goods\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The merchant needed a place to sell his wares, which implies a location dedicated to commerce.",
    "A business is a broad term that can encompass various types of commercial activities, including selling wares, but it doesn't specify a physical location.",
    "A mall is a larger complex that contains multiple stores and businesses, which a single merchant may not build alone.",
    "A store specifically refers to a retail space where goods are sold directly to customers, making it a suitable choice for a merchant.",
    "\"Sell goods\" is an action or a description of what the merchant does, rather than a place he can build.",
    "A house typically refers to a residential building and does not serve the purpose of selling wares.",
    "Given that the goal is to find a tangible place specifically designated for selling, the option \"store\" directly reflects that purpose.",
    "I have evaluated all choices, and \"store\" is the most appropriate answer that aligns with the context of the question."
