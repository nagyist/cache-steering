  "query": "Question: There are usually four strings on what popular instrument?\n\nChoices:\nA: trumpet\nB: kite\nC: quark\nD: guitar\nE: bird's nest",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the choices provided to identify which of them may have four strings associated with them.",
    "I will examine each option. The trumpet is a brass instrument and does not have strings, so it is not the correct choice.",
    "Next, a kite is a flying object made of fabric and wood or plastic, and it also does not have strings in the musical sense. Thus, it cannot be the answer.",
    "The term \"quark\" refers to a fundamental particle in physics, and it doesn't have any direct association with music or strings. Therefore, it can be eliminated.",
    "Now, I will consider \"guitar.\" A standard guitar typically has six strings, but there are some variations, such as a four-string guitar known as a tenor guitar. However, the standard perception is that guitars have six strings.",
    "Finally, a \"bird's nest\" refers to a structure built by birds. It does not have strings in the musical sense and is not relevant.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only one that is directly associated with having four strings is the choice of guitar when considering variations. The actual context implies the most common instrument like the guitar, since \"four strings\" might refer to a simple variant."
