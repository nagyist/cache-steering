  "query": "Question: Why do you not earn money while you have lunch?\n\nChoices:\nA: too full\nB: eat food\nC: get food\nD: find food\nE: stop working",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the main activity involved during lunch, which generally includes eating.",
    "Next, recognize that lunch is typically a break from work or other productive activities.",
    "Then, analyze why taking a break affects earning money. When one is on a lunch break, they are not working.",
    "Examine the options provided: \n- A (too full) implies a physical state, not a reason for not earning. \n- B (eat food) is involved in lunch but does not explain the lack of earnings. \n- C (get food) also does not relate to the lack of earnings directly.\n- D (find food) suggests a preparatory step which doesn't relate to the current context of lunchtime.\n- E (stop working) clearly indicates that when taking a lunch break, work ceases, leading to no earnings.",
    "Since the main reason one does not earn money during lunch is because they stop working during that time, option E is the most relevant."
