  "query": "Question: What time period did mammoth's live in?\n\nChoices:\nA: ancient times\nB: museum exhibit\nC: museum of natural history\nD: prehistoric times\nE: prehistory",
  "steps": [
    "Mammoths are ancient animals that roamed the Earth during a specific time period known as the Pleistocene Epoch, which lasted from about 2.6 million to about 11,700 years ago.",
    "The Pleistocene Epoch is often categorized under the larger timeframe known as \"prehistory,\" as it predates recorded history.",
    "The term \"prehistoric times\" specifically refers to the time before written records, which aligns with when mammoths existed.",
    "\"Ancient times\" is a broader term that can include various periods, but it may also refer to post-mammoth eras.",
    "A \"museum exhibit\" is not a time period but rather a display of items, which does not answer the question accurately.",
    "The \"museum of natural history\" is also not a time period but a place where one can learn about subjects like mammoths, again not directly answering the question.",
    "The term \"prehistory\" is very closely related to the time period when mammoths lived, encompassing the entire time frame up to the advent of recorded history.",
    "Considering the choices, \"prehistoric times\" (D) and \"prehistory\" (E) both refer to the time period that includes the existence of mammoths, but \"prehistoric times\" is more specific in that context.",
    "I need to choose the most specific term that is accurate for when mammoths lived, which is \"prehistoric times.\""
