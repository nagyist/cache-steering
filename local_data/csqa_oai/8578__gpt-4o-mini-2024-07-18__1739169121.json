  "query": "Question: If I go for a run and don't watch where I place my feet, what's likely to happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: fall down\nB: sweat\nC: exhaustion\nD: may trip\nE: may fall",
  "steps": [
    "If I don't watch where I place my feet while running, the most immediate risk is losing balance.",
    "Losing balance while running can lead to falling or tripping over obstacles or uneven surfaces.",
    "The term \"fall down\" signifies an immediate and complete loss of balance, which is a common consequence of not watching my feet.",
    "\"May trip\" suggests that I might stumble but not necessarily fall entirely, which is also a risk.",
    "\"May fall\" implies a potential outcome similar to \"fall down,\" but with slightly less certainty.",
    "Looking at the options, I need to assess which outcomes are more likely when running without caution; both falling and tripping are risks.",
    "However, \"fall down\" may imply a guaranteed outcome in a definite scenario of losing focus, while \"may trip\" and \"may fall\" are less certain.",
    "Since tripping does not always lead to falling completely, the most definitive outcome of not watching where my feet go during a run is likely to be falling down.",
    "Therefore, although both \"may trip\" and \"may fall\" are valid concerns, \"fall down\" is the most direct result of careless foot placement."
