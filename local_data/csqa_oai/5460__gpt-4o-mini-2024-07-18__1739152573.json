  "query": "Question: A flashing LED might indicate a serious problem with your computer if it is on your what?\n\nChoices:\nA: electronic equipment\nB: screen\nC: electronic devices\nD: pc board\nE: electrical machine",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what a flashing LED typically indicates in computer systems. It often signifies some kind of alert or issue.",
    "Next, I should review the given options to see where a flashing LED would be most critical for indicating a serious problem.",
    "Option A, \"electronic equipment,\" is quite broad and could refer to many devices; however, it doesn't pinpoint where a flashing LED would specifically indicate a problem.",
    "Option B, \"screen,\" typically indicates issues related to display but might not signify a serious internal problem with the computer itself.",
    "Option C, \"electronic devices,\" is similar to option A and lacks specificity.",
    "Option D, \"pc board,\" specifically refers to the printed circuit board within a computer. A flashing LED here could indicate a serious hardware issue, such as power problems or malfunctions.",
    "Option E, \"electrical machine,\" is also quite general and does not specifically relate to problems within a computer system.",
    "Based on this reasoning, option D stands out as it directly relates to the internal workings of the computer where a flashing LED would suggest significant issues."
