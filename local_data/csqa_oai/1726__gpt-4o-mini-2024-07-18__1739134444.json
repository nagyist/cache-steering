  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you could acquire maps if you do not currently have any and want to keep them.",
    "Option A (guide drivers) refers to a service rather than a place to acquire maps, so it is not relevant.",
    "Option B (library) is a place where you can typically find maps available for reference or borrowing.",
    "Option C (bookstore) may sell maps, making it a plausible option for acquiring them for personal use.",
    "Option D (cabinet) is a storage location and doesn\u2019t apply to acquiring maps; you cannot get maps from a cabinet.",
    "Option E (drawer) is also a storage place and similar to the cabinet, it does not fit the context of acquiring maps.",
    "While both the library and the bookstore can provide maps, the bookstore is specifically designed for selling items such as maps, making it a more likely option for actually acquiring them as opposed to borrowing.",
    "Since I want to keep the maps, purchasing them from a bookstore (Option C) aligns with this desire more so than borrowing from a library.",
    "Comparing the two options (library and bookstore), the bookstore is the best place to get your own maps to keep."
