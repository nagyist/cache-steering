  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the most basic reason why people talk to each other.",
    "Among the options, we should consider what the primary purpose of communication is.",
    "One possible purpose is to obtain information (option A), but this is quite narrow in scope.",
    "Another purpose proposed is the exchange of ideas (option B), which suggests a two-way communication but does not necessarily capture all aspects of why people talk.",
    "Sharing information (option D) is close to a fundamental purpose of talking, indicating that conversations often aim to communicate specific knowledge or feelings.",
    "Options C (nose) and E (dry mouth) do not make sense as basic reasons for talking.",
    "Considering the intent and the content of conversations, sharing information (D) seems to encapsulate a primary reason why communication occurs.",
    "Now evaluating between D (sharing information) and A (obtaining information), sharing information is often more representative of general conversation than just obtaining information.",
    "Therefore, the most inclusive and basic reason for talking among people is sharing information."
