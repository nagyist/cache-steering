  "query": "Question: All the parents gathered in the cafeteria to watch the performance, Mark's were there to watch him play trombone in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: brass quartet\nC: marching band\nD: school band\nE: school play",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Mark plays the trombone; it is important to consider where a trombone is typically played.",
    "Trombones are commonly found in larger ensembles, such as orchestras and bands, rather than in small groups like quartets.",
    "The options provided include \"orchestra,\" \"brass quartet,\" \"marching band,\" \"school band,\" and \"school play.\"",
    "The term \"marching band\" specifically indicates a performance that is usually outside and involves marching, which can include playing brass instruments like the trombone.",
    "\"School band\" could also be a place where one would find a trombone player, as it often includes various instruments and is a common setting in schools.",
    "Given that Mark\u2019s parents are gathered to watch a performance, the option \"school play\" is unlikely since it does not involve musical instrument performances.",
    "The \"brass quartet\" is a smaller group that typically wouldn\u2019t include trombones, as it usually consists of trumpets and possibly a tuba.",
    "Both \"marching band\" and \"school band\" are viable options for a trombone performance, but marching bands are more distinctly known for showcasing brass instruments.",
    "However, since the context is a school performance and parents are gathered, \"school band\" seems to encapsulate all groups performing in a school setting more generally, which would include instruments like the trombone.",
    "Thus, the phrase \u201cMark\u2019s were there to watch him play trombone in the\u201d implies a more straightforward answer leaning towards a general school setting, which indicates \"school band\" as the most appropriate choice."
