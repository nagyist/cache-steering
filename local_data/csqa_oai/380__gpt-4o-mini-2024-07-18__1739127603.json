  "query": "Question: The garage had light sensors and automatic doors, what kind of house was it?\n\nChoices:\nA: modern house\nB: building\nC: townhouse\nD: neighbor's house\nE: downtown",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the features mentioned in the question: light sensors and automatic doors. These are both elements that are associated with modern technology.",
    "Next, I will consider the terms provided in the answer choices. \"Modern house\" directly refers to a style of residential architecture that incorporates current technologies and designs.",
    "In contrast, \"building\" is a generic term that doesn't necessarily specify any residential characteristics nor incorporates the features described.",
    "\"Townhouse\" is a specific type of dwelling that may or may not have these features. Townhouses could be modern or traditional; the term alone doesn't imply the presence of high-tech elements.",
    "\"Neighbor's house\" is ambiguous and does not provide any architectural or technological context. It simply refers to the proximity of a house.",
    "\"Downtown\" refers to an urban area and does not describe the features of a house at all.",
    "Based on the analysis, the presence of light sensors and automatic doors strongly suggests that the house is of a modern design, as these technologies are common in contemporary constructions.",
    "Therefore, I will conclude that the best answer choice that fits the description provided is \"modern house.\""
