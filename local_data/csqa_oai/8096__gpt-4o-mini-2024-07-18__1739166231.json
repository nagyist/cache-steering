  "query": "Question: What city in a North American Country, that isn't the United States, would you expect to find a good french restaurant?\n\nChoices:\nA: wine\nB: nyc\nC: quebec\nD: manhattan\nE: paris",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the requirement that the city should be in a North American country that is not the United States.",
    "Recognize that Canada is a North American country that has a significant French-speaking population, especially in regions like Quebec.",
    "Consider the cities in the choices provided. NYC and Manhattan are both cities within the United States, ruling them out.",
    "Paris, while known for its excellent French cuisine, is located in France and not in North America, so it is also not a valid option.",
    "Focus on Quebec from the remaining options, which is a province in Canada with a major French influence and culture.",
    "Recall that Quebec City and Montreal are both located in Quebec and are known for their French restaurants.",
    "Assess whether other choices (A, B, D, E) could be interpreted differently, but they either repeat cities within the U.S. or are not in North America.",
    "Conclude that Quebec offers a strong prospect for finding good French restaurants due to its language and culture.",
    "Finalize the answer based solely on the options and reasoning provided above."
