  "query": "Question: The house wasn't connected to anything but rather was randomly plopped down in the woods, what did it need to have visitors?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: residential area\nC: milk man\nD: street\nE: subdivision",
  "steps": [
    "The house is described as being isolated and not connected to anything, indicating that it is located in a remote area.",
    "To have visitors, the house would need to be accessible or identifiable to people who may want to come by.",
    "Considering the choices given, a \u2018city\u2019 or \u2018residential area\u2019 implies a more organized or populated space, which contrasts with the description of the house being in the woods.",
    "A \u2018milk man\u2019 (C) does not seem directly relevant to the need for visitors as it describes a specific job rather than a general access.",
    "A \u2018street\u2019 (D) implies a direct route to access a house, which could enable visitors to find the house, even though the house is still isolated.",
    "A \u2018subdivision\u2019 (E) suggests a planned community, usually in a residential zone, which again contrasts with the isolation described.",
    "Given the need for visitors to reach the house, the most practical option is that the house requires a \u2018street\u2019 for access.",
    "Upon considering all previous evaluations, the option that relates best to enabling visitors is choice D - street."
