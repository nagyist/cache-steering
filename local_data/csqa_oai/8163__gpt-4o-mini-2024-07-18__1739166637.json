  "query": "Question: How could you find out if someone tried committing suicide?\n\nChoices:\nA: scars\nB: kill yourself\nC: sorrow\nD: depressed\nE: misery",
  "steps": [
    "To determine if someone has attempted suicide, I would first consider visible signs or indicators that might suggest prior attempts. This involves physical evidence on the person's body.",
    "One common indication could be scars, which might suggest a history of self-harm or suicide attempts. Therefore, option A appears relevant.",
    "Next, I would think about the emotional and psychological state of the individual. Feelings such as sorrow, depression, or misery could be associated with suicidal thoughts or attempts.",
    "Option C (sorrow) could indicate deep emotional pain, which might lead to suicidal thoughts but does not directly indicate an attempt.",
    "Option D (depressed) also reflects a mental state consistent with someone who might be at risk for suicide, highlighting a psychological aspect.",
    "Option E (misery) closely relates to the emotional turmoil one might experience, which can be associated with suicidal behavior, similar to sorrow and depression.",
    "Upon reviewing options A, C, D, and E, while all may provide hints about suicidal thoughts or behaviors, A (scars) directly serves as the most concrete evidence of a suicide attempt.",
    "To summarize, while emotional states (C, D, E) indicate risk factors for suicide, A provides a tangible sign of a past suicide attempt."
