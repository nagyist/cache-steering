  "query": "Question: The lizard frightened the hiker, it's movements made what rustle?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden\nB: trees\nC: books\nD: rocks\nE: bushes",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what could be causing a rustling sound in a natural environment where a lizard might be found.",
    "Lizards are often found in areas with vegetation, such as forests, gardens, or bushy areas.",
    "The word \"rustle\" typically refers to a sound made by leaves or similar materials moving, often found in bushes or undergrowth.",
    "Next, we can evaluate the options: A (garden) could be a place with rustling, but it doesn't directly convey movement. B (trees) can rustle due to leaves but is less likely associated with a lizard. C (books) does not fit because it's not a natural habitat for the lizard. D (rocks) might cause some noise but is not closely connected to movement rustling. E (bushes) likely matches the sound of a lizard moving through plant material.",
    "Considering the typical movements of a lizard in its natural habitat, the sound it would likely make while moving through vegetation would be best represented by bushes.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice that captures the idea of a lizard moving and creating a rustling sound is E (bushes)."
