  "steps": [
    "When running errands, people typically require a place to leave their cars temporarily while they complete these tasks.",
    "The options provided include a few locations that are not suitable for short-term car storage while running errands.",
    "Option A suggests storing a car \"at home,\" which is not practical for running errands, as the car would already be at home and would not be available for use.",
    "Option B refers to the \"freeway,\" which is not a place where cars can be parked; it is a thoroughfare for vehicles in motion.",
    "Option C mentions a \"race track,\" which is not a typical place for storing cars while conducting errands, as it's primarily for racing activities.",
    "Option E states \"car show,\" which also does not represent a common situation for individuals needing to park cars temporarily while they shop or complete other errands.",
    "This leaves us with Option D: \"parking lot,\" which is specifically designed for parking vehicles and is commonly found near stores and places where errands are run.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most suitable location for storing cars during errands is indeed a parking lot."
