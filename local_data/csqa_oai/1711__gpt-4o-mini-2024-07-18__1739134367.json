  "query": "Question: What do kids have to do before they can go outside a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: distracting\nB: open door\nC: wonder about\nD: take shoes off\nE: become adults",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's evaluate what actions kids typically need to perform before going outside. One logical step is to gain access to the outdoors from inside the house.",
    "Opening the door is usually a necessary action for kids to exit the house and gain access to the outside. Therefore, this action is fundamental to the process.",
    "Next, let's consider the other choices. Choice A, \"distracting,\" does not relate to the necessary actions for going outside.",
    "Choice C, \"wonder about,\" while it may be something kids do, it is not a requisite action before going outside.",
    "Choice D, \"take shoes off,\" could be applicable in certain contexts (like going to a carpeted area or a home where shoes are not worn), but it is not universally required before going outside.",
    "Choice E, \"become adults,\" is irrelevant in the context of actions required before going outside, as it implies a significant life change rather than a simple action.",
    "After analyzing each choice, it\u2019s clear that the action that must occur before a child can go outside is to open the door (Choice B)."
