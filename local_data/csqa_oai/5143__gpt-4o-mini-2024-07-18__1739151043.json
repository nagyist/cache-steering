  "steps": [
    "To determine what is likely to run high when two people are competing, we should consider the nature of competition itself. Competition typically generates heightened feelings or reactions.",
    "Next, I will analyze each of the provided choices to see which aligns best with the effects of competition.",
    "Choice (A), pride, could be a possible feeling, as individuals may feel proud of their abilities or accomplishments during a competition. However, pride alone may not encompass the entire range of emotions involved.",
    "Choice (B), frustration, can occur in competitive situations, especially if one feels they are losing or being treated unfairly. But again, it does not capture all that happens during a competition.",
    "Choice (C), emotions, is quite broad. Emotions can encompass many feelings, including excitement, joy, anxiety, and frustration, all of which can be heightened during competition.",
    "Choice (D), encouraging, typically would not be considered to run high in the context of competition between two opponents. If anything, competing parties might be more focused on winning rather than encouraging one another.",
    "Choice (E), tensions, is an appropriate term in the context of competition as two individuals vying against each other can create a tense atmosphere. However, it may be too narrow as it focuses on conflict rather than the greater spectrum of emotional responses.",
    "Considering all these options, while pride, frustration, emotions, and tensions are all relevant to some degree, \"emotions\" is the most comprehensive term that most accurately represents the heightened responses that arise during competition."
