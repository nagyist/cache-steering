    "To determine where Aberdeen is located in the US, I need to recall relevant US geography and cities named Aberdeen.",
    "I know there is an Aberdeen in Washington state, which is a well-known city.",
    "There is also an Aberdeen in South Dakota, which is less prominent but still recognized.",
    "I should rule out the other options to confirm where the most notable Aberdeens are located.",
    "Option B, Europe, does not apply since the question specifically asks about the location in the US.",
    "Option C, Scotland, is incorrect for the same reason \u2013 it refers to a location outside the US.",
    "Option D, Maryland, is not associated with the name Aberdeen in the US.",
