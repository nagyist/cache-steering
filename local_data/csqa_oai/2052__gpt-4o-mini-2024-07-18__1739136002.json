  "query": "Question: The couple was attempting procreating night after night, between that and work it was leading to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: economic growth\nB: population increase\nC: exhaustion\nD: overpopulation\nE: feeling good",
  "steps": [
    "The couple is engaging in procreation, which implies repeated attempts at conceiving a child.",
    "Procreation can be physically demanding and may require significant effort and energy, especially if it is attempted frequently.",
    "With the statement mentioning that it was between \"that and work,\" it suggests that the couple is balancing procreation with their professional responsibilities, adding to the physical and mental strain.",
    "The word 'leading' indicates that this behavior is resulting in some kind of effect or outcome.",
    "Economic growth (Choice A) and population increase (Choice B) are potential outcomes of procreation, but the question focuses on the immediate impact on the couple, not broader societal effects.",
    "Overpopulation (Choice D) is a long-term societal concern and does not directly pertain to the couple's immediate experience.",
    "Feeling good (Choice E) may occur, but it is not as likely to be the primary outcome of frequent procreating attempts amidst the stress of work.",
    "Exhaustion (Choice C) logically follows as a likely consequence, given the physical demands of both procreation and work, especially when done repeatedly over time.",
    "Considering all these points, exhaustion is the most reasonable outcome of the couple's situation as it directly addresses the burden they're under."
