  "query": "Question: Where do you look to see a meteor?\n\nChoices:\nA: outerspace\nB: orbit\nC: universe\nD: sky\nE: observatory",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what a meteor is. A meteor is a small body from space that enters the Earth's atmosphere and produces a streak of light as it burns up.",
    "Next, I think about where meteors are typically observed. They are seen as they enter the atmosphere, which occurs well above the ground but can be viewed from the surface of the Earth.",
    "I analyze the choices provided. Option A, \"outer space,\" is where meteors come from, but you don't directly look at outer space to see them burning up.",
    "Option B, \"orbit,\" refers to the path of satellites or other bodies around the Earth, which doesn\u2019t directly correlate with where we observe meteors.",
    "Option C, \"universe,\" is a broader term that encompasses everything, including the location of meteors, but it\u2019s not the location we specifically look towards to see them.",
    "Option D, \"sky,\" is the area above the ground where meteors are actually visible as they burn through the atmosphere. This seems like a strong contender.",
    "Finally, option E, \"observatory,\" is a place where astronomical observations are made, but when observing meteors, one typically just looks up at the sky rather than being confined to a building or specific instrument.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, the most accurate and general answer is D, \"sky,\" because it is from this vantage point that meteors are observed during events like meteor showers."
