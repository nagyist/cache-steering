  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy found it easy to divide 9, and we need to identify a term that describes the relationship between 9 and 3.",
    "In mathematical terms, when dividing, we can say that one number is a multiple of another if it can be expressed as that number multiplied by an integer.",
    "Next, we verify if 9 can be expressed as a multiple of 3.",
    "If we multiply 3 by 3 (which is an integer), we get 9: 3 x 3 = 9.",
    "So, 9 is indeed a multiple of 3.",
    "Now, let's check the answer choices. We need a term that indicates the relationship where 9 is generated from 3 by multiplication.",
    "The options include: A: multiply, B: multiple, C: unite, D: multiplication, E: multiple.",
    "The correct term that fits the context is \"multiple,\" as it directly defines the relationship indicated by the division.",
    "Since \"multiple\" also appears twice among the choices (B and E), I verify that it is still the correct term relevant to our question and thus the answer should be one of them."
