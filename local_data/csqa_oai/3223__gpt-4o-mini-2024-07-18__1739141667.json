  "query": "Question: If I'm at the doctor's office looking for a good title, what sort of story am I looking to read?\n\nChoices:\nA: book\nB: magazine article\nC: safe deposit box\nD: hotel menu book\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario is set in a doctor's office, which typically offers various printed materials for patients to read while waiting.",
    "The titles available should be relevant for a short read that is typically found in such waiting areas.",
    "Options like \"safe deposit box\" and \"hotel menu book\" are not related to reading materials found in a doctor's office.",
    "A \"library\" is more associated with a collection of books and may not be suitable as it doesn't reflect a single reading material.",
    "A \"magazine article\" is often a common choice in waiting rooms due to its shorter length and engaging content.",
    "\"Book\" could also be a potential choice; however, it suggests a longer read than generally available in a doctor's office.",
    "Thus, the best choice for something to read in this context is a short article that could easily be found in a magazine.",
    "Among the options, the only choice that closely matches a common reading material you would find at a doctor's office is a magazine article."
