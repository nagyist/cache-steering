  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that \"their union had settled and they would go off strike,\" which indicates that an agreement has been reached.",
    "Going off strike typically implies that the workers are returning to their regular duties after a resolution is achieved.",
    "The phrasing suggests that after settling the strike, there must be a logical consequence of the settlement that incorporates what happens next.",
    "The choices provided include several potential outcomes: demands met, complaints addressed, being satisfied, getting back to work, and more money.",
    "\"Demands were met\" (choice A) would indicate that their conditions were fulfilled, which is plausible but does not directly imply an immediate action.",
    "\"Complaints had been addressed\" (choice B) suggests resolution but lacks a direct course of action following the settlement.",
    "\"Be satisfied\" (choice C) indicates a feeling but remains vague about what the workers would do next.",
    "\"Get back to work\" (choice D) directly aligns with the context of returning after a strike, indicating a clear action to resume duties.",
    "\"More money\" (choice E) suggests a potential outcome but does not imply returning to work, which is a key action associated with ending a strike.",
    "Since \"get back to work\" most accurately describes the immediate next action after going off strike, it stands out among the options."
