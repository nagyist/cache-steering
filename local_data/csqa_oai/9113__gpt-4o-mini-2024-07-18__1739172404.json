  "query": "Question: The woman was okay with the bug since it was a predator of aphids, where did the bug live?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden\nB: carpet\nC: rug\nD: meadow\nE: rock",
  "steps": [
    "The woman appreciates the bug because it preys on aphids, which are commonly found in gardens or plants.",
    "Since aphids typically thrive in gardens, it is reasonable to consider that the bug would also inhabit such an environment.",
    "The other options, namely \"carpet\" (B) and \"rug\" (C), are indoor settings where aphids are not typically found; therefore, these options are unlikely habitats for the bug.",
    "\"Meadow\" (D) could potentially be a habitat for certain bugs, but it does not directly relate to the context of aphids, which are more commonly associated with cultivated plants.",
    "A \"rock\" (E) does not represent a suitable environment for a bug that preys on aphids, as it doesn\u2019t offer the necessary habitat or food source.",
    "Given all considerations, the most logical choice based on the connection between the bug, aphids, and their habitats is \"garden\" (A)."
