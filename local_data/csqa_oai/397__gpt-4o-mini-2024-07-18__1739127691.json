  "query": "Question: The master control for the Tardis is where in the main room?\n\nChoices:\nA: nuclear power plant\nB: center\nC: basement\nD: main office\nE: bowel of the ship",
  "steps": [
    "To begin, I need to understand what the Tardis is. The Tardis is a fictional time machine and spacecraft from the British television series Doctor Who.",
    "Next, I consider the layout of the Tardis as depicted in the show. The main room is also known as the control room, where the Doctor pilots the Tardis.",
    "I can recall that the console, which is the master control, is prominently located in the control room and is a central feature.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, I'm analyzing where the master control could feasibly be located within the options given.",
    "Options A (nuclear power plant), C (basement), D (main office), and E (bowel of the ship) do not logically align with the function of the master control, which is used for piloting and controlling the Tardis.",
    "Considering option B (center), it makes sense as the console is designed to be the focal point of the control room.",
    "I\u2019m verifying my understanding of the Tardis's layout. The console being at the 'center' correlates with the visual depictions I've seen in the show.",
    "No other locations mentioned (basement, office, etc.) support the idea of the master control being where the main operations for navigation occur.",
    "After considering all the options and reasoning through their plausibility, 'center' stands out as the logical answer."
