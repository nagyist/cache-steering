  "query": "Question: Dave wants to build a new ranch house, but he's worried about mudslides, fires, earthquakes,  and restrictive zoning codes.  Where might he live?\n\nChoices:\nA: montana\nB: west\nC: california\nD: outback\nE: texas",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the natural risks mentioned: mudslides, fires, and earthquakes. These factors are particularly relevant in certain geographic areas.",
    "Mudslides commonly occur in hilly or mountainous regions, especially after heavy rains. Earthquakes are prevalent in areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Fires are a significant concern in dry regions, especially those with vegetation.",
    "California is known for its susceptibility to all three natural risks: mudslides in its mountainous areas, earthquakes due to its location on the San Andreas Fault, and wildfires due to its dry climate.",
    "Montana, while having risks of natural disasters, is less prone to earthquakes and wildfires than California, making it a better choice for someone concerned about these issues.",
    "The \"West\" is a broad term and could include areas with similar issues as California, including mudslides, fires, and earthquakes, so it's not a definitive option.",
    "The \"Outback\" generally refers to remote areas in Australia, which may not be relevant to the context of this question about building a ranch house in the United States.",
    "Texas, while having some regions with less severe earthquake risks, also has areas prone to flooding and tornadoes, which doesn't address Dave's specific concerns about mudslides, fires, and earthquakes.",
    "Restrictive zoning codes could apply in any location but are often a significant concern in densely populated or high-demand areas like California.",
    "Considering all of the above, the location that encompasses Dave's worries about mudslides, fires, earthquakes, and zoning codes is California, as they face all these issues directly."
