  "query": "Question: After a person celebrates an occasion for hours on end, what might the person experience?\n\nChoices:\nA: hangovers\nB: being happy\nC: drinking\nD: becoming tired\nE: nirvana",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a person who has been celebrating an occasion for an extended period of time.",
    "Celebrating for hours typically involves various activities, including socializing and possibly consuming food and drinks.",
    "After such a lengthy celebration, it's common for individuals to feel fatigued due to the extended physical and emotional demand of the celebration.",
    "Though drinking might occur during celebrations, the question asks what the person might experience afterward, not during the celebration itself.",
    "A \"hangover\" could be a consequence of excessive drinking, but it depends on the amount consumed and individual tolerance levels.",
    "Given that celebrations often lead to social interaction, there is likely to be an emotional high, but this is short-lived and often followed by a period of low energy.",
    "In addition to tiredness, being happy could also be a lingering feeling; however, the direct after-effect after prolonged celebration leans more towards exhaustion rather than sustained happiness.",
    "Therefore, while choices A (hangovers), B (being happy), and D (becoming tired) reflect potential outcomes, becoming tired is a very predictable result of exhaustive celebratory activities.",
    "Given these considerations, choice D, \"becoming tired,\" is the most appropriate answer."
