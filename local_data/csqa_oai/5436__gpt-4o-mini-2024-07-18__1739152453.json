  "query": "Question: What does a parent tell their child to do after they've played with a lot of toys?\n\nChoices:\nA: go to bed\nB: become adult\nC: read book\nD: grow up\nE: clean room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of the question. The parent is giving instructions to the child after they have played with toys.",
    "Next, I evaluate each option to see which action is most commonly suggested after playing with toys.",
    "Option A: \"go to bed\" is usually suggested at the end of the day, but not necessarily right after playtime.",
    "Option B: \"become adult\" is not an immediate action that a parent would instruct a child to do after playing.",
    "Option C: \"read book\" could be a calming activity, but it is not a standard directive after playing with toys.",
    "Option D: \"grow up\" is not a direct action; it refers to a process that takes time and isn\u2019t something a parent would instruct.",
    "Option E: \"clean room\" is a common request after playing, as children often leave toys scattered and need to tidy up.",
    "Based on the evaluation, \"clean room\" is the most logical and expected instruction a parent would give after playtime."
