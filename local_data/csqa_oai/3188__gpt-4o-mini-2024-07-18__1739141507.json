  "query": "Question: The person was always using mouthwash, why were they doing that?\n\nChoices:\nA: headache\nB: to quench thirst\nC: white teeth\nD: source of income\nE: fair trial",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the reason behind the person's consistent use of mouthwash.",
    "Mouthwash is primarily used for oral hygiene, which includes freshening breath and promoting dental health.",
    "One common outcome of using mouthwash regularly is maintaining white teeth by reducing plaque buildup and staining.",
    "Options A (headache) and B (to quench thirst) are unlikely as mouthwash is not typically used for these purposes.",
    "Option D (source of income) does not correlate with the use of mouthwash, as it does not serve as a financial tool.",
    "Option E (fair trial) is unrelated to oral hygiene and does not provide a plausible reason for mouthwash use.",
    "Considering all the options, C (white teeth) aligns with the common intention behind using mouthwash, which is to enhance oral health and appearance."
