  "steps": [
    "The question states that the balloon was bought with other weekly household essentials.",
    "Often, household essentials are purchased in stores where groceries and daily needs are sold.",
    "A grocery store is a common place to buy household essentials, which may include balloons for celebrations.",
    "The option \"birthday party\" does not directly answer where the balloon was purchased; it's more about the occasion for the balloon.",
    "The option \"child's hand\" suggests possession, but does not indicate a place of purchase.",
    "The \"clown\" option is also not a place; it references a type of entertainer who often uses balloons.",
    "The option \"sky\" is illogical as balloons cannot be purchased from the sky.",
    "Given the contextual clues of household essentials and common shopping locations, the grocery store stands out as the most logical place where a balloon would be purchased."
