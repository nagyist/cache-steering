    "The question asks about the emotional or psychological state caused by receiving a desired gift for one's birthday.",
    "When someone receives a gift they wanted, it typically elicits a positive reaction.",
    "The options provided include negative emotions (A, B, E) and positive responses (C, D).",
    "Disappointment, anger, and headaches are generally associated with negative events or outcomes, not with receiving a wanted gift.",
    "Being happy (D) is a common reaction when one receives something they wanted, especially on a special occasion like a birthday.",
    "The option \"then have\" (C) is grammatically incomplete and does not represent an emotional state.",
    "Thus, the most logical emotional state resulting from receiving a desired gift on a birthday is happiness.",
    "Among the options, D (being happy) is the best fit for the result of receiving a gift you wanted."
