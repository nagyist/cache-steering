  "steps": [
    "The bald eagle is a bird of prey commonly found in North America, particularly near large bodies of open water with abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.",
    "The question specifies the region where bald eagles are known to fly over potato fields. We need to identify regions in North America that are prominent for both bald eagles and potato farming.",
    "Alaska is known for its wildlife and bald eagles but is not primarily known for potato fields.",
    "Hells Canyon is a scenic region but does not have a significant reputation for potato farming.",
    "South Lake Tahoe is known for its ski resorts and lakes but is not primarily recognized for potato farming or a large population of bald eagles.",
    "Central Idaho, on the other hand, has potatoes as a major agricultural product and is also a region where bald eagles can be frequently seen.",
    "Canada generally has regions that support both bald eagle populations and potato farming, but since the question is specifically about a region in the United States known for these two, Canada may not fit.",
    "Among the choices, only Central Idaho fulfills both criteria of being known for potato fields and having bald eagles.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the answer to the question is Central Idaho."
