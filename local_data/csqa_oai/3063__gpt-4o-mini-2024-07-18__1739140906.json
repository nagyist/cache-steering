    "The question introduces the idea of someone who is \"obsessed with grooming,\" which typically involves taking meticulous care of one's personal hygiene and appearance.",
    "Grooming often includes activities such as bathing, shaving, styling hair, and applying skincare or beauty products, all of which relate closely to personal cleanliness.",
    "Considering the context of grooming, \"cleanliness\" is a primary goal, as grooming practices are fundamentally about maintaining a clean, neat, and tidy appearance.",
