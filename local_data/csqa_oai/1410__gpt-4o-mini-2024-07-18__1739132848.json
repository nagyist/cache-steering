  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one might go to see a sword.",
    "I need to evaluate the options provided in relation to the likelihood of them containing a sword.",
    "Option A (scabbard) refers to a container for a sword, but it\u2019s not a place you go to see a sword itself, just where it might be kept.",
    "Option B (school) typically does not have swords on display unless for a specific historical or educational purpose, making it an unlikely option.",
    "Option C (collection) could mean a personal or private collection. While that might contain swords, it doesn\u2019t indicate a public place to view them.",
    "Option D (museum) is a common place that collects historical artifacts, including swords, and would have them displayed for public viewing.",
    "Option E (sheath) is similar to scabbard and refers to a covering for a sword, not a location to see them.",
    "Comparing all options, the most logical choice for a place to see a sword is a museum, which exists to showcase artifacts and historical items."
