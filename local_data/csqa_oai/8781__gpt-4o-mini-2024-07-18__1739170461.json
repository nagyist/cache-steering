  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that returning to work was easy for Dan, which implies he was ready to get back to work and found it comfortable or natural to do so.",
    "The phrase \"he had liked doing nothing for weeks\" indicates that Dan enjoyed his time off and may have found pleasure in not working.",
    "The word \"completely\" suggests that his state after treatment had a significant quality or change about it.",
    "Looking at the choices, we need to find a word that would logically describe his state of being after treatment in relation to returning to work.",
    "Choice A: \"sobering\" doesn't fit as it suggests a serious or reflective state, which doesn't align with returning to work easily.",
    "Choice B: \"work\" isn't an adjective to describe his state.",
    "Choice C: \"painless\" could imply a lack of discomfort, but it doesn't connect strongly to the idea of returning to work easily.",
    "Choice D: \"malaise\" indicates a sense of unease or discomfort, which doesn't align with his ease in returning to work.",
    "Choice E: \"boredom\" would imply he has nothing to do, which contradicts the idea of him returning to work easily.",
    "The absence of strong negative feelings or discomfort and his ease of returning suggest he likely felt \"painless\" after treatment."
