  "query": "Question: Where might an expressway leave the Us to go?\n\nChoices:\nA: large city\nB: canada\nC: country\nD: map\nE: highways",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the context of the question, which involves an expressway leaving the United States.",
    "Expressways, also known as freeways or highways, are major roads typically designed for high-speed traffic.",
    "An expressway leaving the United States suggests a crossing into another area or jurisdiction, which could be a different country.",
    "Among the choices, I need to evaluate which option represents a destination that an expressway could feasibly lead to when leaving the US.",
    "Option A (\"large city\") does not specifically indicate a destination outside of the US; it could refer to a city within the US.",
    "Option B (\"canada\") suggests a neighboring country, which is plausible since expressways can connect the US to Canada.",
    "Option C (\"country\") is vague and could mean many things; however, it does imply leaving the US for another country, potentially including Canada or others.",
    "Option D (\"map\") is not a destination but a representation of locations and does not apply.",
    "Option E (\"highways\") also does not suggest a specific destination; it is a general term for types of roads and is not a proper answer.",
    "Since Canada is a neighboring country and commonly recognized as an expressway destination from the US, it stands out as the most logical choice."
