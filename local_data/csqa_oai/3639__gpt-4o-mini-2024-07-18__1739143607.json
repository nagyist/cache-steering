  "query": "Question: The person was trapped on the freeway on the way to a movie audition, where was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: florida\nB: countryside\nC: california\nD: america\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "The person is on a freeway, which is typically a major roadway found in urban or suburban areas rather than rural areas.",
    "The context of a movie audition suggests that the location is likely associated with the film industry, which is predominantly based in California.",
    "Florida does have freeways, but it is not known as a major hub for the film industry like California, specifically Hollywood.",
    "The countryside choice is unlikely since freeways connect urban areas, and a countryside setting would more likely involve smaller roads.",
    "\"America\" is too general and does not specify a location, while \"large city\" is vague and doesn\u2019t pinpoint a specific location relevant to the context of the film industry.",
    "California is known for having many freeways and is the primary center for movie auditions due to Hollywood.",
    "Considering all the choices, California stands out as the most likely location for someone going to a movie audition and encountering being trapped on a freeway.",
    "I will double check the other choices against this context to affirm that California is indeed the best possible choice.",
    "After reviewing, no other option fits the context of a movie audition and the freeway situation as well as California does."
