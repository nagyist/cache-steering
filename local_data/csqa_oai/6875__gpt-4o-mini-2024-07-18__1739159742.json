  "query": "Question: Seating is usually thought to be best in the center of the room, about halfway back, in what place?\n\nChoices:\nA: bus depot\nB: rest area\nC: theatre\nD: church\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context in which seating arrangement is often discussed. It typically relates to venues where performance, presentations, or gatherings occur.",
    "Next, rule out places where seating is not primarily focused on optimal viewing or listening experiences. A bus depot and rest area are likely places where seating isn't centered around an audience experience.",
    "Then, compare the remaining options: theatre, church, and classroom. All of these environments typically feature a central seating arrangement designed for a better experience.",
    "In a theatre, the best seating is generally located midway back, allowing audiences to see the stage and hear performances clearly.",
    "In a church, seating arrangements can vary. Some may be focused towards a front area where a preacher speaks or a ceremony occurs; however, it might not follow the strict \"halfway back\" guideline as in a theatre.",
    "Classrooms often have seating arranged in various styles (like rows or circles), but they don't adhere to a strict center placement for optimal viewing or listening, as instructional styles differ widely.",
    "Thus, considering these environments and where \"best\" seating is typically specified, the theatre stands out as the place where center, halfway back is ideal.",
    "Conclude that since the preferences for seating arrangements specifically refer to optimal viewing experiences, the theatre is the most logical choice."
