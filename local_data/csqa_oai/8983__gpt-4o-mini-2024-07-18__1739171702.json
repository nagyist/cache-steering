  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that an eraser is commonly associated with writing or drawing tools, particularly pencils.",
    "Next, I consider the environments where people typically use pencils, as an eraser is often used in conjunction with them.",
    "Schools are a primary environment where pencils and erasers are commonly used for writing, drawing, and completing assignments.",
    "Office supply stores sell erasers but are not a location where they are typically used.",
    "A desk drawer may contain an eraser, but it is not a place where one actively uses it.",
    "A pencil box is a container for holding supplies like pencils and erasers; however, it is not a location for use.",
    "Comparing the options, schools provide a direct context in which the eraser is actively utilized by students for their work.",
    "Since using an eraser is a common activity in schools, this suggests that option C is the most appropriate answer.",
    "I confirm that the rest of the options do not fit as well as schools for the use of an eraser."
