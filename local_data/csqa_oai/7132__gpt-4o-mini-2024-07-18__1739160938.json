  "query": "Question: If you drink too much liquor you are likely to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stumble\nB: food\nC: coffee\nD: throw up\nE: choke",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the effects of consuming too much liquor on the body and behavior. Drinking excessively can impair coordination and balance.",
    "Next, identify how impaired coordination can manifest. One common manifestation is stumbling, as individuals may have trouble walking straight or maintaining balance.",
    "Now, consider other potential effects of excessive liquor consumption. Nausea and vomiting are common responses when the body is overwhelmed by alcohol.",
    "Examine the option 'food'. While some may eat food while drinking, it is not a direct effect of drinking too much liquor.",
    "Look at the option 'coffee'. Typically, consuming coffee does not directly correlate to the effects of drinking alcohol; it may be attempted to counteract tiredness but is not a likely immediate consequence.",
    "Next, analyze the option 'choke.' This is a serious risk but may occur more due to an obstruction or emergency rather than a direct result of drinking too much liquor.",
    "After weighing the effects, the options that stand out are 'stumble' and 'throw up.' Both are plausible but throwing up is typically a stronger immediate reaction to excessive alcohol.",
    "Since stumbling relates more to coordination issues whereas vomiting relates to the body's response to the toxic effects of too much liquor, reiterate how severe drinking leads more commonly to throwing up."
