  "query": "Question: Bobby noticed that the silverware was plastic.  This was a turn off for him because it was so cheap.  Where might he have been?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: silver\nC: cupboard\nD: table\nE: kitchen",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the sentence. Bobby is reacting negatively to the plastic silverware, which indicates that he is in a setting where silverware is expected to be of higher quality, possibly indicating a dining situation.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. A restaurant often uses real silverware to enhance the dining experience, so plastic would typically be a turn off there.",
    "Now, consider the option of a \"kitchen.\" In a kitchen, it is quite common to have plastic utensils, which may not be a turn off for many people since they would be more functional for everyday use.",
    "The option \"cupboard\" suggests a storage place where silverware could be kept, but it doesn\u2019t directly imply the dining experience that Bobby\u2019s reaction is indicative of.",
    "Moving on to the option \"table,\" it may seem plausible since this is where he would encounter silverware during a meal, but the question suggests a broader context beyond just a physical location.",
    "Finally, the \"silver\" option seems out of context. This option does not align with the mechanism of dining or using utensils, as silver relates to the material but not the setting.",
    "Given the listed options, Bobby's experience aligns most closely with a restaurant, which would use silverware and the use of plastic might be particularly disappointing in that context where quality is expected."
