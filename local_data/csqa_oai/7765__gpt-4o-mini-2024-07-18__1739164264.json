  "steps": [
    "In an interview context, the participants typically include an interviewer and a candidate.",
    "The primary goal of an interview is for the interviewer to evaluate the candidate and for the candidate to assess if they want to work for the company.",
    "Generally, the interviewer sits at a desk or table, while the candidate is seated across from them.",
    "This arrangement allows both parties to engage directly and maintain eye contact, which is important for communication.",
    "Positioning candidates and interviewers in a way that they face each other is conducive to conversation and assessment.",
    "Other choices such as round-table or gathering together imply a less formal setting, which is not typical for interviews.",
    "Getting angry or believing in god are irrelevant to the physical positioning in an interview context.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate description of how people are typically positioned in an interview is that they face each other."
