  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a logical career path for individuals who major in computer science.",
    "A computer science major typically involves learning how to program, manage data, and understand algorithms.",
    "Considering the skills learned in a computer science program, one of the most direct applications of this knowledge would be in a career that involves software development.",
    "Among the choices given, \"write programs\" directly relates to a primary task performed by most computer science professionals.",
    "The other choices provided (A, C, D, and E) do not relate closely to the core competencies or career paths associated with computer science.",
    "\"Talk to each other\" (A) is vague and not a career path.",
    "\"Choose life\" (C) is philosophical and does not pertain to a specific career related directly to computer science.",
    "\"Play outside\" (D) is recreational and unrelated to a career path in computer science.",
    "\"Believe in god\" (E) also does not connect to a professional career associated with computer science.",
    "Therefore, the only viable career path from the given options that aligns with a computer science degree is to \"write programs.\""
