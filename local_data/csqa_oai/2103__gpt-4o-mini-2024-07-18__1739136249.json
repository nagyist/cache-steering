  "query": "Question: He was ready to bike home, he got out his key and began to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: turn lock\nB: pocket\nC: solution to problem\nD: pocket\nE: open doors",
  "steps": [
    "The context suggests that he is preparing to leave, so 'biking home' implies he is going to unlock something, likely a door to exit.",
    "The phrase \"got out his key\" indicates he is ready to use the key, which usually is to perform an action related to a lock.",
    "Considering the choices, \"turn lock\" suggests an action he would do with a key, as you often turn a key to unlock or lock something.",
    "The term \"pocket\" appears twice in the options, but it doesn't fit the context of what he would be doing with a key.",
    "\"Solution to problem\" does not fit the context of physical actions associated with keys and doors. It is too abstract.",
    "\"Open doors\" also fits the context as you can use a key to open a door, but it's somewhat less specific than the immediate action of turning the lock.",
    "I need to determine which option best completes the sentence based on typical actions associated with keys and locks.",
    "Since the question specifies what he began to do after getting out his key, the immediate action of \"turn lock\" is a stronger candidate than \"open doors.\"",
    "Thus, the most logical completion is that he began to turn the lock with his key to unlock the door."
