  "query": "Question: He was lost going up and down the long hall, it must've been a very what to contain a hall that long?\n\nChoices:\nA: prison\nB: conference\nC: dormitory\nD: large building\nE: inside",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes someone being lost in a long hall, suggesting the location has a significant length or size.",
    "The term \"hall\" typically refers to a passageway or large room in a building, often found in larger structures.",
    "The phrase \"it must've been a very\" indicates that the answer should describe the nature of the building where the hall exists, implying it needs to be associated with large spaces.",
    "Let's evaluate the choices provided:\n- A: prison - Prisons have long halls, but they wouldn't be characterized as \"very\" if we are only considering the hall.\n- B: conference - This is a specific use type for halls but not as expansive in terms of building type.\n- C: dormitory - Dormitories can have long halls, but they are typically smaller than large buildings.\n- D: large building - This option explicitly states that it is a spacious structure, which aligns with the description of a long hall.\n- E: inside - This choice lacks relevance or specificity to describe the type of structure.",
    "Among the choices, D (large building) captures the general size connotation effectively, as it indicates that a hall must belong to something ample enough to accommodate such a length.",
    "While C (dormitory) could be a reasonable answer due to its potential for long corridors, it is not as encompassing as D (large building).",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer to fulfill the context of the hall's required length must lean towards a general mention of a large structure rather than a specific type."
