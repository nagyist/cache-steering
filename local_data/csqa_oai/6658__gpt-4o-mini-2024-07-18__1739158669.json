  "query": "Question: She was beginning to age, an early sign of her memory problems was showing short term what?\n\nChoices:\nA: increase in emotional resonance\nB: forgetting\nC: brainless\nD: take shape\nE: forgetfulness",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to early signs of memory problems, specifically related to short-term memory.",
    "Among the choices, we need to find a term that relates specifically to short-term memory issues.",
    "Let\u2019s analyze each option: \n- A: \"increase in emotional resonance\" does not relate to memory problems.\n- B: \"forgetting\" implies losing memory but is vague without specifying the context.\n- C: \"brainless\" suggests a lack of thought, which doesn't directly refer to memory.\n- D: \"take shape\" does not relate to memory and seems more metaphorical.\n- E: \"forgetfulness\" specifically refers to the act of forgetting, closely tied to memory issues.",
    "Options B and E both mention forgetting, but \"forgetfulness\" as a noun is more explicit about the condition itself rather than just the action of forgetting.",
    "Since the question specifies \"short term,\" \"forgetfulness\" sounds like a direct sign of short-term memory problems.",
    "After evaluating the options, option E (\"forgetfulness\") directly correlates with early signs of short-term memory issues."
