  "query": "Question: It was a crude building with drafting floors, so all  the friends slept high in lofts while at the remote what?\n\nChoices:\nA: soho\nB: frame house\nC: hunting lodge\nD: apartment building\nE: bed",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the description of the building as a \"crude building with drafting floors.\" This suggests a rustic or simple structure, likely not very modern or sophisticated.",
    "Next, we notice that the friends are sleeping \"high in lofts.\" Lofts are typically spaces that are elevated, often found in buildings such as cabins, lodges, or simple residential constructions.",
    "The phrase \"at the remote\" indicates that the location is somewhat isolated or away from urban areas. This further implies that the type of building is probably not a conventional residential structure like an apartment building.",
    "Now let's consider the options provided in the question. \nA: \"soho\" typically refers to an area in New York City, which does not match the \"remote\" description.\nB: \"frame house\" can be a simple building, but it doesn't capture the essence of lofts and being remote as much as other options.\nC: \"hunting lodge\" fits well, as these are typically rustic buildings found in remote locations where people might stay overnight while hunting.\nD: \"apartment building\" is typically an urban structure and does not fit the description of being crude or remote.\nE: \"bed\" does not make sense in the context of a physical location.",
    "Among the considered options, \"hunting lodge\" aligns with both the rustic nature of the building and the practice of staying in lofts in a remote area where friends might be spending time together.",
    "In conclusion, out of all the options, the one that best fits the description of a crude building where friends sleep in lofts at a remote location is a \"hunting lodge.\""
