  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the common characteristics of dogs, especially in relation to their behavior towards humans.",
    "Dogs are known for their companionship with people and often display behaviors that indicate they are social animals.",
    "When dogs interact with people, they typically show warmth and approachability, which aligns with the idea of being friendly.",
    "While dogs can indeed be very smart, the question specifically asks about their behavior towards people, not their intelligence.",
    "Loyalty is a strong characteristic of dogs, particularly in the bond they form with their owners, but loyalty is more of a trait rather than a direct way they act towards all people.",
    "Describing dogs as \"found outside\" is more about their habitat rather than their behavior towards people.",
    "When focusing on how dogs are perceived in common interactions, the term \"furry\" describes their physical appearance rather than behavior.",
    "Considering all the options, the best descriptor of dogs' behavior towards people is \"friendly,\" as they are generally known to be open and sociable creatures."
