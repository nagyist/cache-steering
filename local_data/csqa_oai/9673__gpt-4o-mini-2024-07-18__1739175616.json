  "query": "Question: If you need a restroom while on the road where can you stop?\n\nChoices:\nA: rest area\nB: library\nC: resturant\nD: office building\nE: gas station",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of needing a restroom while on the road, which implies looking for convenience options that are commonly available to travelers.",
    "Consider rest areas, which are specifically designed for travelers and usually provide restrooms, picnic areas, and sometimes vending machines.",
    "Next, evaluate the option of a library. Libraries are typically public buildings, but they may not always be open, and not all will have restroom facilities accessible to the public.",
    "Now, assess the option of a restaurant. Most restaurants have restrooms available for their customers, making it a reasonable option for travelers in need of a restroom.",
    "Then, consider office buildings. While they may have restrooms, access can be restricted, and they are not reliable stops for travelers.",
    "Finally, examine gas stations, which commonly have restrooms available as a convenience for customers refueling their vehicles.",
    "Compare the options. Rest areas, restaurants, and gas stations all provide available restrooms for travelers, while libraries and office buildings may not be reliable choices.",
    "Given the options analyzed, restaurants and gas stations may provide the most consistent access to restrooms when on the road.",
    "Out of the three viable options (rest area, restaurant, gas station), rest areas stand out as designated stops specifically for this purpose."
