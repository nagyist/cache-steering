  "query": "Question: The farmer is making grow a tomato, what does he specialize?\n\nChoices:\nA: flowering\nB: barn\nC: growth\nD: plants\nE: more of",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the farmer is growing a tomato, which is a type of plant.",
    "Since tomatoes are plants, the farmer's specialization should relate to growing plants.",
    "Looking at the options, \"plants\" is explicitly mentioned in choice D.",
    "Choice A, \"flowering,\" refers to a specific part of plant biology but does not directly relate to the whole process of growing tomatoes.",
    "Choice B, \"barn,\" does not connect to specialization in growing tomatoes; it refers to a structure rather than a specialization.",
    "Choice C, \"growth,\" is a broad term that could apply, but it is not as specific as \"plants,\" which directly identifies the type of activity involved.",
    "Choice E, \"more of,\" does not make sense in this context as it lacks specificity and clarity regarding specialization.",
    "Given that \"plants\" is the most directly related to the act of growing tomatoes and follows the context of the farmer's work, it stands out among the choices."
