  "query": "Question: His wife began to worry when he was setting cup on table, she saw what shaking?\n\nChoices:\nA: hands\nB: the table\nC: breaking\nD: coaster\nE: skill",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the situation described. The concern arises when the wife notices something shaking while her husband is setting a cup on the table.",
    "Next, we consider what could be shaking in this scenario. The most immediate possibility is that the husband's hands could be shaking, which would indicate he might be nervous or unsteady.",
    "Another possibility could be that the table itself is shaking, which could imply that something is unstable about the table, potentially causing concern about breaking or spilling.",
    "However, the choice \"breaking\" does not fit as an answer to the shaking; instead, it expresses a consequence rather than the cause or the item itself shaking.",
    "The item \"coaster\" is unlikely to be the focus of concern here, as it would typically sound less alarming, and \"skill\" does not relate to the scenario described.",
    "Considering the emotional reaction of the wife, it seems more plausible that the shaking of the husband's hands would lead her to worry, as it indicates an immediate issue relating to his well-being.",
    "Based on all reasoning steps, the most logical option that aligns with her worry about what is shaking is the hands."
