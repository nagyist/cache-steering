  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that she had worked hard her whole life and saved money, suggesting a significant investment or purchase, likely something substantial.",
    "The phrase \"dream entrance hall\" implies that the purchase relates to a residence that features a notable entryway, which typically refers to a home.",
    "Looking at the choices, a \"hat rack\" (A) is relatively trivial and does not align with the idea of a lifelong investment or dream.",
    "A \"school\" (B) does not fit the context of a personal dream entrance hall, suggesting it\u2019s not the correct choice.",
    "The term \"large home\" (C) aligns with the idea of a significant purchase related to a dream entrance hall. A large home would likely have a grand or appealing entrance hall.",
    "A \"palace\" (D) might seem extravagant and could technically link to a large entrance hall, but it\u2019s often associated with royalty or extreme wealth, which the context does not support.",
    "A \"gateway\" (E) does not fit the context of a place where one would buy and live, nor does it relate to the concept of an entrance hall.",
    "Evaluating all options, \"large home\" (C) stands out as the only logical choice that reflects a significant lifetime saving effort and a personal dream."
