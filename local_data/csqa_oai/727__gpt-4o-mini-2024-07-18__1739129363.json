  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an activity that is typically associated with auditory experience.",
    "\"Smile\" (Choice A) is a non-verbal expression and can be done by anyone, including deaf people.",
    "\"Singing\" (Choice B) involves vocalization, which requires sound and is generally not something deaf people can enjoy the same way as hearing people.",
    "\"Sweat\" (Choice C) is a physiological response to heat or exertion and is unrelated to an auditory experience.",
    "\"Act\" (Choice D) involves performance skills that can be communicated via gestures and expressions, and can certainly be performed by deaf individuals.",
    "\"Dance\" (Choice E) involves bodily movement that can be enjoyed by deaf people, as they might feel the vibrations of music or enjoy the experience visually.",
    "Comparing all options, \"singing\" stands out as the activity that cannot be fully enjoyed by deaf people due to the lack of sound."
