  "query": "Question: What will criminals do before robbing a bank?\n\nChoices:\nA: step lightly\nB: serving time\nC: take money\nD: arm themselves\nE: manual",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the context of the question, which is about the actions criminals might take before committing a bank robbery.",
    "Next, I will consider the nature of a bank robbery and what preparation might typically involve.",
    "Criminals may engage in various behaviors to prepare for a robbery, such as scouting the bank or planning the logistics of the heist.",
    "I will analyze the choices provided: \n- A: \"step lightly\" suggests a cautious approach but does not directly relate to preparation for a robbery.\n- B: \"serving time\" implies being in prison, which is not an action taken before robbing a bank.\n- C: \"take money\" seems like the end goal of the robbery, not a preparatory action.\n- D: \"arm themselves\" is a concrete action that many criminals might take for protection or intimidation before committing a robbery.\n- E: \"manual\" does not provide clear context relevant to the question about criminal behavior.",
    "Considering the analysis, the action most related to preparation for a bank robbery is arming oneself.",
    "I will double-check all options to ensure that \u201carm themselves\u201d fits the criteria of an action taken before the robbery, compared to the other choices.",
    "Since option D clearly represents a typical behavior that criminals might engage in before a heist, I will choose this as the final answer."
