  "query": "Question: If a person spends all day at their job, what are they likely doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: gain weight\nB: walk away\nC: work hard\nD: turn around\nE: getting a burnout",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the likely activity of a person who spends all day at their job.",
    "When someone spends the entire day at their job, it typically implies they are engaged in their work responsibilities.",
    "Looking at the options, \"work hard\" (C) directly aligns with the notion of being at a job for an extended period.",
    "The option \"gain weight\" (A) might be a side effect of long hours, but it is not a direct activity taking place at the job.",
    "\"Walk away\" (B) and \"turn around\" (D) imply leaving or discontinuing work, which contradicts the premise of spending all day at the job.",
    "Lastly, \"getting a burnout\" (E) could result from prolonged work but does not necessarily imply what they are actively doing during that time.",
    "Thus, the most straightforward and relevant answer reflecting what a person is likely doing when at their job all day is to \"work hard.\""
