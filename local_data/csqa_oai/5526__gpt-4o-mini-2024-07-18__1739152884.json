  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the term \"mine\" in this context. Generally, it refers to a place where minerals or resources are extracted from the earth.",
    "Next, I think about the typical geographic features where mines are usually located. Mines are commonly found under landforms that contain valuable resources.",
    "I consider choice A, Pennsylvania. This state is known for its coal mining, but it's a specific location rather than a general geographic term.",
    "Next, I evaluate choice B, desert. Deserts are arid regions with sparse populations and are not typically associated with mining activities due to lack of resources.",
    "For choice C, valley, I reflect that valleys can be locations for various mines, including those that extract minerals from the earth as they can be rich in resources.",
    "Choice D, Cambodia, is a specific country where mining does take place, though not exclusively under any geographic feature like mountains or valleys.",
    "Now looking at choice E, mountain, I remember that many mines, especially for minerals and metals like gold and silver, are located in mountainous regions.",
    "I weigh the options between valley and mountain. While valleys can contain mines, mountains are more commonly associated with significant mining operations due to the geological formations present.",
    "After considering all the geographic features and their relationship to mines, I conclude that mines are most commonly located under mountains."
