    "The question asks for a goal that people have related to having sex for a long duration.",
    "Option A states \"sell beer,\" which is unrelated to the context of having sex. This doesn't express a goal tied to sexual activity.",
    "Option B states \"wonderful thing.\" While sex can be described as wonderful, this does not directly address the goal of having sex for a long time.",
    "Option C states \"herpes.\" This is a sexually transmitted infection and not a goal that individuals would aspire to achieve through sexual activity.",
    "Option D states \"cost money.\" This could be a concern related to sexual activities but does not represent a goal for having sex.",
    "Option E states \"last hour.\" This demonstrates a clear goal of wanting to have extended sexual activity, implying enjoyment or satisfaction from that duration.",
    "Among the options, the only one reflecting a direct goal related to having long-lasting sex is \"last hour.\""
