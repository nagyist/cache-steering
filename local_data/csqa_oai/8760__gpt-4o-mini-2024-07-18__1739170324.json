  "query": "Question: What's the best place to store boxes of spare automobile parts?\n\nChoices:\nA: shed\nB: loft\nC: attic\nD: garage\nE: basement",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environmental factors for storing automobile parts. They are often sensitive to humidity and temperature fluctuations.",
    "Second, evaluate each option regarding their typical climate. A shed is usually exposed to outdoor conditions which might not be ideal for sensitive parts.",
    "Third, a loft or attic can often provide temperature control, but they may not be as easily accessible as others. Additionally, they might get very hot or very cold, depending on the season.",
    "Fourth, a garage is typically attached to the house and provides a controlled environment where minor temperature changes occur. It is often more accessible than an attic or loft.",
    "Fifth, consider the basement. While basements can have stable temperatures, they might also be prone to dampness, which is not good for automobile parts.",
    "Sixth, accessibility is a major concern. You would want to easily reach the parts for installation or maintenance purposes. Garages are generally more accessible than attics and basements.",
    "Seventh, think about how the space is typically used in practice. Garages are known for storage of vehicles and vehicle-related items, making them suitable for spare parts.",
    "Eighth, consider the risk of pests or corrosion. Basements and sheds may attract pests, while garages can be better managed to prevent such issues.",
    "Ninth, consider the potential for organization. Garages usually have built-in storage solutions or room for shelves, making organization easier for spare parts.",
    "Finally, after weighing all these considerations, the garage stands out as the most optimal choice for storing boxes of spare automobile parts."
