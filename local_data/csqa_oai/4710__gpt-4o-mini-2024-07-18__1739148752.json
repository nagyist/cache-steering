  "steps": [
    "Marmots are a type of large ground squirrel that primarily inhabit mountainous regions and grasslands.",
    "Geographically, marmots are found predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Specific species of marmots, such as the yellow-bellied marmot, are found in North America, which is mostly located in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "The habitats of marmots include regions in the western United States, Canada, and parts of Europe and Asia, which are all in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Given that marmots are not found in the Southern Hemisphere, choices relating to the southern part of the globe and jungles can be eliminated.",
    "While choice C states \"North America,\" it is more specific than just the hemisphere. However, \"North America\" is part of the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Choice D, \"Vancouver Island,\" is a specific location but does not represent the half of the earth marmots inhabit generally.",
    "Thus, the most inclusive and correct choice representing where marmots live is the \"northern hemisphere.\""
