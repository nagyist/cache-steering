  "query": "Question: Where are you if the person next to you has a briefcase and you're accused of a misdeed?\n\nChoices:\nA: hand\nB: airport\nC: desk\nD: to help\nE: courtroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of having a briefcase. A briefcase is often associated with business settings, travel, or legal situations.",
    "Next, look at the accusation of a misdeed. Misdeeds typically refer to wrongdoing or legal issues, which suggests a more serious context, perhaps involving law enforcement or legal proceedings.",
    "Given these two pieces of information, let's analyze the choices. A \u201cdesk\u201d could be related to an office or a workspace but does not inherently suggest legal implications.",
    "The \u201cairport\u201d could fit with someone traveling and possibly carrying a briefcase, but does not strongly align with being accused of a misdeed.",
    "\u201cTo help\u201d is vague and does not fit the scenario of an accusation or the presence of a briefcase.",
    "Finally, the \u201ccourtroom\u201d is a setting closely related to legal matters, accusations, and possibly the presence of a briefcase (often carried by lawyers or legal personnel).",
    "Considering all factors, including the legal implications and the presence of a briefcase, the most likely location involving both accusations and business/legal associations is a courtroom."
