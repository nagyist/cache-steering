  "steps": [
    "The question states that the government cracked down on anybody protesting, which implies that there was an action taken against a specific behavior or activity.",
    "Protesting typically involves expressing dissent or opposition to authority or government policies, indicating that this is what the government disliked.",
    "Among the choices given, we need to determine which option relates closely to the act of protesting.",
    "Choice A, \"buy cats at petstore\", is unrelated to protesting and dissent, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice B, \"question authority\", is directly related to protesting as protests often involve questioning government decisions and actions. This seems like a strong candidate.",
    "Choice C, \"crowds\", could be a factor in protests as they often involve large groups of people, but it doesn't directly indicate what the government dislikes about the act of protesting itself.",
    "Choice D, \"forget\", does not relate to the context of protesting or government action against protests, so it can also be eliminated.",
    "Choice E, \"wash dishes\", is completely unrelated to the theme of the question and can be eliminated as well.",
    "The strongest and most relevant choice that directly pertains to the government's dislike in the context of protesting is option B, \"question authority\"."
