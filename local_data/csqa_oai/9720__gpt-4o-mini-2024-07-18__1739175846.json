  "steps": [
    "The question states that the big rolling machines make tons of newspapers every day. This implies a connection between the machines and the production of newspapers.",
    "To determine the correct answer, I need to consider what is essential for producing newspapers. Usually, newspapers are printed on paper, and the process involves having stories ready to be printed.",
    "Looking at the options, I see that some of them don't directly relate to the printing process. For instance, option A (\"tree\") is related to the source of the paper but not the process of getting stories into the newspapers.",
    "Option B (\"recycled\") could pertain to the material used, but it does not fit the context of \"getting the stories.\"",
    "Option C (\"written on paper\") suggests that the stories are first written on paper before being turned into newspapers, but this doesn't align with the common production process.",
    "Option D (\"printed on paper\") indicates that stories are printed to produce newspapers, which aligns with how newspapers are typically produced.",
    "Option E (\"local\") does not relate to the process or the production of newspapers in a meaningful way connected to the rest of the question.",
    "Since the question asks what the big rolling machines need to produce newspapers, the best choice is the one that describes the final action performed by these machines, which is to print the stories onto paper.",
    "After evaluating the options, option D is the most logical choice as it directly relates to the function of the rolling machines in making newspapers."
