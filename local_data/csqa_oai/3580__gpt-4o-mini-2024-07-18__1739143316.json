  "query": "Question: John didn't think he and Steve should be competing against each other.  It wasn't good for their relationship.  The losers always felt jealousy and what?\n\nChoices:\nA: winning or losing\nB: envy\nC: resentment\nD: injury\nE: pride",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that competition between John and Steve is detrimental to their relationship. It mentions that the \"losers always felt jealousy,\" which suggests negative feelings in a competitive context.",
    "I need to identify what negative feelings are commonly associated with losing in a competition. Jealousy might lead to other emotions or feelings related to resentment.",
    "Looking at the options, \"envy\" is similar to jealousy but might not capture the deeper, more long-lasting feelings that can stem from losing.",
    "On the other hand, \"resentment\" indicates a stronger emotion that can persist over time as a result of feeling wronged or perceiving an injustice, which seems appropriate given the context.",
    "The other options include \"winning or losing,\" which does not directly relate to the emotional outcome for the losers, and \"injury,\" which does not apply to emotional contexts of competition. \"Pride\" would typically be associated with winning, not losing.",
    "Therefore, the emotion that often accompanies jealousy for those who lose in competitive situations is likely to be resentment, as it aligns well with the idea of feeling slighted or harboring negative feelings."
