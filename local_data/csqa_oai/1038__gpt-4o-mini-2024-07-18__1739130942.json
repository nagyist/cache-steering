  "steps": [
    "The question asks what medium is typically used to watch garbage reality shows.",
    "Garbage reality shows are generally consumed through mainstream media channels.",
    "Out of the provided choices, one would not use a trashcan (A) or floor (B) to watch anything.",
    "Microwaves (E) are used for cooking, not for viewing programs.",
    "\"Toronto\" (C) is a city and does not relate to the medium of watching shows.",
    "The most common medium for watching television shows, including reality shows, is a television (D).",
    "Therefore, the logical answer must be the medium that can effectively stream or broadcast shows.",
    "Since a television is specifically designed for viewing shows, it solidifies itself as the correct choice.",
    "Now I review the choices again: A (trashcan), B (floor), C (toronto), D (television), E (microwave).",
    "The only valid option that aligns with the context of the question is D (television)."
