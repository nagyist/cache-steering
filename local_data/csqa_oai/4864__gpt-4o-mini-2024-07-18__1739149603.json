  "query": "Question: What will happen to your clothes if you are full?\n\nChoices:\nA: topfull\nB: incomplete\nC: enlarge\nD: close fitting\nE: partial",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what effect being full might have on clothing.",
    "When someone is \"full,\" it typically means their stomach is at or near capacity, which can put pressure on clothing.",
    "We need to consider what happens to clothes fitting-wise when the body shape changes due to fullness.",
    "Tight or close-fitting clothing may feel even tighter when someone is full, due to the increased volume of the stomach area.",
    "The choice \"topfull\" doesn't seem to be a standard term for clothing fitting, making it unlikely to be the correct answer.",
    "The term \"incomplete\" does not relate to the physical state of clothing; it describes a lack of something.",
    "\"Enlarge\" indicates that clothing is becoming larger, which is not typically what happens to clothing when one becomes full; rather, it feels tighter.",
    "\"Close fitting\" suggests that clothing is snug against the body, which aligns with the sensation of clothing when someone is full.",
    "Lastly, \"partial\" does not accurately describe the fitting of clothes relative to fullness.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, \"close fitting\" is the most logical choice as it describes the sensation of clothing when a person is full."
