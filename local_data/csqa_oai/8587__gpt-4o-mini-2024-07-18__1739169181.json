  "steps": [
    "Billy loves singing, which suggests that he finds enjoyment in it.",
    "The enjoyment derived from singing often comes from expressing oneself and connecting with others.",
    "\"Singing\" primarily serves as a form of communication, where one can share emotions and thoughts.",
    "Among the choices provided, being heard aligns with the idea that singing allows expression and sharing oneself with an audience.",
    "The other options (sore throats, itchiness, hoarse voice, and change in mood) do not inherently relate to a positive aspect or reason for loving singing.",
    "Thus, the option that makes the most sense in the context of why Billy loved singing is C: being heard."
