  "query": "Question: A flask is a container can, it is made to hold what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fire\nB: store\nC: contain food\nD: garage\nE: liquid",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the purpose of a flask as a container.",
    "A flask is typically used to hold substances, and it is important to identify which type of substances it is commonly associated with.",
    "Flasks are often made to hold liquids, especially in laboratory and drinkware contexts.",
    "Option A, \"fire,\" does not make sense as a substance that can be held in a container.",
    "Option B, \"store,\" describes an action rather than a substance, so it is not relevant to what a flask holds.",
    "Option C, \"contain food,\" suggests that a flask might hold food, but flasks are primarily designed for liquids rather than solid food items.",
    "Option D, \"garage,\" is unrelated, as a garage is a building used for parking vehicles, not a substance.",
    "Option E, \"liquid,\" aligns with the common use of flasks which is to hold liquids, such as water, chemicals, or beverages.",
    "Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate answer to the question of what a flask is designed to hold is liquid."
