  "query": "Question: John needed to find shade. He was being blinded by what?\n\nChoices:\nA: full sunlight\nB: bright sunshine\nC: sunny place\nD: moonlight\nE: tanning",
  "steps": [
    "First, we must understand the context of the question. John is trying to find shade, which suggests he is experiencing discomfort from something that emits light.",
    "Next, we evaluate the choices given. \"Moonlight\" (D) is much softer and does not typically cause discomfort, as it is much dimmer than sunlight.",
    "Similarly, \"tanning\" (E) is an activity that involves exposure to sunlight but doesn't represent a direct cause of being blinded.",
    "Now let's consider \"sunny place\" (C). While being in a sunny place can imply exposure to sunlight, it does not specifically address the intensity of light causing blindness.",
    "Next, we analyze \"bright sunshine\" (B). This phrase indicates a strong intensity of sunlight, which is likely a direct source of discomfort, suggesting that this could be the reason John is searching for shade.",
    "Finally, \"full sunlight\" (A) also suggests being under the full intensity of the sun, which could similarly lead to discomfort and the need for shade.",
    "However, \"bright sunshine\" (B) emphasizes the intensity, which commonly leads to blinding situations necessitating shade more than just being in a \"sunny place\" or being in \"full sunlight.\"",
    "Considering all reasoning, \"bright sunshine\" (B) is the most accurate answer describing the condition that leads John to seek shade."
