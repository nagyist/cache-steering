  "query": "Question: What do cats have but humans and some other animals do not have?\n\nChoices:\nA: bodies\nB: tongues\nC: tails\nD: muscles\nE: bones",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will examine the choices to see what unique physical feature or characteristic cats possess in comparison to humans and certain other animals.",
    "Next, I will evaluate choice A: \"bodies.\" Both cats and humans have bodies, so this choice is incorrect.",
    "Then, I will assess choice B: \"tongues.\" Cats and humans both have tongues, so this choice is also incorrect.",
    "Next, I will look at choice C: \"tails.\" Cats have tails, while humans do not have tails, making this choice a candidate for the answer.",
    "I will then review choice D: \"muscles.\" Both cats and humans have muscles, so this choice is incorrect.",
    "Finally, I will consider choice E: \"bones.\" Both cats and humans have bones, so this choice is also incorrect.",
    "Since \"tails\" is the only feature that is distinctly present in cats and absent in humans (and in some other animals), it confirms that choice C is the correct answer."
