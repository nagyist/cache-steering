  "query": "Question: Where in your room would you put scissors that you use all the time?\n\nChoices:\nA: counter\nB: cabinet\nC: house\nD: backpack\nE: desk",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify a location in the room that is easily accessible for using scissors frequently.",
    "The counter is a surface that might be used quite often, but it might not be the best long-term storage location as it could get cluttered.",
    "A cabinet could provide storage, but it might not be easy to reach quickly whenever I need the scissors.",
    "A house is not a specific location within a room; it's too broad to be a useful answer in this context.",
    "A backpack is typically used for transporting items and may not be a good place to keep scissors that are used frequently, as it might not be convenient.",
    "A desk is usually where I do a lot of tasks, and having scissors easily accessible on the desk would be practical for frequent use.",
    "Considering convenience, safety, and accessibility, the desk seems to be the ideal location for frequently used scissors.",
    "I will compare the potential choices one last time: counter, cabinet, and backpack are less suitable compared to the desk, which offers a good workspace."
