  "query": "Question: The oven was left open after turning off to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: roast\nB: baking food\nC: cool temperature\nD: heat\nE: bake",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the purpose of leaving the oven open after turning it off.",
    "When an oven is turned off, its residual heat can retain warmth for a period of time.",
    "Leaving the oven door open can help to facilitate the cooling down of the oven itself.",
    "One might leave the oven door open to prevent food from continuing to cook or to let moisture escape.",
    "The action of allowing the oven to cool is often important for safety reasons and to avoid overheating the kitchen.",
    "Out of the choices provided, \"cool temperature\" directly relates to the act of leaving the oven door open to promote cooling.",
    "The other options, such as \"roast,\" \"baking food,\" \"heat,\" and \"bake,\" imply continued cooking or applying heat, which contradicts the action of turning off the oven.",
    "By now isolating the choices based on reason, \"cool temperature\" is the only logical answer that matches the action in question."
