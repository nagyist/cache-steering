  "query": "Question: Where do you see clouds?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground level\nB: sky\nC: air\nD: top of mountain\nE: top of building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where clouds are typically formed and found. Clouds are generally made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.",
    "Next, recall that clouds can be observed at different altitudes, but they are primarily located in the sky, above the ground level.",
    "Evaluate each choice provided to determine where clouds are most commonly seen. \nChoice A (ground level) does not apply, as clouds are not typically found at that level.",
    "For choice B (sky), this aligns with the common understanding that clouds are part of the sky, often directly visible to us from the ground.",
    "Consider choice C (air). While clouds do occupy airspace, this term is too vague and does not specifically denote a particular place where clouds can be seen. It does not pinpoint a location like \"sky\" does.",
    "Examine choice D (top of mountain). Although one might see clouds at the top of a mountain, it is not the best representation of where clouds are primarily located, as they are much more commonly found in the overall sky.",
    "Finally, analyze choice E (top of building). Similar to the top of a mountain, while clouds can occasionally be seen from the top of a building, this is again not representative of their main location compared to the sky.",
    "Thus, the choice that most accurately sees clouds is choice B, as they are fundamentally located in the sky."
