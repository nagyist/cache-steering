  "query": "Question: Where would you put an eyeglasses case if you are a man?\n\nChoices:\nA: store\nB: bag\nC: drawer\nD: purse\nE: pant pocket",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question which states \"if you are a man.\" This implies we should focus on storage options typically used by men.",
    "Evaluate option A: \"store.\" While you can technically store an eyeglasses case in a store, this is not practical for personal use.",
    "Now consider option B: \"bag.\" Many men carry bags such as messenger bags, backpacks, or briefcases, which are suitable places to put an eyeglasses case.",
    "Assess option C: \"drawer.\" A drawer can be another suitable option as it is often used to store personal items including accessories like an eyeglasses case.",
    "Consider option D: \"purse.\" Generally, purses are associated with women, so it is less likely that a man would put an eyeglasses case in a purse.",
    "Finally, analyze option E: \"pant pocket.\" Although some fashion styles may allow for this, it's often impractical for an eyeglasses case due to size and comfort.",
    "Compare the practicality and likelihood of each remaining option (B: bag, C: drawer). A bag allows for easy transport, while a drawer is more about storage at home.",
    "Since carrying an eyeglasses case when out is more relevant, the bag would be a more suitable answer."
