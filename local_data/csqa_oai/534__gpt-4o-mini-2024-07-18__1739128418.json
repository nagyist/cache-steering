  "query": "Question: Dry and cracked heels are found on?\n\nChoices:\nA: boot\nB: the desert\nC: loaf of bread\nD: foot\nE: hock",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze what the term \"dry and cracked heels\" refers to. Typically, it applies to skin, particularly on feet, that has become dry and developed fissures or cracks.",
    "Next, we can consider the given options: A: boot, B: the desert, C: loaf of bread, D: foot, and E: hock. Out of these, 'foot' stands out as a body part where dry and cracked heels are commonly found.",
    "Looking at option A: boot, while a boot may cause discomfort or keep moisture from the feet, it does not directly refer to a body part where dry and cracked heels occur.",
    "Then, examining option B: the desert, this does not relate directly to the concept of heels; it refers to a geographical area with arid conditions.",
    "For option C: loaf of bread, this does not make sense in the context since bread does not have heels in the way humans do.",
    "Considering option E: hock, this term typically refers to a joint in animals (especially in the hind leg of quadrupeds), which does not relate to human heels.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all options, 'foot' is clearly the only direct match to the description of \"dry and cracked heels.\""
