  "query": "Question: The Mormon owned steak house was always busy, it was a great place to visit where?\n\nChoices:\nA: utah\nB: nebraska\nC: the sun\nD: new york\nE: strip mall",
  "steps": [
    "We start by identifying the key phrases in the question. \"The Mormon owned steak house\" suggests a connection to a place where the Mormon community is significant.",
    "The state most commonly associated with the Mormon community is Utah, where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is headquartered and has a large population.",
    "While there may be Mormon communities in other states, such as Nebraska or New York, they are not known as the central locations for such communities.",
    "The choice \"the sun\" is clearly not a location, making it irrelevant to the question of where the steak house is located.",
    "\"Strip mall\" refers to a type of shopping development and does not specify a geographic location.",
    "Now, we compare the remaining options: A (Utah), B (Nebraska), D (New York).",
    "Utah is the most closely associated state with a large Mormon presence and culture.",
    "Both Nebraska and New York are less significant in terms of Mormon population and cultural relevance.",
    "Given that the context of the question points to a specific community and a well-known area linked to it, Utah is the strongest candidate.",
    "After verifying all steps, it is clear that the best answer is A: Utah."
