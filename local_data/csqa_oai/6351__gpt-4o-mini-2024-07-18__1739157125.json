  "query": "Question: He followed the train tracks hoping to get home, he had gotten lost in the Yooperland where?\n\nChoices:\nA: ghetto\nB: michigan\nC: new york\nD: canada\nE: train station",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify who \"he\" is in the context of the question. The question refers to a person who is lost in \"Yooperland.\"",
    "Next, we interpret what \"Yooperland\" means. \"Yooperland\" is a colloquial term for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which is known for its unique culture and geography.",
    "Based on the definition of \"Yooperland,\" we can eliminate choices that are not related to Michigan. Both New York (C) and Canada (D) are unrelated to Yooperland.",
    "Now, we further analyze the remaining options: A (ghetto), B (michigan), and E (train station).",
    "The term \"ghetto\" (A) does not specifically define a location; it refers to a neighborhood rather than a region, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "\"Train station\" (E) is more of a specific place rather than a geographic area and does not correspond to the context of \"lost in Yooperland.\"",
    "With only Michigan (B) remaining as a feasible choice and knowing that the person is lost in \"Yooperland,\" it confirms that the location is indeed in Michigan.",
    "To double-check, we reinforce that \"Yooperland\" is specifically tied to Michigan, further validating that the most accurate answer is Michigan."
