    "To begin, we need to understand what a kitchenette is. A kitchenette typically refers to a small kitchen area with basic cooking facilities, usually found in smaller living spaces.",
    "Next, we need to consider the types of dwellings listed in the options. We are specifically looking for dwellings that are stacked on top of each other, meaning they have multiple levels or floors.",
    "Option A is a house. While some houses can be multi-storied, they are often standalone and usually don't involve dwellings being stacked on top of each other.",
    "Option B is a dorm room. Dormitories are indeed stacks of rooms, but dorms usually have shared kitchens rather than individual kitchenettes within the rooms.",
    "Option C is a one-story apartment. While apartments can have kitchenettes, a one-story apartment does not fit the criterion of being 'stacked on top of each other' as it implies there are multiple levels.",
    "Option D is an apartment. Apartments are often found in multi-story buildings, thus they certainly can have kitchenettes and are typically stacked on top of each other.",
    "Option E is a hotel room. Hotel rooms are indeed often stacked on top of each other as part of multi-story hotel buildings, and they often feature kitchenettes, especially in extended stay hotels.",
    "Now, we compare options D and E. Both are dwellings that are stacked on top of each other and can have kitchenettes. However, the question emphasizes the commonality of kitchenettes, which are more frequently associated with apartments compared to hotel rooms.",
    "Finally, considering the commonality of kitchenettes, I conclude that among the options, apartments (D) are typically more recognized for having kitchenettes, particularly in multi-story buildings."
