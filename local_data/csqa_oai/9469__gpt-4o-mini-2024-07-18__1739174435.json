  "query": "Question: Where would you find a vase in a restaurant?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: shelf\nC: cabinet\nD: windowsill\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common placements of vases in a restaurant setting. Vases are often used for decoration or to hold flowers.",
    "Next, analyze the option of \"table.\" Vases can indeed be placed on tables as centerpieces, especially in finer dining establishments.",
    "Then look at \"shelf.\" While some restaurants may have shelves displaying vases, it's less common for everyday dining use, making this option less likely.",
    "Now evaluate \"cabinet.\" It's possible for vases to be stored here when not in use, but it's not a prominent place where customers typically see them.",
    "Examine \"windowsill.\" Vases can be placed on windowsills for decoration, especially if there are plants or flowers involved. This option is also plausible.",
    "Finally, consider \"bathroom.\" Vases are not normally found in bathrooms as part of the standard decor in restaurants.",
    "After this analysis, the most likely option where a vase would be found in use at a restaurant is on a \"table\" as a centerpiece."
