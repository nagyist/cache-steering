  "query": "Question: Boris was lying to Natasha. That dress did make her but look far.  But he wanted to avoid what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being fired\nB: trouble\nC: hurt feelings\nD: overweight\nE: being found out",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context provided in the statement. Boris lied to Natasha about her dress, suggesting he was trying to protect her feelings or avoid a negative reaction.",
    "Next, I analyze the nature of the lie. Since Boris complemented the dress despite it not being flattering, this implies he was concerned about Natasha's feelings.",
    "I then look at the options available. While \"being fired,\" \"trouble,\" and \"overweight\" may be potential concerns, they do not directly relate to the situation involving a personal compliment.",
    "Considering \"hurt feelings,\" it seems to align well with Boris's motive for lying. His intention appears to have been to spare Natasha from feeling bad about her appearance.",
    "Then I evaluate the option \"being found out.\" This could also be a reason for lying; however, it does not encompass the emotional context reflected in the compliment to Natasha.",
    "After weighing the emotional implications of Boris's lie, it's clear that he particularly aimed to avoid hurting Natasha's feelings through his kind deception.",
    "Finally, I confirm that the primary reason for Boris lying was to prevent any negative emotional impact on Natasha, which directly corresponds with choice C."
