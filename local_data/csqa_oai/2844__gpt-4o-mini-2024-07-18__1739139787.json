  "query": "Question: A projectile ball is in what after being launched?\n\nChoices:\nA: catapult\nB: motion\nC: flintlock\nD: arcade\nE: tennis court",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what happens when a projectile ball is launched. A launched projectile is typically in a state of movement through the air due to the force applied to it at launch.",
    "Consider the characteristics of projectile motion. A projectile follows a curved path under the influence of gravity, indicating that it is indeed in motion.",
    "Examine the answer choices for relevance. The only option that corresponds to the current state of the projectile ball after being launched is motion.",
    "Review the other options. A: catapult refers to a device used to launch projectiles, not their state post-launch. C: flintlock pertains to a type of firearm. D: arcade relates to a gaming environment, and E: tennis court is a specific play area but unrelated to the state of the projectile ball.",
    "Conclude that none of the other options represent a state of a launched projectile ball effectively, while \"motion\" directly describes what the ball is doing after being launched."
