  "steps": [
    "The question asks about sources where young people might read about weasels, indicating literature or media targeted towards a younger audience.",
    "Option A suggests \"songs.\" While some songs might mention animals, they are generally not a primary source for reading about specific animals like weasels.",
    "Option B, \"corn fields,\" refers to a physical location, not a reading source, so it doesn't fit as a medium where young people would read about weasels.",
    "Option C presents \"children's story.\" Children's literature often features a variety of animals, including weasels, in stories aimed at young readers.",
    "Option D, \"animated film,\" suggests a visual medium rather than a reading source. While films may contain stories about animals, they do not constitute reading material.",
    "Option E, \"forrest,\" also refers to a location, not a reading source, which doesn't specifically relate to where weasels are read about.",
    "Comparing the options, options A, B, D, and E do not directly correlate to reading content, while option C aligns with children's literature.",
    "Children's stories often feature moral lessons or educational content about animals, making option C the most logical choice for where young people would read about weasels."
