  "query": "Question: As a human in a large northeastern city, where can you see animals?\n\nChoices:\nA: zoo\nB: workplace\nC: sky\nD: new york city\nE: many places",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the locations where animals can commonly be seen in a large northeastern city.",
    "I recognize that zoos are specifically designed to house and display animals from various regions, making it a strong candidate for a place to see animals.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the choice of \"workplace.\" Generally, workplaces may not accommodate animals, particularly in a city context, unless it's a pet-friendly office or something similar. This seems less likely.",
    "The option \"sky\" refers to birds and other flying creatures, but this is less specific and may not be the best answer, as it doesn't fully encompass various types of animals.",
    "Considering \"new york city,\" while it encompasses many elements and some animals may be found in the wild (like pigeons or squirrels), it doesn't specifically indicate a place dedicated to viewing animals.",
    "The choice \"many places\" suggests a generality and may include various situations where animals can be observed, but it does not specify any singular, clear locations like a zoo.",
    "Thus, comparing all the options, \"zoo\" is the most definitive location known for viewing a variety of animals in a structured environment.",
    "I can also consider that while other options might provide opportunities to view animals, they are not as reliable or dedicated as a zoo.",
    "After reviewing the reasoning for each option, I conclude that the zoo is the best specific answer to the question of where to see animals in a large northeastern city."
