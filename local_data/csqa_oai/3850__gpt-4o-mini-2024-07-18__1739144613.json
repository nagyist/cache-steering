  "query": "Question: A member of the audience was struck in the head by a ball. What sort of building is the audience most likely in?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie theater\nB: stadium\nC: church\nD: show\nE: arena",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where audiences typically gather to watch events where a ball might be involved.",
    "A movie theater generally does not host events that involve balls being thrown or struck, so it is less likely.",
    "Churches usually do not involve balls in their activities, so that option can also be disregarded.",
    "\"Show\" is a vague term, but it typically does not imply sports or ball games, making it less probable as well.",
    "A stadium is usually associated with sports events, where balls are thrown or hit, making it a likely candidate.",
    "An arena also could host similar sports events, so it remains a potential answer.",
    "Now I will compare the two possible venues: stadium and arena.",
    "While both could have a ball causing a spectator to get struck, stadium is more commonly associated with outdoor sports, and arena can include various indoor sports and events.",
    "However, the term \"stadium\" is usually directly tied to ball games (like football, baseball, and soccer), which strengthens its case.",
    "Consequently, I will conclude that the most likely place for an audience to be struck by a ball is a stadium."
