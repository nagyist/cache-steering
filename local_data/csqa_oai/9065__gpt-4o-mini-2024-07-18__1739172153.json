    "The question asks for the reason a person is getting married.",
    "Consider the choices provided and their relevance to marriage.",
    "Choice A (graduation) does not correlate with getting married, as graduation is an educational milestone, not a reason for marriage.",
    "Choice B (fear death) might cause someone to seek companionship, but it is not a conventional reason for marriage that is celebrated.",
    "Choice C (promise to do) can relate to marriage, as marriage often involves promises or vows made between partners to support one another.",
    "Choice D (gain weight) is an unrelated and negative reason and does not generally connect with the purpose of marriage.",
    "Choice E (catch cold) is also irrelevant to the reasons for marriage.",
    "After analyzing the options, the most fitting choice related to the act of getting married is choice C, as marriage typically involves a promise or commitment."
