  "steps": [
    "To determine where a long, dark passageway might typically be found, I will consider each of the options given.",
    "A cave is naturally known for its long and dark passageways due to the lack of natural light and the geological formations within it.",
    "A hotel may have hallways, but they are generally well lit and designed for comfort, which does not align with being dark.",
    "A bathroom may have a short passage or hallway but lacks the significance of being a long, dark passageway.",
    "An airport may have long corridors, but these are typically well-lit, busy, and designed for navigation.",
    "A house may have hallways, but they are usually lit as well and do not fit the description of being long and dark.",
    "Comparing the options, a cave is the only location that is associated with being long and dark as a characteristic of its environment.",
    "Double-checking: a cave has darkness because it is underground or covered, while other locations are more social and lit."
