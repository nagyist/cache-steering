  "query": "Question: He was her uncle, and she was his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: aunty\nB: niece\nC: boy\nD: older generation\nE: aunts house",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase states \"He was her uncle\", indicating a familial relationship.",
    "If he is her uncle, then she must be related to him through a sibling of one of his parents.",
    "Typically, an uncle is the brother of one's parent or the husband of one's aunt.",
    "If we consider the common relationships, an uncle typically has a niece, who is the daughter of his sibling.",
    "Since there is only one direct familial term that describes the relationship of a child to their uncle, it must be \"niece\".",
    "Now examining the options provided:\n- A: aunty \u2013 this is not correct as an aunty would refer to an aunt, not a niece.\n- B: niece \u2013 this fits as she is the niece of her uncle.\n- C: boy \u2013 this is incorrect as it does not denote a familial relationship.\n- D: older generation \u2013 too vague and not applicable in this context.\n- E: aunts house \u2013 this is not a person and irrelevant to the relationship.",
    "The only option that accurately represents the relationship of \"her uncle\" and \"she\" is \"niece\"."
