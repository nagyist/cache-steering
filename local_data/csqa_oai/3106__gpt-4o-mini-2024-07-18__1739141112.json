  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the meaning of \"living life.\" It typically refers to the essential elements or experiences that contribute to one's existence and well-being.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the choices provided to see which aligns best with the fundamental concept of living life.",
    "Choice A, \"breathe,\" is essential for life itself. Without breathing, a person cannot survive, making this choice very significant.",
    "Choice B, \"learning,\" is important for personal growth and development. It enriches our experiences and helps us navigate life.",
    "Choice C, \"sorrow,\" while a part of the human experience, is not something one needs in order to live life; it is rather a potential emotional state.",
    "Choice D, \"wear a mullet,\" is merely a hairstyle and does not have any substantial relevance to the basic requirements of living life.",
    "Choice E, \"marriage,\" is a social construct and, while it can contribute to a fulfilling life for some, is not necessary for everyone.",
    "Now, comparing A and B, breathing is a fundamental biological necessity, whereas learning, while valuable, is not as critical for mere survival.",
    "Thus, in the context of essential requirements for living life, choice A (breathe) stands out as the most crucial."
