  "query": "Question: If one needed peas and shopped local, where might they go?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: fridge\nC: grocery store\nD: farmer's market\nE: freezer",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where one might go to buy peas locally, we can first analyze the options provided.",
    "Option A, \"supermarket,\" is a possibility, but it is typically more of a larger retail outlet rather than a purely local option.",
    "Option B, \"fridge,\" is not applicable since it refers to a storage space for already purchased items, not a place to shop.",
    "Option C, \"grocery store,\" is a local shop that typically sells produce, including peas. This could be a good option.",
    "Option D, \"farmer's market,\" usually occurs on specific days and often features local growers selling fresh produce, including peas. This is also a viable option for local sourcing.",
    "Lastly, option E, \"freezer,\" is similar to the fridge; it's not a shopping location but a place to store items.",
    "Between the grocery store and the farmer's market, both options align with the idea of shopping local for peas.",
    "However, the farmer's market is often considered more local because it directly involves local producers and fresh farming goods.",
    "In summary, while both the grocery store and the farmer's market are options for purchasing peas locally, the farmer's market specifically emphasizes local sourcing."
