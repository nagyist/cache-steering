  "query": "Question: HOw do you carry potatos home?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: grocery bag\nC: restaurants\nD: farmer's market\nE: bushel basket",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what is being asked: the question is about how to carry potatoes home.",
    "Next, consider the common methods or containers used to transport potatoes from the store or market to home.",
    "Analyze each of the choices provided: \n- A: grocery store - This is where you buy potatoes, not a method of carrying them.\n- B: grocery bag - This is a practical option for carrying potatoes, as it is designed for that purpose.\n- C: restaurants - This seems unrelated, as restaurants do not serve as a means to carry potatoes home.\n- D: farmer's market - Similar to a grocery store; it's a place to buy potatoes but not a method to carry them.\n- E: bushel basket - This could also be used to carry potatoes, especially in larger quantities.",
    "Now, evaluate the practicality of the two relevant options: a grocery bag is usually more common for everyday purchases, while a bushel basket is more specialized and not typically used for small amounts.",
    "Consider the average person's experience: most people use grocery bags when shopping for items like potatoes rather than bushel baskets, which are less common and can be bulky.",
    "Think about the context from which the transportation method is derived: in modern grocery shopping, a grocery bag is ubiquitous and suitable for a variety of items, including potatoes.",
    "Check if other choices fit: grocery store, restaurants, and farmer's market do not address the method of carrying but are locations instead.",
    "Final consensus: since a grocery bag is the most typical answer for carrying groceries, including potatoes, it stands out as the best choice."
