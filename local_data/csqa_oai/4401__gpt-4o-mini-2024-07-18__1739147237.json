  "steps": [
    "The question mentions passing through a ticket booth to ride a roller coaster, which implies an attraction or event that requires an admission fee.",
    "A roller coaster is commonly associated with amusement parks and fairs, where rides are a central feature.",
    "Let's examine the choices: A train station typically does not have a roller coaster; it is a transportation hub.",
    "A venue might refer to a place for entertainment or events, but it does not specifically imply rides like a roller coaster.",
    "A bank does not provide amusement rides or require passing through a ticket booth for entertainment, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "Fairs often feature rides, similar to amusement parks, but they are typically temporary and may not be permanent like roller coasters.",
    "Considering the permanence and scale of a roller coaster, amusement parks are designed specifically for rides, making it a more logical answer.",
    "While fairs do have rides, the specific mention of a roller coaster aligns more closely with the offerings of an amusement park.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting choice that aligns with passing through a ticket booth to access a roller coaster is an amusement park."
