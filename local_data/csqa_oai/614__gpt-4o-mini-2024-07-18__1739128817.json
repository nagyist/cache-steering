  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a person has to walk downstairs to get a tool.",
    "Walking downstairs typically implies that the tool is located in a lower level than the starting point, such as in a house or building with multiple levels.",
    "Among the given options, a basement is a common place in homes that requires walking downstairs to access.",
    "A garage could potentially be on the same level as the home or on an upper level, but it often serves as a storage area for tools as well. However, it does not specifically require going downstairs.",
    "A hardware store, repair shop, and library are all facilities that would not typically require walking downstairs from a home environment to access tools.",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer that involves a place where tools are stored and would require walking downstairs is the basement."
