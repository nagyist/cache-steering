  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the effects that dust can have on a person's health and well-being during housework.",
    "I remember that inhaling dust can lead to respiratory issues or irritation in some individuals.",
    "Next, I think about the symptoms that can result from exposure to dust, like headaches or fatigue.",
    "I analyze the choices given: A (arguments) seems unlikely to be a direct consequence of dust.",
    "B (dust poisoning) isn't a commonly recognized term; while excessive exposure to certain types of dust could be harmful, \"dust poisoning\" is not a standard medical term.",
    "C (headache) is often experienced by individuals exposed to dust, as it can cause sinus irritation and strain.",
    "D (exhaustion) can also occur as cleaning can be physically demanding, but is not specifically linked to dust itself.",
    "E (boredom) is subjective and not a direct effect of dust exposure during housework.",
