  "steps": [
    "The janitor needs to clean up the mess made by the student. A bucket of sawdust is typically stored in a place where cleaning supplies are kept.",
    "A utility closet is a common place for maintenance and janitorial supplies, including cleaning materials like sawdust.",
    "A well is primarily associated with water storage or extraction, which is not relevant to the storage of cleaning supplies.",
    "A garden shed is more commonly used for outdoor tools and gardening supplies, rather than for janitorial supplies.",
    "A pantry is typically used for food storage, which is not related to cleaning activities or supplies.",
    "A cupboard could store various items but isn't specifically dedicated to janitorial equipment like a utility closet would be.",
    "Considering the context of a school cafeteria and cleanliness, the most logical location for the janitor to retrieve sawdust would be the utility closet.",
    "I will compare the option of the utility closet with the other options to confirm that it makes the most sense.",
    "The other options (well, garden shed, pantry, and cupboard) do not align with the needs of a janitor in a cafeteria setting for cleaning supplies, reinforcing that the utility closet is the most appropriate answer."
