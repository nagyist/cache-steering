  "steps": [
    "The question asks what the contestants had to wait for their chance to do on American Idol.",
    "American Idol is a platform primarily focused on singing talents, where contestants audition by performing songs.",
    "The primary activity that contestants participate in during the show is to sing for the judges and the audience.",
    "While waiting, contestants may also be engaged in activities like having patience, getting ready, or standing in line, but these are not the main focus of the competition.",
    "Among the choices, \"sing\" directly relates to the primary function of the contestants on the show.",
    "\"Have patience\" and \"get ready\" are more about the contestants' mindset or preparation rather than an action they do.",
    "\"Stand in line\" and \"get in line\" indicate physical arrangements of the contestants but do not capture the essence of what they are waiting for.",
    "After evaluating all choices, it's clear that \"sing\" aligns best with the main activity on American Idol."
