  "query": "Question: An island off the coast of of California is located where?\n\nChoices:\nA: pacific ocean\nB: mississippi river\nC: body of water\nD: earth\nE: middle of ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the geographic context of California. It is situated on the west coast of the United States.",
    "Next, note that California has a coastline along the Pacific Ocean, which is a major body of water on the western side of North America.",
    "An island, by definition, is a piece of land surrounded by water. Therefore, an island off the coast of California must be in a body of water.",
    "The specific body of water that is adjacent to California is predominantly the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Recognizing that \u201coff the coast of California\u201d implies a coastal relationship, the island would be directly in the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Now evaluate the provided answer choices based on this geographic conclusion.",
    "Choice A mentions the \"Pacific Ocean\" directly, which is accurate as it aligns with the location of California.",
    "Choice B, the \"Mississippi River\", is not relevant as it is located far from California and is not an ocean.",
    "Choice C refers to a \"body of water\", which is also true but is less specific than identifying the actual water body involved.",
    "Choice D, \"earth,\" is too broad, as it encompasses all geographic locations, not just the specific context of California.",
    "Choice E states \"middle of ocean,\" which is not geographically precise and mischaracterizes the relationship of the island to California.",
    "Upon comparison, while both A and C are true, choice A (Pacific Ocean) provides the most precise and specific answer in context."
