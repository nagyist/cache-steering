  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the child was scorned for scratching the plate. This indicates that the object causing the scratch is likely something with a harder or sharper surface.",
    "Let's analyze the proposed choices for their likelihood of scratching a plate.",
    "A cup is typically made of ceramic or glass, which is not likely to scratch a plate.",
    "A spoon, usually made of metal or plastic, can potentially scratch a plate, but its rounded shape generally makes it less likely to do so compared to a sharper object.",
    "A fork has tines that are pointed and sharp relative to other utensils. This makes it a strong candidate for scratching a plate.",
    "A saucer, being a small plate, wouldn\u2019t cause the damage but could possibly be scratched if it were being placed onto the plate, rather than being the tool causing the scratch.",
    "A bowl, similar to a cup, is also not likely to scratch a plate.",
    "From the reasoning above, the most plausible object that could scratch the plate is a fork, as it has sharp ends that could easily make scratches."
