  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a northern country where one might find a bald eagle preserve.",
    "Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada.",
    "From the choices given, both 'A: canada' and 'E: in washington' pertain to locations where bald eagles are known to inhabit and where preserves might exist.",
    "Considering 'A: canada', there are locations in Canada, especially in British Columbia and other northern areas, where preserves for bald eagles exist.",
    "Now evaluating 'E: in washington', this reference is to a U.S. state, not a country. While Washington state has bald eagle preserves, the question specifies a \"northern country.\"",
    "Choices B (Colorado), C (mountain top), and D (Utah) are U.S. locations or general terms and don't qualify as northern countries.",
    "Therefore, the only option that correctly identifies a northern country with known bald eagle habitats is 'A: canada'."
