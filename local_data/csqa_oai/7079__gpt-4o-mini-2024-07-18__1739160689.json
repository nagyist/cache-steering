  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the context in which audiences typically cheer for athletes.",
    "Athletes perform in competitive settings where spectators are gathered, such as stadiums or arenas.",
    "The options provided include various locations: a sporting event, movie theater, theatre, church, and concert.",
    "A \"sporting event\" is explicitly an event where athletic competitions take place, and cheering is common.",
    "In a \"movie theater,\" audiences do not cheer for the actors; they usually remain quiet and watch the film.",
    "A \"theatre\" typically refers to a place for performing arts, where applause rather than cheering occurs, and it's not specific to athletes.",
    "A \"church\" is a place of worship, where audiences do not cheer but often engage in silence or singing.",
    "A \"concert\" involves musicians performing, and while there can be applause and cheering, it does not specifically relate to athletes.",
    "Comparing these options, the most appropriate location where audiences cheer for athletes is clearly a \"sporting event.\"",
    "Therefore, I will select the answer that corresponds to where audiences cheer for athletes."
