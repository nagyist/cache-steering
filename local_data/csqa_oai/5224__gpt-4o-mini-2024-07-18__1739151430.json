    "The Blue Ridge Mountains are a mountain range that is part of the larger Appalachian Mountains.",
    "Roanoke City is located in the state of Virginia.",
    "I need to identify which of the given choices corresponds to the location of Roanoke City with respect to the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
    "The Blue Ridge Mountains extend through several states, but I need to confirm if they are predominantly in Virginia.",
    "The Blue Ridge Mountains do pass through Virginia, and in fact, some prominent areas in these mountains, including Roanoke, are located in Virginia.",
    "The options provided are: A: Appalachians, B: North Carolina, C: Virginia, D: Pennsylvania, and E: Montana.",
    "Although the Appalachians are the larger mountain range that includes the Blue Ridge, they do not specify the state.",
    "North Carolina lies adjacent to the Blue Ridge Mountains, too, but Roanoke City is not located there.",
    "Pennsylvania and Montana are far removed from the Blue Ridge Mountains, making them irrelevant in this context.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer indicating the state where Roanoke City and the Blue Ridge Mountains are located is Virginia."
