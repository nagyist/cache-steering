  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context of where fire extinguishers are typically required by safety laws.",
    "I know that fire safety regulations can vary by location, but there are common places where fire extinguishers are mandated.",
    "For most public safety regulations, public buildings are often required to have fire extinguishers due to the higher occupancy and potential fire hazards.",
    "Businesses may also be required to have fire extinguishers, but the requirement can depend on the type of business and the local regulations.",
    "Houses generally do not have the same strict requirements as businesses or public buildings but having one is often recommended.",
    "Vehicles may be required to have fire extinguishers in certain situations, but this is not universally mandated by law.",
    "In a chemistry lab, due to the nature of chemicals and potential fire hazards, fire extinguishers are often required.",
    "To narrow it down, I consider the option of \"public building.\" Public buildings are typically under strict safety regulations pertaining to fire safety, including the necessity for fire extinguishers.",
    "Comparing \"public building\" with the other options, it remains the most definitive answer related to the law concerning fire extinguishers and safety."
