  "query": "Question: If I have to keep track of how much oxygen there is, where am I?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: water\nC: earth\nD: space shuttle\nE: tunnel",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that I need to track how much oxygen there is. This implies that the environment I am in should contain or rely on oxygen.",
    "Air is a mixture of gases that includes oxygen, which is essential for human and animal life. Therefore, monitoring oxygen levels in this context is significant.",
    "Water, while it does contain dissolved oxygen, is not a place where one typically tracks oxygen levels for air breathing purposes, so it is less relevant for this question.",
    "The Earth as a whole has a balance of oxygen but is a broad term; it may not necessarily imply the need for immediate tracking.",
    "In a space shuttle, tracking oxygen levels is critical since it resides in an environment where the air supply must be controlled artificially.",
    "A tunnel might require monitoring for air quality but is less likely to be a primary focus compared to a more controlled environment like a space shuttle.",
    "Given all choices, the space shuttle is the most specific context where tracking oxygen levels is crucial for survival.",
    "Therefore, the choice that aligns most closely with the necessity to track oxygen levels accurately is D, space shuttle."
