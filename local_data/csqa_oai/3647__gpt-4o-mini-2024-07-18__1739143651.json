  "query": "Question: How can you see an extreme closeup of a potato?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: optical device\nC: pantry\nD: garden patch\nE: vegetable stew",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the locations or scenarios where a potato might be found. Options include a grocery store, pantry, garden patch, or in a vegetable stew.",
    "Next, think about how one might view a potato up close. The options like grocery store and pantry involve seeing potatoes in their normal state, but do not imply how to get an extreme closeup.",
    "Consider the option of using an optical device. An optical device like a microscope or camera can provide a detailed and extreme closeup view of a potato.",
    "Evaluate the other options: the pantry may hold potatoes but does not help in giving an extreme closeup. The garden patch offers potatoes but also doesn't facilitate a closeup view. A vegetable stew contains potatoes but in a mashed or cooked state, which wouldn\u2019t yield a clear closeup.",
    "Assess the importance of an optical device in providing clarity and detail necessary for an extreme closeup of a potato, which none of the other options provide effectively.",
    "Look at the options again to confirm: A closeup involves an intentional act of zooming in, which only an optical device can accomplish among the choices given.",
    "Final consideration is that while the pantry, garden patch, and grocery store can have potatoes, they do not assist in viewing them up close compared to an optical device."
