  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of each option and where stars are typically visible from.",
    "Option A, \"space shuttle,\" is a place above the Earth where one can see stars without atmospheric interference.",
    "Option B, \"building,\" may offer some sight of stars, but visibility is often limited by city lights and reflections.",
    "Option C, \"on the lawn,\" does not literally mean seeing stars; it suggests seeing them in the sky while being on the grass.",
    "Option D, \"friend's house,\" could allow for some visibility of stars depending on the location and lighting, but it is not guaranteed.",
    "Option E, \"wall,\" suggests an indoor option where stars would be depicted (like a mural), not an actual sighting.",
    "Evaluate that the best place to see stars directly out of a window is likely in a situation where there are minimal obstructions and light pollution.",
    "The best context for seeing stars directly, considering all options, is in space, as implied in option A.",
    "Since option A is the only choice explicitly aligned with seeing stars outside a window, it stands out as the most suitable answer."
