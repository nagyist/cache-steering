    "When meeting a friend over coffee, it is common to engage in conversation.",
    "Talking is a primary activity that typically takes place during a coffee meeting with a friend.",
    "Excitement could occur when meeting a friend, but it is usually secondary to the actual act of talking.",
    "Joy can also be a feeling experienced during the meeting, but it is not the main action associated with meeting for coffee.",
    "Abuse is an unlikely action when meeting a friend for a social encounter over coffee.",
    "Panic does not usually describe a typical social interaction, especially in the context of meeting a friend for coffee.",
    "From the choices given, talking stands out as the most direct and relevant activity that occurs during such a meeting.",
