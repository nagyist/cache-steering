  "query": "Question: where do you keep a tourniquet?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospital\nB: ambulance\nC: pocket\nD: emergency kit\nE: applying even pressure",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the primary role of a tourniquet, which is to stop severe bleeding from a limb in emergencies.",
    "Consider locations where a tourniquet is typically stored and can be accessed quickly in an emergency situation.",
    "Analyze the options provided: \n- A: hospital - While a hospital does have tourniquets, they are not kept on a person for immediate use.\n- B: ambulance - Ambulances are equipped with medical supplies including tourniquets, making them a reasonable option.\n- C: pocket - While a tourniquet could fit in a pocket, it is not a standard or practical place to keep one.\n- D: emergency kit - Tourniquets are commonly included in emergency kits, making this a strong option.\n- E: applying even pressure - This refers to a method rather than a location for storing a tourniquet.",
    "Evaluate the options based on context: for immediate access, both the ambulance and emergency kit make sense, but the emergency kit is typically accessible during various emergencies outside of professional medical vehicles.",
    "Recognize that while tourniquets can be stored in hospitals and ambulances, the best locations for personal carry would lean towards a pocket or emergency kit.",
    "Decide which of these two (pocket or emergency kit) is the more standard and practical recommendation for keeping a tourniquet readily available.",
    "Conclude that an emergency kit is a common place to store a tourniquet for accessibility in emergency situations, while a pocket is less practical."
