  "steps": [
    "The question asks about little cameras in cars and what they made easier.",
    "I need to think about the common functionalities of little cameras in vehicles.",
    "One primary function of cameras in cars is for safety and assistance during driving, particularly while reversing or parking.",
    "The functionality that is most widely associated with cameras in cars is backing up or reversing.",
    "The other answer choices such as technical difficulties, heat up, carpooler, and set off do not seem relevant to the functions of little cameras in cars.",
    "'Carpooler' refers to individuals sharing a ride, which doesn\u2019t relate to camera functions.",
    "'Set off' may imply setting off a device or alarm, which is not a primary task of car cameras.",
    "'Technical difficulties' does not indicate a function of car cameras; rather, it describes problems that could arise.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the most logical choice is that little cameras in cars made it easier to \"back up.\""
