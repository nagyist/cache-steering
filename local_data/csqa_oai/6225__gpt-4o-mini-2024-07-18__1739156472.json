  "query": "Question: John prepared a written sex contract.  It wouldn't hold up in court, but it gave him piece of mind, and he had it signed before he allowed his newest BDSM partner to perform what on him?\n\nChoices:\nA: torture\nB: verbal\nC: oral\nD: unwritten\nE: aforewritten",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about a written sex contract that John prepared with a BDSM partner. The term \"BDSM\" suggests a focus on bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism practices.",
    "The phrase \"perform what on him\" implies a specific action or type of interaction that typically occurs in BDSM scenarios.",
    "Among the options, \"torture\" might seem relevant in a BDSM context, but it's a broad term that doesn\u2019t fit as neatly into the typical activities that one might contract for consensually.",
    "\"Verbal\" could refer to verbal consent or communication, but this doesn't align with the phrase about performing rather than discussing or consenting.",
    "While \"unwritten\" and \"aforewritten\" are not actions, they relate to the nature of the contract rather than the activity itself, making them unsuitable answers.",
    "\"Oral\" specifically pertains to oral sex, which is a defined act within sexual contexts, especially in BDSM relationships where negotiated consent is critical.",
    "Comparing all options, \"oral\" stands out as the most likely action to be performed following a consent-based contract, aligned with BDSM practices.",
    "Therefore, the answer should indicate the type of act that John had his partner perform on him, which is most clearly represented by \"oral.\""
