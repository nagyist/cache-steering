  "query": "Question: The swimming pool couln't be refilled due to drought regulations, where was it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: ymca\nB: california\nC: park\nD: first floor\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify which options refer to a specific location. The choices presented include places such as ymca, california, park, first floor, and school.",
    "Evaluate the options in terms of stage and relevance of location related to a swimming pool. A swimming pool typically belongs to a facility rather than a specific floor or a state.",
    "Out of the options, ymca, park, and school are places where swimming pools can be commonly located. California, while a state, doesn\u2019t directly specify a location for a swimming pool, and first floor implies a level in a building but not the building itself.",
    "Now consider the nature of the options: ymca is known for recreational facilities that often include swimming pools, school may also have swimming pools, while a park could include a community pool.",
    "Next, analyze environmental factors; the question mentions drought regulations, suggesting an outdoor or public swimming pool situation may be more affected. Typically, parks and schools may face such regulations, but ymca pools might be less impacted due to their operational nature.",
    "California is known for droughts, indicating that the swimming pool's location might be influenced by that situation. This essentially relates back to the earlier options since California could generally restrict water use.",
    "Among ymca, park, and school, I lean towards park as many public pools in parks often face restrictions due to drought regulations.",
    "Thus, weighing all aspects, including the provisions of swimming pools in dry regions and their typical locations, the conclusion follows."
