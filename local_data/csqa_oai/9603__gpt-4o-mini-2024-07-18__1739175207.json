  "query": "Question: Computers with audio cards can do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: do work\nB: produce sound\nC: follow instructions\nD: advance knowledge\nE: solve problems",
  "steps": [
    "First, we understand that an audio card in a computer is a component responsible for processing audio signals.",
    "Next, we consider the main function of an audio card, which is to convert digital audio data into analog signals to produce sound.",
    "Then, we analyze the choices provided to see which aligns with the capabilities of an audio card.",
    "Option A (\"do work\") is very broad and does not specifically relate to the function of an audio card.",
    "Option B (\"produce sound\") directly relates to the audio card's primary function\u2014processing audio signals to create sound.",
    "Option C (\"follow instructions\") refers more to the overall computing capability rather than the specific function of the audio card.",
    "Option D (\"advance knowledge\") does not make sense in the context of an audio card\u2019s function.",
    "Option E (\"solve problems\") is also too general and not specific to the audio card's capabilities.",
    "Given this analysis, the most appropriate answer based on the function of audio cards is Option B."
