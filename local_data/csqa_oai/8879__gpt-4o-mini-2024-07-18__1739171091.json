  "query": "Question: The man began to cogitate about cogitating, being able to do this meant he clearly he must what?\n\nChoices:\nA: obsessive compulsive\nB: mad\nC: perambulate\nD: have brain\nE: sit quietly",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the concept of \"cogitating,\" which means to think deeply or reflect on something.",
    "If a man is cogitating about cogitating, it implies a level of self-awareness and critical thinking regarding his thought processes.",
    "For someone to engage in such complex thinking, they must possess the ability to think in higher cognitive functions.",
    "This suggests that he must have a functioning brain capable of thought.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate the answer choices:",
    "Option A (obsessive compulsive) doesn\u2019t necessarily relate to cogitating about cogitating as it implies a disorder rather than a thinking capability.",
    "Option B (mad) implies irrationality or insanity, which does not align with the act of cogitating.",
    "Option C (perambulate) means to walk or move around, which is unrelated to the mental act of thinking.",
    "Option D (have brain) fits perfectly, as having a brain is a requisite for engaging in cogitation.",
    "Option E (sit quietly) could be a conducive state for cogitation but does not directly imply the capability to cogitate itself.",
    "After analyzing all options, the most logical conclusion is that to cogitate about cogitating, one must at least have a functioning brain."
