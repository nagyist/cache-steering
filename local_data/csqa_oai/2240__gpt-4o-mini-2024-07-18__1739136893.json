  "query": "Question: People of faith believe what is a vessel for the soul?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: head\nC: port\nD: human body\nE: streets",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which refers to people of faith and their beliefs surrounding the soul.",
    "Analyze which option may metaphorically or literally represent a vessel for the soul.",
    "Consider the meanings of each option: \n- A: ocean typically refers to a large body of water, not a vessel.\n- B: head can imply a physical feature but is not traditionally viewed as a vessel for the soul.\n- C: port suggests a place where vessels dock, which is metaphorical but not closely aligned with typical body-and-soul language.\n- D: human body is commonly recognized as the vessel for the soul in many beliefs.\n- E: streets are pathways and do not embody the concept of a vessel.",
    "From previous interpretations, it seems that the human body is the longest established belief as the container for the soul across various faiths and philosophies.",
    "Reaffirm that in many religious and cultural contexts, the human body is seen as the physical form that carries or houses the soul, confirming option D.",
    "Cross-check: does any other option more aptly capture the idea of a vessel?\n- Ocean and streets are not relevant in this context.\n- Head may represent thought but does not encapsulate the soul. \n- Port, while symbolic, is less aligned than the human body.",
    "Conclude that the most fitting answer, supporting a common belief among people of faith, is indeed the human body as a vessel for the soul."
