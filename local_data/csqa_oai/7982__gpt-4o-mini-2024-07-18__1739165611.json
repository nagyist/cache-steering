  "query": "Question: Sarah expected to a fortune on her new business.  However, she ended up going broke because no one could get money to buy.  What might her business have been?\n\nChoices:\nA: bunkrupt\nB: real estate\nC: stock market\nD: bank\nE: treasure chest",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sarah expected to make a fortune from her new business but ended up going broke because no one could afford to buy from her. This suggests that her business depended on customers having money to purchase goods or services.",
    "Analyzing the options: \n- A: \"bunkrupt\" isn't a business type; it refers to being unable to pay debts.\n- B: \"real estate\" requires significant investment and clientele who can afford to buy properties, which could lead to bankruptcy if no one is able to invest.\n- C: \"stock market\" involves trading shares and investment, but would not typically lead to going broke because of lack of consumer purchasing power directly, as it's more about investments rather than sales.\n- D: \"bank\" depends on financial transactions and lending; if a bank goes broke, it's typically due to mismanagement rather than a lack of sales.\n- E: \"treasure chest\" is not a realistic business type but rather an item or concept that does not require customers to buy.",
    "Identifying which option aligns best with the reasoning that no one could get money to buy suggests a connection to a high-ticket item or service. Real estate (B) fits this circumstance as it involves large investments and could lead to problems in sales in a financially stressed environment.",
    "Considering the real estate market can collapse when individuals lack finances makes option B the most coherent with Sarah's situation of going broke due to customers not being able to afford purchases.",
    "Comparing real estate (B) with other options indicates that stock market and bank don't directly fit with the purchasing dependency described."
