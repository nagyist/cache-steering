  "query": "Question: Where would you go if you didn't feel like baking a cake yourself?\n\nChoices:\nA: theater\nB: refrigerator\nC: bakery\nD: grocery store\nE: oven",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the context of the question, which is about finding an alternative to baking a cake at home.",
    "Baking a cake involves preparing ingredients and using an oven, so I want to consider places where I could obtain a cake without needing to do the baking myself.",
    "The choices given include options that may or may not have cakes readily available for purchase.",
    "Option A, the theater, typically does not sell cakes, so this is unlikely to be a good choice.",
    "Option B, the refrigerator, is where a cake might be stored once it's baked, but it does not provide a solution to the initial problem of obtaining a cake.",
    "Option C, the bakery, is a specialized place where cakes are made and sold, thus it directly addresses the need for purchasing a cake without baking.",
    "Option D, the grocery store, often has cakes available, but not specialty cakes like those found in a bakery. While this is an option, it may not guarantee the same quality or variety as a bakery.",
    "Option E, the oven, again refers to the act of baking, rather than buying. Thus, it is irrelevant in the context of avoiding baking.",
    "Given the need for a cake without the effort of baking it myself, the bakery stands out as the best choice."
