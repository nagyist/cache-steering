  "query": "Question: Litter collects where when it's thrown out of a car?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: highways\nC: roadsides\nD: park\nE: street corner",
  "steps": [
    "Litter is commonly discarded by individuals while traveling in vehicles, such as cars.",
    "When litter is thrown out of a car, it lands in the immediate vicinity of the car's path.",
    "The item has no control over its destination and will fall wherever the force of gravity takes it.",
    "Common places for litter to collect when thrown from a moving vehicle include areas near roadways.",
    "Considering the options, 'ground' is too vague as it could apply to any surface; it does not specify the context of litter.",
    "'Highways' could be a possible location, but it refers more to more significant roadways rather than a specific area of litter collection.",
    "'Roadsides' specifically refers to the edges of roads where litter is likely to accumulate after being thrown from a car.",
    "'Parks' are designated recreational spaces where litter would not be thrown from vehicles generally.",
    "'Street corner' is also not a specific collection area for litter thrown from a car; it is too localized.",
    "The most appropriate and specific choice that describes where litter collects when thrown out of a car would be 'roadsides.'"
