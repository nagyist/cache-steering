  "query": "Question: Where does a dog go to pee?\n\nChoices:\nA: guard house\nB: affection\nC: walked\nD: inside the house\nE: go outside",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical behavior of dogs when they need to relieve themselves. They usually seek an appropriate place to go.",
    "Next, analyze the options given. \"Guard house\" (A) does not typically represent a location for a dog to relieve itself.",
    "Now, look at \"affection\" (B). This option is unrelated to where a dog needs to pee. It represents a feeling rather than a physical location.",
    "Consider \"walked\" (C). While going for a walk can lead to a dog relieving itself, it is not a direct answer about the location itself.",
    "Next, evaluate \"inside the house\" (D). Many dogs are trained to go inside the house, particularly if they are using pads, but it is not the most common or preferred choice for most dogs.",
    "Finally, assess \"go outside\" (E). This option is the most logical, as dogs are typically taken outside for bathroom breaks.",
    "With an external environment typically preferred for finding a place to relieve themselves, \"go outside\" (E) is both the most common and practical choice."
