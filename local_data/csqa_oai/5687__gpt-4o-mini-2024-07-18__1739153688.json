  "query": "Question: A cow farm has quite the smell, that's why they tend to be located in a remote what?\n\nChoices:\nA: corral\nB: nursery rhyme\nC: northern california\nD: rural area\nE: barnyard",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that a cow farm has a notable smell, which is a characteristic associated with farming, particularly with livestock. This implies that such farms are often not located near populated areas to avoid inconveniencing residents with the odor.",
    "Next, let's consider the options provided to determine where a cow farm would typically be found.",
    "Option A, \"corral,\" refers to a fenced area for livestock and does not specifically indicate a remote location.",
    "Option B, \"nursery rhyme,\" is irrelevant to the context of physical locations for a cow farm.",
    "Option C, \"northern california,\" specifies a geographic area but does not universally apply to cow farms, as they can be found in many places.",
    "Option D, \"rural area,\" refers to regions that are away from urban centers and are suitable for farms due to less population density and reduced nuisance from smells.",
    "Option E, \"barnyard,\" describes a farm area where animals are kept but not necessarily a remote location; it also does not align with the need for distance from populations.",
    "Given that the smell is a critical factor in determining the location of a cow farm, the most fitting choice is the one that explicitly indicates a distant and less populated environment.",
    "Among the options, \"rural area\" explicitly indicates a remote setting, which aligns with the expectations for cow farms."
