  "query": "Question: John needs a screwdriver to take the old blade off of his lawnmower.  Where does John look for his screwdriver?\n\nChoices:\nA: toolkit\nB: tool belt\nC: handyman\nD: bar\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the most common place where tools, including screwdrivers, are typically stored at home.",
    "A toolkit is often a designated place for storing various tools, including screwdrivers, wrenches, and pliers.",
    "A tool belt is worn for convenience while working, but it may not contain all of the tools John needs, especially if it's not on him at the moment.",
    "A handyman refers to a person who does repairs; John is not looking for a person but rather for his screwdriver.",
    "A bar is not a logical place to find tools; it is primarily a place for drinks and socializing.",
    "A repair shop may have tools available, but John would probably not go there to find his own screwdriver; rather, that is where one might go to obtain repairs or professional help.",
    "Given the options provided and the context of John finding his own tools, the most reasonable place for John to look is his toolkit."
