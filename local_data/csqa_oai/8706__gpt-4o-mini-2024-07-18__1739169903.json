  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what a \"passageway\" means. A passageway is typically a path or route that allows movement between different areas.",
    "Next, we need to evaluate the choices given. We are looking for a location where a passageway is mainly used by visitors.",
    "Choice A, \"building\" is too general; it's hard to specify what type of building and if visitors would predominantly use the passageway.",
    "Choice B, \"hotel,\" suggests that visitors or guests typically move through passageways like lobbies or hallways. It\u2019s a strong candidate since hotels are designed for visitor traffic.",
    "Choice C, \"cave,\" while it does have passageways, they are not often associated with visitors in the same way that hotels are. Caves can have guided tours, but they are not primarily built for visitor use.",
    "Choice D, \"house,\" usually has passageways used by residents rather than visitors, making it less relevant for this question.",
    "Choice E, \"office,\" suggests passageways used primarily by employees rather than visitors, as offices are more related to permanent staff and work environments.",
    "Now, comparing these choices, \"hotel\" stands out as the location that is specifically designed for visitors to use passageways regularly.",
    "To further confirm, hotels generally have extensive passageways that are essential for guests' movement, from lobbies to rooms. Other choices do not provide such clear association with visitors using passageways."
