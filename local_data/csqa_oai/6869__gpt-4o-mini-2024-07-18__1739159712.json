  "query": "Question: Where do people typically make a friend as an adult?\n\nChoices:\nA: at school\nB: neighbor's house\nC: at a bar\nD: workplace\nE: unexpected place",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where adults typically spend a significant amount of their time. This can help identify environments conducive to socializing and forming friendships.",
    "Adults often work full-time jobs, which means the workplace is a common setting for meeting new people.",
    "In workplace settings, colleagues often bond over shared tasks, projects, or breaks, making it a natural environment for forming friendships.",
    "Other options like \"at school\" are less relevant for adults, as many have completed their education. While some adults may take classes, it does not typically represent the majority of adult experiences.",
    "The suggestion of \"neighbor's house\" can be a potential but is not as common or substantial compared to other environments, particularly for those living in apartment complexes where neighbors may be less social.",
    "The choice \"at a bar\" indicates a social environment, but while people do make friends there, it\u2019s often more fleeting relationships centered around entertainment rather than deep connections.",
    "Considering \"unexpected place,\" this can happen but is less likely compared to structured environments where social interactions are more intentional, such as the workplace.",
    "After evaluating the likelihood of forming friendships across these options, the workplace stands out as the most prevalent and conducive environment for adults to make friends."
