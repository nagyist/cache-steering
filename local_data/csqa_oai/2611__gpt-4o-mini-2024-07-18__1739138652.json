  "query": "Question: All humans have what which is used to distinguish them from one another?\n\nChoices:\nA: ears\nB: feelings\nC: names\nD: naval\nE: bladders",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to identify what characteristic or attribute is commonly used to distinguish one human from another.",
    "While all humans do have ears, feelings, navels, and bladders, these attributes are not typically used to differentiate individuals in a societal context.",
    "Names, on the other hand, are explicitly used to identify and distinguish individuals from one another in everyday interactions.",
    "Thus, the critical function of names is their use as identifiers, suggesting they fit well within the context of the question.",
    "Now, looking at the other options: Ears and external physical attributes are not unique to each individual. Feelings are subjective experiences and do not provide a means of identification. Navels and bladders are physiological features that do not serve as identifiers.",
    "Considering this analysis, names clearly stand out as the primary attribute used to distinguish individuals.",
    "Therefore, the answer must be the option that represents this concept of distinction, which is \"names.\""
