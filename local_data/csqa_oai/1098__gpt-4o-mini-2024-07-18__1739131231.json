  "query": "Question: What is likely to have an enclosed shelf?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: a mortuary\nC: bookstore\nD: school building\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what an enclosed shelf typically is. An enclosed shelf is often a structure that has sides, a back, and possibly a door, which is designed to hold items securely.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each of the choices to see which one is most likely to have such a structure.",
    "Starting with option A, a cabinet is a piece of furniture that is specifically designed with shelves and often has doors, making it a strong candidate for having enclosed shelves.",
    "Looking at option B, a mortuary is primarily a location for holding the deceased and while it may have some storage, it is not commonly known for enclosed shelves.",
    "For option C, a bookstore, while it has shelving, is usually open shelving to display books for shoppers, rather than enclosed.",
    "Next, analyzing option D, a school building, is a broader term and while it could have storage areas (like cabinets) it doesn\u2019t specifically indicate the presence of enclosed shelves.",
    "Finally, for option E, a bedroom may have furniture like dressers or closets that can have enclosed shelves, but it is not the primary function of a bedroom.",
    "Upon reviewing all options, the option that most directly corresponds to having specifically designed enclosed shelves is option A, the cabinet."
