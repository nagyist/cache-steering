  "steps": [
    "The term \"gentleman\" typically refers to a man who is courteous, honorable, and well-mannered, often implying a certain level of dress and formality.",
    "Considering traditional attire associated with gentlemen, formal wear is usually expected, which includes items such as suits, blazers, and ties.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"suit\" (C) is a specific type of formal attire that a gentleman could be wearing.",
    "The other choices (A: church, B: movie, D: university, E: europe) do not directly represent clothing or formal attire. Instead, they relate to locations or contexts where a gentleman might be found, but do not specify what he would wear there.",
    "Since the only choice that explicitly represents an article of clothing that aligns with the idea of a gentleman's attire is \"suit,\" this reinforces that suits are indeed a common and expected outfit for a gentleman."
