  "query": "Question: Animals are unselfconscious and just do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: listen to each other\nB: live lives\nC: bite\nD: fight each other\nE: smile",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the nature of animals in relation to being unselfconscious.",
    "Being unselfconscious suggests that animals act according to instinct and natural behavior, rather than reflecting on their actions.",
    "I should consider what animals primarily do when acting unselfconsciously.",
    "\"Live lives\" implies a broad range of natural behaviors including eating, sleeping, socializing, and performing daily activities.",
    "Listening to each other (choice A) suggests a form of communication, but it is not comprehensive of what animals do.",
    "Biting (choice C) and fighting each other (choice D) are specific actions that do not encompass the entire existence of an animal.",
    "Smiling (choice E) is a behavior associated with humans and is not applicable to how animals behave.",
    "Given these considerations, choice B: \"live lives\" covers the concept of unselfconscious behavior broadly and meaningfully."
