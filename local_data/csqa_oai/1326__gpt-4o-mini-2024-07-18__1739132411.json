  "query": "Question: John couldn't arise from his position, so he remained at his desk. What might his position be?\n\nChoices:\nA: get down\nB: kneeling\nC: lie down\nD: lay down\nE: sitting down",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what \"arise from his position\" implies. The phrase suggests John is in a state that prevents him from getting up or moving significantly.",
    "Consider the options given and what kind of positions would logically prevent a person from arising.",
    "Option A, \"get down,\" implies a motion to lower one's position rather than staying still, which doesn't apply.",
    "Option B, \"kneeling,\" could allow for someone to arise, thus it also seems unlikely.",
    "Options C and D, \"lie down\" and \"lay down,\" suggest a flat position which could indeed prevent someone from sitting up or rising however, \"lay down\" is typically a transitive action and doesn't fit John\u2019s current state.",
    "Option E, \"sitting down,\" directly correlates to a position at a desk. If John is sitting, it would make sense that he cannot easily rise if he's either focused or stationary.",
    "Analyze Option E against the context of his desk occupation. Sitting at a desk typically conveys a state of being occupied and sometimes can imply he is engaged in an activity that keeps him there.",
    "Confirm that \"sitting down\" effectively conveys John's position, as it is a common and logical posture when at a desk that could lead to him being unable to arise."
