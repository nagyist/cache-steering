  "query": "Question: Where would you see someone typing on a keyboard?\n\nChoices:\nA: landfill\nB: finger\nC: with camera\nD: office\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what environments typically have keyboards available for typing.",
    "In an office, it is common to find computers with keyboards where people often type documents and emails.",
    "I think about other options like a landfill. It is unlikely someone would be typing on a keyboard there as it\u2019s not a conducive workspace.",
    "Next, I consider the option \"finger.\" This is not a location but rather something used to type; it doesn't make sense in the context of the question.",
    "The option \"with camera\" might refer to some scenario, but it doesn't directly relate to typing on a keyboard.",
    "The option \"music store\" is relevant for musical instruments and sound equipment rather than typing, making it an unlikely choice as well.",
    "Comparing all the choices, the most logical location where someone would be typing on a keyboard is \"office.\""
