  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the context of the sentence. The phrase \"always kept an umbrella handy for the frequent rain\" indicates that she lives in an area where rain is common.",
    "Consider the choices provided. Option A (Seattle) is known for its frequent rain, as it has a significant amount of rainy days throughout the year.",
    "Option B (rain forest) is also a plausible choice since rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, but it is less common for individuals to \"live\" in rain forests in the same sense as a city or town.",
    "Examine choice C (beach). While beaches can be near rain-prone areas, they are generally not associated with frequent rain as a primary characteristic.",
    "Review choice D (store). A store is a location rather than a living place and does not make sense in this context.",
    "Assess choice E (suitcase). A suitcase also does not represent a living location; it is an object that one carries, so it is irrelevant to the question.",
    "Compare the remaining viable options - A (Seattle) and B (rain forest). Seattle is a city where many people live, whereas a rain forest is a more obscure environment for habitation.",
    "Recognize that the most logical inference regarding where she could 'live' from the options given is Seattle, as it directly relates to a common living situation and a known environment with frequent rain.",
    "Ultimately, based on the analysis of the context and the characteristics of the options, Seattle emerges as the best answer."
