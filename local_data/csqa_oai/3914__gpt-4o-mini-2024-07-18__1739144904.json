    "The question states that she locked her key in her car again, which means she has a backup plan for such situations.",
    "The phrase \"she always kept a spare\" indicates a location where she can access the spare key easily.",
    "Option A: \"own home\" suggests she might keep a spare there, but it wouldn't be immediately accessible if she is outside the car.",
    "Option B: \"front door\" is typically not a secure place to keep a spare key, as it could be found by someone else.",
    "Option C: \"pocket\" implies she would have the spare key on her, making it easily accessible. However, it doesn\u2019t align with the context of having a spare key.",
    "Option D: \"garden gnome\" seems whimsical and unlikely; it is also a place someone might check thoroughly before finding a key.",
    "Option E: \"purse\" makes sense as it is common for individuals, especially women, to carry their essentials, including a spare key, in their purse.",
    "Based on practicality and frequency of use, it's reasonable to conclude that she would keep her spare key in her purse.",
    "By comparing the options, \"purse\" is the most logical and common choice for carrying a spare key."
