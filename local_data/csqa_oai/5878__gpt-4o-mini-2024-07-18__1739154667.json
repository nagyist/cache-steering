  "query": "Question: Joe was in California for vacation and saw a marmot  What specific place might he be?\n\nChoices:\nA: great outdoors\nB: mountainous region\nC: north america\nD: los angeles\nE: sierra nevada mountains",
  "steps": [
    "Joe is on vacation in California, which is known for its diverse landscapes, including mountains, forests, and urban areas.",
    "Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are not commonly seen in urban areas like Los Angeles.",
    "Since marmots thrive in specific habitats, particularly in higher elevations, the Sierra Nevada mountains in California is a strong candidate.",
    "The Sierra Nevada mountains are known for their wildlife, including marmots, which makes this choice likely.",
    "The choice of \"great outdoors\" is too vague and could refer to many areas, not specifically identifying California or a scenic location.",
    "The option \"mountainous region\" is also too broad and does not specifically point to a place in California where marmots are commonly seen.",
    "The option \"North America\" is accurate but too general, as it encompasses a larger area beyond just California.",
    "Los Angeles, while a city in California, is not known for marmots due to its urban environment and lack of suitable habitat.",
    "The evidence suggests that the most specific and accurate place Joe might be, where he could see a marmot in California, is the Sierra Nevada mountains."
