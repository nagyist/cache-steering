  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the view when lying on the floor of an outdoor deck while gazing upward.",
    "Being on an outdoor deck suggests that the area is likely open and outside, not enclosed like a room.",
    "When looking up from the floor of the deck, the most likely view would be the open air.",
    "Since we are outdoors, the next thing directly above would typically be the sky.",
    "Ceilings or walls are associated with indoor environments, and the outdoor deck would not have a ceiling like that of a room.",
    "The choice of 'carpet' does not apply because being outside would typically mean there isn\u2019t a carpet on a deck surface.",
    "Therefore, the only plausible choice that matches what would normally be seen when looking up from the floor of an outdoor deck is the sky."
