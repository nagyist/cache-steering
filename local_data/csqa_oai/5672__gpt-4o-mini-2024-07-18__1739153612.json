  "query": "Question: When someone doesn't have beauty they have?\n\nChoices:\nA: ugly\nB: beast\nC: waterfall\nD: waterfall\nE: ugliness",
  "steps": [
    "The question presents a scenario where someone lacks beauty, which suggests we need a term that conveys the absence or opposite of beauty.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided: \nA: ugly - this is a direct adjective describing someone who lacks beauty.\nB: beast - this doesn't relate to beauty; it typically refers to an animal or coarse person.\nC: waterfall - this doesn't relate to the concept of beauty in human terms.\nD: waterfall - this is the same as C, and still irrelevant.\nE: ugliness - this is a noun that describes the state of being ugly, which is the absence of beauty.",
    "Now, we need to determine which answer best fits the description of lacking beauty.",
    "'Ugly' is an adjective that describes someone or something that is not beautiful, but it doesn\u2019t describe the condition or state of being without beauty, which is referred to as 'ugliness'.",
    "'Ugliness' captures the concept of the absence of beauty in a noun form and fully aligns with the meaning we are looking for.",
    "Thus, while 'ugly' is a descriptor of an individual, 'ugliness' characterizes the broader state of not having beauty.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer that represents the idea of lacking beauty is 'ugliness'."
