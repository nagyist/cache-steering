  "steps": [
    "The question is about where people store their plastic cutlery.",
    "We need to consider common storage places for kitchen items, particularly plastic cutlery.",
    "A cupboard is a common storage solution for kitchen utensils and cutlery.",
    "The option 'everything' is too vague and not a specific location for storing items.",
    "The option 'own home' is too broad; while it's true people store items at home, it doesn't specify a place.",
    "A clothes closet is typically not used for kitchenware, making this option less likely.",
    "The last option, 'store,' suggests a retail or commercial location rather than a personal storage area.",
    "Considering all these points, the most logical answer refers to a specific storage location for cutlery, which is a cupboard."
