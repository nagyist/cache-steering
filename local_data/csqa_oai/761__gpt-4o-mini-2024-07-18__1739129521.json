    "The question asks what John might order at an Indian restaurant, which suggests we should consider food items typically found at such establishments.",
    "Indian cuisine is well-known for its rich variety of flavorful dishes, especially curries.",
    "The choices provided include: large city, Seattle, curry, clothing, and reservation.",
    "Options A (large city) and B (Seattle) do not relate to food; they are locations but do not align with ordering food at a restaurant.",
    "Option D (clothing) is not relevant to a dining context as it pertains to apparel, which is not something one would order at a restaurant.",
    "Option E (reservation) is related to securing a table at a restaurant, but it is not something one orders from the menu.",
    "Now, examining option C (curry), it is a popular dish at Indian restaurants and is exactly what one would order.",
    "Since none of the other options relate to food or ordering at an Indian restaurant, and curry is a prominent dish in Indian cuisine, it stands out as the logical answer."
