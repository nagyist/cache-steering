  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a feature of a cat that is visible in the dark.",
    "I need to consider which of the options are features of a cat and which might be relevant to visibility in low-light conditions.",
    "Cats have excellent night vision, which mainly involves their eyes. Their eyes have a higher number of rod cells that are sensitive to low light.",
    "The option \"litter of kittens\" refers to a group of offspring and is not a feature that you would see in the dark; it is also context-dependent.",
    "The option \"four legs\" is a common characteristic of many animals, including cats, but legs cannot be highlighted as a distinctive feature visible in the dark.",
    "The option \"nose\" is a feature of a cat, but it is not particularly enhanced for visibility in dark conditions like the eyes.",
    "The option \"flippers\" does not apply to cats; flippers are typically found on aquatic animals and not relevant here.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most relevant feature that would be visible in the dark is the eyes, given their adaptability to low-light environments."
