  "query": "Question: Friday wasn't in the mood to be answering questions.  After a ten hour interrogation he was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: getting tired\nB: sharing information\nC: rich\nD: teaching\nE: boredom",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a scenario where \"Friday\" underwent a ten-hour interrogation. By mentioning a long duration, it implies that the situation was likely exhausting or frustrating for him.",
    "Considering the context of an interrogation, it generally involves pressure and can lead to fatigue. Therefore, \"getting tired\" seems like a strong possibility as an outcome after such a long interrogation.",
    "On the other hand, during an interrogation, it is unlikely that someone would be sharing information willingly, especially if they were not in the mood to answer questions. Thus, \"sharing information\" seems less plausible.",
    "The options \"rich,\" \"teaching,\" and \"boredom\" do not logically follow from the context of an interrogation either. Being interrogated does not typically lead to one becoming rich or teaching others during that time.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable outcome for Friday after a ten-hour interrogation while not in the mood to answer questions is that he would indeed be getting tired."
