  "query": "Question: Where can I find a steakhouse with a view of canyons?\n\nChoices:\nA: nebraska\nB: mexico\nC: new york\nD: utah\nE: japan",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations known for canyons. States like Utah are famous for their canyons, especially places like Zion and Bryce Canyon.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided. Nebraska and Japan are not particularly known for canyons. Therefore, they are less likely to meet the criteria.",
    "Looking at Mexico, while it has picturesque landscapes, it might not be known specifically for steakhouses with canyon views compared to the other options.",
    "New York has restaurants with views, but it is more urban and lacks prominent canyons. It has some parks and landscapes but doesn't fit the canyon theme well.",
    "Utah is known for its stunning canyons and outdoor scenery, making it a strong candidate for a steakhouse with a view of canyons.",
    "I evaluate if I know of any specific steakhouses in Utah that have views of canyons. There are certainly places like the View Restaurant near the canyons that could fit this description.",
    "I also consider the appeal of a steakhouse with canyon views, and Utah is often associated with outdoor dining experiences with dramatic landscapes.",
    "While other states might have good dining options, only Utah clearly combines both the presence of canyons and known steakhouses.",
    "Thus, weighing all factors, the most suitable answer is Utah."
