  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of someone making bread. They might be pressed for time or have other priorities.",
    "Evaluate each option based on how it relates to the urgency of not having \"all day.\"",
    "Option A (baking is hard) suggests difficulty but does not imply urgency or the need for haste.",
    "Option B (eat bread) does not directly correlate with the idea of time; it shifts focus to consumption rather than preparation.",
    "Option C (fresher) is ambiguous and doesn\u2019t clearly support the need for urgency in making the bread.",
    "Option D (I\u2019m hungry) implies a personal need for food, which would motivate someone to finish making bread quickly.",
    "Option E (it's sooooooo yummy) touches on the pleasure of the end product but does not convey the feeling of needing to rush.",
    "Among all options, option D most clearly conveys a reason for needing to finish making bread quickly due to personal hunger."
