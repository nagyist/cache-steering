  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a \"puck\" is used for. A puck is a disc used in the game of ice hockey.",
    "Next, I should consider where ice hockey is played. The main venue for ice hockey games is an ice rink.",
    "Among the choices provided, I need to evaluate where people who use a puck professionally would typically be found.",
    "The first choice, A: hockey rink, is a place where professional players perform and use a puck during games or practice.",
    "The second choice, B: locker room, may have players who use a puck, but it's not an area where the puck is actually used in play; it's more of a preparation area.",
    "The third choice, C: sporting goods store, does not involve professional use of a puck as it pertains to retail rather than play.",
    "The fourth choice, D: used in hockey game, is not a specific structure but rather a reference to the activity involving the puck.",
    "Finally, the fifth choice, E: teachers, does not relate to the use of a puck or the professional context of hockey.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer, where you can see people using a puck professionally, is at the hockey rink."
