    "The question asks how a person's health should improve after getting in shape.",
    "\"Getting in shape\" typically refers to engaging in regular exercise and maintaining a healthy diet.",
    "A common effect of regular exercise is an improvement in overall physical health, which often includes increased energy levels.",
    "Feeling better (Choice A) is a likely outcome as physical fitness contributes to improved mood and well-being.",
    "Feeling stronger (Choice B) is also a probable result; gaining muscle and strength is a major goal for many people who exercise.",
    "Feeling depressed (Choice C) contradicts the typical benefits of exercise, as physical activity is known to enhance mood and reduce symptoms of depression.",
    "Experiencing pain (Choice D) may occur during the process of getting in shape due to sore muscles, but it is not an improvement in health.",
    "Looking better (Choice E) can be a result of getting in shape, as improved fitness may lead to weight loss or better muscle tone.",
    "Both feeling better (Choice A), feeling stronger (Choice B), and looking better (Choice E) are valid improvements associated with getting in shape, but the direct health improvements focus primarily on general well-being and strength.",
    "Out of the choices considering overall health improvement, feeling better and feeling stronger are the most directly related to health enhancement, but \"feeling better\" encompasses a broader range of benefits."
