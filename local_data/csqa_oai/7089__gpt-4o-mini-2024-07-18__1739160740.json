  "query": "Question: They served wine and cheese after everybody saw the exhibits and installations where?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar\nB: cemetary\nC: art show\nD: spaghetti sauce\nE: liquor store",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which mentions wine and cheese being served after viewing exhibits and installations. This context suggests a social event or gathering related to art or culture.",
    "Consider the choices provided: \n- A: bar (typically serves drinks but not usually associated with exhibits)\n- B: cemetery (not a location for serving food/drinks)\n- C: art show (a logical event where exhibits and installations are presented)\n- D: spaghetti sauce (not a location)\n- E: liquor store (focuses on selling drinks, not an event space)",
    "Analyze choice C \"art show.\" An art show often includes various forms of art installations and exhibitions, making it a common setting for serving wine and cheese.",
    "Evaluate if there are any other choices that could possibly fit. The bar does serve drinks but does not typically involve exhibits or installations like an art show does. The others (cemetery, spaghetti sauce, liquor store) do not fit the social or cultural context.",
    "Confirm that the primary activity here is the viewing of art-related items, which aligns perfectly with choice C.",
    "Make sure that other options do not present a valid scenario for serving wine and cheese in relation to the exhibits.",
    "Based on the reasoning, only an art show fits all elements of the question logically."
