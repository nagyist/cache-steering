  "query": "Question: Where would you find a parking area near if you're hoping to ride a rollercoaster?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: amusement park\nC: parkade\nD: apartment complex\nE: people",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to find a parking area near a rollercoaster, I need to consider the context in which rollercoasters are usually found.",
    "Rollercoasters are commonly associated with amusement parks, where there are multiple rides and attractions.",
    "If I want to ride a rollercoaster, I am likely going to an amusement park specifically designed for entertainment and thrill rides.",
    "Amusement parks typically have designated parking areas to accommodate visitors' vehicles.",
    "I can dismiss options such as \"city,\" \"apartment complex,\" and \"people\" as they are not specifically related to riding a rollercoaster or do not commonly have associated parking.",
    "\"Parkade\" refers to a parking structure, but it does not specifically indicate proximity to a rollercoaster or amusement park.",
    "The most logical choice, therefore, is \"amusement park\" since it directly correlates to where rollercoasters are found and typically has parking facilities."
