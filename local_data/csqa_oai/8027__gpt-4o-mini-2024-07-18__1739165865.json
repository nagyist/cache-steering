  "query": "Question: Indian restaurants can be found in many of these throughout the world. What are they?\n\nChoices:\nA: more sophisticated town\nB: seattle\nC: san francisco\nD: curry\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct answer, I need to identify a characteristic that Indian restaurants are commonly associated with.",
    "Indian restaurants are typically found in areas with a diverse population or a significant number of immigrants from India.",
    "Large cities tend to have more diverse populations and a greater variety of restaurants, including Indian cuisine.",
    "I can analyze the options presented to see which aligns best with the presence of Indian restaurants.",
    "Option A, \"more sophisticated town,\" is vague and doesn't specifically indicate a location where Indian restaurants would be prevalent.",
    "Option B, \"seattle,\" is a specific city, but I need to consider if other options might be more universally applicable.",
    "Option C, \"san francisco,\" is also a specific city but shares characteristics with Seattle in terms of diversity and restaurant variety.",
    "Option D, \"curry,\" refers to a dish rather than a location, so it doesn't fit the question contextually.",
    "Option E, \"large city,\" is a general term and directly correlates with the idea of diversity and availability of various types of cuisine, including Indian restaurants.",
    "Comparing all options, \u201clarge city\u201d is the broadest term and fits the question perfectly. Both San Francisco and Seattle are indeed large cities where Indian restaurants can be found, but \"large city\" encompasses many more locations globally."
