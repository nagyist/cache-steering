  "query": "Question: The family decided to have a picnic, they got some bread and chips out of their walk-in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: plastic bag\nC: toaster\nD: pantry\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a family preparing for a picnic. They would need to gather items that are typically used for such an occasion, such as food items and snacks.",
    "Next, look at the items specifically mentioned: bread and chips. These are common picnic foods and are usually stored in a location accessible to the family.",
    "The term \"walk-in\" suggests a larger storage area typically found in kitchens or dining spaces where food items are kept.",
    "Now, evaluate the options provided:\n- A: supermarket - It's unlikely they would have bread and chips out of a supermarket, as they would be purchased from there, not retrieved from.\n- B: plastic bag - This does not fit the description of a 'walk-in,' as a plastic bag cannot be a place to store items in a walk-in manner.\n- C: toaster - The toaster is an appliance used for heating bread, not for storing food.\n- D: pantry - A pantry is a common place for a family to store food, making it a strong candidate.\n- E: house - While the food could technically be in the house, \"walk-in\" refers to a storage area rather than the entire house.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only viable option that strongly relates to the storage of food items like bread and chips, and matches the description of a \u201cwalk-in,\u201d is a pantry."
