  "query": "Question: A strong laxative will help you keep what kind of bowel movements?\n\nChoices:\nA: strongwoman\nB: cake\nC: regular\nD: weak\nE: fragile",
  "steps": [
    "A strong laxative is used to stimulate bowel movements in individuals who may be experiencing constipation.",
    "The objective of taking a strong laxative is to facilitate a normal schedule of bowel movements rather than irregular or infrequent occurrences.",
    "Regular bowel movements are typically characterized by their frequency and ease of passage, which is what a strong laxative aims to achieve.",
    "The term \"weak\" in the context implies a lack of effectiveness, which contradicts what a strong laxative is meant to provide.",
    "\"Fragile\" and \"cake\" do not relate to the context of bowel movements at all, making these choices irrelevant.",
    "The option \"strongwoman\" has no connection to bowel health or the effects of a laxative; it is a descriptor of a person rather than a bowel movement characteristic.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, the only choice that aligns with what a strong laxative helps achieve is \"regular\" bowel movements.",
    "I can confidently conclude that the answer should reflect the purpose of strong laxatives to enhance the regularity of bowel movements."
