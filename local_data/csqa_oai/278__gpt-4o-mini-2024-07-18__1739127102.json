  "query": "Question: The king was to meet an ambassador, where would the meet?\n\nChoices:\nA: court\nB: dinning room\nC: throne room\nD: monarchy\nE: castle",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the location associated with formal meetings between a king and an ambassador. The context suggests a significant and ceremonial environment.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. The choices include court, dining room, throne room, monarchy, and castle.",
    "The term \"court\" often refers to a royal court or the body of advisors and officials surrounding a monarch, but it doesn't specify a physical location.",
    "The \"dining room\" is typically associated with meals and not formal diplomatic meetings.",
    "The \"monarchy\" refers to the system of government or the royal family itself, but it does not indicate a specific meeting place.",
    "The \"castle\" is a broader term for the royal residence and could include many rooms but is not definitive for official meetings.",
    "The \"throne room\" is traditionally where kings conduct important meetings, receive ambassadors, and hold court. It is specifically designed for such formal interactions.",
    "Given the significance and formality of the meeting with an ambassador, the throne room stands out as the most appropriate location.",
    "Now, review the reasoning: the throne room is designed for official purposes, whereas the other options do not fit the context of a formal diplomatic meeting."
