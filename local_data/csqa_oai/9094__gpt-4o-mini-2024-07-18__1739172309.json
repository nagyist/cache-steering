  "query": "Question: where do men keep a wallet?\n\nChoices:\nA: bed\nB: lunch box\nC: pockets\nD: purse\nE: carry credit cards in",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider where men typically store valuables or items they carry with them daily.",
    "I recall that men often use their pockets to hold items like wallets, keys, and phones when they are out and about.",
    "I assess the other options: A (bed) doesn't make sense, as a wallet would not be kept there for everyday access.",
    "Option B (lunch box) is not typical for storing wallets; a lunch box is used for food, not personal items.",
    "Option D (purse) generally refers to a female accessory, and while some men do carry bags, it's less common for wallets.",
    "Option E mentions storing credit cards, but it doesn't specify a location; wallets are specifically designed to hold such cards and cash.",
    "Considering all the options, option C (pockets) is the most logical and common place for men to keep a wallet."
