  "steps": [
    "The question asks about how the chicken is made to be in smaller pieces for a chicken salad.",
    "Let's analyze each of the options provided and see if they relate to cutting the chicken into smaller pieces.",
    "Option A: \"baked in oven\" indicates a cooking method but does not necessarily imply that the chicken is cut into smaller pieces.",
    "Option B: \"chopped\" directly suggests that the chicken is physically cut into smaller pieces, which aligns perfectly with the goal of making chicken salad.",
    "Option C: \"bought at store\" refers to purchasing chicken, but does not address how it is prepared or made into smaller pieces.",
    "Option D: \"cooked by grilling\" indicates another cooking method but, like baking, does not imply that the chicken is in smaller pieces.",
    "Option E: \"eaten\" is irrelevant because it refers to the consumption of chicken rather than its preparation.",
    "After considering all options, the only response that specifically describes the act of making chicken smaller in size for a salad is option B, \"chopped.\""
