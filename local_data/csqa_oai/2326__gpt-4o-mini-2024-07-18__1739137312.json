  "query": "Question: Joe had a key to a rented locker at what type of place?\n\nChoices:\nA: bus depot\nB: at hotel\nC: own home\nD: pocket\nE: idea",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what type of places typically have lockers that can be rented. Common examples include bus depots, hotels, and gyms.",
    "Next, I will analyze each choice to see if it's a plausible location for a rented locker.",
    "Choice A mentions a bus depot, which generally has lockers for travelers to store their luggage temporarily. This option is reasonable.",
    "Choice B mentions a hotel. Many hotels have luggage storage lockers or similar services for guests, so this is also a plausible option.",
    "Choice C states \"own home.\" Typically, homes do not have rented lockers as it is a personal space, which makes this option unlikely.",
    "Choice D mentions \"pocket,\" which doesn't make sense in the context of a rented locker since pockets are not a location for rental.",
    "Choice E states \"idea.\" This doesn't pertain to a physical location where lockers might be found, so it is not a viable option.",
    "Now narrowing it down, I see that A (bus depot) and B (hotel) are plausible locations for a rented locker, while C, D, and E are not.",
    "Between A and B, both are common places that might offer rented lockers, but I would lean towards the bus depot being more associated with \"renting\" a locker for temporary storage than a hotel, which is usually more about room rental."
