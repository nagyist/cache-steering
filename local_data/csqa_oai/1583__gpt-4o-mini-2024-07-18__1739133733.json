  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question: We are looking for something that allows one to hear other people but does not allow that person to be heard themselves.",
    "Now, let's go through each option one by one to see which fits this description.",
    "Option A: Television - A television allows you to hear what is being broadcast, but you can also speak and be heard (e.g., via a video call), so this doesn't fit.",
    "Option B: Radio - A radio lets you hear broadcasts but does not allow you to speak back or be heard, aligning with the criteria.",
    "Option C: Telephone - A telephone permits two-way communication, so you can hear and be heard, which does not fit the criteria.",
    "Option D: Mouth - A mouth can be used to hear (indirectly) if one is speaking, but it also allows you to speak, so it does not fit as well.",
    "Option E: Song - A song can be heard when played, but it does not facilitate two-sided communication; however, the way the question is phrased implies it relates to an object that exists in a conversation context.",
    "Since option B (radio) allows you to hear but does not let you be heard, and it fits the criteria set by the question best, I will choose this option."
