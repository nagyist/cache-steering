  "steps": [
    "I need to understand the context of the sentence, which involves an individual who feels limited in purpose by their ability to pay bills.",
    "The phrase \"actively what\" suggests the missing word should describe an action or state that ties back to paying bills.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"having money\" (C) implies a state of being that is directly related to being able to pay bills, but does not necessarily imply action.",
    "\"Making money\" (D) suggests a proactive action related to earning, which could potentially lead to being able to pay bills.",
    "\"Pay debts\" (A) also relates to financial obligations but does not directly reflect a state of active engagement.",
    "\"Keep house\" (E) could imply maintaining a household but is not directly related to the ability to pay bills.",
    "Considering the options, \"making money\" (D) fits well, as it relates to actively engaging in a process that can lead to paying bills.",
    "However, if the emphasis is on the necessity of having funds available to pay bills, \"having money\" (C) can also be valid.",
    "Both \"making money\" and \"having money\" fit within the context; the nuance of whether the sentence is emphasizing the action (D) or state (C) must be considered.",
    "Upon evaluation, the most fitting choice remains \"making money,\" as the sentence likely highlights action as the reason for engagement."
