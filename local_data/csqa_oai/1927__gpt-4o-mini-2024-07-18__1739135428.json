  "query": "Question: Where do you store a salad bowl when not in use?\n\nChoices:\nA: french restaurant\nB: lettuce\nC: dishwasher\nD: cupboard\nE: buffet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a salad bowl, which is generally for serving or holding salad when needed.",
    "Next, think about where kitchen items are typically stored when not in use. Items that are commonly used in food preparation or serving are usually stored in designated kitchen spaces.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: \n- A (french restaurant) is not a storage place for personal kitchen items.\n- B (lettuce) is food and not a storage option.\n- C (dishwasher) is where you clean the bowl after use, not where you store it when it is clean.\n- D (cupboard) is a common and suitable place for storing kitchen items.\n- E (buffet) typically refers to a style of serving food rather than storage.",
    "Since the most logical option for storing a salad bowl when it\u2019s not in use is in a designated cabinet or shelf, the cupboard is the appropriate answer.",
    "Double-checking: cupboard is where kitchenware is mostly kept when not in use, aligning with kitchen organization practices."
