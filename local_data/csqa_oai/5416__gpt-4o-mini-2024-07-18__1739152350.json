  "steps": [
    "Consider the question, which states that all people need to move, otherwise something will atrophy. Atrophy refers to the wasting away or decrease in size of an organ or tissue.",
    "Evaluate each choice to see if it relates to something that can physically atrophy due to lack of movement.",
    "Choice A: feelings - While feelings can change or diminish, they do not physically atrophy like muscle tissue can.",
    "Choice B: shrink - This term is too vague and does not specifically refer to anything that atrophies; it is also a verb rather than a noun.",
    "Choice C: free will - Free will is a philosophical concept and does not physically atrophy, so this is not a correct choice.",
    "Choice D: muscles - This is directly related to the concept of atrophy, as muscles can and do atrophy when they are not used or stimulated through movement.",
    "Choice E: parents - Parents might experience emotional or psychological changes, but they cannot atrophy in the physical sense as a body part can.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only choice that refers to something that can physically atrophy due to lack of movement is muscles."
