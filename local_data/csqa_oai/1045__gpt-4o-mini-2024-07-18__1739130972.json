  "query": "Question: What does a child have to do in order to officially become a student?\n\nChoices:\nA: read a book\nB: drop out of school\nC: wash dishes\nD: enter school\nE: study book",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to define what it means to become a student. Generally, a student is someone who is enrolled in a school or educational institution to learn.",
    "Next, I examine the options to see which action is necessary for enrollment in a school.",
    "Option A, \"read a book,\" is not directly related to becoming a student; reading is an activity that can happen whether someone is enrolled or not.",
    "Option B, \"drop out of school,\" is the opposite of becoming a student, as it implies leaving an educational institution.",
    "Option C, \"wash dishes,\" has no relevance to the process of becoming a student.",
    "Option D, \"enter school,\" closely relates to the act of becoming a student because entering a school is necessary for enrollment.",
    "Option E, \"study book,\" like reading, is an activity that can occur after becoming a student but is not a prerequisite for being considered one.",
    "Now, comparing the relevant options, D is the only choice that directly pertains to the action required to officially become a student.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the correct answer is the action required to officially become a student."
