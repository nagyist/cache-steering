  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that James was delayed for a couple of hours because he had a connection, implying he was waiting for something or someone to connect with.",
    "Looking at the context, \"connection\" could refer to various scenarios, but it is most commonly associated with travel, especially in the case of flights.",
    "Option A, \"company\", does not logically fit as a place where someone would be delayed due to a connection. It's too vague without context.",
    "Option B, \"airport\", relates to travel where a person might have a connecting flight. It is reasonable that James could experience a delay here while waiting for a connecting flight.",
    "Option C, \"wall\", does not make sense in the context of delays due to connections\u2014it is not a place where one would experience such an issue.",
    "Option D, \"computer network\", could imply a connection, but it is more abstract and less likely to result in hours of delay compared to travel.",
    "Option E, \"love\", also does not fit, as it is more of a metaphorical 'connection' and does not typically lead to delays in a literal sense.",
    "Given all the options and the context of the question, the most fitting choice for where James might have a connection that leads to a delay is at the airport."
