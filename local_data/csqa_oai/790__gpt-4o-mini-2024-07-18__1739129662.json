  "query": "Question: Three quarters of what are covered by the ocean?\n\nChoices:\nA: waterfalls\nB: underwater\nC: beach\nD: surface of earth\nE: river",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what is covered by the ocean, we should consider what is large enough to be covered by vast bodies of water.",
    "The ocean covers about 71% of the Earth's surface. Therefore, any answer has to relate to the surface in some way.",
    "Option A (waterfalls) are not generally found in relation to the ocean, as they do not constitute large areas and are typically located on land.",
    "Option B (underwater) refers to what exists beneath the ocean itself, which isn't what we are looking for in terms of coverage.",
    "Option C (beach) refers to the land areas directly adjacent to oceans, which are only a small part of the total area covered by the oceans, rather than what is covered.",
    "Option D (surface of Earth) includes all land and water on the planet, and since the ocean covers a significant percentage of this surface, it is a strong candidate.",
    "Option E (river) refers to smaller bodies of fresh water and does not relate to the vast coverage of oceans.",
    "After considering all the options in relation to the coverage by the ocean, option D best fits the description of what three quarters (or a significant portion) refers to in terms of coverage."
