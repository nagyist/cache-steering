  "query": "Question: Where is a student likely to have a ring binder?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: notebook\nC: book store\nD: office\nE: office supply store",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the purpose of a ring binder. It is primarily used for organizing and storing loose-leaf papers or documents, which can be common in academic or professional settings.",
    "Evaluate the choices in relation to where a student would typically need documents organized. School is a common environment where students use ring binders for class notes, handouts, and assignments.",
    "Now look at the other options: a notebook is made up of bound pages and not typically where you would find a ring binder, a book store sells books and may not specifically focus on supplies, an office implies a more professional setting than a student's environment, while an office supply store does sell ring binders but may not be a location where a student would regularly carry one.",
    "The most practical and common place for a student to have a ring binder is at school, since that is where students are engaged in learning activities that require organization of papers.",
    "While a student might be seen buying a ring binder at an office supply store or book store, the question specifically asks where they are likely to already have one.",
    "Thus, based on the context of a student\u2019s daily activities and needs, school is the most logical and relevant answer."
