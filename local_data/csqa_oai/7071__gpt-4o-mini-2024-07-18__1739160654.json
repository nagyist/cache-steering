  "query": "Question: What does a person do when they are blocking someone in a driveway?\n\nChoices:\nA: healthy relationship\nB: food\nC: moving car\nD: wet suit\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "To understand what a person does when they are blocking someone in a driveway, I need to consider the context of the situation.",
    "Blocking someone in a driveway typically means that another vehicle is obstructing access to that driveway, preventing the owner of the driveway from entering or exiting.",
    "When someone is blocked, they would likely need to move the car that is blocking the driveway in order to regain access.",
    "The action of moving a car would be the immediate response to resolve the situation of being blocked.",
    "Now, I need to analyze the options provided for their relevance to the situation described.",
    "Option A (healthy relationship) does not relate to the immediate action of moving a car.",
    "Option B (food) is unrelated to the context of blocking in a driveway.",
    "Option C (moving car) directly addresses the action needed to resolve the block.",
    "Option D (wet suit) has no connection to the driveway situation.",
    "Option E (school) is irrelevant to the act of blocking a driveway.",
    "After evaluating all options, moving the car is clearly the only relevant action in the context of someone being blocked in a driveway."
