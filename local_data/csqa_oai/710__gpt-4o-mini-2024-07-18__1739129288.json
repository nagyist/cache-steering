  "query": "Question: James was a student who had a report that is due tomorrow.  Where might he spend most of his time today?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: college class\nC: class room\nD: classroom\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider that James has a report due tomorrow, which suggests he may need to spend time preparing and completing it today.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the provided choices to determine where he would likely work on a report.",
    "The options to work on a report include: university, college class, classroom, and library. The terms 'class room' and 'classroom' refer to the same thing, so I can consider them equivalent.",
    "I will analyze \"university\" which is a broader term that includes study areas, classes, and libraries, but it may not specify a focused area for completing a report.",
    "The option \"college class\" suggests that he might be in a class where he may not have time to work on his report since it is scheduled.",
    "\"Classroom\" (or \"class room\") also indicates a location for learning, but it primarily serves as a venue for lectures rather than focused report work.",
    "The \"library\" is a dedicated space for studying and working on assignments, making it the most likely place for James to spend time on his report.",
    "Considering that a report requires concentration and access to resources, the library would provide both a quiet environment and materials needed for research and writing.",
    "Since all factors point to the library being the optimal choice for working on an academic report, I can confirm my decision."
