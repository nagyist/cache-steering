  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"not meant to be sold\" suggests that the product has a specific purpose other than making a sale.",
    "We need to consider the context of what this product could be used for, and eliminating the options that imply a sales purpose is important.",
    "Option A, \"shelf,\" implies a place to store items rather than a purpose for the product itself.",
    "Option B, \"cost one dollar,\" relates to pricing and does not address the purpose of the product.",
    "Option E, \"store,\" again implies a sales purpose or a location rather than an intended use of the product.",
    "Option C, \"breaking,\" doesn't seem to relate to a meaningful use context; it implies destruction.",
    "Option D, \"demonstration,\" suggests that the product could be used for showcasing its features and functionality, which aligns with not being sold.",
    "Since the product was meant for demonstration, it suggests that it was likely created for the purpose of marketing or educating potential customers about its use.",
    "Considering all these factors, option D stands out as the most fitting purpose for a product that is not intended to be sold."
