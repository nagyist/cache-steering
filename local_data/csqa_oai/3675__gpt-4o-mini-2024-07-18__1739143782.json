  "steps": [
    "To determine what a person gets out of a pi\u00f1ata, I need to consider what a pi\u00f1ata is. A pi\u00f1ata is often a decorated container filled with goodies, traditionally broken open at celebrations like birthdays or holidays.",
    "The primary purpose of a pi\u00f1ata is to provide a fun activity where participants take turns trying to break it open. When successfully broken, the contents spill out for everyone to collect.",
    "I should evaluate the answer choices. The first option, A: contraceptives, does not relate to a pi\u00f1ata and is entirely irrelevant.",
    "Next, option B: well fed, does not specifically address what one would receive from a pi\u00f1ata and is also quite vague.",
    "Option C: candies is a strong candidate because pi\u00f1atas are typically filled with candies and small toys which are the expected prizes.",
    "Looking at option D: own house, this is obviously unrelated to the concept of a pi\u00f1ata and doesn\u2019t fit at all.",
    "Lastly, option E: fairness, while important in a game or activity context, does not match what content is gathered from a pi\u00f1ata.",
    "After analyzing all choices, option C: candies directly aligns with the typical contents that one would receive from breaking open a pi\u00f1ata."
