  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the behavior of honest people.",
    "When considering honesty, the most relevant behavior is that honest people would naturally tell the truth.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices against the notion of honesty.",
    "Choice A (tell truth) directly correlates with the characteristic of honesty, as honest people are truthful.",
    "Choice B (own objects) is unrelated to the concept of honesty; owning objects does not imply a moral stance or behavior regarding honesty.",
    "Choice C (pay bills) might involve honesty in terms of fulfilling obligations, but it doesn't specifically define the act of being honest itself.",
    "Choice D (selling food) does not directly relate to honesty; it pertains more to commerce.",
    "Choice E (buy cake) similarly has no relevance to the virtue of honesty and is merely a transactional action.",
    "Among all options, A is the only choice that clearly reflects what honest people tend to do."
