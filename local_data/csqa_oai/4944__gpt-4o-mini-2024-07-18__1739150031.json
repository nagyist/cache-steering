  "query": "Question: The signs went from English to French, they had traveled far along the national highway where?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: major cities\nC: africa\nD: united states\nE: atlas",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions signs changing from English to French, which suggests a location where both languages are prevalent or where French is significantly spoken.",
    "Canada is known for being bilingual, with both English and French as official languages, particularly in provinces like Quebec.",
    "Major cities can have bilingual signs in areas, but they do not specifically indicate a location where signs would change significantly from English to French on a national highway.",
    "Africa is not a primary location for signs changing from English to French along national highways, as the countries there primarily focus on indigenous languages or colonial languages based on the region.",
    "The United States predominantly speaks English, and while there may be French-speaking areas (like Louisiana), signs do not generally change to French along national highways.",
    "The term \"atlas\" in option E refers to a book of maps, which does not pertain to the context of traveling along a national highway.",
    "Comparing the viable options, Canada is the only location where it is common to see road signs in both English and French due to its bilingual nature.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer based on the reasoning is Canada, as it aligns with the detail about signs traveling from English to French along the national highway."
