  "query": "Question: When buying beer what is it you give the cashier and they give you back less of?\n\nChoices:\nA: showing identification card\nB: money\nC: i.d\nD: electrical circuit\nE: proper age",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what you give to the cashier when buying beer. Typically, you hand over some form of payment.",
    "Next, consider the nature of the transaction. When purchasing beer, you give money to the cashier.",
    "Now, think about what the cashier provides in return. After you give your money, you generally receive beer and possibly some change back.",
    "The question explicitly states that you give something to the cashier and they give you back less of it. This implies that whatever you give is indeed a measure that does not return in full.",
    "Since you receive change back when you give money, it is clear you initially provide more money than what you receive back.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the options given:\n- A (showing identification card) is something you may do but doesn't fit the transaction description of giving and receiving less.\n- B (money) matches our understanding that you give money and receive less (in terms of not getting back the full amount you gave).\n- C (i.d) is also about identification and not a transaction of giving and receiving less.\n- D (electrical circuit) doesn't relate to the context of buying beer.\n- E (proper age) pertains to eligibility but doesn\u2019t fit the framework of giving and receiving something tangible.",
    "Thus, the only option that fulfills the requirement of you giving something and receiving back less of it is money."
