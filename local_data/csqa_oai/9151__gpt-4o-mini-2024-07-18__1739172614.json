  "steps": [
    "When participating in sports, the body's temperature rises due to physical exertion.",
    "To regulate body temperature, the body activates sweat glands to cool down through evaporation.",
    "Sweating results in the loss of water from the body, as sweat is primarily composed of water.",
    "While playing sports, it's common for athletes to experience significant fluid loss due to this sweating process.",
    "The options provided include several factors that could be associated with playing sports.",
    "\"Good health\" does not relate to fluid loss; in fact, being in good health would aid in better hydration and performance.",
    "\"Pain\" can occur during sports, but it is not a direct reason for water loss in the body.",
    "\"Fatigue\" can result from exertion or dehydration, but it is also not the primary cause of water loss during sports.",
    "\"Injuries\" may occur in sports, but again, they are not related to the physiological process of losing water.",
    "The only option that directly explains the loss of water while engaged in sports activities is \"sweating.\""
