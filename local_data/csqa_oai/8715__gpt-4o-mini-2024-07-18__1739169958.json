  "query": "Question: The couple were finally to buy house, they had comfortable jobs and the funds for a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: falling down\nB: down payment\nC: privacy\nD: careful\nE: save money",
  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that the couple is in a position to buy a house, which usually requires an initial financial investment.",
    "In real estate terminology, a \"down payment\" refers to the initial amount of money paid when purchasing a home, which aligns with needing funds.",
    "The other options do not fit well into this context: \"falling down\" is non-applicable as a financial term, \"privacy\" is unrelated to purchasing, \"careful\" does not connect to financial terms, and \"save money\" is more about a general behavior rather than a specific financial action needed to buy a house.",
    "Thus, among the choices, \"down payment\" is the only one that directly relates to the act of purchasing a house."
