  "query": "Question: What must a train do before reaching the station?\n\nChoices:\nA: passing slowly\nB: arrive early\nC: arrive late\nD: slow past stop\nE: slow down",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a train must do before reaching the station.",
    "We need to consider the actions a train takes as it approaches a station.",
    "Typically, as a train approaches a station, it needs to adjust its speed for safe stopping.",
    "Among the options provided, \"slow down\" implies reducing speed in preparation for stopping.",
    "Other options like \"arrive early\" and \"arrive late\" do not pertain to the immediate actions taken before reaching the station.",
    "\"Passing slowly\" and \"slow past stop\" might imply reduced speed, but they are not as clear as \"slow down.\"",
    "\"Slow down\" is the most direct and universally applicable action all trains must perform before stopping at a station.",
    "No other options clearly convey the necessity to decrease speed for safety while approaching a station.",
    "Thus, the best choice that clearly answers the question is \u201cslow down.\u201d"
