  "query": "Question: Where would you see someone using a thermometer?\n\nChoices:\nA: outside\nB: hospital\nC: cabinet\nD: doctor's office\nE: drawer",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to recognize the primary function of a thermometer, which is to measure temperature.",
    "Next, we consider locations where measuring temperature is commonly necessary or performed.",
    "The hospital is a place where medical care is provided, and measuring a patient\u2019s temperature is an essential procedure there.",
    "The doctor\u2019s office, similar to the hospital, is another medical setting where patients are typically checked for vital signs, including temperature.",
    "Outside is generally not a common place to use a thermometer for human temperature readings, although outdoor thermometers exist for weather.",
    "A cabinet is typically a storage space and not a place where one would use a thermometer.",
    "A drawer is also a storage area, with no specific connection to the active usage of a thermometer.",
    "Since both the hospital and doctor's office are legitimate answers, I need to determine which location is more appropriate.",
    "Between the hospital and doctor\u2019s office, hospitals have a broader range of medical equipment and more frequent interactions with conditions requiring temperature checks.",
    "Ultimately, both B (hospital) and D (doctor's office) are valid; however, considering the context of emergency and critical care, hospital usage is more pronounced."
