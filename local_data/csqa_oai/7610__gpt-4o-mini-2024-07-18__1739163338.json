  "steps": [
    "I need to identify locations that are commonly associated with gambling activities.",
    "A race track is a place where betting on horse races occurs, which is a form of gambling.",
    "A casino is specifically designed for gambling, featuring various games such as slots, poker, and table games.",
    "A building is too general and does not specifically relate to gambling activities.",
    "A bar may have some gambling activities, but it is primarily a place for socializing and drinking rather than focused gambling.",
    "Back horses is a colloquial term related to betting on horses but is not a location itself.",
    "Comparing race tracks and casinos, while both involve gambling, casinos encompass a wider range of gambling options and activities.",
    "Thus, the most likely place to find a concentrated number of gamblers would be in a casino."
