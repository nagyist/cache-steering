  "query": "Question: What does someone feel after running twenty six miles?\n\nChoices:\nA: sore feet\nB: death\nC: twenty six\nD: feel tired\nE: short breath",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the physical exertion associated with running a marathon distance of twenty-six miles.",
    "It is common for individuals to experience tiredness or fatigue after such an extensive physical activity.",
    "Next, evaluate the emotional or physical sensations that could accompany a long-distance run.",
    "While \"sore feet\" might be a typical outcome, it does not encompass the overall feeling most people would report after completing the run.",
    "The option \"death\" seems overly dramatic and unlikely as a direct feeling; it is not a universally valid feeling after long runs.",
    "The option \"twenty-six\" does not make sense in the context of feelings or sensations one might have.",
    "The choice \"feel tired\" captures the general consensus of what most people feel after an extensive run, including a marathon.",
    "Another option, \"short breath,\" could also apply, but it is more likely that individuals would feel a generalized tiredness rather than just shortness of breath after such an effort.",
    "Combining all of this, \"feel tired\" accurately reflects a common feeling experienced after running a marathon."
