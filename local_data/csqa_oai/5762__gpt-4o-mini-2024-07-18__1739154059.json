  "steps": [
    "First, we start by analyzing the context of the sentence. John was looking for a shirt, so he likely needed access to a storage space where clothing is kept.",
    "Next, we consider each option and its relevance to storing shirts. A closet (A) is a common place for clothing, but it is usually a larger space.",
    "A chest (B) can hold clothes, but it typically refers to a large, often decorative storage box, which is less common for shirts.",
    "A drawer (C) is a smaller compartment within furniture, often used for storing items like shirts, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A dresser (D) often contains multiple drawers and is primarily used for clothing storage. Thus, it could also be a valid choice.",
    "A suitcase (E) is used for temporary storage of clothes, typically for travel, making it less likely to be the option John would pull open if he is looking for a shirt at home.",
    "Now we analyze the phrase \"pulled open.\" This action implies a physical object that can slide open or be opened, which aligns well with a drawer or dresser.",
    "Considering that John is specifically looking for a shirt, the most straightforward and common choice would be a drawer, as shirts are often kept in a drawer or in a dresser with multiple drawers.",
    "Between drawer (C) and dresser (D), drawer is more specific to the action of pulling open."
