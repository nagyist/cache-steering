  "query": "Question: Where would you find fungus growing on something made from milk?\n\nChoices:\nA: eyes\nB: biology laboratory\nC: shower stall\nD: old cheese\nE: decaying matter",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify where fungus commonly grows. Fungus thrives in warm, moist environments and often feeds on organic materials.",
    "Next, we consider the options provided and focus on those that mention something related to milk or dairy products.",
    "Option D mentions \"old cheese.\" Cheese is directly made from milk and can easily develop mold (a type of fungus) as it ages, especially if not stored properly.",
    "Option B mentions a \"biology laboratory,\" which might have fungus but is not specifically related to milk or dairy products.",
    "Option C mentions a \"shower stall,\" where mold might grow, but it is not related to milk products specifically.",
    "Option E mentions \"decaying matter,\" which can contain fungus, but again, it is not directly linked to milk.",
    "Option A mentions \"eyes,\" which is not a viable option since fungus does not grow on human eyes.",
    "Considering all of this, \"old cheese\" stands out as the only option where fungus would specifically grow on something made from milk."
