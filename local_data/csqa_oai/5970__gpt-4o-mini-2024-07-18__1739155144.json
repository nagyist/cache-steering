  "query": "Question: You often keep tools in a box in your?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: repair shop\nC: drawer\nD: neighbor's house\nE: dentist",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a typical location where tools are kept.",
    "Options include various locations like a garage, repair shop, drawer, neighbor's house, and dentist.",
    "A garage is a common place for keeping tools, often used for home maintenance and car repairs.",
    "A repair shop would also logically contain tools, but it is more of a business than a personal storage location.",
    "A drawer could hold tools, especially smaller ones or hand tools, but it may not be the best option for larger tools.",
    "A neighbor's house generally would not be a place where an individual keeps their own tools.",
    "The dentist is not relevant as it typically would not house any tools related to home maintenance.",
    "Comparing the options: \n- The garage (A) is most typical for personal tool storage.\n- The repair shop (B) is more commercial.\n- The drawer (C) is plausible for smaller tools, but less common for larger sets.",
    "Since the question implies a personal storage location and \u2018drawer\u2019 is less specific than \u2018garage\u2019, I lean towards \u2018garage\u2019.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer considering common storage would be \u2018A: garage\u2019."
