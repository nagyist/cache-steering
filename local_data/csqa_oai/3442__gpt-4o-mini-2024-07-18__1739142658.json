  "query": "Question: Wanting the road to be complete, what was the road like to have frustrated the mayor so?\n\nChoices:\nA: unfinished\nB: bumpy\nC: done\nD: partial\nE: ended",
  "steps": [
    "The mayor wanted the road to be complete, meaning he desired it to be fully finished and usable.",
    "If the road was in a state that was \"unfinished,\" it would suggest that there were still parts that needed work, which aligns with being frustrated about its current state.",
    "The term \"bumpy\" suggests a quality of the road's surface rather than its completeness, which does not directly relate to the mayor's frustration about the road being complete.",
    "The option \"done\" implies that the road is already complete, which would not lead to frustration, as the mayor desires that state.",
    "The term \"partial\" implies that parts of the road are complete while others are not, which could indeed lead to frustration if the mayor wanted the entire road completed.",
    "The option \"ended\" usually denotes a conclusion, and doesn't mean anything related to road conditions or statuses, so it does not contribute to the mayor's frustration.",
    "Now, I will analyze the remaining options that could frustrate the mayor - \"unfinished\" and \"partial.\"",
    "\"Unfinished\" clearly correlates with the road not being completed at all, which could frustrate someone who wants the entire project finalized.",
    "\"Partial\" means that some sections are done while others aren't, which could also frustrate the mayor but not to the same extent as \"unfinished,\" which implies no progress.",
    "After considering both \"unfinished\" and \"partial,\" I conclude that \"unfinished\" best represents the state of the road that would frustrate the mayor the most, as it suggests complete lack of completion."
