  "query": "Question: When an unpopular change in the way things are done occurs what is the public reaction?\n\nChoices:\nA: confusion\nB: going to court\nC: moral outrage\nD: trial\nE: hurt feelings",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the impact of an unpopular change on the public. Unpopular changes often lead to a strong emotional response from those affected.",
    "Next, think about what types of emotional responses are common in these situations. People may feel confused, upset, or even outraged when faced with changes they disagree with.",
    "Analyze the choices provided. Confusion (A) suggests a lack of understanding, which may not be the primary emotion. While people may feel confused, it's not as strong as other reactions.",
    "Consider going to court (B), which is a legal action rather than an emotional response. While some may resort to this, it is not the primary reaction for the general public.",
    "Examine the option of moral outrage (C). This reaction aligns with feelings of anger or injustice, often seen in public outcry against policies or changes that are viewed as unfair.",
    "Look at the option of trial (D). A trial is a legal process and not a reaction from the public in general, similar to the court option.",
    "Finally, consider hurt feelings (E). This is a potential reaction, but it may not encompass the broader public sentiment, which often involves anger and passion rather than just hurt feelings.",
    "Weighing all the options, moral outrage (C) captures the collective feeling of many in response to an unpopular change more accurately than the other options."
