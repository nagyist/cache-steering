  "query": "Question: What can a concert hall also be used for?\n\nChoices:\nA: commercial building\nB: university building\nC: screaming\nD: city\nE: theater",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary function of a concert hall, which is to host musical performances and concerts.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices given in relation to the secondary functions a concert hall might serve.",
    "Option A (\"commercial building\") is not suitable, as concert halls are not primarily used for commercial business purposes.",
    "Look at option B (\"university building\"); while some concert halls may be affiliated with universities, they are not exclusively university buildings and typically don't serve that function.",
    "Consider option C (\"screaming\"). While people might scream at concerts, this is not a constructive or typical use of a concert hall.",
    "Examine option D (\"city\"). A concert hall is a structure found within a city but does not serve the purpose of functioning as a city.",
    "Finally, review option E (\"theater\"). Many concert halls can also function as theaters for stage performances, plays, and other events beyond music concerts themselves.",
    "Since the primary role of a concert hall overlaps significantly with that of a theater, and given the lack of suitable alternatives, option E is the best choice."
