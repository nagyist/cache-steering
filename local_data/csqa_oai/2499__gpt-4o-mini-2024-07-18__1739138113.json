  "query": "Question: John noticed that there was a lot of dust in the room.  He cleaned off the place where food is served last.   Where might John have cleaned last?\n\nChoices:\nA: shelf\nB: library\nC: table\nD: fridge\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the information given. John observed a lot of dust in the room, which indicates he is likely cleaning an area that is used often or frequently gathers dust.",
    "Next, John prioritized cleaning the area where food is served last. This suggests that the area he cleaned last is likely associated with food.",
    "Now, we look at the options given: shelf, library, table, fridge, refrigerator. Among these, a shelf and a table could be related to food service but the library does not fit that context.",
    "The fridge and refrigerator are the same thing, so we can consider them as one option. They are also not places where food is directly served but are used to store food.",
    "The most likely place where food is served is the table, as it is typically the surface used for dining.",
    "Considering that John cleaned the area where food is served last, it logically follows that the cleanest or the last area cleaned would be a table where he serves food.",
    "In conclusion, given all the reasoning and the relationship to food service, it is clear that the area he cleaned last was the table."
