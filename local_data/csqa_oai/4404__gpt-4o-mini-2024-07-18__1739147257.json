  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a famous cornet was displayed alongside other famous items.",
    "We need to identify a location that is commonly associated with the display of famous or notable items.",
    "A \"case\" typically refers to a display case but does not imply a broader exhibition context.",
    "A \"marching band\" refers to a group that performs and would not likely be a place of display.",
    "A \"high school band\" is similar to marching bands and would not be a display venue for famous items.",
    "An \"exhibition\" can refer to a display event specifically set up to showcase items of interest, but it is more specific rather than a common place.",
    "A \"museum\" is a dedicated institution that houses various artifacts and exhibits for public viewing, including renowned instruments.",
    "Comparing all options, a museum seems to be the most appropriate choice for the context of displaying a famous cornet and other notable items.",
    "I conclude that the best answer among the provided choices is a \"museum\" since it directly aligns with the description of an exhibition space for famous items."
