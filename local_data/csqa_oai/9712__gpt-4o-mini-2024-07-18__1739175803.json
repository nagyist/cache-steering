  "query": "Question: What do people perform if they have a band?\n\nChoices:\nA: standing ovation\nB: music\nC: tricks\nD: applause\nE: smile",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand what a band is. A band typically refers to a group of musicians who perform music together.",
    "Next, we consider what a band primarily does. The main activity of a band is to perform music, as that's their purpose and function.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices provided:\n- A (standing ovation) refers to an audience's reaction, not something the band performs.\n- B (music) aligns with the primary activity of a band.\n- C (tricks) does not relate specifically to a band; bands do not typically perform tricks.\n- D (applause) is also a reaction from the audience rather than something performed by the band.\n- E (smile) is simply a facial expression and not a performance associated with a band.",
    "Since the primary activity of a band is to play music, option B is the most accurate representation of what people perform if they have a band."
