  "query": "Question: Hundreds of miles away a paper was signed and the conflict was over, not a single drop of blood would hit the what that day?\n\nChoices:\nA: vein\nB: person\nC: paper\nD: clinic\nE: battlefield",
  "steps": [
    "The statement discusses a conflict being resolved by a signed paper, implying a peaceful resolution rather than violence.",
    "The phrase \"not a single drop of blood\" indicates that there will be no violence or casualties resulting from the resolution of the conflict.",
    "Considering the context, the phrase \"hit the\" is used metaphorically to denote where violence typically occurs.",
    "The options provided include various terms related to health, conflict, and locations.",
    "Option A (\"vein\") relates to blood but does not directly align with the idea of a conflict location.",
    "Option B (\"person\") implies potential casualties but is again too broad and not specific to a context of conflict resolution.",
    "Option C (\"paper\") refers to the document signed, which signifies the end of conflict rather than a place of violence.",
    "Option D (\"clinic\") is a place associated with healthcare, where one might go after injuries, but does not relate directly to the conflict's resolution.",
    "Option E (\"battlefield\") is a clear location where bloodshed typically occurs during conflicts.",
    "Given that the question states there would be no bloodshed due to the signing of the paper, the most logical answer that fits the context is that not a single drop of blood would hit the \"battlefield.\""
