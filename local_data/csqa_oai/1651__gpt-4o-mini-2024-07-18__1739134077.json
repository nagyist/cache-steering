  "query": "Question: Why does a person go to a soup kitchen?\n\nChoices:\nA: own house\nB: oral sex\nC: statue\nD: in mail\nE: free food",
  "steps": [
    "To understand why a person would go to a soup kitchen, I first need to identify the primary function of a soup kitchen.",
    "A soup kitchen typically serves meals to those in need, particularly the homeless or low-income individuals who may not have access to regular meals.",
    "Considering the choices presented, I can eliminate options that do not relate to the purpose of a soup kitchen.",
    "Option A (own house) is irrelevant because someone with their own house may not need to visit a soup kitchen for meals.",
    "Option B (oral sex) does not relate to the purpose of a soup kitchen and can be eliminated.",
    "Option C (statue) also does not connect to the needs typically addressed by a soup kitchen and can be disregarded.",
    "Option D (in mail) does not pertain to the service provided by a soup kitchen, so it can be eliminated as well.",
    "The only option remaining is E (free food), which directly correlates with the primary reason for attending a soup kitchen.",
    "Since the goal of a soup kitchen is to provide free meals to those in need, this option best captures the essential reason someone might go to a soup kitchen."
