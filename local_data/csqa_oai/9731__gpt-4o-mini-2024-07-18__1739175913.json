  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the choices to determine which has a surface with ripples.",
    "A mirror has a smooth surface that reflects light and does not have ripples.",
    "An object in general could be anything, and without specific context, this choice is too vague.",
    "Cottage cheese is known for its lumpy texture, which can resemble small ripples or curds on its surface.",
    "A tetrahedron is a solid geometric shape with flat triangular faces, which does not have a rippled surface.",
    "A lake often has a surface that can be rippled due to wind or movement, characteristic of bodies of water.",
    "So far, cottage cheese and a lake are the only two choices that can be associated with having ripples on their surfaces.",
    "While cottage cheese presents a textured surface, it is static, whereas a lake can have dynamic ripples due to environmental factors.",
    "Considering the context of surfaces that routinely display ripples, a lake is more representative of having a surface with ripples than cottage cheese.",
    "Thus, the best choice indicating a surface with ripples is a lake."
