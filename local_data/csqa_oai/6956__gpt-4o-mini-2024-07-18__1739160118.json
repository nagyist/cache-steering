  "query": "Question: They got their kid a nice new play mat, they put it in front of the TV in the where?\n\nChoices:\nA: pool\nB: bathroom\nC: school\nD: living room\nE: doorway",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions a \"nice new play mat\" suggesting it is intended for a child to play on.",
    "The mention of putting the mat \"in front of the TV\" indicates that it is located in a common area where families typically gather to watch television.",
    "Out of the provided choices, we need to determine which location makes the most sense for a play mat to be placed in front of a TV.",
    "Option A: \"pool\" does not fit as it is generally outside and not suitable for a child\u2019s play mat.",
    "Option B: \"bathroom\" is also not a logical place for a play mat, as it is not a typical area for playing.",
    "Option C: \"school\" is implausible because the context indicates a home setting rather than a school environment.",
    "Option D: \"living room\" is a likely choice since it is where families often have their TV and children can play comfortably.",
    "Option E: \"doorway\" is not a reasonable location for a play mat; it would be an obstructive place to put something intended for play.",
    "Based on this elimination process, the most logical and appropriate choice is \"living room.\""
