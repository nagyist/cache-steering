  "query": "Question: If you've been standing in queue for a long time you may develop some what?\n\nChoices:\nA: will have to wait\nB: daydreaming\nC: impatience\nD: angry\nE: become impatient",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of standing in a queue for a long time. The longer someone stands in line, the more they may feel a range of emotions or reactions to the wait.",
    "Next, thinking about the word \u201cdevelop,\u201d it suggests that some condition or feeling may evolve over time. This relates to experiences felt during extended waiting.",
    "Now, we need to analyze the choices given. The first option \"A: will have to wait\" is merely a statement about the situation, not a feeling that is developed.",
    "The second option \"B: daydreaming\" could happen while waiting, but it does not precisely capture what a person develops as a response to waiting.",
    "The third option \"C: impatience\" describes a reaction that is commonly felt after standing in line for too long. It involves an emotional state that grows from the frustration of waiting.",
    "The fourth option \"D: angry\" indicates another possible feeling but is more intense and not the primary reaction one develops from a mere wait in line.",
    "The last option \"E: become impatient\" also captures the essence of what one develops but uses slightly different wording. It denotes an action but effectively communicates a similar sentiment to \u201cimpatience.\u201d",
    "Between options \"C\" and \"E,\" both represent the feeling developed due to waiting. However, \"C\" is a more straightforward description, while \"E\" is phrased as an action, which slightly differs.",
    "Considering the clarity and directness of the wording, \"C: impatience\" succinctly encapsulates the feeling developed from waiting in a queue for a long time."
