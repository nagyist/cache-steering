  "query": "Question: Sam was very orthodox.  This was in opposition to his roommate, who was very what?\n\nChoices:\nA: liberal\nB: heretical\nC: recalcitrant\nD: conservadox\nE: catholic.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the meaning of \"orthodox.\" It generally refers to adhering to established or traditional beliefs, especially in a religious context.",
    "Next, we examine the opposite of \"orthodox.\" Typically, the opposite can be termed as \"liberal,\" which often signifies a willingness to depart from traditional values or beliefs.",
    "Then, we analyze each answer choice concerning the idea of opposition to \"orthodox.\"",
    "Choice A: \"liberal\" - This suggests a departure from tradition and aligns well as the opposite of orthodox.",
    "Choice B: \"heretical\" - This often means beliefs that are contrary to established doctrine, similar to liberal but may imply a stronger deviation than just a liberal stance.",
    "Choice C: \"recalcitrant\" - This indicates being stubbornly resistant to authority or control, not directly related as an opposition to \"orthodox.\"",
    "Choice D: \"conservadox\" - This seems to be a blend of \"conservative\" and \"orthodox,\" which does not effectively represent opposition.",
    "Choice E: \"catholic\" - While this term can imply universality, it does not serve as an adequate opposite to orthodox.",
    "After analyzing the possible choices, \"liberal\" stands out as the most fitting opposite to \"orthodox,\" reflecting a different and often opposing attitude towards traditional beliefs."
