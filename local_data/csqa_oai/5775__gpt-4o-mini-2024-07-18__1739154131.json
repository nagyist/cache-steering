  "steps": [
    "The question refers to the professor's expectation about the type of response he anticipated for a simple question.",
    "The phrase \"ridiculous answer\" suggests that the actual response was overly complicated or not appropriate for the context of the question.",
    "The professor likely wanted an answer that was simpler and easier to understand.",
    "Out of the options provided, \"straightforward\" aligns well with the idea of wanting something less convoluted.",
    "The terms \"solemn,\" \"pensive,\" \"somber,\" and \"serious\" do not convey the simplicity or clarity expected in a straightforward response.",
    "\"Straightforward\" directly implies an answer that is clear, direct, and uncomplicated, which fits the context perfectly.",
    "Verifying against the remaining options: \"solemn\" and \"somber\" suggest seriousness in tone, while \"pensive\" indicates deep thinking or contemplation\u2014none of which match the expectation for simplicity.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most appropriate answer reflecting the professor's expectation is \"straightforward.\""
