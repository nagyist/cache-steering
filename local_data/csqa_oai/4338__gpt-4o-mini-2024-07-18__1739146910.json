    "The user lacked knowledge about the computer, indicating confusion or frustration.",
    "The term \"pure\" suggests a strong or extreme quality related to his experience.",
    "In common language, if someone is struggling with something like an instructional course, they might describe it as akin to a challenging or torturous environment.",
    "The word \"hell\" is often used metaphorically to describe a situation that is very difficult, stressful, or unpleasant.",
    "Looking at the context, \"hell\" seems to resonate with the idea of frustration and struggle in the course.",
    "The other options (A: energy, B: office building, D: school, E: house) do not fit the context of a negative or difficult experience.",
    "Given that the user did not understand and found the course challenging, \"hell\" stands out as the most fitting descriptor.",
