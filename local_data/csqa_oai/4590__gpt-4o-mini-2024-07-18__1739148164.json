  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that Schlitz is a brand of beer that originated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
    "Next, I note that if someone is drinking Schlitz, they may have a connection to Milwaukee since it is associated with the city's brewing history.",
    "I consider the given options and identify that \"Milwaukee\" is mentioned explicitly as option C.",
    "I also observe that the other options (A: residential area, B: city, D: suburbia, and E: schlitztown) are either too vague or not directly related to the specific context of Schlitz beer.",
    "I reflect on the fact that a residential area or suburbia could exist in the city of Milwaukee but does not specifically identify the location.",
    "I eliminate options A, B, D, and E because they do not specifically pinpoint the significance of Schlitz being connected to Milwaukee.",
    "Lastly, I conclude that the most logical answer given the context is option C, as it directly relates to where Schlitz is historically associated."
