  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the facial expression of an audience that liked a performance. Likely expressions would indicate enjoyment or approval.",
    "A smile is a common expression of happiness and satisfaction. If an audience enjoys a performance, they are likely to smile.",
    "A standing ovation indicates strong appreciation but is more related to body movement rather than a direct facial expression.",
    "Music, while it can evoke emotions, is not a facial expression. It's not relevant to the question about facial expressions.",
    "A grimace usually signifies discomfort or dislike, which would not align with the audience enjoying a performance.",
    "Applause is a form of appreciation but again, it is not a facial expression; it is an auditory signal of approval.",
    "Among the choices presented, a smile most directly reflects the positive facial expression associated with enjoyment of a performance."
