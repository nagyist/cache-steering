    "The sentence describes a situation where tourists initially perceive something as a statue.",
    "It is later revealed that this statue is actually performance art.",
    "Performance art typically involves an element of action or movement as a form of expression.",
    "Given this context, the performance art likely began to demonstrate some kind of movement, setting it apart from a static statue.",
    "Choices A (growing mold), C (accent garden), D (green), and E (painting) do not imply any action or movement.",
    "Choice B (moving) aligns perfectly with the concept of performance art, as it suggests that the sculpture began to animate in some way.",
