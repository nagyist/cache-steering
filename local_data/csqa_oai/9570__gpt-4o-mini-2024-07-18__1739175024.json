  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what a spider constructs to catch its food or prey.",
    "Spider webs are a well-known structure created by spiders specifically for the purpose of trapping insects and other prey.",
    "The term \"web\" is commonly associated with various species of spiders, as many use silk to create intricate webs for catching prey.",
    "The other options (bridge, cellar, basement, hanging in air) do not accurately describe structures made by spiders for capturing prey.",
    "A bridge typically refers to a structure used to connect two points over a gap, not something related to capturing prey.",
    "A cellar and basement refer to enclosed spaces within buildings and have no relation to spider constructions.",
    "\"Hanging in air\" is too vague and does not refer to a specific structure built by spiders for trapping prey.",
    "Considering all options, \"web\" is the only term that correctly identifies the structure constructed by spiders."
