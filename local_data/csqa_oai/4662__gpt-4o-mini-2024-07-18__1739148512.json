  "query": "Question: Where should you look for your yoyo if it was stolen by a bratty young person?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy store\nB: toy shop\nC: brother's room\nD: toy factory\nE: own home",
  "steps": [
    "Start by considering where a stolen yoyo would likely go after being taken by a young person. Young people often take toys for personal use or fun.",
    "A yoyo is a common toy that can be found in various locations, but specifically considering where a bratty young person might bring it, it's important to contemplate their personal spaces.",
    "Among the options given, a \"brother's room\" seems like a plausible location since it is a personal space where a young person might play with or store toys.",
    "In terms of the other options, a \"toy store\" or \"toy shop\" could be where it came from, but these locations are unlikely for the yoyo to be after being stolen.",
    "\"A toy factory\" is less likely as it is a workplace and wouldn't be a place for a young person to casually take a toy to.",
    "\"Own home\" implies looking in general areas that may not be specific enough to find the yoyo if it was indeed taken to a personal space.",
    "Thus, the brother's room remains the most probable location as a central place where a bratty young person might take a toy to play with it.",
    "To finalize the potential locations, the brother's room is most directly associated with youthful playfulness and hiding stolen toys."
