  "query": "Question: What does someone immoral do when they are taking final exams without studying?\n\nChoices:\nA: cheat\nB: study\nC: great joy\nD: graduation\nE: sweat",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's establish what is defined as immoral behavior in the context of final exams. Typically, taking an exam without studying might indicate a lack of preparation and could lead to dishonest actions to achieve a good result.",
    "Next, we consider the given options. Option A (cheat) directly correlates with immoral behavior during exams. Cheating is an action taken to unfairly gain an advantage, especially when one is not prepared through legitimate means.",
    "Option B (study) is the opposite of the scenario presented, as someone who studies is acting with integrity and responsibility.",
    "Option C (great joy) does not necessarily correlate with immoral acts but might suggest a nonchalant attitude towards academic integrity, which isn\u2019t specifically immoral.",
    "Option D (graduation) is an outcome of completing exams rather than a direct action taken during exams, and it does not indicate any immoral behavior.",
    "Option E (sweat) implies anxiety or struggle but it does not reflect a moral judgment. It\u2019s a physical reaction to pressure rather than an immoral action.",
    "Considering all the options, cheating aligns most clearly with an immoral action taken during final exams when one is unprepared.",
    "Thus, the choice that best represents what someone immoral does in this scenario is option A (cheat)."
