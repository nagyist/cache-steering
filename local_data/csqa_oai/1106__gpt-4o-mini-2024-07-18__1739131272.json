  "query": "Question: where do you typically buy apples?\n\nChoices:\nA: farmers market\nB: table\nC: grocery store\nD: apple tree\nE: fridge",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is asking for typical places to buy apples.",
    "Consider the nature of each option provided in relation to purchasing apples.",
    "Option A: \"farmers market\" is a common place where fresh produce, including apples, is sold.",
    "Option B: \"table\" does not make sense as it is not a place of purchase; it's a surface where items may be placed.",
    "Option C: \"grocery store\" is a typical retail environment where a variety of products, including apples, can be bought.",
    "Option D: \"apple tree\" is where apples grow, but it does not pertain to the act of purchasing; it's more related to harvesting.",
    "Option E: \"fridge\" is where apples might be stored after purchase, but it is not a place where they are bought.",
    "Evaluate the two most plausible options: Option A (farmers market) and Option C (grocery store).",
    "Consider that while both a farmers market and a grocery store are valid, a grocery store is typically more common for regular purchases of apples.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer that reflects a typical place to buy apples is Option C (grocery store)."
