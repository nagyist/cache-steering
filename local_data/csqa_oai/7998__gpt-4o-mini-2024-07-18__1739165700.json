  "query": "Question: Where is the source of this steak house kobe?\n\nChoices:\nA: china\nB: town\nC: texas\nD: new york\nE: japan",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"kobe\" refers to in the context of a steakhouse. The term often refers to \"Kobe beef,\" which is a particular type of Wagyu beef from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle.",
    "Next, I note that Kobe beef originates specifically from Kobe, Japan, where the cattle are raised under strict regulations to produce high-quality beef.",
    "Now, I consider the options provided. \n- Option A (China) is not relevant as Kobe is not associated with beef from China.\n- Option B (town) is too vague and does not indicate a specific geographical origin.\n- Option C (Texas) is on a list of places known for steaks but does not relate to Kobe beef.\n- Option D (New York) is also a renowned steak location but again does not pertain to the Kobe origin.\n- Option E (Japan) directly correlates with the source of Kobe beef.",
    "I have established that the authentic source of Kobe beef is Japan. Since \"steak house kobe\" likely references this type of beef, it must be linked to its origin.",
    "Based on the information gathered, the most appropriate answer regarding the source of the steak house kobe is Japan, confirming the relevance of the term."
