    "Consider the context of \"meeting people.\" This usually refers to a social situation where individuals are making initial or new connections.",
    "When people meet, common physical gestures can play a significant role in establishing rapport and comfort.",
    "Introducing yourself (Choice A) is a verbal action, not a physical gesture, so it may not be the best answer.",
    "Smiling (Choice B) is a friendly and inviting gesture often used in social interactions, but it does not always involve physical contact.",
    "Shaking hands (Choice C) is a traditional physical gesture that signifies greeting and acknowledgment, often used in professional and formal contexts.",
    "Sharing a hug (Choice D) is usually reserved for close friends or family members and may not be typical when merely meeting someone for the first time.",
    "Talking (Choice E) is also a verbal action like introducing oneself and does not represent a physical gesture.",
    "Since shaking hands is a well-known gesture specifically associated with introductions and meetings, it stands out as the most likely physical gesture among the other options."
