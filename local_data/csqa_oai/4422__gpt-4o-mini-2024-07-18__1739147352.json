  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location where one would typically expect to see a human eye.",
    "The human eye is a part of the human body and is primarily located within the head.",
    "Considering the provided choices, we can analyze them in relation to the human eye's expected location.",
    "Choice A, \"faces,\" is relevant as the eyes are indeed located on the face. However, it is somewhat broader and may not specifically denote a human eye.",
    "Choice B, \"potato,\" is not a valid option because a potato does not have any biological structure that resembles a human eye.",
    "Choice C, \"person's head,\" directly points to the anatomical structure that houses the eyes, making it a clear and specific location.",
    "Choice D, \"mammal,\" is too broad since it includes many species, and while mammals have eyes, it does not specify \"human.\"",
    "Choice E, \"skull,\" also relates to where the eyes reside, but it is an anatomical context rather than a living aspect of a human being.",
    "Given these considerations, the most direct and specific answer regarding the location of a human eye is choice C, which indicates that the human eye is located in a person's head."
