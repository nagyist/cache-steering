  "query": "Question: James was traveling abroad for a few weeks and he had trouble finding his double edged razor. He eventually found it together with some cream and a small comb.  What did he find it in?\n\nChoices:\nA: medicine cabinet\nB: shower\nC: shaving kit\nD: first aid kit\nE: the breadbox",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James found his double-edged razor along with some cream and a small comb.",
    "A double-edged razor is typically associated with shaving, which would require a shaving cream for use.",
    "The presence of a small comb may suggest grooming items, which are also commonly found in shaving kits.",
    "The options provided include various potential storage areas or kits.",
    "The medicine cabinet is a common place for health-related items but typically lacks shaving-specific items like a razor.",
    "The shower is more of a location where one might shave rather than a place to store grooming items.",
    "The first aid kit is focused on medical supplies and would not logically contain shaving items or a comb.",
    "The breadbox is not a storage location for grooming items, as it is intended for food.",
    "A shaving kit is specifically designed for items related to shaving and grooming, making it the most suitable answer among the choices.",
    "Since the razor, cream, and comb are all related to the act of shaving, it confirms that they are likely stored in a shaving kit."
