  "steps": [
    "The question states that the window of the Honda was hit from the inside, which implies that the glass would shatter outward rather than inward.",
    "Based on the nature of broken glass after a window is struck from the inside, the pieces are likely to fall or be projected outwards.",
    "If the glass breaks inward, we would expect the shards to be found inside the vehicle, but the question specifies that the glass broke outward.",
    "Given that the glass is found outside, we need to consider locations surrounding the vehicle that could logically hold the broken glass.",
    "Among the choices provided, we have locations that are all somewhat generic: bridge, Spain, beach, field, and street.",
    "A 'bridge' likely wouldn't have glass strewn about unless there was an accident on or near it.",
    "'In Spain' seems too far removed and nonspecific from the incident, as broken glass wouldn't be scattered across a country due to a single vehicle incident.",
    "A 'beach' is also a plausible area, but it\u2019s not typically associated with broken glass from a car window unless the car is parked nearby.",
    "A 'field' could also theoretically contain glass if the car were parked or damaged in an open area, but the connection is tenuous.",
    "The most reasonable location for broken glass, given it broke from the inside and ejected outward, is 'street,' as it is common for accidents to occur along roadsides or parked by the street."
