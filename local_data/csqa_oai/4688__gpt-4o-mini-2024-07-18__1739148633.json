  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what a courtyard typically is. A courtyard is an enclosed area, often surrounded by buildings and can be found in various types of architecture.",
    "Next, I should think about what is commonly found within or visible from a courtyard. Since it's an outdoor space, it might have gardens, paths, or areas of grass.",
    "Looking at the choices provided: \n- \"A three headed dragon named Ralph\" sounds fantastical and is unlikely to be something one would typically see in a courtyard.\n- \"Asshole\" is an inappropriate or slang term and does not refer to something visible in a physical sense.\n- \"Lawn\" refers to an area of grass and is a very common feature of courtyards.\n- \"Versailles\" is a landmark and while it could be within someone\u2019s view, it is more of a location rather than something you would directly see *from* a courtyard.\n- \"Spain\" is a country and not something that would be visible from a specific courtyard unless it is specifically located in Spain.",
    "Given this analysis, the only logical and practical answer that fits what can be seen from a courtyard is \"lawn\" since courtyards often have grass areas.",
    "I will confirm that the other options do not fit well with the typical contents or views associated with a courtyard.",
    "After considering all options and their relevance to a courtyard, it's clear that \"lawn\" is the most appropriate choice."
