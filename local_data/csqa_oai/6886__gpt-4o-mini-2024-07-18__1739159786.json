  "query": "Question: Her brother and sister-in-law were coming to visit, she told the kids that uncle and who were coming?\n\nChoices:\nA: aunty\nB: boy\nC: niece\nD: most families\nE: falling down",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions \"her brother and sister-in-law,\" which indicates that the brother's partner (sister-in-law) is the important figure in this context.",
    "\"Sister-in-law\" indicates a female relative, which suggests that she will be referring to her or specifying their relationship when mentioning \"uncle.\"",
    "The question asks what relation she might specify in addition to \"uncle\" when telling her kids who is coming to visit.",
    "Given the context of the question and the mention of \"uncle,\" it is likely that the word that appropriately follows in this family dynamic is \"aunty,\" as it would relate directly back to the \"sister-in-law.\"",
    "Since the only option that relates directly as a familial counterpart to \"uncle\" is \"aunty,\" we can rule out the other options.",
    "Options like \"boy,\" \"niece,\" \"most families,\" and \"falling down\" do not fit the same relational structure as \"uncle\" and do not provide meaningful pertinence to the context of a family visit.",
    "The most logical answer considering the context and familial relationships is thus \"aunty,\" which also is the term that aligns with \"uncle.\""
