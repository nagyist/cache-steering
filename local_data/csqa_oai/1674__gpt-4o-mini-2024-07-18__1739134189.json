  "query": "Question: Billy didn't know what to do.  He had just bought a huge ficus, but he has no where to put it.  It was just too gid for his house.  Right now, the ficus waited outside in something. What is the ficus in?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: large pot\nC: maze\nD: green house\nE: tropical forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the situation described in the question. Billy has a huge ficus plant.",
    "Second, the question mentions that Billy has nowhere to put the ficus because it is too big for his house, indicating that it needs to be kept outside for the time being.",
    "Third, the ficus is currently \"outside in something.\" This suggests that the ficus needs a container or some form of shelter outside.",
    "Fourth, let's consider the answer choices. \n- A: park - this does not suggest a container for the ficus.\n- B: large pot - this implies that the ficus could still be in a suitable container outside. \n- C: maze - this does not relate to a plant being kept outside.\n- D: green house - though this could house the ficus, greenhouses are typically enclosed structures, which might not align with \"outside.\"\n- E: tropical forest - this does not imply any containment and does not fit the scenario of Billy caring for it.",
    "Fifth, since the ficus needs to wait outside and must be in some type of container, the most viable option would be \"large pot.\"",
    "Sixth,\"B: large pot\" directly aligns with the idea of having a large plant that needs to remain contained while being outside.",
    "Seventh, confirming this with the meaning of \"ficus\" which refers to a type of plant that is often potted, reinforces the idea that a \"large pot\" would be the best choice.",
    "Eighth, the other options do not provide a suitable or likely scenario for temporarily keeping the ficus outside.",
    "Ninth, so far, all reasoning leads to the conclusion that the best option is a large pot for the ficus.",
    "Tenth, final verification: A large ficus can certainly be kept in a large pot until a more permanent location is found."
