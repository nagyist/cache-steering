  "query": "Question: What dry state can a lizard be found in?\n\nChoices:\nA: books\nB: tropics\nC: new mexico\nD: dessert\nE: usa",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify which options refer to types of environments or geographical areas.",
    "Options A (books) and D (dessert) are not relevant as they do not describe dry states where lizards can typically be found.",
    "Now, examine the remaining options: B (tropics), C (New Mexico), and E (USA).",
    "Consider the tropics (Option B). While the tropics can be dry, they are generally known for being humid and warm. This does not align with \"dry state.\"",
    "Next, look at New Mexico (Option C). It is known for its dry and desert-like climates, making it a suitable habitat for lizards.",
    "Finally, consider option E (USA). This is a broad term, and while lizards may be found in dry states within the USA, it is less specific than New Mexico.",
    "I conclude that New Mexico is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a dry state where lizards are known to inhabit."
