  "query": "Question: What could happen to a car if it crashes?\n\nChoices:\nA: relaxation\nB: wreak\nC: flowers\nD: car crash\nE: smoke",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider the outcomes of a car crash. The term \"crash\" implies a violent and damaging event for the car.",
    "Among the choices, \"relaxation\" does not fit, as a crash typically causes stress and damage rather than relaxation.",
    "The word \"wreak\" is a verb that means to cause or inflict, but it needs an object, which is not a direct outcome of a crash itself.",
    "\"Flowers\" have no relevance to a car crash, as they are not connected to the events or damage that occur in a crash scenario.",
    "\"Car crash\" describes the event rather than an outcome or a consequence, making it less likely to be a direct effect of a crash.",
    "\"Smoke\" could be an outcome of a car crash, especially if there is a fire involved due to fuel ignition from the crash impact.",
    "Given the reasoning above, \"smoke\" appears to be the most relevant and logical outcome of a car crash."
