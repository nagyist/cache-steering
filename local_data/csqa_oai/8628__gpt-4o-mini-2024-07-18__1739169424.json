  "query": "Question: What does an actor do while acting?\n\nChoices:\nA: branch out\nB: eat curry\nC: wear costume\nD: pretend\nE: sing songs",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the primary activity associated with acting. Acting is generally defined as performing a role in a play, movie, or other production.",
    "Next, we can examine the choices provided. Option A, \"branch out,\" does not specifically relate to the immediate act of acting itself.",
    "Option B, \"eat curry,\" is unrelated to the process of acting and does not occur while performing.",
    "Option C, \"wear costume,\" is indeed something that actors typically do while preparing for and performing roles, but it is not the fundamental activity of acting.",
    "Now, considering option D, \"pretend,\" this is actually a core element of acting. Actors embody characters, bringing them to life in a performative way, which is essentially the act of pretending.",
    "Finally, option E, \"sing songs,\" could be part of a performance, particularly in musicals, but it is not universal to all acting.",
    "Given the analysis, while wearing costumes and singing can be associated with acting, the core and most fundamental aspect is the act of pretending."
