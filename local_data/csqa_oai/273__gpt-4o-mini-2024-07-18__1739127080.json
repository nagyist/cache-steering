    "I need to identify which of the provided answer choices relates to the idea of examining or getting information from books.",

    "Choice B \"go somewhere\" does not relate to the context of examining books or chapters at all.",
    "Choice C \"knit\" is completely unrelated to the context of books or examining them.",
