  "query": "Question: His hair was getting long enough that it could be put in a ponytail, so he headed to this place to have what happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: combed when not straight\nB: coloured\nC: cut there\nD: braided\nE: washed",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that his hair is long enough for a ponytail, which suggests he is looking to manage or change his hairstyle.",
    "Given the context, options like \"coloured,\" \"washed,\" and \"braided\" could be possibilities, but they do not necessarily imply that a change in length will occur.",
    "\"Combed when not straight\" suggests maintenance rather than a significant change to the hair\u2019s length or style.",
    "The most relevant option regarding managing long hair for the purpose of appearance and ease of handling would be to \"cut\" it.",
    "Since he is going to a place for a specific action regarding his long hair, \"cut\" aligns best with common intentions when hair reaches a certain length.",
    "Thus, the decision to \"cut\" the hair would fit the scenario well, as it implies a need for upkeep or style adjustment that is relevant when hair becomes long."
