  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the context of the sentence. Amelia is trying to aim for a small isle, which suggests she's in a body of water.",
    "Next, we consider the options provided. \"Ocean\" and \"sea\" suggest large bodies of saltwater, while \"pool\" is a man-made structure. \"Auditorium\" doesn\u2019t fit the context as it's a type of building.",
    "Given that an \"isle\" typically refers to a small island, it's more plausible that it's located within either the ocean or the sea rather than a pool or an auditorium.",
    "The phrase \"the water of the what was coming on fast\" implies a significant movement of water. Large bodies of water like the ocean or sea would match this description, while a pool would not typically have fast-moving water.",
    "Now we narrow down the options to either the ocean or the sea, both of which can have fast currents or waves.",
    "Considering that \"ocean\" represents a vast and generally more turbulent body of water compared to a sea, the context of fast-moving water could indeed be more accurately attributed to the ocean.",
    "While a sea can also have strong waters, the likelihood of it being described in such a dramatic way in this context might lean more towards the ocean.",
    "I will double-check the implications of both choices. \"Ocean\" suggests vastness and strong currents, while \"sea\" is more commonly used for water that can be both calm and choppy.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, \"ocean\" fits the scenario of fast-moving water heading towards Amelia as she tries to reach an isle more aptly than the term \"sea.\""
