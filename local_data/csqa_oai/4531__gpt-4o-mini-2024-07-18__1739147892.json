  "query": "Question: Where do people say god is at all times?\n\nChoices:\nA: give peace\nB: judge people\nC: everywhere\nD: anything\nE: work miracles",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It inquires about a common belief or saying regarding the omnipresence of God.",
    "Next, we consider the choices given. \"Give peace\" (A) and \"work miracles\" (E) both imply actions and not locations or states of being.",
    "Now let's examine \"judge people\" (B). While some may believe that God judges everyone, it does not specifically address where God is said to be.",
    "Then we look at \"everywhere\" (C). This option suggests the idea of God's omnipresence, which aligns with many religious beliefs that God is present in all places at all times.",
    "Finally, \"anything\" (D) is too vague and does not specifically relate to God's presence.",
    "After reviewing all options and considering the context of the question, it becomes clear that \"everywhere\" (C) is the most fitting answer."
