    "To understand the question, \"My company is vertical,\" I need to clarify what a vertical company means. It usually refers to a business that operates within a single industry and controls multiple stages of its supply chain. For example, a company that manufactures, sells, and distributes its own products.",
    "The term \"horizontal\" in business typically refers to a company that diversifies its operations across different industries or products. A horizontal company would seek to enter new markets or offer a variety of products, rather than focusing on one vertical line of business.",
    "The options provided include different strategies for potentially making a vertical company more horizontal. I need to analyze each choice carefully to determine which one best aligns with the transition from vertical to horizontal structure.",
    "Choice A, \"branch out,\" suggests expanding into new products or markets, which aligns with the concept of horizontal growth. This could be a viable option for making a vertical company more horizontal.",
    "Choice B, \"ship goods,\" primarily involves logistics and distribution but does not necessarily pertain to changing the company's structure from vertical to horizontal. This choice does not directly address the question.",
    "Choice C, \"commit crime,\" is not a viable option for altering business structure. Engaging in illegal activities is not an acceptable strategy for business operation.",
    "Choice D, \"change strategies,\" is quite broad. It may refer to altering business practices, which could indirectly lead to horizontal growth, but it lacks specificity about how to achieve that transition.",
    "Choice E, \"own resources,\" indicates vertical integration by acquiring control over necessary components of the supply chain. This would reinforce a vertical business model rather than shifting it to a more horizontal one.",
    "Out of all the explanations, \"branch out\" (Choice A) explicitly suggests the action of entering new markets or diversifying product lines, which is the clearest method of transitioning from a vertical to a more horizontal business model."
