  "query": "Question: What do humans often do while they're asleep?\n\nChoices:\nA: dream dreams\nB: think critically\nC: drink coffee\nD: cross road\nE: earn money",
  "steps": [
    "Humans spend a significant portion of their lives sleeping, which raises questions about what activities occur during this state.",
    "One common phenomenon associated with sleep is dreaming, which is a mental activity that happens primarily during the REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep.",
    "The option \"dream dreams\" clearly relates to the act of dreaming, which is widely recognized as a common experience for many people while they sleep.",
    "The other options suggest activities that are typically not associated with sleep, such as thinking critically (B), drinking coffee (C), crossing a road (D), or earning money (E).",
    "Thinking critically requires conscious attention and is unlikely to occur while asleep, as the brain is in a different state during sleep.",
    "Drinking coffee is clearly an action that requires waking consciousness, as it involves ingestion and alertness.",
    "Crossing a road requires awareness of one\u2019s environment and the ability to respond to potential dangers, which is impossible while unconscious asleep.",
    "Earning money generally implies active engagement in work or business activities, which cannot occur during sleep.",
    "Therefore, after considering all the options and their relation to the state of being asleep, the only viable answer that aligns with common human behavior during sleep is dreaming."
