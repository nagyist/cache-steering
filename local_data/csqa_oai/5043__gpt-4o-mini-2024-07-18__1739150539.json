  "query": "Question: The teacher didn't just want the answer and work shown but also for the students to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: prepare dinner\nB: evaluate progress\nC: include examples\nD: work in school\nE: prove their point",
  "steps": [
    "The teacher has specific expectations beyond just giving the answer and showing the work, indicating a deeper level of understanding is required.",
    "The answer choices suggest various activities or tasks that may be deemed important in the learning process.",
    "Choice A (\"prepare dinner\") is irrelevant in the context of a classroom setting. It does not relate to educational tasks.",
    "Choice B (\"evaluate progress\") could be relevant but seems more aligned with the teacher's approach to overall assessment rather than what students must do alongside showing their work.",
    "Choice C (\"include examples\") suggests that students should support their answers with further illustration or clarification, which aligns well with the idea of demonstrating understanding.",
    "Choice D (\"work in school\") seems vague and does not add any distinct value to the teacher's specific request.",
    "Choice E (\"prove their point\") implies the students need to defend their answers, which could be an aspect of providing justified reasoning but isn't the most direct interpretation of wanting an answer and work shown.",
    "Considering these analyses, including examples is a common educational practice that helps solidify a student\u2019s understanding, fitting well with the requirement of showing work.",
    "Thus, the most comprehensive answer that captures what the teacher desires the students to do in addition to giving the answers and showing the work is to include examples."
