    "After a concert is performed, the audience typically reacts to the performance in various ways.",
    "One common reaction from the audience after a concert is expressing their enjoyment or appreciation for the performance.",
    "Applause is a well-known way for the audience to show their appreciation for performers after a concert.",
    "The other choices can also relate to a concert, but they don't directly reflect a reaction from the audience.",
    "Smiling (choice A) can happen, but it is not guaranteed or specific to after a concert; it is more general.",
    "Music (choice B) is part of the concert itself, not a consequence of finishing it.",
    "Medium (choice C) doesn't directly relate to the aftermath of a concert performance.",
    "Accomplish (choice E) may be relevant to the performers but does not pertain specifically to the experience of the audience post-concert.",
