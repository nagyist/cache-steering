  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes the new play as a highly attended performance of the year, indicating a strong positive response from the audience.",
    "Considering the context of a play, audiences generally express their enjoyment through actions that show approval or appreciation.",
    "\"Admiration\" could imply a positive response, but it does not specifically describe an action that an audience would physically do during a performance.",
    "\"Applaud\" is a common and direct action that audiences take in response to a performance they enjoy, making it a strong candidate.",
    "\"Make reservations\" is related to attendance at the performance, but it does not describe the immediate reaction of the audience during the show.",
    "\"Experience\" is more of a general term and does not explicitly convey an action taken by the audience as a response to the performance.",
    "\"Sleep\" would be the opposite of an engaged audience reaction, as one would not stand and sleep during a performance.",
    "To summarize, the most appropriate action that fits the context of the audience's reaction while standing is \"applaud.\""
