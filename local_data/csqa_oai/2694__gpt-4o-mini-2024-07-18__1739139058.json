  "steps": [
    "To determine where most people store their fortune, I need to analyze the options provided.",
    "The first option is \"imagination.\" This is a place where people may think about wealth, but it is not a practical location for storing actual fortune.",
    "The second option is \"bank.\" Banks are commonly known for securely storing money and valuables, making it a very practical and realistic choice for storing one's fortune.",
    "The third option is \"cookie.\" This option is likely a reference to a fortune cookie, which contains a paper fortune or proverb. However, this does not represent a method for storing wealth.",
    "The fourth option is \"treasure chest.\" While a treasure chest is often depicted in stories as a place to store valuables, it is not a commonly used option in the modern world for securing fortunes.",
    "The fifth option is \"gold.\" While gold itself can be considered a store of wealth, it is not a place or method for storing wealth but rather a physical form of fortune.",
    "Upon reviewing these options, the most practical and commonly accepted answer for where most people would store their fortune is the bank, as it provides security and accessibility for money and valuable items."
