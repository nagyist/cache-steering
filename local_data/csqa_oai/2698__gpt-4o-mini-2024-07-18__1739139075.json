  "query": "Question: He used hair styling gel, he kept it where?\n\nChoices:\nA: tube\nB: outside\nC: store\nD: bathroom\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a person would keep hair styling gel.",
    "Hair styling products like gel are typically used in a bathroom setting, as they are part of grooming routines.",
    "It is unlikely that hair styling gel would be stored in a tube, as a tube is typically a form of packaging rather than a storage location.",
    "\"Outside\" does not seem like a suitable option for storing hair products, as they can be affected by weather conditions.",
    "A \"store\" refers to a place of retail, where products are sold, but not a location where one would keep their personal hair products.",
    "A \"refrigerator\" is also not a common place for storing hair styling products, as they do not require refrigeration.",
    "Considering all options, the bathroom stands out as the most logical choice for where a person would keep hair styling gel."
