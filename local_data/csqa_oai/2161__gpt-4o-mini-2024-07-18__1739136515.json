  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations that are typically associated with shows or performances.",
    "Theater is a well-known venue specifically designed for performances, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Weddings can have entertainment but are not primarily considered a venue for shows.",
    "Gardens can host events, but they are not specifically designed for shows or performances.",
    "Opera houses are specialized venues for operatic performances, which involve shows but are more specific than the general concept of a show.",
    "Conventions usually focus on exhibits and presentations rather than typical shows, so they are also less likely.",
    "Comparing the viable options, both theater and opera are strong contenders.",
    "However, the word 'theater' generally encompasses a broader range of shows than 'opera', which is specifically focused on operatic performances.",
    "Given the context of the question and the typical usage of the word, the most appropriate venue for enjoying a show in a general sense is the theater."
