  "query": "Question: What does killing people induce in a normal person?\n\nChoices:\nA: feelings of guilt\nB: prison sentence\nC: going to jail\nD: jailed\nE: getting time",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the effects of killing people on a \"normal person,\" which implies that we are considering the psychological and emotional responses rather than legal consequences.",
    "Killing another person is often associated with strong emotions, especially in individuals who have not previously harmed others.",
    "Feelings of guilt are common psychological reactions for many people when they commit acts that violate moral or ethical beliefs, such as taking a life.",
    "While legal consequences such as prison sentences, being jailed, or getting time (imprisonment) may follow as a result of killing someone, these are not the immediate emotional effects on a normal person.",
    "The remaining options that could pertain to emotional or psychological responses are those linked to guilt.",
    "All the other options (B, C, D, and E) are focused on legal consequences rather than feelings experienced by a person who has committed such an act.",
    "Since the question specifically asks about what killing induces in a normal person, the most appropriate choice is focusing on their emotional state, particularly guilt.",
    "Thus, the conclusion is that the killing of people induces feelings of guilt in a normal person."
