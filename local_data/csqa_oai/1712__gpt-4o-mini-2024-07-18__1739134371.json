    "The question asks where a person would use an expressway to navigate quickly.",
    "Expressways are typically designed for fast and efficient travel over long distances, and are commonly found in urban and suburban areas, especially in the United States.",
    "We need to consider the provided choices: A (medium), B (country), C (eastern United States), D (American city), and E (Michigan).",
    "Choice A (medium) does not fit, as it is not a specific location or area that could use expressways.",
    "Choice B (country) is vague and does not refer to a specific area where expressways can be commonly utilized.",
    "Choice C (eastern United States) is a large region that has many expressways and highways for quick travel.",
    "Choice D (American city) is also a valid place where expressways are commonly used, as cities often have expressways to facilitate quick transportation.",
    "Choice E (Michigan) could also be a correct answer, as expressways are present there, but it is a more specific area compared to the broader contexts of eastern United States or American cities.",
    "Comparing the choices, options C and D both account for places where expressways are prevalent, but C (eastern United States) is broader and encompasses more travel opportunities.",
    "However, I note that D (American city) might have more direct relevance regarding the daily use of expressways in a city context."
