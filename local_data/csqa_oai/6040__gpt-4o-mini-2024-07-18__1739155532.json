  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a land mass feature where one would see a gazelle in the wild.",
    "Gazelles are known to inhabit open plains and savannas, primarily in Africa and parts of Asia.",
    "Option A, \"encyclopedia,\" is not a land mass feature and has no relevance to seeing gazelles.",
    "Option C, \"asia,\" is a continent, but it does not specifically refer to a land mass feature or environment where gazelles are commonly found.",
    "Option D, \"ivory coast,\" refers to a specific country in West Africa. While there may be gazelles present, it is not a generalized land mass feature like open plains.",
    "Option E, \"breakfast,\" is not related to land mass features and is irrelevant in this context.",
    "This leaves us primarily with the option for \"open plain\" (Option B) as the correct answer since gazelles are most commonly found in open plains."
