  "steps": [
    "The question asks what one would want to prevent after sustaining an injury. It is important to prioritize aspects that are likely to lead to worse outcomes if not addressed.",
    "Option A states \"for it to become worse.\" This is a general statement and could encompass several situations, but it doesn't specifically detail a particular concern.",
    "Option B states \"become infected.\" Infection is a common complication of injuries that can lead to serious health issues, making this a valid concern.",
    "Option C states \"hurts.\" While pain is a significant aspect of an injury, it is often a symptom rather than a condition that leads to further deterioration.",
    "Option D states \"cause bleeding.\" Controlling bleeding is critical immediately after an injury to prevent further complications, making this a strong choice.",
    "Option E states \"cause death.\" While this is a serious concern, it's less likely to be a direct outcome of most minor injuries and is generally relevant in more severe or specific situations.",
    "Now, comparing the strengthened arguments of options B and D, both address serious outcomes, but preventing infection (B) often requires more ongoing management than just controlling bleeding (D), which tends to be an immediate concern.",
    "Though avoiding pain (C) is valid, it does not necessarily prevent the key issues that can arise from injuries like infection or severe complications from bleeding.",
    "Thus, preventing potential infection is critical following an injury as it can lead to severe complications if not managed properly."
