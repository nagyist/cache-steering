  "steps": [
    "The question involves an action a person takes when they anticipate something arriving, but the exact time of arrival is not known.",
    "Among the choices, some actions seem to be more relevant to the concept of anticipation while others do not directly relate to waiting for an arrival.",
    "Choice A (\"washing dishes\") does not relate to anticipation and tends to imply a more active pursuit rather than passive waiting.",
    "Choice C (\"stand erect\") refers more to posture than to an action taken in anticipation of something arriving.",
    "Choice D (\"cross street\") implies an action taken to move from one place to another, which doesn't directly connect to the context of waiting.",
    "Choice E (\"waiting room\") refers to a physical space designated for waiting and does imply waiting but not the act itself, which may be less directly relevant.",
    "Choice B (\"wait patiently\") directly embodies the idea of patiently anticipating something without specific time constraints.",
    "Among all the options, \"wait patiently\" is the most relevant choice as it describes exactly what a person would do when something is arriving at an undisclosed time."
