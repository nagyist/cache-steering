    "Now, I need to identify which options are relevant places or items for purchasing both frozen food and party supplies.",
    "The option \"A: grocery store\" typically sells both frozen food and various party supplies like snacks, paper plates, and plastic utensils.",
    "Option \"B: refrigerator\" is an appliance designed primarily for cold storage of fresh food, and not intended for purchasing items.",
    "Option \"C: freezer\" is also an appliance, specifically for storing frozen items, and does not serve as a purchasing location.",
    "Option \"D: fridge\" is another appliance focused on storing fresh items, not for purchasing.",
    "Option \"E: supermarket\" is typically a larger retail establishment that carries a wide variety of products, including both frozen food and party supplies.",
