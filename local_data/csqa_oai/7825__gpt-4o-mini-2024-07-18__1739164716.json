  "steps": [
    "To determine where someone might keep personal soap, we need to think about common storage locations for personal hygiene products.",
    "Personal soap is typically used in personal grooming, so it is often kept in places associated with daily hygiene routines.",
    "One logical choice is the 'own home' where people usually have personal items like soap for bathing and cleaning.",
    "Additionally, soap can be stored in a 'cabinet', which is a specific place within the home, such as a bathroom cabinet.",
    "Next, we evaluate the other options: \n- A birthday party is unlikely to be a place where personal soap is stored, as it's more about celebration.\n- A supermarket is where soap may be purchased, not stored personally.\n- Jail could potentially provide soap, but it wouldn't be considered personal soap in the way we are interpreting it.",
    "Since 'own home' is a broader answer that includes various places where personal soap might be kept, and 'cabinet' is a more specific location which also fits but is still part of the home, we focus on the most comprehensive answer.",
    "We should conclude that the best answer covers the personal ownership and typical storage location."
