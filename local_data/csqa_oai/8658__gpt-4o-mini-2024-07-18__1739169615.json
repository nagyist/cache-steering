  "query": "Question: When she would wait tables she had to listen to and what?\n\nChoices:\nA: serve customers\nB: serve food\nC: tipping\nD: write\nE: wash hands",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about an activity that occurs while waiting tables, indicating that it relates to the responsibilities of a waitress.",
    "The primary responsibility of a waitress includes interacting with customers, which involves both listening to them and serving them in various capacities.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"serve customers\" (A) directly relates to the actions a waitress must take when waiting tables.",
    "\"Serve food\" (B) is also a valid responsibility but it doesn't encompass the aspect of \"listening to\" while waiting tables as the question implies a dual focus.",
    "\"Tipping\" (C) isn\u2019t an action that she performs while waiting tables; rather, it's a practice that occurs as a response to her service.",
    "\"Write\" (D) could refer to taking orders, but the phrasing of the question suggests a focus on what she has to listen to, which again emphasizes customer interaction.",
    "\"Washing hands\" (E) is a hygiene practice but is not directly tied to listening or serving customers in the context of waiting tables.",
    "Comparing the relevant entries, \"serve customers\" (A) clearly encompasses both the listening and serving aspects more holistically."
