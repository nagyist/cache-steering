  "query": "Question: What do people do in the cold?\n\nChoices:\nA: complete job\nB: wear hats\nC: wear shorts\nD: believe in god\nE: kill animals",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the typical activities people engage in when it is cold outside.",
    "I know that cold weather often influences how people dress in order to stay warm.",
    "Wearing hats is a common practice in cold weather because it helps retain body heat.",
    "I also consider the other options: completing a job could happen in any weather, not specifically in cold.",
    "Wearing shorts is contrary to what people generally do in cold conditions, as shorts are typically worn in warm weather.",
    "Believing in a deity is not directly affected by temperature; thus, it is irrelevant to the question.",
    "Killing animals can occur for various reasons but is not a direct response to cold weather.",
    "Based on this analysis, wearing hats stands out as the activity most associated with cold weather.",
    "I will now double-check the options to ensure that wearing hats is indeed the most relevant action.",
    "Out of all the options, only wearing hats is specifically necessary for coping with cold temperatures."
