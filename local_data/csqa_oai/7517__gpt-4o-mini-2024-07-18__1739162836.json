  "steps": [
    "First, consider the items being purchased: a potato, carrots, strawberries, and bananas. These are all grocery items that typically need to be carried home.",
    "Next, think about how one usually transports groceries. Common items used for this purpose include shopping bags, baskets, or carts.",
    "Evaluate the options given in the choices. \"Restaurants\" (A) does not relate to carrying groceries, as it refers to places where food is served.",
    "\"Two wheels\" (C) could suggest a bicycle but is too vague to be a method for carrying groceries. Additionally, a bicycle would require a way to securely carry the items.",
    "\"Vegetable soup\" (D) does not apply either, as it's a dish that does not help with carrying groceries. It is unrelated to the task of transporting them home.",
    "Finally, \"exhaust pipe\" (E) does not make sense in the context of carrying groceries, as it refers to a component of a vehicle and has no functional relationship with grocery transport.",
    "Thus, out of all the options, the only logical choice that directly relates to carrying the groceries is \"shopping bags\" (B)."
