  "query": "Question: Where might a chess set outside get frozen?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: dorm\nC: cupboard\nD: toy store\nE: snow",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the locations mentioned in the choices and whether they typically have conditions where a chess set could freeze outside.",
    "Michigan is known for cold winters, where temperatures can drop below freezing. It is possible for an outdoor chess set to freeze there.",
    "\"Dorm\" refers to a type of student housing, typically located on a campus. This is an indoor setting and would not be a place where a chess set could freeze outside.",
    "A \"cupboard\" is also an indoor storage space, making it unlikely for a chess set to freeze there.",
    "A \"toy store\" is typically indoors where toys are sold. Like the prior choices, this is not a place where a chess set would freeze outside.",
    "\"Snow\" refers to frozen precipitation, which can occur anywhere cold enough. A chess set could be outside and get covered in snow, thus freezing, but this is not a specific location.",
    "Among the options, Michigan is the only place that is both a location and suitable for a chess set to freeze outside due to extreme cold in winter.",
    "Review the choices once more. \"Michigan\" stands out as the only location where outdoor freezing could feasibly occur."
