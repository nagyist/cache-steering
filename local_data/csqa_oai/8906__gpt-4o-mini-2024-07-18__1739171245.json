  "steps": [
    "To determine where instruments for science are used, I need to consider the context of scientific work and the types of instruments involved.",
    "Science typically involves investigation and experimentation, which requires precise tools and instruments.",
    "Choices such as \"dentist's office,\" \"gas station,\" and \"operating room\" may use instruments, but they are more specialized for specific fields (dentistry, automotive services, and surgery).",
    "A \"case\" is too vague without specific context and doesn't inherently imply a scientific application.",
    "A \"laboratory\" is a dedicated space for scientific research and experimentation, equipped with various scientific instruments.",
    "I can eliminate options A, B, C, and E based on their primary purposes not being focused on scientific experimentation.",
    "The only option left with a clear connection to science and the usage of multiple scientific instruments is D, \"laboratory.\"",
    "Thus, laboratories are the main environments where scientific instruments are employed for experiments and research."
