    "Mexico is known for its beautiful beaches, such as Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum, which attract many tourists.",
    "I should also consider other types of attractions, such as natural sites, cultural attractions, and theme parks.",
    "Zoos exist in Mexico, but they are generally less frequented by tourists compared to natural attractions or beaches.",
    "Waterfalls do exist, such as the famous Cascadas de Agua Azul, but they attract a smaller audience compared to beaches.",
    "Homes are not typically tourist attractions and are usually private properties, thus not a common choice for tourists to frequent.",
    "Disneyland does not exist in Mexico, but there is a theme park called \"Xcaret\" which is popular. However, it's not as internationally recognized as Disney parks.",
    "Based on typical tourist behavior, beaches are a major attraction in Mexico, drawing the highest number of visitors.",
