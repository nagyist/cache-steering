  "query": "Question: What do airplanes do as they are beginning to take off?\n\nChoices:\nA: speed up\nB: carry people\nC: stop\nD: slow down\nE: crash",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the process of taking off in aviation. Airplanes need to generate enough lift to become airborne.",
    "Next, understand that lift is generated by the wings of the airplane, which requires a certain speed to be achieved.",
    "During takeoff, the airplane must accelerate down the runway to reach this necessary speed.",
    "Given this context, \"speed up\" is a process that clearly describes what happens as an airplane takes off.",
    "Next, analyze the other choices: \"carry people\" is a general description of an airplane's function rather than a specific action during takeoff.",
    "\"Stop\" contradicts the takeoff process, as it implies that the airplane ceases movement, which would prevent it from getting airborne.",
    "\"Slow down\" also contradicts the need for the airplane to gain speed for takeoff.",
    "\"Crash\" is an extreme event that does not relate to the normal operations of airplanes during takeoff unless there is a serious malfunction.",
    "Therefore, the only logical conclusion based on the operation of an airplane during takeoff is that it must \"speed up.\""
