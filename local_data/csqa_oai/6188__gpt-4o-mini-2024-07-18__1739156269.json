  "query": "Question: The sunshine was quickly burning up the crew, it seemed to not only beat down from about but also from below by reflecting off the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: moon\nB: sea\nC: beach\nD: sun\nE: desktop",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that the sunshine was burning up the crew, suggesting an intense heat or brightness from multiple directions.",
    "It mentions the sun beating down from above, indicating the primary source of sunlight is indeed from the sun.",
    "The phrase \"reflecting off\" suggests that there is a surface that reflects light back towards the crew, intensifying their exposure to the sun.",
    "Out of the provided options, the moon, sea, beach, sun, and desktop, we need to identify which could reflect sunlight naturally.",
    "The moon reflects sunlight, but it\u2019s not relevant in this context since it is not below the crew as described in the sentence.",
    "The sun cannot reflect light off itself as per the context because it is the source of light.",
    "The desktop is not a natural reflector of sunlight in an outdoor context.",
    "Between the sea and the beach, both are plausible reflectors of sunlight.",
    "The sea is known to have reflective properties due to its surface, and the reflection could create the illusion of the sun coming from below.",
    "The beach can also reflect sunlight, but generally, it's the water (sea) that reflects sunlight significantly because of its surface area and movement."
