  "steps": [
    "To determine the type of advertisement he opened, I need to consider the medium indicated by the phrase \"after reading the subject line.\"",
    "The phrase \"subject line\" is commonly associated with emails. It typically refers to the short summary or title that appears in the inbox before an email is opened.",
    "Comparing other options: \n- A magazine ad does not have a subject line in the same sense; advertisements in magazines typically have titles but not subject lines.",
    "- Mail ads (physical mail) may have headlines but not subject lines; they are usually envelopes with addresses.",
    "- \"La ville\" does not fit the context of advertisement types relevant to a \"subject line.\"",
    "- Web page ads usually don't have subject lines either, as they are typically embedded within the content or displayed as banners.",
    "Given the familiarity of \"subject line\" with email communications, it leads me to conclude that the advertisement he opened was most likely an email advertisement."
