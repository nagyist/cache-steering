  "query": "Question: The Coast Guard is a police force that often does what?\n\nChoices:\nA: board vessels\nB: direct traffic\nC: ocean\nD: force law\nE: arrest",
  "steps": [
    "The Coast Guard is known for its law enforcement responsibilities. This includes maintaining safety and security on the waterways.",
    "One of the primary functions of the Coast Guard is to inspect and board vessels to ensure they meet safety and regulatory compliance.",
    "The options provided include various functions that could relate to a police force. I need to determine which option closely aligns with the Coast Guard's responsibilities.",
    "The option \"board vessels\" (A) accurately describes the action taken by Coast Guard personnel during inspections or to enforce maritime law.",
    "The option \"direct traffic\" (B) is more associated with land-based police and does not apply to the Coast Guard's main functions in a maritime context.",
    "The option \"ocean\" (C) does not represent an action and is not applicable as a primary duty of the Coast Guard.",
    "The option \"force law\" (D) is vague and does not specifically describe a typical action taken by the Coast Guard.",
    "The option \"arrest\" (E) is related but is a subset of the broader action and responsible function of boarding vessels and ensuring compliance.",
    "While arresting individuals is part of the Coast Guard's authority, the most definitive action that represents their enforcement duties is boarding vessels.",
    "Thus, after analyzing all options, the best answer to the question is \"board vessels.\""
