  "query": "Question: What can occur in fencing if you are not careful?\n\nChoices:\nA: competition\nB: severe injuries\nC: fever\nD: perspiration\nE: small cuts",
  "steps": [
    "In fencing, participants engage in fast-paced actions with sharp blades, which could lead to accidents if not handled carefully.",
    "One main concern in fencing is the potential for severe injuries due to stabs or cuts from the swords, especially in high-intensity situations.",
    "Another possible outcome from being careless in fencing could be small cuts, which could occur from the edges of the weapon or accidental contact.",
    "However, while small cuts might be a concern, severe injuries represent a more serious risk factor often highlighted in contact sports like fencing.",
    "While competition, fever, and perspiration can occur in fencing, they are not direct risks associated with a lack of carefulness in the practice.",
    "Fever is unrelated to the activity of fencing itself and is more of a medical condition.",
    "Perspiration is a natural part of any physical activity and is not a risk associated with careless actions.",
    "Therefore, the primary risks of being careless in fencing are severe injuries or small cuts.",
    "Since severe injuries encompass a broader range of potential outcomes and are generally considered more serious than small cuts, they should be prioritized in the answer."
