  "query": "Question: What force keeps objects on the surface of the earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: tectonic plates\nB: the sun\nC: one moon\nD: gravity\nE: four seasons",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the force that keeps objects on the surface of the Earth.",
    "Objects are kept on the Earth due to a fundamental force that attracts them towards the Earth's center.",
    "This force is known as gravity, which is a force of attraction between masses.",
    "Tectonic plates are related to geological movements and do not directly keep objects on the surface of the Earth.",
    "The sun exerts gravitational force, but it is not the primary force keeping objects on the Earth's surface.",
    "The moon does exert gravitational influence, causing tides, but it does not directly keep objects grounded on Earth.",
    "The four seasons are the result of the tilt of Earth's axis and its orbit around the sun, not a force keeping objects on the surface.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the only option that describes this attractive force is gravity."
