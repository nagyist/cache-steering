  "query": "Question: Where would you see a performer at a gathering of you friends?\n\nChoices:\nA: cinema\nB: opera\nC: party\nD: stage\nE: dance",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what type of gathering typically includes performers. A gathering with friends usually implies a more casual or social setting.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices given. The cinema is more of a passive entertainment venue where people watch movies rather than interact with performers.",
    "The opera is a formal event with performances, but it is not usually associated with casual gatherings among friends.",
    "A party is a social event where friends gather, and it may include various types of entertainment, including performers, such as musicians or DJs.",
    "The stage choice suggests a specific area where performances happen, but it is not necessarily a gathering place itself where friends meet.",
    "The dance option indicates a performance type, but does not specifically point to a gathering context with friends.",
    "Considering all of the options, a party is most aligned with a gathering of friends where a performer could be present.",
    "I will double-check if a performer could be found at any of the other locations. While it's possible to have performers at the cinema and opera, these are not synonymous with gatherings of friends.",
    "Conclusion drawn is that a party is the best fit for where a performer would typically be seen at a gathering of friends."
