  "query": "Question: How can a company get things to their customers?\n\nChoices:\nA: mail order\nB: carrier pigeon\nC: own factory\nD: ship goods\nE: commit crime",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the various methods a company can use to deliver products to customers.",
    "Mail order is a legitimate method where customers can order items via mail and expect delivery.",
    "Carrier pigeons are not a practical or reliable method for delivering goods across distances in modern times.",
    "Having an own factory could enable a company to produce goods but does not directly address the delivery method to customers.",
    "Shipping goods is a common and effective method for getting products to customers, especially over long distances.",
    "Committing a crime such as theft or illegal delivery would not be a legitimate or ethical means to get products to customers.",
    "Based on the evaluation, mail order and shipping goods are both valid answers.",
    "However, mail order is a specific type of shipping, whereas \"ship goods\" includes all forms of shipping and is a more comprehensive answer.",
    "Thus, the best choice from the options that directly addresses how a company can get things to customers is to \"ship goods.\""
