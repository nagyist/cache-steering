  "query": "Question: If one sees a fox and is standing in a coastal, gulf state, where is this person?\n\nChoices:\nA: alabama\nB: louisiana\nC: south carolina\nD: arkansas\nE: mountains",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify what a coastal, gulf state is. Coastal, gulf states are those that border the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "The U.S. states that have coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.",
    "Next, we consider the presence of a fox in these states. Foxes are common wildlife throughout the United States, including in coastal regions.",
    "Now, we can evaluate the answer choices. The options include Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Arkansas, and mountains.",
    "We can eliminate South Carolina from consideration because it does not border the Gulf of Mexico; it is on the Atlantic coast.",
    "Next, we eliminate Arkansas because it is landlocked and also does not border the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "The remaining options are Alabama and Louisiana, both of which are coastal and do border the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "Since the question specifically states \"coastal, gulf state\" and asks where \"this person\" is based on seeing a fox and doesn't provide other geographic context, it suggests a continuing focus on the Gulf, indicating Louisiana or Alabama is more fitting, given that they both fall under the criteria.",
    "To narrow it down further, Alabama is to the east of Louisiana along the Gulf coast. If we are looking at a broader sense of the coastal experience or common wildlife, Louisiana might be a more typical answer as it is often associated with rich wildlife habitats."
