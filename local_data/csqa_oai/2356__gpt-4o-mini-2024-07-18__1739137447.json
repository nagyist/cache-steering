  "query": "Question: What is the largest group of books in North America?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk\nB: school house\nC: library of congress\nD: closet\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which option represents the largest group of books, we need to consider the meanings of each option provided.",
    "Option A, \"desk,\" refers to a piece of furniture and typically holds only a limited number of books, so it is not a group or collection.",
    "Option B, \"school house,\" refers to a building for educational purposes. It may contain multiple books, but it is not specifically defined as a large collection of books.",
    "Option C, \"library of congress,\" is known as the largest library in the world. It has millions of books and serves as a significant repository for knowledge and information.",
    "Option D, \"closet,\" is also a storage space that may contain books, but again, it is not comparable to a large collection or repository of books.",
    "Option E, \"classroom,\" refers to a space for teaching and learning. A classroom may have textbooks and other educational materials but does not represent a large collection of books like a library does.",
    "Considering the evaluation of all options, the \"library of congress\" stands out as the only choice that embodies the concept of a large and organized collection of books.",
    "Before concluding, let's confirm that the Library of Congress indeed contains over 170 million items, making it significantly larger than any of the other choices."
