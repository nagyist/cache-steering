  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which pertains to a work environment where people are gathered.",
    "Analyze the choices provided: kitchen, poker, meeting, living room, and internet cafe.",
    "Consider \"kitchen\" - while people may occasionally gather in a kitchen at work, it is typically for breaks or meals rather than formal discussions.",
    "Next, evaluate \"poker\" - this is a game played socially, not typically associated with work-related discussions or gatherings.",
    "Examine \"meeting\" - this choice strongly aligns with the context as meetings usually involve sitting around a table to discuss work-related topics.",
    "Look at \"living room\" - while a living room may be a place where informal discussions happen, it is not typically a setting for work-related gatherings.",
    "Assess \"internet cafe\" - while people may use this for work, it does not typically involve sitting around a table in a formal manner.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, it's evident that \"meeting\" is the only option that involves formal gathering at a table in a work context.",
    "Conclude that the most logical and contextually appropriate answer to the question is \"meeting.\""
