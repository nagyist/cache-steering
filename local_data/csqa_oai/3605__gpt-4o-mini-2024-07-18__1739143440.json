  "query": "Question: He was thanking everybody for coming, he gave them each a big what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shake hands\nB: appreciation\nC: happy\nD: feel good\nE: smile",
  "steps": [
    "The context states that he was thanking everybody for coming, implying a gesture of gratitude and warmth.",
    "Among the options, a physical gesture like \"shake hands\" (choice A) could make sense, but it typically represents a greeting or parting, rather than a thank-you.",
    "\"Appreciation\" (choice B) refers to a feeling or expression of gratitude but is not something he could physically give to each person.",
    "\"Happy\" (choice C) is an emotion and cannot be given, so it doesn't fit the context.",
    "\"Feel good\" (choice D) also refers to an emotional state and cannot be bestowed on others in a tangible way.",
    "\"A smile\" (choice E) is a physical expression of warmth and friendliness that can be shared with others, making it relevant to thanking someone.",
    "Considering the act of giving something as a token of thanks, a smile is a common and warm gesture in such contexts.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most suitable choice for what he gave to each person when thanking them is a smile."
