  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location to put a ficus to protect it from the rain.",
    "A ficus is a type of plant that may not thrive well in overly wet conditions.",
    "The options provided suggest different environments where a ficus could be placed.",
    "An arboretum (choice A) is an outdoor space typically used for growing trees and shrubs, which wouldn't protect the ficus from rain.",
    "The ground (choice B) implies an outdoor setting, which again would expose the ficus to rain.",
    "An apartment (choice C) suggests an indoor living environment, which would effectively protect the ficus from rain.",
    "California (choice D) is a geographical area, but without specified conditions, it doesn\u2019t guarantee protection from rain.",
    "Home (choice E) can refer to either an indoor or outdoor space, but since it\u2019s unspecified, it might not necessarily protect the ficus from rain.",
    "Considering the aim is to protect the ficus from rain, the best option that ensures consistent indoor placement is an apartment."
