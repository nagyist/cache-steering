  "query": "Question: What drinking vessel can overflow if filled with too much water?\n\nChoices:\nA: riverbed\nB: sewer\nC: drain\nD: creek\nE: glass",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a drinking vessel that can overflow if too much water is added.",
    "A riverbed (choice A) is not a vessel; it is the ground that holds a river, so it cannot overflow in the same context as a drinking vessel.",
    "A sewer (choice B) is a system for carrying away waste and has no direct relation to drinking or being a vessel, so it won't fit the definition needed for the question.",
    "A drain (choice C) is not a vessel; it is an outlet for excess water, so it doesn't apply to overflow in the context of drinking.",
    "A creek (choice D) refers to a small stream and is not a drinking vessel, so it doesn't satisfy the question criteria.",
    "A glass (choice E) is a common drinking vessel that can overflow if too much water is poured into it.",
    "Upon evaluating all options, the only one that matches the description of being a vessel that can overflow is the glass."
