  "query": "Question: Where would a person keep a personal ficus?\n\nChoices:\nA: good health\nB: park\nC: own home\nD: lobby\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a personal ficus is. A ficus is a type of plant, often kept indoors as a houseplant.",
    "Next, think about appropriate environments for a houseplant. Houseplants like ficus thrive best in indoor settings where they can receive the right amount of light and care.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices given. \"Good health\" (A) is not a physical location. It refers to a state of wellbeing rather than a place for keeping a plant.",
    "Next, consider \"park\" (B and E). While a ficus could potentially survive in a park, it wouldn't be considered \"personal\" since parks are public spaces, not private.",
    "Then, look at the option \"lobby\" (D). A lobby is also a public space and not necessarily a place where a person keeps personal items like a plant.",
    "Now, focus on the choice \"own home\" (C). It\u2019s the most logical choice, as a person's home would be a private space suitable for keeping personal belongings, including plants.",
    "Thus, based on the reasoning above, \"own home\" is the best option since it provides a suitable and personal environment for keeping a ficus."
