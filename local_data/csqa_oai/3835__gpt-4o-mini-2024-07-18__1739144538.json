  "query": "Question: Where are you if you're hearing a bass clarinet accompanying people singing in German?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: school band\nC: music store\nD: opera house\nE: symphony",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that there is a bass clarinet being played along with singing in German. This suggests a formal musical setting rather than a casual one.",
    "An orchestra typically includes a variety of woodwind instruments, including the bass clarinet, and often accompanies singers in classical or operatic music.",
    "A school band may have a bass clarinet but is less likely to focus on singing specifically in German, as school bands often prioritize popular music or a variety of genres.",
    "A music store would not be a location where specific live performances, especially singing in German with accompaniment, typically occur.",
    "An opera house frequently features performances with singers who may sing in languages such as German, especially considering the prevalence of German operas.",
    "A symphony orchestra might also perform, but this scenario of a bass clarinet specifically accompanying singing leads more towards an opera setting, where the collaboration between instruments and vocalists is common.",
    "Evaluating the options: while both an orchestra and an opera house could accommodate a bass clarinet and singing in German, the reference to singing strongly aligns with an opera house context.",
    "Conclusively, considering the nature of the music (singing in German) and the typical uses of the bass clarinet, the most fitting answer is an opera house."
