  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the question which asks for a Canadian region where beavers are native in the northwest of North America.",
    "Next, I identify that beavers are commonly found in forested areas and regions with water bodies, as they build dams and lodges near water.",
    "I then consider the choices provided: British Columbia, Woodlands, Wooded area, Niagara Falls, and Body of water.",
    "I note that \"British Columbia\" is a well-known province in Canada that has extensive forested and water-rich habitats suitable for beavers.",
    "Now, I examine \"Woodlands\" and \"Wooded area,\" which are more general terms and do not specify a location but rather describe a type of habitat.",
    "Next, I look at \"Niagara Falls\" which is a specific landmark but is not a region synonymous with beavers or their habitat in the larger context of North American wildlife.",
    "Lastly, I consider \"Body of water,\" which again is a general term and does not refer to a specific region or area in Canada.",
    "Based on this reasoning, \"British Columbia\" clearly stands out as the appropriate choice since it is a specific region known for being home to beavers."
