  "query": "Question: Billy was a human, and he had human bodily functions.  He needed to catch his flight but ended up missing it, because he had too much mexican and was stuck where?\n\nChoices:\nA: bed\nB: couch\nC: bathroom\nD: school\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "Billy is described as having human bodily functions, and the context suggests he experienced a gastrointestinal issue related to eating too much Mexican food.",
    "The phrase \"was stuck\" implies that he was unable to leave due to a physical need related to those bodily functions.",
    "Among the choices given, the one most directly associated with needing to address bodily functions urgently is the bathroom.",
    "The other options (bed, couch, school, airport) do not logically connect to the reason for missing a flight due to GI distress.",
    "A bedroom or couch would imply a lack of urgency regarding one's bodily needs, while the school and airport do not fit the narrative of being \"stuck.\"",
    "Thus, the most plausible scenario is that Billy needed to use the bathroom, which would explain why he missed his flight.",
    "Concluding, the only choice that consistently aligns with needing to attend to urgent bodily functions is option C: bathroom."
