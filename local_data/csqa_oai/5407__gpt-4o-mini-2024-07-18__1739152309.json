  "query": "Question: How will a teacher begin projects for students required to work together?\n\nChoices:\nA: state facts\nB: teach pupils\nC: group students\nD: better knowledge\nE: dividing students",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the goal of the teacher in starting projects that require collaboration among students.",
    "Next, recognize that to facilitate collaboration effectively, students need to be organized into groups.",
    "Look at the options given: some options, like \"state facts\" and \"teach pupils,\" do not directly relate to forming groups for projects.",
    "The option \"better knowledge\" is vague and does not specifically address the organization of students for group work.",
    "The options \"group students\" and \"dividing students\" both relate to organizing students, but \"group students\" more clearly implies forming collaborative teams.",
    "Analyze \"dividing students\" \u2014 while it focuses on separating them, it may not emphasize the collaboration aspect as poignantly as grouping suggests.",
    "Since group work typically follows the initial grouping of students, the teacher's first step would logically be to group them.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that the most appropriate action a teacher would take to begin projects requiring teamwork is to group the students."
