  "query": "Question: Where would a person go for a wound that wasn't urgent?\n\nChoices:\nA: emergency room\nB: library\nC: injured person\nD: patient\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the nature of the wound. Since it is mentioned as \"not urgent,\" this implies that the wound does not require immediate medical attention.",
    "Consider the options provided. The emergency room (A) is specifically for urgent and emergency situations, so it would not be appropriate for a non-urgent wound.",
    "Next, evaluate option B, the library. This does not seem relevant to dealing with a wound, as a library is a place for reading and learning rather than medical care.",
    "Now look at option C, \"injured person.\" This refers to someone who has been injured but suggests talking about the person rather than a location for treatment.",
    "Consider option D, \"patient.\" This implies someone receiving medical care but does not provide a location to go to for treatment.",
    "Finally, analyze option E, \"hospital.\" A hospital, while it may have an emergency room, also typically has outpatient facilities or urgent care units where non-urgent cases can be treated.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, since a hospital can address non-urgent wounds appropriately, the best choice is option E."
