  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions good weather, which typically suggests an outdoor setting rather than an indoor one.",
    "\"Firing up the grill\" usually occurs in places where there is ample outdoor space and the element of cooking outside is more enjoyable, such as backyards or parks.",
    "The options include \"restaurant\" and \"kitchen,\" which are indoor locations and not likely for grilling in nice weather.",
    "\"Park\" is an outdoor location where people can grill, but it is more typical to refer to one\u2019s own private space for grilling.",
    "The terms \"back yard\" and \"backyard\" refer to the same concept, which involves one's private outdoor space specifically designated for activities like grilling.",
    "While \"park\" is suitable for grilling, the context of personal enjoyment and the commonality of grilling at home suggests that \"back yard\" or \"backyard\" is the more appropriate answer.",
    "The distinction between \"back yard\" and \"backyard\" is primarily grammatical, as both terms denote the same place, but \"backyard\" is more commonly used.",
    "Considering the context and common usage to describe a place to grill, \"backyard\" is the best fit for the statement."
