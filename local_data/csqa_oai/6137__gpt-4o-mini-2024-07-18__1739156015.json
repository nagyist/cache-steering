    "The question indicates a person struggled with mental illness throughout her life, which suggests that despite this challenge, she managed to achieve or maintain something positive.",
    "Looking at the choices, A (\"recur\") and D (\"cause hallucination\") imply negative outcomes or situations that are unlikely to be seen as achievements or positive states.",
    "Choice B (\"cause irrational behaviour\") also reflects a negative aspect rather than a positive accomplishment, making it less likely to be the correct answer.",
    "Choice C (\"effectively treated\") implies an external action that would not typically describe a personal endeavor or strength, especially since the prompt focuses on enduring mental illness.",
    "Choice E (\"managed\") suggests that the individual successfully dealt with or coped with her mental illness throughout her life, which aligns well with the idea of enduring despite challenges.",
    "Now considering all of these options, the choice that reflects a positive outcome or personal capability in the face of adversity is E (\"managed\").",
    "The other options do not convey a persistent capability or accomplishment in managing one\u2019s mental health in a way that suggests resilience."
