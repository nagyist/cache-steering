  "query": "Question: Where can you see snakes at a public zoological park?\n\nChoices:\nA: kew gardens\nB: tree\nC: terrarium\nD: thick forest\nE: field",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where snakes are commonly housed in public zoological parks.",
    "Snakes are typically housed in controlled environments that mimic their natural habitat for visitors to safely observe them.",
    "One of the common environments for showing reptiles, including snakes, in zoos is a terrarium.",
    "Kew Gardens is primarily a botanical garden and is not known for showcasing snakes.",
    "A tree, thick forest, and field are all natural environments where snakes may live, but they are not controlled environments where they are displayed in a zoo.",
    "The word \"terrarium\" specifically refers to a small enclosed area where reptiles can be kept, making it the most logical choice for a public zoological park.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the other options to ensure they are less suitable for seeing snakes in a public zoo.",
    "Kew Gardens (A), tree (B), thick forest (D), and field (E) do not provide the appropriate context for viewing snakes in a controlled manner as found in a zoo.",
    "Therefore, the option that best fits the context of where to see snakes at a public zoological park is clearly the terrarium."
