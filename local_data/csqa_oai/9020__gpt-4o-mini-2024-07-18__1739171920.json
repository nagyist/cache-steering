  "query": "Question: How can a bridge be built?\n\nChoices:\nA: river valley\nB: softly\nC: over water\nD: california\nE: dentist",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a bridge is and its primary purpose, which is to provide a pathway over obstacles like water, roads, or valleys.",
    "Next, analyze the choices to determine which one aligns with the common use or construction of a bridge.",
    "Choice A (river valley) suggests a location where a bridge could be built, but it's not specific about the bridge's characteristics or context, like being over water.",
    "Choice B (softly) does not relate to the construction of a bridge and seems irrelevant as bridges are typically built using strong materials and methods.",
    "Choice C (over water) directly describes a common function of bridges, which is to span bodies of water, indicating how bridges are often constructed.",
    "Choice D (california) refers to a geographical location but does not provide specific details about the nature of bridge construction.",
    "Choice E (dentist) is completely unrelated as it refers to a profession and has no connection to bridge building.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most accurate and relevant choice indicating how a bridge can be constructed is clearly C (over water)."
