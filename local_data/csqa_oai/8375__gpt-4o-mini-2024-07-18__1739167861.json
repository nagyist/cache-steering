  "query": "Question: What wet vehicle do you steer with a wheel?\n\nChoices:\nA: bicycle shop\nB: medium\nC: michigan\nD: boat\nE: trunk of car",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a wet vehicle, implying that it operates in or on water.",
    "The term \"steer with a wheel\" suggests that the vehicle needs a steering mechanism typically associated with vehicles that navigate, such as boats or cars.",
    "I will evaluate each option to see if it fits the criteria of being a wet vehicle steered by a wheel.",
    "Option A: \"bicycle shop\" refers to a place for purchasing bikes, not a vehicle.",
    "Option B: \"medium\" does not represent a vehicle at all.",
    "Option C: \"michigan\" is a geographical location and not applicable to the context of a vehicle.",
    "Option D: \"boat\" is indeed a wet vehicle, but typically boats are steered with a rudder or tiller rather than a wheel. However, there are some boats with a steering wheel.",
    "Option E: \"trunk of car\" is a storage space in a car, not a vehicle.",
    "From this evaluation, the only relevant option that somewhat meets the question stem is D: boat, as it is an aquatic vehicle, albeit usually steered by a rudder."
