  "steps": [
    "To determine where it is unlikely to find an office building, we need to analyze each option in context.",
    "Option A (city): Cities are typically hubs for office buildings, housing numerous businesses and workplaces. Therefore, it's likely to find office buildings here.",
    "Option B (high tower): High towers commonly host office spaces, especially if they're located in urban settings. Thus, it is likely to find office buildings in high towers.",
    "Option C (industrial complex): Industrial complexes typically focus on manufacturing, warehousing, or industrial work rather than office space. Office buildings are less common here.",
    "Option D (downtown area): Downtown areas are often characterized by a dense concentration of office buildings, making it very likely to find them in this locale.",
    "Option E (advertising company): If referring to a company that provides advertising services, these workplaces are often office buildings. However, \"advertising company\" does not specifically indicate a location where office buildings are abundant or unlikely.",
    "After reviewing each option, Industrial Complex stands out as the most unlikely place to find an office building, given its nature and typical purpose."
