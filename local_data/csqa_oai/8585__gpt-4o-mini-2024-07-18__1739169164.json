  "query": "Question: Where is clothing found on vacation?\n\nChoices:\nA: trunk\nB: washing machine\nC: closet\nD: suitcase\nE: store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where clothing is typically stored or found when someone is on vacation.",
    "When packing for a vacation, people usually put their clothing into a suitcase.",
    "While on vacation, it is common for some clothing to be unpacked and placed into a hotel room's closet.",
    "A washing machine is generally used while doing laundry, not a place where clothing is stored for the duration of a vacation.",
    "A trunk could be used for storage, but it is less common in modern travel compared to a suitcase.",
    "Stores can be places where someone can buy or find clothing, but they are not locations where someone would find their own clothing that they brought on vacation.",
    "Given these considerations, the most logical place that clothing is found while on vacation is the suitcase, as that's where it is packed and stored when traveling.",
    "Although clothing can also be placed in a closet, the suitcase is the first point of storage when traveling.",
    "Therefore, the most suitable answer is that clothing is found in the suitcase while on vacation."
