  "query": "Question: If I am a spectator at a movie theater, what am I likely watching?\n\nChoices:\nA: watch event\nB: performance\nC: demonstration\nD: sporting event\nE: show",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of being a spectator. A spectator typically observes an event or presentation.",
    "Next, I analyze the term \"movie theater.\" It is a facility designed specifically for showing films to an audience.",
    "I then glance at the list of choices to determine which option aligns with the concept of watching a film.",
    "Choice A (\"watch event\") is too vague and does not specifically refer to films or movie theaters.",
    "Choice B (\"performance\") suggests live acts, which are typically not shown in a movie theater.",
    "Choice C (\"demonstration\") implies showing how something works, which is not relevant to watching a film.",
    "Choice D (\"sporting event\") refers to live sports, which again would not be happening in a movie theater setting.",
    "Finally, choice E (\"show\") is a term that could imply a movie presentation, as movies can be referred to as shows, especially in a theatrical context.",
    "Among all choices, choice E clearly matches the scenario of being a spectator in a movie theater."
