  "query": "Question: Where would you get an electric razor if you do not have one?\n\nChoices:\nA: k mart\nB: man's suitcase\nC: medicine cabinet\nD: from the electric company\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question: The question is asking where to obtain an electric razor specifically.",
    "Analyze the options provided to determine their relevance to acquiring an electric razor.",
    "Option A (k mart): This is a store that sells a variety of items including personal grooming products, making it a viable option.",
    "Option B (man's suitcase): This implies a personal item owned by someone, which doesn't fit the criteria of obtaining a razor.",
    "Option C (medicine cabinet): This typically contains medications and health-related items, not likely to contain grooming tools like an electric razor.",
    "Option D (from the electric company): This does not make sense, as the electric company provides electricity, not personal grooming devices.",
    "Option E (bathroom): This is a common place where one might store personal grooming products, but it doesn\u2019t suggest acquiring a new razor if one doesn\u2019t already have it.",
    "Since Option A (k mart) is a specific location where you can buy an electric razor and is likely to have it available, it is the best choice for obtaining one."
