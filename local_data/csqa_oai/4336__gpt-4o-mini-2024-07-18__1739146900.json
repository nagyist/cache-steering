  "steps": [
    "To determine what causes an apple tree to grow, I should consider the factors that contribute to the growth of any plant.",
    "Plants typically require sunlight, water, nutrients, and proper temperature to grow.",
    "Among the choices given, I need to evaluate which one is a direct contributor to the growth of apple trees specifically.",
    "Choice A, apple juice, is a product derived from apples and doesn\u2019t contribute to the growth of the apple tree itself.",
    "Choice B, bloom, refers to the flowering process and, while important for reproduction, it is not a direct cause of growth.",
    "Choice C, park, is a location and does not inherently cause the tree to grow; it may provide space but not the necessary conditions for growth itself.",
    "Choice D, New Hampshire, is a geographical region and not a factor that causes growth.",
    "Choice E, sunshine, is essential for photosynthesis, which is a critical process for the growth of plants, including apple trees.",
    "Therefore, the direct cause for an apple tree to grow is linked to its need for sunlight and other growing conditions."
