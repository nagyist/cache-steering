  "query": "Question: Where could you find more than one ticket office, of different types?\n\nChoices:\nA: humans\nB: movie theaters\nC: city\nD: opera house\nE: train station",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is asking about locations that could have more than one type of ticket office.",
    "Consider each option and evaluate whether it typically has multiple types of ticket offices.",
    "A: \"humans\" does not fit as it doesn't refer to a location with ticket offices.",
    "B: \"movie theaters\" primarily sell tickets for films, which is a single type, so there typically wouldn\u2019t be different types of ticket offices.",
    "C: \"city\" can involve various events and services (concerts, sports events, public transportation) that may all require different types of ticketing systems. Therefore, a city could house multiple ticket offices for different purposes.",
    "D: \"opera house\" usually focuses on performances related to opera, thus having a specific ticket office for that type of event and not a variety of types.",
    "E: \"train station\" typically has ticket offices for various types of train services, but might not encompass as many varied ticket types as a city context would (like events, public transport, etc.).",
    "Compare the best candidates: city (C) could include various events and services with diverse ticket offices, while a train station (E) is more limited to transport tickets.",
    "Having analyzed all options, the most comprehensive answer reflecting the multiple types of ticket offices is the city (C)."
