  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to make food?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: supermarket\nC: table\nD: stomach\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"make food\" means. It typically refers to the process of preparing or cooking food.",
    "The kitchen is widely recognized as the designated area for cooking and food preparation. It is equipped with appliances like stoves, ovens, and sinks which facilitate cooking.",
    "A supermarket, while it provides ingredients for cooking, is not a place where food is made. It is a place to buy food.",
    "A table can be a location for assembling or serving food, but it is not a place for the actual cooking process.",
    "The stomach is where food is consumed, not made, so it doesn't fit the criteria for making food.",
    "A restaurant is a place where food is prepared and served, but it's not the individual's own space for making food; it's a commercial establishment.",
    "Considering all of the options, the kitchen stands out as the primary and most practical location for making food.",
    "I will double-check by reviewing the roles of each option: kitchen (cooking), supermarket (shopping), table (serving), stomach (consuming), restaurant (commercial preparation).",
    "The only place that serves the purposes of making food, with all tools and equipment, is the kitchen."
