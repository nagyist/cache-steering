  "query": "Question: How does a human solve problems?\n\nChoices:\nA: say hello\nB: have fever\nC: better himself\nD: think critically\nE: have to sleep",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand that the question is asking about the general process or methods used by humans to solve problems.",
    "Identify the implications of the answer choices provided, connecting them to the process of problem-solving.",
    "Choice A, \"say hello,\" does not relate to solving problems but rather a form of greeting.",
    "Choice B, \"have fever,\" indicates a medical condition and does not pertain to problem-solving at all.",
    "Choice C, \"better himself,\" suggests self-improvement but is too vague and not directly linked to the act of problem-solving.",
    "Choice D, \"think critically,\" clearly involves analyzing situations, assessing information, and making reasoned decisions, which are fundamental aspects of solving problems.",
    "Choice E, \"have to sleep,\" again does not connect to the process of problem-solving but rather indicates a biological necessity.",
    "Given the above analysis, it is evident that the most relevant and appropriate choice to describe how humans solve problems is critical thinking."
