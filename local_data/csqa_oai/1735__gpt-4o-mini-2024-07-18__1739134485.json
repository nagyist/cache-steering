  "steps": [
    "The context mentions that the fan has watched the team play every Sunday, indicating a tradition of watching games.",
    "The phrase \"enter a what\" implies that the fan is about to experience something in person, which suggests a physical location related to sports.",
    "The mention of a \"snap\" gives a clue towards a sport that utilizes the term \"snap,\" which is commonly associated with football (the act of the center snapping the ball to the quarterback).",
    "Therefore, the fan's experience relates to football, as none of the other sports mentioned (hockey, basketball) typically use the term \"snap\" in their gameplay.",
    "Since the question asks for a place to see a \"snap\" live, the best fit is a location where football is played, which would be a football stadium.",
    "While other options are plausible sports venues, none align with the specific mention of \"snap\" as much as a football stadium does.",
    "Thus, I can conclude that the correct answer from the provided choices must involve a football context."
