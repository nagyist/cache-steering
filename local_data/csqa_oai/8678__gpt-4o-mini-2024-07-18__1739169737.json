  "query": "Question: What happens to someone who stays in bed too long?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedsores\nB: sleep in\nC: well rested\nD: aren't ready when arrives\nE: lay down",
  "steps": [
    "Staying in bed too long can limit physical activity and reduce blood circulation.",
    "Reduced circulation can lead to pressure on certain body parts, which causes skin to break down.",
    "The breaking down of skin due to prolonged pressure is known as bedsores or pressure sores.",
    "While one might feel well-rested after sleeping, staying in bed excessively can lead to negative health effects.",
    "Options B (sleep in) and C (well rested) suggest positive outcomes from being in bed too long, which may not capture the primary risk.",
    "Options D (aren't ready when arrives) and E (lay down) do not directly address the health impact of staying in bed excessively.",
    "Given the health risks associated with prolonged bed rest, the most relevant choice is A (bedsore)."
