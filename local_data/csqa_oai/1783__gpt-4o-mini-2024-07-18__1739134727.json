  "query": "Question: The man wanted a new cereal bowl, where should he buy one?\n\nChoices:\nA: contain cereal\nB: china shop\nC: kitchen cabinet\nD: cupboard\nE: cereal box",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify where one typically buys cereal bowls. Cereal bowls are often sold in stores that specialize in kitchenware or home goods.",
    "Next, we analyze the options provided: \n- A: \"contain cereal\" does not make sense as a purchase option.\n- B: \"china shop\" specializes in dishes and may offer cereal bowls.\n- C: \"kitchen cabinet\" is a storage place, not a buying option.\n- D: \"cupboard\" is also a storage place, not a buying option.\n- E: \"cereal box\" contains cereal, not bowls.",
    "Among the options, the only one that represents a place where one could buy a cereal bowl is the china shop.",
    "While kitchen cabinets and cupboards are relevant for keeping cereal bowls, they do not sell them.",
    "The term \"china shop\" implies a store that sells fine dishes, which likely includes cereal bowls.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice for purchasing a new cereal bowl is option B, which is a china shop."
