  "query": "Question: What kind of heart test might you have while having a check up?\n\nChoices:\nA: anxiety\nB: stress\nC: trouble\nD: uncertainty\nE: a bug bite",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking specifically about heart tests that might be conducted during a check-up.",
    "Choice A, \"anxiety,\" relates to mental health rather than a physical heart test, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice C, \"trouble,\" is vague and does not refer to a specific heart test, so it can also be eliminated.",
    "Choice D, \"uncertainty,\" again does not refer to any heart test or medical procedure, so this can be eliminated too.",
    "Choice E, \"a bug bite,\" is not related to heart health tests at all, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "This leaves us with Choice B, \"stress,\" which likely refers to a stress test that evaluates how well the heart works under physical stress.",
    "Thus, the most logical and relevant answer for a heart test during a check-up is a stress test."
