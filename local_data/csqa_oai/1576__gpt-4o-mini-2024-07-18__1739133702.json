  "query": "Question: Where do investment bankers hang out in the suburbs?\n\nChoices:\nA: wall street\nB: city hall\nC: monopoly game\nD: michigan\nE: country club",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, we need to consider the context of the question, which revolves around where investment bankers, who typically work in finance, might spend their leisure time in the suburbs.",
    "Investment bankers usually have a high-income lifestyle, which influences their choice of social venues and hangout spots.",
    "A place like \"Wall Street\" (Choice A) is a famous financial hub in New York City, not a suburban location, thereby making it an unlikely option.",
    "\"City Hall\" (Choice B) generally pertains to government affairs and is not commonly associated with the leisure activities of investment bankers, especially not in suburban contexts.",
    "While \"Monopoly Game\" (Choice C) is a playful concept, it does not represent a physical location where investment bankers would hang out, thus making it irrelevant.",
    "Looking at \"Michigan\" (Choice D), it is a state that encompasses suburban areas, but it does not specifically relate to where investment bankers would typically gather.",
    "Lastly, \"Country Club\" (Choice E) fits the profile well, as country clubs are known venues wherein affluent individuals, including investment bankers, often relax and socialize in more suburban settings.",
    "After evaluating all choices against the original question, \"Country Club\" (E) emerges as the most suitable answer, given its social characteristics and the likelihood of gathering affluent professionals."
