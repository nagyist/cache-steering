  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to identify which type of vessel is capable of firing a torpedo without being detected, which typically implies stealth capabilities.",
    "A patrol boat is usually a smaller vessel designed for coastal operations and may not have the capability to launch torpedoes effectively against large ships.",
    "A submarine, on the other hand, is specifically designed for stealth and can launch torpedoes while remaining submerged and undetected, making it a prime candidate for firing an unseen torpedo.",
    "A corvette is a small warship used for anti-submarine warfare and coastal patrol but is less stealthy than submarines and not primarily designed to launch torpedoes undetected.",
    "A destroyer is a larger surface combatant equipped with advanced weaponry, but it typically operates in a more visible manner than submarines, which may make it less capable of launching an unseen torpedo strike.",
    "A frigate is a similar surface combatant role and is generally designed to escort and perform anti-submarine duties, but it does not possess the core stealth capability that submarines do.",
    "Overall, a torpedo fired from a submarine would be the most likely scenario for an unseen attack on a battleship since it can approach unnoticed.",
    "I will conclude that the best answer is the one that aligns with the need for stealth and the capacity to launch torpedoes effectively."
