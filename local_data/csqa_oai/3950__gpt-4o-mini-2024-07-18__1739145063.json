  "query": "Question: The cubicles felt like their own little rooms, you could hardly even see over the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: square shape\nB: doors and windows\nC: apartment\nD: border\nE: high walls",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions \"cubicles\" and hints at their enclosed nature, suggesting a lack of visibility over something that creates the cubicle's boundaries.",
    "Next, we consider what structures would typically be associated with cubicles. One common aspect is their height and privacy features, which could restrict visibility.",
    "Among the options provided, higher structures would obstruct one's line of sight more effectively than the other choices.",
    "We analyze each option for its relevance: \n- A \"square shape\" does not imply height.\n- \"Doors and windows\" are present but not necessarily tall enough to hinder visibility.\n- \"Apartment\" suggests a concept rather than a physical barrier.\n- \"Border\" could refer to a perimeter but lacks specificity in height.\n- \"High walls\" specifically indicates significant vertical barriers that would block sightlines.",
    "Given that cubicles are often surrounded by partitions that are tall, the option \"high walls\" aligns with the context of visibility being restricted.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer should reflect the common understanding of cubicles as enclosed spaces characterized by tall dividers."
