  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the question, which asks about what must be avoided during official judging.",
    "Official judging typically takes place in contexts such as competitions, sports, or formal evaluations, where fairness and objectivity are critical.",
    "One key element of official judging is the necessity for unbiased decision-making, which means avoiding any factors that could impact the fairness of the results.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"controversy\" (A) might refer to disagreements that could arise from judging, but it doesn't directly affect the integrity of the judging process itself.",
    "The term \"prejudice\" (B) implies a pre-existing bias or preconceived notion about something, which directly contradicts the principles of fair judging and must be avoided.",
    "\"Verdict\" (C) is simply a term that refers to the decision made after judging and cannot be avoided as it is a necessary outcome of the process.",
    "\"Statement\" (D) could refer to comments made during judging, but does not inherently imply bias or unfairness and might not need to be avoided.",
    "\"Evaluating\" (E) is the process of assessing, which is the very essence of judging and cannot be avoided.",
    "After considering all options, \"prejudice\" (B) stands out as the primary element that must be avoided in official judging to ensure fairness and equity."
