  "query": "Question: A hurricane is similar to what other wind event?\n\nChoices:\nA: tornadocane\nB: disaster\nC: tornadoes\nD: death\nE: horrendous",
  "steps": [
    "A hurricane is a large-scale weather event characterized by strong winds and heavy rain, typically forming over warm ocean waters.",
    "Tornadoes, on the other hand, are smaller, more localized wind events characterized by a funnel shape and measured intensity, forming typically during severe thunderstorms.",
    "Both hurricanes and tornadoes are categorized as severe wind events caused by different meteorological conditions but share characteristics such as strong winds and potential for destruction.",
    "The key difference lies in their scale, with hurricanes affecting larger areas and tornadoes impacting smaller, specific regions within that area.",
    "Given the question asks for a comparison of similar types of wind events, we should focus on wind phenomena that share key characteristics.",
    "While options like \"disaster,\" \"death,\" and \"horrendous\" do not describe wind events, the choice \"tornadoes\" directly represent another type of wind event.",
    "The phrase \"tornadocane\" appears to be a fictional or humorous term combining 'tornado' and 'hurricane,' which lacks clear meteorological status.",
    "Option \"tornadoes\" is the only viable choice that accurately represents another wind event akin to hurricanes.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating the reasons and definitions, the most appropriate answer aligning with the characteristics and nature of wind events is \"tornadoes.\""
