  "query": "Question: The ranch house is common in what northwestern Rocky Mountains state\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: montana\nC: british columbia\nD: california\nE: desert",
  "steps": [
    "We start by identifying the location mentioned in the question, which is the \"northwestern Rocky Mountains state.\"",
    "Next, we consider the choices given: A (countryside), B (Montana), C (British Columbia), D (California), and E (desert).",
    "We recognize the Rocky Mountains primarily run through the United States and Canada, with several states in the U.S. being known for their mountainous regions.",
    "\"British Columbia\" is a province in Canada and not a U.S. state, so C is not a correct answer since we are looking for a state.",
    "Out of the choices, B (Montana) is a U.S. state located in the northwestern region of the Rocky Mountains.",
    "We analyze the term \"ranch house.\" Ranch houses are indeed common in many regions of the West, particularly in states like Montana that have a strong ranching culture and rural landscapes.",
    "Next, we consider the other choices: A (countryside) is too vague, D (California) is more southwestern, and E (desert) does not describe a state specifically linked to the Rocky Mountains.",
    "Since Montana is known for its vast countryside, ranching lifestyle, and location in the northwestern Rocky Mountains, it stands out as the most fitting answer.",
    "We finalize by confirming that Montana fits all criteria based on geography and culture regarding ranch houses."
