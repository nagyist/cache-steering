  "query": "Question: While fun for balloons and parties, a helium tank can also be found in what place of research?\n\nChoices:\nA: sadistic dentist's office\nB: atmosphere\nC: laboratory\nD: chemistry lab\nE: moon",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general uses and properties of helium. Helium is often used in party balloons because it is lighter than air and provides buoyancy. However, it also has scientific applications.",
    "Next, think about the environments where helium might be used for research. Helium is often utilized in laboratories, particularly in cryogenics, as it can help cool materials to very low temperatures.",
    "Consider the options provided. A \"sadistic dentist's office\" does not make logical sense as a place where helium is used.",
    "The \"atmosphere\" option refers to a broad environmental context rather than a specific place of research.",
    "A \"laboratory\" is a general term that encompasses various types of scientific research, where helium could be utilized for various experiments.",
    "The term \"chemistry lab\" is more specific and could certainly use helium for chemical experiments, especially in cryogenic research.",
    "Since both \"laboratory\" and \"chemistry lab\" involve the use of helium, analyze if one is more applicable than the other.",
    "Consider the fact that \"laboratory\" is a broader term and could refer to various fields including biology, physics, and more, not just chemistry.",
    "Evaluate the other options relative to the viable options. \"Moon\" is irrelevant, as helium may theoretically be found there but is not a research location.",
    "After examining the choices, it seems that both \"laboratory\" and \"chemistry lab\" are relevant, but \"laboratory\" is the most inclusive of the various research types where helium is relevant."
