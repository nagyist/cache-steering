    "The question asks about the natural habitat of marmots before they are captured.",
    "Marmots are generally found in mountainous regions, particularly in North America and parts of Europe.",
    "Switzerland has a population of marmots, particularly in the Alps.",
    "Spain does not have a significant population of marmots, although there may be some in a few regions.",
    "Vancouver Island is known for its wildlife, but it is not a typical habitat for marmots.",
    "The term \"wilderness\" could refer to areas where wild marmots live, but it is quite general.",
    "Australia does not have marmots as they are not native to that continent.",
    "Among the choices, the most fitting description of where all marmots live would be in the wilderness, as this encompasses all natural habitats they exist in before any potential capture.",
    "It\u2019s important to choose the answer that reflects the most comprehensive understanding of their habitat."
