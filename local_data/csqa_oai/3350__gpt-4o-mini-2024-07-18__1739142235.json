  "query": "Question: If a cottage is above the cloud line, where is it?\n\nChoices:\nA: village\nB: rural area\nC: mountains\nD: fairy story\nE: valley",
  "steps": [
    "The cloud line is the altitude above which clouds typically form. This indicates a certain height above sea level.",
    "If a cottage is above the cloud line, it must be located at a high altitude, where the air is thinner and cooler.",
    "Clouds are commonly found in mountainous regions, as higher elevations are where the air can cool and condense to form clouds.",
    "While there could be clouds in valleys, the phrase \"above the cloud line\" suggests a location at a height where one would not be surrounded by the clouds, which is more characteristic of mountainous areas.",
    "A village or a rural area can exist at various altitudes, including those below the cloud line, so they are not necessarily indicative of being above it.",
    "A \u201cfairy story\u201d is not a physical location and does not pertain to a real geographical environment. Thus, it cannot be a correct answer.",
    "Considering all of the above, the most logical answer for the location of a cottage above the cloud line is in the mountains."
