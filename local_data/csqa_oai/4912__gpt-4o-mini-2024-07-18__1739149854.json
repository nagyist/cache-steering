  "query": "Question: A person is being judged, what is he entitled to?\n\nChoices:\nA: source of income\nB: fair trial\nC: headache\nD: white teeth\nE: freedom",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what a person is entitled to when being judged, which suggests a legal or judicial context.",
    "In a judicial context, individuals are typically entitled to certain rights to ensure justice.",
    "One of the fundamental rights in judicial proceedings is the right to a fair trial, which is crucial for due process.",
    "Looking at the options: \n- A: \"source of income\" does not relate to being judged.\n- C: \"headache\" is not a right and is irrelevant.\n- D: \"white teeth\" is also not related to the context of being judged.\n- E: \"freedom\" can be a right, but it is more about the outcome rather than the process of being judged.",
    "Thus, the only option that aligns with the right to justice and due process in the context of being judged is \"fair trial.\""
