  "query": "Question: What is usually next to a door?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: office\nC: wall\nD: building\nE: kitchen",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what a door typically connects. A door usually leads to another room or area.",
    "Next, we think about the placement of a door relative to its surroundings. A door is usually surrounded by walls.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options provided. \nA: Apartment - While a door can lead to an apartment, it is not something that is usually next to a door in a generic sense.",
    "B: Office - Similar to apartment, a door can lead to an office, but again, it is not universally next to a door.",
    "C: Wall - A wall is typically what frames a door, making it a common element right beside or around a door.",
    "D: Building - A building might contain a door, but it is not literally next to a door in a typical indoor context.",
    "E: Kitchen - A door might lead to a kitchen, but it isn't typically something found right next to a door.",
    "Among all the options, \"wall\" is the most logical and universally correct answer as walls are always found next to doors in buildings."
