  "query": "Question: She could watch people coming and going to all the different shops while at the beauty salon because it was located where?\n\nChoices:\nA: picking clothes\nB: clerk\nC: strip mall\nD: beautifying hair\nE: neighborhood",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location of a beauty salon that allows one to see people coming and going to different shops.",
    "To have a view of various shops, the beauty salon would need to be in a place with multiple retail establishments nearby.",
    "A \"strip mall\" is a common term for a retail format that features a row of different shops and services in one location.",
    "Options like \"picking clothes,\" \"clerk,\" and \"beautifying hair\" do not pertain to a location and do not suggest visibility to multiple shops.",
    "\"Neighborhood\" can indicate a variety of areas, but it does not specifically imply a concentration of shops as clearly as a \"strip mall.\"",
    "Since the question emphasizes watching people going to multiple shops, the most appropriate answer is one that describes a retail area with various storefronts.",
    "Considering all options, \"strip mall\" makes the most sense in this context as it typically features several businesses and shops in one location.",
    "We should double-check other options. \"Picking clothes\" does not describe a place, \"clerk\" refers to a person, \"beautifying hair\" is a service offered, and \"neighborhood\" is too broad and vague.",
    "Thus, the clear and logical answer to why the beauty salon allows for watching people go to different shops is that it is likely located in a strip mall."
