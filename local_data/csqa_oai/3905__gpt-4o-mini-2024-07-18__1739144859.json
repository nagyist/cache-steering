  "query": "Question: Jane saw her flirting with her boyfriend, what was her reaction?\n\nChoices:\nA: jealousy\nB: unwanted pregnancy\nC: happiness\nD: getting into trouble\nE: anger",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the situation: Jane saw someone flirting with her boyfriend.",
    "Next, consider the emotional implications of seeing a partner being flirted with by someone else.",
    "Flirting generally implies romantic interest or attraction, which could be perceived as a threat to Jane's relationship.",
    "Evaluate the possible emotional reactions Jane might have based on the threat to her relationship.",
    "Jealousy is a common response when one partner feels their relationship is being compromised by an outsider.",
    "Happiness seems unlikely, as seeing someone flirt with a partner usually causes distress rather than joy.",
    "Unwanted pregnancy is not a direct reaction to observing flirting; it relates to sexual relationships rather than emotional responses.",
    "Getting into trouble also does not logically follow from the situation as described; it doesn't connect directly to seeing flirting.",
    "Anger could be a response, but is typically less immediate than jealousy in a situation involving perceived infidelity.",
    "All evaluations lead to jealousy being the most fitting reaction, considering the emotional stakes involved."
