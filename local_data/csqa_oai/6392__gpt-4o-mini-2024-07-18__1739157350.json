  "steps": [
    "To find a place to get a BBQ meal away from home, we first consider the options given in the choices.",
    "Choice A, \"backyard,\" suggests a location associated with home rather than \"away.\"",
    "Choice B, \"Louisiana,\" is known for its BBQ culture; however, it is a broader geographic location and may not immediately imply a place to get a meal.",
    "Choice C, \"neighbor's house,\" might imply a possibility for BBQ if the neighbor is hosting, but it is not a definitive option like a restaurant.",
    "Choice D, \"restaurant,\" is very clear; it directly indicates a place specifically for dining, where BBQ meals could be served.",
    "Choice E, \"ribs,\" refers to a type of BBQ dish rather than a location. Therefore, it is irrelevant in this context when looking for a place to eat.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"restaurant\" stands out as the most straightforward and undeniable choice for getting a BBQ meal away from home."
