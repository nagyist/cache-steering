  "query": "Question: Many prison movies take place at what famous prison?\n\nChoices:\nA: forest\nB: city\nC: countryside\nD: america\nE: alcatraz",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a famous prison that is often depicted in movies.",
    "I need to think about prisons that are well-known in popular culture and film.",
    "Alcatraz is one of the most famous prisons in the world, known for its security and notorious inmates.",
    "Many films have been made about Alcatraz, including \"Escape from Alcatraz\" and \"The Rock.\"",
    "I should consider the other options to verify they are not related to famous prisons.",
    "\"Forest,\" \"City,\" and \"Countryside\" do not refer to specific prisons, and they are all geographical descriptors rather than names of prisons.",
    "\"America\" is a country and not a specific prison. While it has many prisons, it doesn\u2019t pinpoint a famous one.",
    "Based on this reasoning, Alcatraz is the only specific prison that matches the description in the question.",
    "I can confidently conclude that the answer must be Alcatraz."
