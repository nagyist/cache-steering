  "query": "Question: The spirit ascended to the after life, so what was it leaving?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar\nB: human being\nC: cemetary\nD: graveyard\nE: earth",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the spirit ascended to the afterlife. This implies that something is being left behind as the spirit transitions to another realm.",
    "To understand what the spirit is leaving, we must consider its original state or form before the ascension. Since we are discussing a spirit, we need to identify what physical entity is associated with a spirit.",
    "A spirit is typically understood to be the non-physical essence of a living being, particularly in relation to a human. Therefore, the most logical entity it would leave behind is a human body.",
    "We need to analyze the provided options. The choices include: bar, human being, cemetery, graveyard, and earth.",
    "The term \"human being\" directly correlates with the physical aspect that a spirit would leave. The other options appear less directly related; for example, both \"cemetery\" and \"graveyard\" represent locations where bodies are interred but do not specifically denote what the spirit might leave.",
    "Analyzing other options: \n- \"Bar\" is irrelevant to the context of a spirit and afterlife.\n- \"Cemetery\" and \"graveyard\" again refer to places, not specific entities.\n- \"Earth\" pertains to the physical world but does not specifically denote what the spirit belongs to.",
    "Since the spirit ascends from a human form, \"human being\" is the clearest and most direct answer as to what it is leaving behind."
