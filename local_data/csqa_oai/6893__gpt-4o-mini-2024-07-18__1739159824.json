  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what you could find moving in a ticket office specifically.",
    "A ticket office is a place where tickets are sold, commonly found in locations like theaters, stadiums, or public transport stations.",
    "I need to evaluate what items or beings might be moving within that context.",
    "Option A mentions \"humans,\" which could include both customers purchasing tickets and staff working in the office.",
    "Option B refers to \"movie theaters,\" which is a type of business that has a ticket office but is not something that can move.",
    "Option C, \"city,\" does not apply as a city is a large area and cannot be found moving within a ticket office.",
    "Option D, \"animals,\" seems unlikely as ticket offices generally do not have animals moving within them.",
    "Option E indicates \"stadium,\" similar to movie theaters, while it can have ticket offices nearby, it doesn\u2019t represent something that can move inside the ticket office itself.",
    "Considering the reasoning steps, \"humans\" is the only option that makes sense as it represents living beings that could actively be moving within the ticket office environment."
