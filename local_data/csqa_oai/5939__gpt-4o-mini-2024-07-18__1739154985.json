  "query": "Question: Where is a supply closet likely to be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: coats\nC: mop and bucket\nD: school\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a supply closet typically holds. It's generally a storage area for supplies such as cleaning materials, office supplies, and other miscellaneous items.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the provided choices to determine which locations are most likely to contain a supply closet.",
    "Choice A (bedroom) doesn't seem suitable as bedrooms usually contain personal items rather than a communal supply closet.",
    "Choice B (coats) could relate to a storage area for coats but is less likely to be referred to as a supply closet.",
    "Choice C (mop and bucket) indicates cleaning supplies, which might be stored in a supply closet, but does not specifically refer to a location for a supply closet.",
    "Choice D (school) is a plausible option, as schools often have supply closets for educational materials, cleaning supplies, and other equipment.",
    "Choice E (house) could also contain a supply closet, but it may vary greatly depending on individual preferences and layout.",
    "Considering all options, 'school' fits the classic definition of a location that would commonly have a designated supply closet for various materials used within the educational environment."
