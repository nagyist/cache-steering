  "query": "Question: Faith can be defined as belief without what?\n\nChoices:\nA: washing toilets\nB: disbelief\nC: knowledge\nD: despair\nE: move mountains",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the concept of faith. Faith is often associated with belief systems that do not require empirical evidence or proof.",
    "Next, we consider what the question is asking: \"faith can be defined as belief without what?\" This implies that we are looking for a term or condition that is typically absent when one has faith.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices one by one to see which one aligns with the notion of faith.",
    "Choice A: washing toilets. This does not relate to the fundamental definition of faith and cannot be considered as something faith is without.",
    "Choice B: disbelief. While disbelief can be contrasted with faith, faith does not require the absence of disbelief to exist. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.",
    "Choice C: knowledge. Faith often operates in contexts where knowledge (or empirical verification) is lacking. People have faith even when they don't have definitive knowledge about a belief. This is a strong candidate.",
    "Choice D: despair. Despair is more about emotional states and does not directly correlate with the definition of faith.",
    "Choice E: move mountains. This phrase is metaphorical and does not relate directly to the definition of faith in terms of belief without something.",
    "After reviewing the choices, the most logical answer that aligns with the definition of faith is that it requires belief without knowledge, as faith exists in the absence of empirical proof."
