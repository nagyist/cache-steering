  "query": "Question: Where would find a townhouse that is not attached to other houses?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment building\nB: suburban development\nC: suburbs\nD: michigan\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to understand the definition of a townhouse. A townhouse is typically a form of medium-density housing that is attached to other units, usually in a row formation.",
    "Given that the question asks for a townhouse that is not attached to other houses, this implies a need for a residential structure that stands alone rather than connected to others.",
    "Next, I will analyze the choices provided.",
    "Choice A is an apartment building. This consists of multiple apartments that share walls, which contradicts the requirement of being not attached.",
    "Choice B is suburban development. This can include both attached townhouses and detached single-family homes, leading to ambiguity.",
    "Choice C is suburbs. Suburbs often have a mix of housing types, including detached single-family homes which can fit the description of a standalone structure.",
    "Choice D, Michigan, is a specific location, but it doesn't specify the type of housing available; housing varies widely across this area.",
    "Choice E is a park, which is primarily recreational and does not include any type of residential housing.",
    "The key need in the question is to find a standalone townhouse not attached to others. Given that suburbs tend to have multiple detached housing options, the best choice aligning with this requirement is the suburbs.",
    "Therefore, among all the options provided, the suburbs (Choice C) are more likely to have detached houses, including standalone townhouses."
