  "query": "Question: Grandma always had baked cookies, all you had to do was look in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: mouth\nB: jar\nC: fridge\nD: house\nE: plate",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the context of the question. Grandma always had baked cookies, which suggests a storage or display method that is common for cookies.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices given. \"Mouth\" (A) does not make sense in the context of where cookies can be found.",
    "Then, \"Jar\" (B) is a common container for cookies, especially in a home setting where a grandmother might keep baked goods.",
    "Now, \"Fridge\" (C) is another option, as cookies can be stored there too, but it's less traditional for everyday access to cookies than a jar.",
    "Looking at \"House\" (D), it is too broad and doesn\u2019t specify a particular place to find cookies.",
    "Lastly, \"Plate\" (E) could be where cookies are served, but generally, cookies are not stored long-term on a plate.",
    "Considering all options, a jar is the most common and traditional choice for Grandma to store her baked cookies, as it allows easy access and keeps them fresh."
