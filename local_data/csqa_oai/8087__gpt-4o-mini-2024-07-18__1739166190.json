  "query": "Question: Where is an active solider likely to sleep?\n\nChoices:\nA: armored car\nB: white house\nC: underwater\nD: tent\nE: trenches",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environments where active soldiers are likely to operate. Soldiers often have to adapt to different situations depending on their missions and locations.",
    "Next, review the provided options. An armored car (A) is primarily a vehicle for transport and protection, not typically used for sleeping.",
    "The White House (B) is a secure building used for official government functions and is not a sleeping area for active soldiers.",
    "Underwater (C) is not a practical sleeping option for soldiers, as they need to breathe and cannot sleep underwater safely.",
    "A tent (D) is a common sleeping arrangement for soldiers during field operations, especially in outdoor environments where they need shelter.",
    "Trenches (E) are historically used for soldiers in combat situations, particularly in World War I, and can serve as makeshift sleeping areas, but they are less common in modern contexts compared to tents.",
    "Compare the practicality of the tent versus trenches. Tents are designed specifically for sleeping and are commonly used in various military operations.",
    "Given the likely scenarios active soldiers face, both tents and trenches are viable options, but tents are typically more favorable in terms of modern military sleeping arrangements.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate and conventional place for an active soldier to sleep, considering practicality and current military practices, would be a tent."
