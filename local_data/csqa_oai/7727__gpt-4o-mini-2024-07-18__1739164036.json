  "query": "Question: What  is likely to happen to ice in the sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: cool water\nB: cool drink\nC: cool off\nD: nothing\nE: become water",
  "steps": [
    "When ice is placed in sunlight, it is exposed to heat from the sun.",
    "The heat from the sun will increase the temperature of the ice.",
    "As the temperature of the ice rises, it will begin to melt.",
    "When ice melts, it transitions from solid form to liquid form.",
    "The liquid form of ice is water.",
    "Therefore, the ice will not turn into \"cool water\" or stay \"cool\" as it is melting.",
    "The concept of \"cool drink\" does not directly relate to the melting ice; it refers to a drink that is cold, not the state of the ice.",
    "The idea of \"nothing\" happening implies no change, which contradicts the prediction of melting.",
    "Given the melting process, the logical conclusion is that the ice will indeed become water."
