  "query": "Question: The man asked to have a tissue holder installed at the dealership, where did they put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: convenient spot\nB: bathroom or bedroom\nC: office\nD: airplane\nE: car",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"man\" asking for a tissue holder to be installed, which suggests it might be a place where people frequently need tissues.",
    "Consider the context of a \"dealership,\" which typically refers to a car dealership.",
    "At a car dealership, common areas where one might need a tissue holder could include waiting areas, customer service areas, or possibly inside cars.",
    "Options B (bathroom or bedroom) and D (airplane) seem unlikely as they are not typically associated with a dealership setting.",
    "Option C (office) is also a potential option as there may be administrative offices in a dealership.",
    "However, option E (car) stands out, as having a tissue holder installed in a car aligns well with the primary business of a car dealership.",
    "Evaluate how likely it is for a tissue holder to be installed in common areas of a dealership versus in cars; it seems more practical to have one in the cars sold by the dealership.",
    "Given this, the installation of the tissue holder is most logically placed inside a car.",
    "Considering all the contexts evaluated, option E (car) is the most sensible answer."
