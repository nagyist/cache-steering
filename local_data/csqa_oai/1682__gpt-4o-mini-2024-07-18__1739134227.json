  "steps": [
    "The first thing to consider is the immediate consequence of hurting someone else. It likely causes pain to that person.",
    "Next, it's essential to recognize that hurting someone can lead to feelings of guilt or remorse in the perpetrator.",
    "Furthermore, depending on the severity of the hurt, it might draw legal consequences, potentially leading to legal problems for the person who caused the harm.",
    "In addition, there could be social repercussions, how others perceive and react to the act of hurting someone else.",
    "Public perception can lead to a public outcry, particularly if the act is seen as unjust or particularly cruel.",
    "However, the question focuses on the direct cause of the act, which involves both physical and social implications.",
    "It's also important to note that hurting someone can lead to punishment in a legal or social context, as society often enforces norms against such behavior.",
    "Analyzing the answers, while \"punishment,\" \"public outcry,\" and \"legal problems\" could occur, they are more of responses rather than direct results of the act of hurting someone.",
    "The most direct result of hurting someone is that it inflicts \"physical pain\" upon them.",
    "Thus, while there are various consequences, the act itself inherently causes physical pain as its primary outcome."
