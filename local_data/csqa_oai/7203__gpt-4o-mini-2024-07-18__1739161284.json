  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze each option for where one would typically fill a salad bowl with as much as you can eat.",
    "A dishwasher is not a place where food is served, so it cannot be the answer.",
    "A restaurant could be a possibility, but not all restaurants offer unlimited servings of salad; it depends on the type of restaurant.",
    "A buffet is specifically designed for all-you-can-eat situations, which typically includes salad options. This place allows patrons to fill their bowls multiple times.",
    "A French restaurant might offer salads, but it is more likely to be a sit-down style restaurant without unlimited servings or buffet style.",
    "A cupboard is simply a storage space for food and cannot be considered a place to fill a salad bowl for consumption.",
    "After considering all options, the buffet stands out as the type of place where you can fill a salad bowl with as much as you can eat.",
    "The other options do not fit the criteria as well as the buffet does for unlimited salad servings."
