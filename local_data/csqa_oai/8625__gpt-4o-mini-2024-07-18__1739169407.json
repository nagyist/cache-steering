  "query": "Question: She wanted a condominium near the Gulf of Mexico, where should she look for one?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: washington\nC: california\nD: community\nE: florida",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that she wants a condominium near the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "The Gulf of Mexico borders several states in the United States, which are relevant to this search.",
    "The states that have coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.",
    "The options given are Michigan, Washington, California, community, and Florida.",
    "Michigan and Washington are not near the Gulf of Mexico, so they can be eliminated.",
    "California is on the Pacific coast, not the Gulf of Mexico, so it can also be eliminated.",
    "The term \"community\" does not refer to a specific geographic location, hence it is not a valid choice for finding a condominium near the Gulf.",
    "This leaves Florida as the only viable option since it has a significant coastline along the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "Condominiums can often be found in coastal areas, and Florida is known for its beach communities along the Gulf.",
    "Given all this information, Florida is the correct answer where she should look for a condominium near the Gulf of Mexico."
