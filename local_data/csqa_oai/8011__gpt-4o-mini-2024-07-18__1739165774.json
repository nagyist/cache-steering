    "The question states that the statistician looked at an attribute but wanted more information. This implies he sought additional descriptive information or analysis related to that attribute.",
    "Choice A, \"calculus,\" seems irrelevant as it pertains to a branch of mathematics rather than providing descriptive information about an attribute.",
    "Choice B, \"description,\" could be a plausible option as it suggests further detail or explanation about the attribute in question.",
    "Choice C, \"formulas,\" while they might be used to analyze attributes statistically, they don't directly describe or provide information about the attributes themselves.",
    "Choice D, \"sentence where described,\" suggests a narrative form of description but is not as straightforward as choice B, which denotes the need for descriptive information.",
    "Choice E, \"array,\" refers to a data structure which doesn't seem relevant to the desire for more information in a descriptive sense.",
    "Comparing the relevance of the remaining choices, B (description) directly addresses the statistician's need for more information about the attribute in a clear and straightforward way."
