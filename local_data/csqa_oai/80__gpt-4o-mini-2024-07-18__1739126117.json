  "query": "Question: He was receiving workman's compensation, he had tripped over a metal rod while building where?\n\nChoices:\nA: factory\nB: construction site\nC: engine\nD: insides of skyscraper's walls\nE: shops",
  "steps": [
    "We know that workman's compensation is typically given to employees who are injured while performing their job duties.",
    "The injury in question occurred when he tripped over a metal rod, which suggests a work environment where such materials are present.",
    "Factories generally have machines and materials, including metal rods, but the context of tripping typically involves active construction or assembly.",
    "A construction site is a location where various materials are spread out, and workers often navigate through potentially hazardous conditions, such as tripping over objects.",
    "Considering the other options, 'engine' typically refers to a machine rather than a work environment, making it an unlikely choice for where he was injured.",
    "'Insides of skyscraper's walls' is very specific and suggests a more confined location, which is less likely for a tripping hazard over a metal rod.",
    "'Shops' may have tools and materials, but they are less associated with construction-related injuries like tripping over rods as seen on a construction site.",
    "Given that the accident occurred due to tripping over a metal rod while working, the most logical conclusion is that it happened at a construction site, which aligns with standard scenarios for workman's compensation claims."
