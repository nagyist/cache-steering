    "To start living life with someone else, one typically considers the nature of the relationship and what steps would signify a commitment to sharing their lives together.",
    "Making love (A) could represent a form of intimacy, but it is generally not the first step in establishing a life together. It does not reflect a commitment to partnership.",
    "Getting married (B) is a formal and traditional way to signify a commitment to living one's life with someone else. It often involves legal and social recognition of the partnership.",
    "Having children (D) is a significant step in a relationship but usually follows the establishment of a stable partnership, such as marriage. It is often a result of living together, rather than a starting point.",
    "Learning (E) can be an important part of any relationship, especially in understanding each other and growing together, but it is quite general and does not directly indicate the initiation of living with someone else.",
