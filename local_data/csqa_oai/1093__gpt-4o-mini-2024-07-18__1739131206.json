  "query": "Question: James bought a hide bed sofa because it was space efficient. Where might he live?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: apartment\nC: village\nD: beach condo\nE: hotel",
  "steps": [
    "James bought a hide bed sofa, which suggests that he values space efficiency. This is often a consideration in smaller living environments.",
    "Looking at the choices, a house typically has more space than a sofa bed requires, so it\u2019s less likely that he lives in a house.",
    "A village may have larger homes and spaces as well, which leads me to conclude that it\u2019s also less likely for him to live in a village.",
    "A beach condo could be small, but these places are often more spacious than typical apartments, especially in a resort-like setting.",
    "Hotels are usually not permanent residences and are not typical places where someone would buy furniture like a hide bed sofa.",
    "Out of the remaining options, an apartment is commonly associated with smaller living spaces, and many apartment dwellers opt for space-efficient furniture.",
    "Thus, based on the need for space efficiency, the most likely living arrangement for James is an apartment."
