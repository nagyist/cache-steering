  "query": "Question: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what?\n\nChoices:\nA: careful\nB: thoughtful\nC: complete\nD: thorough\nE: intricate",
  "steps": [
    "The passage indicates that John performed a minimal or superficial examination of the corpse, implying he did not go into detail or fully investigate the circumstances surrounding the death.",
    "The phrase \"missed the real cause of death\" suggests that if John had invested more effort into his examination, he would have discovered what truly caused the death. This implies a need for a deeper level of scrutiny.",
    "In evaluating the options, I need to focus on words that emphasize a more extensive or careful examination. The terms should convey a sense of completeness or attention to detail.",
    "Option A, \"careful,\" suggests caution but does not specifically denote a comprehensive examination.",
    "Option B, \"thoughtful,\" implies consideration but also lacks the connotation of a detailed investigation.",
    "Option C, \"complete,\" might suggest that he needed to finish all parts of the examination, but it does not explicitly imply thoroughness.",
    "Option D, \"thorough,\" directly communicates that John\u2019s examination lacked the depth necessary to uncover the true cause of death, which aligns perfectly with the context.",
    "Option E, \"intricate,\" refers more to the complexity of something rather than the depth of examination, making it a less relevant choice.",
    "Based on this analysis, \"thorough\" aligns best with the requirements for a detailed and effective examination, which John clearly failed to perform."
