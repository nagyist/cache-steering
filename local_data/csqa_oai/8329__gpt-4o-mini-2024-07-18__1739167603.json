  "steps": [
    "The question states that the snake found a warm place to sleep next to a human, which suggests it is in proximity to a human's belongings or environment.",
    "Next, I need to analyze the options given to see if they can serve as a \"warm place\" next to a human.",
    "Option A is a tree. While a tree can provide shelter, it is typically not considered a warm place, especially compared to other options.",
    "Option B is \"warm place\", which is quite vague, but it doesn't specifically identify where the snake is.",
    "Option C is a wooded area. This could potentially be warm due to the sunlight filtering through the leaves, but it's more of a general habitat than a specific warm place.",
    "Option D is \"sand\". Sand can be warm in the sun, but it's not typically found right next to humans unless at a beach or similar area.",
    "Option E is a \"sleeping bag\". This is a prime candidate for a warm place next to a human, as sleeping bags are designed for warmth and comfort.",
    "Given the proximity to a human, and the fact that a sleeping bag is specifically designed to retain warmth, it is reasonable to conclude that the snake likely ended up in the sleeping bag.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating all options in the context of the question, the best answer is the one that aligns with both being warm and being next to a human."
