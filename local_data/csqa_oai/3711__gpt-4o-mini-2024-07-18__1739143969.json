  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about where bees go to find wildflowers, which are typically found in natural, open environments.",
    "Wildflowers tend to grow in areas that are not heavily urbanized, and the best environments for them are usually rural or undeveloped areas.",
    "The sky is not a suitable choice because bees do not find wildflowers in the sky; they need a terrestrial location.",
    "The beach may have some flowers but is not known for wildflower abundance compared to other environments like the countryside.",
    "Michigan, while it has wildflowers, is a specific location and does not encompass the broader concept of where bees find wildflowers.",
    "The countryside generally refers to rural areas that are often abundant in wildflower growth, making it a highly suitable option for bees searching for flowers.",
    "When considering the options collectively, the countryside stands out as the best general answer for where bees go to find wildflowers."
