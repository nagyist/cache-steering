  "query": "Question: What might a person see at the scene of a brutal killing?\n\nChoices:\nA: bloody mess\nB: pleasure\nC: being imprisoned\nD: feeling of guilt\nE: cake",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a brutal killing. A brutal killing typically involves violence that results in significant injury or death, suggesting a scene that would be chaotic and disturbing.",
    "Next, examine the choices provided. The phrase \"bloody mess\" closely aligns with the typical evidence and aftermath of violence and death, indicating physical blood and disorder at the scene.",
    "Now, evaluate the option \"pleasure.\" In the context of a brutal killing scene, it is unlikely that one would experience pleasure, as the situation is inherently tragic and horrifying.",
    "The option \"being imprisoned\" usually pertains to actions that happen after a crime has been committed. While being imprisoned might be a consequence of a brutal killing, it does not directly relate to what someone would see at the scene of the killing itself.",
    "Next, look at \"feeling of guilt.\" While someone might feel guilt after witnessing or being involved in a brutal killing, this is an emotional response rather than a physical element present at the scene.",
    "Lastly, consider \"cake.\" It is irrelevant and out of place in the context of a violent crime scene and has no connection to the brutal killing scenario.",
    "After evaluating all the options against the context of a brutal killing, \"bloody mess\" remains the only relevant choice that captures what one might visually encounter at such a scene."
