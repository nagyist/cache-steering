  "steps": [
    "The question states that the hare traveled fast but became overconfident (cocky), which implies that the hare did not maintain its speed throughout the race.",
    "The tortoise, on the other hand, is often depicted as moving at a slower pace compared to the hare. This is a key element of the classic fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare.\"",
    "The phrase \"though the tortoise traveled how it won the race\" suggests that the manner in which the tortoise traveled contributed to its victory.",
    "Since the tortoise is known for its slow and steady approach, the answer must reflect this characteristic.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, we notice that \"slowly\" is listed twice (options B and C).",
    "The other options (A: low, D: lightly, E: behind) do not appropriately describe the manner in which the tortoise traveled to win the race.",
    "Regardless of whether I choose B or C, both refer to the same idea of the tortoise moving at a slow pace.",
    "In literary context, the idea of \"slowly\" aligns perfectly with the tortoise's character and the moral of perseverance.",
    "Since both B and C are the same phrase, I can select either as the answer."
