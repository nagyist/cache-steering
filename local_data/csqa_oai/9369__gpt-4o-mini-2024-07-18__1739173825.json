  "query": "Question: What is the opposite of being dead?\n\nChoices:\nA: working\nB: breathing\nC: born\nD: being\nE: alive",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what \"being dead\" means. It indicates that a living organism has lost all biological functions that sustain life.",
    "Next, we need to consider what the opposite of this state would be. An opposite condition would signify the presence of life or living functions.",
    "From the choices given, we should analyze which of them denotes a state that is contrary to being dead.",
    "Choice A, \"working,\" does not directly relate to life itself and can apply to inanimate objects or systems, so it is not the direct opposite of being dead.",
    "Choice B, \"breathing,\" is a function of living beings but is not synonymous with being alive, as some living things (e.g., fish) may have different ways of breathing.",
    "Choice C, \"born,\" refers to the beginning of life but does not represent being alive in the ongoing sense.",
    "Choice D, \"being,\" is a broad term that does not specifically indicate life or the opposite of being dead.",
    "Choice E, \"alive,\" directly opposes the concept of being dead, as it indicates a state of having life.",
    "After analysis, the term that most directly signifies the opposite of being dead is \"alive.\""
