  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the context of buying too much beer. When someone buys excessive amounts, it may lead to increased consumption.",
    "Next, we analyze the effects of consuming too much beer. Intoxication is a common consequence when a person drinks in excess.",
    "Additionally, intoxication can lead to other issues such as poor decision-making or risky behaviors.",
    "One significant risk associated with heavy drinking is the potential for legal problems, including getting arrested due to actions taken while intoxicated, such as public intoxication or driving under the influence.",
    "We also consider the emotional impact; consuming too much beer might lead to feelings of boredom or even temporary pleasure, but these are less direct consequences related to money spent.",
