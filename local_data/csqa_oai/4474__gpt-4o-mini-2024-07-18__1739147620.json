  "query": "Question: Other than a municipal park, where would you find a tennis court?\n\nChoices:\nA: college campus\nB: michigan\nC: country club\nD: high school\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations where tennis courts are commonly found aside from municipal parks.",
    "Next, I consider educational institutions. Colleges and high schools often have athletic facilities, including tennis courts, to support their sports programs.",
    "I also consider private establishments, such as country clubs, which typically feature tennis courts as part of their recreational offerings for members.",
    "Looking at the options provided, A (college campus) and D (high school) are educational institutions that may have tennis courts.",
    "C (country club) is a private institution where tennis courts are likely present, especially for recreational use.",
    "Now I examine B (Michigan) and E (town). Michigan is a state, not a specific venue, and while towns might have tennis courts, the question seeks specific types of locations rather than general areas.",
    "Based on my considerations, A (college campus) and D (high school) both represent valid locations, but C (country club) is distinct for its private nature and typical inclusion of tennis facilities.",
    "Since the question asks for \"other than a municipal park,\" I must pinpoint the most aligned answer with established patterns of court locations.",
    "Out of A, C, and D, I determine that C (country club) uniquely stands out as catering specifically to tennis enthusiasts in a private setting."
