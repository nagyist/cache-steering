  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"Talking to someone is pointless\" suggests that communication is ineffective under certain conditions.",
    "To understand the context, I need to analyze the choices provided for scenarios where talking would be considered pointless.",
    "Choice A: \"dry mouth\" \u2013 This is a physical condition, but it doesn\u2019t prevent communication. It may affect the clarity of speech but not the act of communicating.",
    "Choice B: \"whispering\" \u2013 Whispering is a way of communication; it doesn't make talking pointless. People can still exchange ideas when whispering.",
    "Choice C: \"being heard\" \u2013 If someone is not being heard, it implies that communication is ineffective, but it doesn't directly make talking pointless.",
    "Choice D: \"eye contact\" \u2013 While eye contact is important for effective communication, its absence does not necessarily render talking pointless.",
    "Choice E: \"not listening\" \u2013 If someone is not listening, then the effort to communicate is indeed pointless as the listener is not receiving the information.",
    "Considering all the choices, the option that clearly indicates a situation where talking is pointless is when the other party is \"not listening.\""
