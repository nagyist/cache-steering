  "query": "Question: Where were the cowboys herding the heifers across the property towards?\n\nChoices:\nA: deep sea\nB: slaughterhouse\nC: cattle ranch\nD: countryside\nE: barnyard",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the cowboys were herding heifers. Heifers are young female cattle, which suggests that they are being managed on a property related to cattle farming.",
    "The intent behind herding animals typically involves moving them to a location relevant to their care or use, such as a barn, pasture, or ranch.",
    "Reviewing the choices, \"deep sea\" (A) is not relevant to cattle or herding. \"Slaughterhouse\" (B) might be a destination for cattle, but \"herding\" suggests they are not being herded toward their end.",
    "\"Cattle ranch\" (C) is a valid destination where cowboys would take heifers as it is a common place for managing and caring for livestock.",
    "The \"countryside\" (D) is too vague and not a specific destination. It refers more broadly to rural areas rather than a defined location for the heifers.",
    "\"Barnyard\" (E) could be a place for animals, but it is usually less associated with the act of herding compared to the ranch, which encompasses larger areas for movement.",
    "After evaluating all options based on the context provided, the \"cattle ranch\" (C) stands out as the most appropriate and specific location that fits the purpose of herding heifers."
