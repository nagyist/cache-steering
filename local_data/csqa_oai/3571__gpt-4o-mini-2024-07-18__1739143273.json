  "query": "Question: Name a sort of place where live crabs are not allowed.\n\nChoices:\nA: most offices\nB: fish department\nC: basin\nD: fancy restaurant\nE: fish market",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the question. We are looking for a type of place where live crabs would not be permitted.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each choice based on the typical activities and rules associated with those places.",
    "Choice A: \"Most offices\" - Generally, offices are not environments where live crab or seafood would be necessary or allowed.",
    "Choice B: \"Fish department\" - This is typically a section of a grocery store where seafood is sold, so it is likely to have live crabs.",
    "Choice C: \"Basin\" - A basin is simply a bowl or container used for holding liquids, and it does not inherently have a rule against live crabs.",
    "Choice D: \"Fancy restaurant\" - While a fancy restaurant could have seafood on the menu, it might not allow live crabs in the dining area, but it's possible they would have them in a kitchen for food preparation.",
    "Choice E: \"Fish market\" - Similar to a fish department, this is specifically a place that sells seafood, including live crabs.",
    "Based on this analysis, \"most offices\" (choice A) is the least likely place for live crabs to be allowed since they are not relevant to the office environment at all."
