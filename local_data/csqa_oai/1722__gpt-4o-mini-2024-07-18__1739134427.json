  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze what a good place for a woman to store her sunglasses should be. Sunglasses need to be stored in a location that protects them from damage and makes them easily accessible.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the options provided to see which one meets these criteria.",
    "Option A (drugstore) is not a place for personal storage; it's a retail store where one would purchase items rather than store them.",
    "Option B (movie theater) is also not a storage place; it is a public venue where sunglasses are not stored but rather used or kept in a personal item while watching a movie.",
    "Now considering Option C (bag), in general, a bag can be a good place to store sunglasses, as long as it has a dedicated spot or case for them to prevent scratching or breaking.",
    "Then, I will evaluate Option D (shirt pocket). While a shirt pocket might seem convenient, it is quite risky as sunglasses can easily fall out or be damaged in such a small and open space.",
    "Next, I review Option E (purse). A purse is similar to a bag and can provide a safe space for storing sunglasses, especially if it has compartments or a case.",
    "After evaluating all options, I find that both C (bag) and E (purse) are suitable. However, \"purse\" generally implies a more organized space compared to just any \"bag.\"",
    "Since sunglasses are often part of a woman\u2019s accessories, a purse, being a common item for women, would likely be the better choice for storing them securely."
