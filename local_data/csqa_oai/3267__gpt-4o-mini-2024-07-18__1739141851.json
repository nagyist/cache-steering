  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"had a reputation for celebrating in a debaucherous manner\" suggests that their celebrations were excessive or indulgent, often implying a negative connotation.",
    "Debauchery typically involves excessive drinking or partying, which leads to certain outcomes that are commonly associated with such behavior.",
    "One potential outcome of excessive drinking is 'drunkenness', which is characterized by a lack of control due to alcohol consumption.",
    "Another potential outcome of a debaucherous celebration could be 'fighting', as such environments can lead to conflicts and aggressive behaviors among party-goers.",
    "However, 'enjoyment' and 'have fun' are generally positive outcomes and may not reflect the negative implications of debauchery.",
    "The term 'hang over' directly relates to the aftermath of excessive alcohol consumption, where individuals experience unpleasant effects after heavy drinking.",
    "Comparing 'drunkenness' and 'hang over', both are direct consequences of debaucherous behavior, but 'hang over' is the result of the drunkenness experienced during such celebrations.",
    "Among the choices, the most likely outcomes of such a reputation would be either drunkenness, fighting, or hangover based on the context of indulgent celebrations.",
    "Between 'drunkenness' and 'hang over', 'drunkenness' seems to be the immediate result of celebrating, while 'hang over' is a later consequence.",
    "Ultimately, since 'drunkenness' happens first during the celebration and aligns most closely with the immediate reputation for debauchery, it stands out as the primary outcome."
