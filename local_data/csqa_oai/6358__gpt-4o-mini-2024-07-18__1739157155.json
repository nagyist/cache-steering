  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of where a mother might commonly use a ribbon.",
    "A box is a potential place for ribbons, but it is not a typical or common use for them.",
    "A girl's hair is a very common place for mothers to put ribbons, especially in the context of dressing up or styling.",
    "A Christmas tree is also a common place for ribbons, used as decoration during the holiday season, but this is less about a mother's direct involvement.",
    "A typewriter does not relate to anything a mother would typically do with a ribbon.",
    "A floral arrangement can also use ribbons, but this is less frequent and generally more specific to certain occasions or arrangements.",
    "Comparing the options, putting a ribbon in a girl's hair stands out as the most everyday action a mother would likely take.",
    "While a Christmas tree is also a valid option, it tends to be seasonal and less personal than styling a child's hair.",
    "Thus, the most common and probable answer for where a mother is likely to put a ribbon is in a girl's hair."
