  "query": "Question: Johnny was looking for blowfish in places that weren't near America.  Where would he look?\n\nChoices:\nA: fish market\nB: hawaiian waters\nC: gulf of mexico\nD: tropical sea\nE: south pacific ocean",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Johnny is looking for blowfish in places that aren't near America. Therefore, options that are geographically close to America can be eliminated from consideration.",
    "Choice A, \"fish market,\" does not specify a location and is a general term, so it cannot necessarily be assumed to be outside of America.",
    "Choice B, \"hawaiian waters,\" refers to waters around Hawaii, which is part of the United States and therefore not outside America.",
    "Choice C, \"gulf of mexico,\" is a body of water that is very close to America, specifically the southeastern coast, and can also be eliminated.",
    "Choice D, \"tropical sea,\" is also a broad term but does not specify a location, making it ambiguous, yet it does not indicate it\u2019s outside American waters.",
    "Choice E, \"south pacific ocean,\" is a vast area of ocean that is located significantly away from America and is not associated with any American territories, thus qualifying as an area where Johnny could look for blowfish.",
    "Since the question specifically asks for locations not near America, the elimination of options A, B, C, and D leaves choice E as the only plausible option.",
    "Choice E appears to be the most fitting answer based on geographic considerations, as it is well-known that blowfish are found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean."
