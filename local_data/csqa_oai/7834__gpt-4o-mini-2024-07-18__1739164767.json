  "query": "Question: The vacation price included the hotel and meals, that's why he picked this particular what?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: las vegas\nC: metropolitan area\nD: resort\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that the vacation price included the hotel and meals, suggesting that it's a packaged deal.",
    "This packaged deal is likely to be found in a place specifically designed for vacations, which typically also provides accommodations and dining options.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"town\" and \"city\" are generally broader terms that do not inherently imply specialized vacation accommodations.",
    "\"Las Vegas\" is a specific location, but it does not inherently indicate a broader type of vacation destination without further context.",
    "\"Metropolitan area\" also refers to a broader region and doesn't specifically imply a vacation destination that includes accommodations and meals.",
    "\"Resort,\" however, typically refers to a venue that specifically offers lodging and meals as part of the vacation experience.",
    "Therefore, the mention of hotel and meals aligns most closely with the term \"resort.\"",
    "Since \"resort\" fits perfectly with the context provided in the question regarding a vacation package, it is the best choice."
