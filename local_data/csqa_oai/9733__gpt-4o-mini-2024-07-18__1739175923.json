  "query": "Question: Where might I find seating while waiting to take public transit in a major city?\n\nChoices:\nA: rest area\nB: bus depot\nC: theatre\nD: bus stop\nE: church",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the context of public transit, which typically involves taking buses, trains, or other forms of mass transportation within a city.",
    "Next, I should consider where people traditionally wait for public transit options. Waiting areas are typically designed for convenience where transit users can gather.",
    "I will evaluate each option provided:  \n- A rest area is generally found on highways and is geared towards travelers, not typical public transit users.",
    "- A bus depot is a designated area for buses that often includes seating since it\u2019s a hub for boarding and disembarking passengers, making it a strong candidate.",
    "- A theatre is intended for entertainment purposes, and while people might wait there, they are not typically waiting for public transit.",
    "- A bus stop is a common location where passengers wait for buses; it often has some seating but may vary by city.",
    "- A church usually serves spiritual purposes and, while it may have seating, it is not a common transit waiting area.",
    "Now, I need to identify which locations are specifically designed for transit users. While both a bus depot and a bus stop are relevant, the bus depot is a dedicated facility for this purpose.",
    "I also see that a bus stop can be less formal with varied facilities and might not always have seating available. Therefore, between bus depot and bus stop, the bus depot is more definitively a waiting area for transit."
