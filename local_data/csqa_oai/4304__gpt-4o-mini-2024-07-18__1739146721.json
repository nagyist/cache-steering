  "query": "Question: If you're talking to something then you probable hope that you're also doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: dry mouth\nB: eye contact\nC: being heard\nD: not listening\nE: conversation",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies a scenario where someone is engaged in a dialogue or interaction with another entity, be it a person or something else.",
    "When someone is talking to something, they generally expect a form of reciprocation or acknowledgment from that entity.",
    "One primary expectation when speaking is that the other party is also paying attention to them in some way.",
    "Out of the choices provided, \"being heard\" directly relates to the expectation that one's words and thoughts are acknowledged by the other party.",
    "Other options like \"dry mouth\" and \"not listening\" are less relevant to the act of talking, as they do not imply a positive or reciprocal communication effort.",
    "\"Eye contact\" is a good aspect of communication, but it specifically pertains to visual attention rather than the broader concept of being understood and acknowledged.",
    "\"Conversation\" is too vague and broad, as it encompasses the act of talking, listening, and the back-and-forth exchange but does not specifically match the hope of an individual talking.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"being heard\" seems the most aligned with a fundamental hope when engaged in conversation."
