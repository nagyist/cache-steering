  "query": "Question: Where do you hang a picture?\n\nChoices:\nA: wall\nB: desktop\nC: table\nD: newspaper\nE: ceiling",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of a picture hanging. Pictures are typically displayed for viewing purposes rather than for function like furniture or work surfaces.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided options to see where a picture can practically be displayed. A table is usually used for placing objects rather than hanging items.",
    "Then, look at the option \u201cnewspaper\u201d. Newspapers are a medium for news and information and not a suitable option for hanging pictures.",
    "Now, consider \u201cceiling.\u201d Although some decorative elements may be hung from ceilings, it is not a common place for typical picture hanging, which is usually at eye level.",
    "Examine the word \u201cwall.\u201d Walls are traditionally where pictures are hung because they provide a vertical surface designed for that purpose.",
    "Also, think about how a picture is usually hung. It requires nails, hooks, or adhesive that work best on solid vertical surfaces, which align with walls.",
    "Review the options once more. The option \"desktop\" refers to a flat surface, and while you can place a framed picture on a desktop, it isn't considered hanging a picture.",
    "Cross-reference with other options again. Wall is the most logical choice since it fits the purpose of displaying a picture prominently.",
    "Double-check the definitions and common practices surrounding picture display, confirming that the wall is indeed the fitting option."
