  "query": "Question: He had to try to make the call in the middle of the night, it was hard to communicate using only a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: communicating\nB: response\nC: yelling\nD: hanging up\nE: whisper",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that \"in the middle of the night\" there is difficulty in communication.",
    "Communicating at night often requires lower volume to avoid disturbing others, suggesting that loud communication would be inappropriate.",
    "The phrase \"using only a what?\" indicates that we are looking for a method or tool of communication.",
    "Evaluating the options: A \"communicating\" is not a specific method but a general term. B \"response\" refers to the reaction or feedback, not a method. D \"hanging up\" refers to terminating a call, which is not a method of communication.",
    "This leaves us with \"yelling\" and \"whisper\" as potential communication methods.",
    "Yelling would be difficult in the night not only because of noise but also logically does not fit the context of trying to avoid waking people.",
    "Whispering fits the context as it is a silent way of communicating that is suitable for late-night situations where one wants to be quiet.",
    "Thus, whispering is the preferred method of communication implied in the question."
