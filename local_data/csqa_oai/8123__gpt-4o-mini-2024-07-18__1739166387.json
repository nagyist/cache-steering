  "query": "Question: The power went out, so why did the family use a candle?\n\nChoices:\nA: emit light\nB: burn brightly\nC: warmth\nD: light house\nE: fire hazard",
  "steps": [
    "The family is in a situation without power, which means they need an alternative source of light.",
    "A candle is a common alternative that can be used for illumination when electricity is not available.",
    "Among the choices provided, option A (\"emit light\") directly relates to the function of a candle in this context.",
    "While a candle does burn brightly, the main purpose in this scenario is to provide light, not just brightness.",
    "The choice for warmth (C) is not the primary reason for using a candle; it's more about illumination.",
    "Option D (\"light house\") does not make sense in this context as it refers to a structure rather than the use of a candle.",
    "A candle can pose a fire hazard (E), but this is not a reason to use it; rather, it is a caution to consider.",
    "Looking at the reasons the family would turn to a candle during a power outage, the emitting of light stands out as the most relevant reason.",
    "Therefore, option A (\"emit light\") is the most logical choice based on the context given."
