  "query": "Question: The ground floor of what structure would contain workers in suits and ties?\n\nChoices:\nA: brownstone\nB: highrise building\nC: hotel\nD: school\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a structure where workers in suits and ties would typically be found on the ground floor.",
    "Workers in suits and ties often indicate a professional work environment, which is commonly associated with office buildings or highrise buildings.",
    "Brownstones are generally residential buildings in urban areas and are less likely to have a ground floor populated by workers in suits.",
    "Hotels could have business-related services but are more associated with hospitality rather than a primary work environment for suits and ties.",
    "Schools are educational facilities and do not typically involve workers in suits and ties; instead, they would more likely involve teachers and staff in more casual attire.",
    "An office building is specifically designed for business operations and frequently houses employees in professional attire, including suits and ties.",
    "Highrise buildings can also be office buildings, but without additional context about the specific type of building, it is more ambiguous than just saying \"office building.\"",
    "Given the need for a definitive answer and a particular focus on the professional attire in a dedicated business environment, \"office building\" is the most fitting choice."
