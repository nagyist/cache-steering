  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the phrase \"the difficulty of life was killing him.\" This suggests that the person was experiencing a profound struggle or distress.",
    "Given this context, I can infer that the individual may feel overwhelmed and could consider drastic actions as a response to their suffering.",
    "Next, I will consider the answer choices provided to identify what aligns with the feeling of being overwhelmed by life's difficulties.",
    "Choice A: suicide, seems to be a potential response to severe distress, representing a way to escape pain.",
    "Choice B: grief, while related to sadness, does not suggest a decisive action the person would take in this context.",
    "Choice C: going to jail, does not directly correlate with the emotional struggle mentioned; it seems less relevant.",
    "Choice D: not living, can be interpreted similarly to suicide, as it implies an end to existence.",
    "Choice E: wrote his congressman, appears unlikely as a response to personal suffering; it seems an indirect action not fitting the emotional intensity implied.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the strongest candidates appear to be A (suicide) and D (not living). Both relate closely to the meaning of ending suffering.",
    "Between choices A and D, suicide is more explicit, while not living is more vague but could equivalently mean a choice toward self-harm or cessation.",
    "Considering that the phrase implies a severe struggle, the most immediate and impactful choice that fits is A (suicide) rather than the more passive interpretation of D."
