  "query": "Question: They got to the door and it was locked, he reached in his jeans what to retrieve the key?\n\nChoices:\nA: pocket\nB: bus depot\nC: lock\nD: purse\nE: front door",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes someone reaching into their jeans to find a key to unlock a door.",
    "The action of reaching into jeans implies looking for something that is typically kept in clothing.",
    "Among the options provided, the most logical place to keep a key is in a \"pocket.\"",
    "A \"bus depot,\" \"lock,\" \"purse,\" and \"front door\" do not represent places where someone would commonly keep a key in their jeans.",
    "Since the context is directly about retrieving a key from jeans, it further validates that it would be retrieved from a \"pocket.\"",
    "I can eliminate options B, C, D, and E since they don't correlate with retrieving a key from jeans.",
    "Therefore, the only remaining valid option is \"pocket.\""
