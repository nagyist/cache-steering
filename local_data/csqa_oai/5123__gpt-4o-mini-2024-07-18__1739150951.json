  "steps": [
    "When jumping out of a cruise ship, it is important to consider the environment surrounding the ship. Cruise ships are typically located in large bodies of water.",
    "The primary purpose of a cruise ship is to transport passengers over the ocean or seas, therefore, its immediate surroundings are generally water, not land.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, 'marina' suggests a docked area with smaller boats, which is not where a cruise ship is situated when at sea.",
    "'Airport' is not a feasible landing spot when a person jumps from a cruise ship as it is not located at sea.",
    "'A stairwell' refers to an internal structure of the ship itself, and one cannot land in a stairwell when jumping off the ship.",
    "An 'island' is a land mass, but typically, you wouldn't land on solid ground unless the ship is very close to one, which is unlikely when considering the act of jumping off a cruise ship at sea.",
    "The most logical and straightforward option when jumping off a cruise ship is that you would land in the water surrounding the vessel.",
    "Since the ocean is typically where ships operate and where you would land when jumping from a cruise ship, it aligns directly with the act of jumping out.",
    "Finally, reviewing all the options, 'ocean' is the only plausible place you would end up after jumping from a cruise ship."
