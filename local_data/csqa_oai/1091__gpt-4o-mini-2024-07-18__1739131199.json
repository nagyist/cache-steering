  "query": "Question: Where is an empty dish usually stored?\n\nChoices:\nA: resturant\nB: pantry\nC: table\nD: kitchen cabinet\nE: glass",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what the options entail. An empty dish is typically a clean dish that is not currently in use.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option based on where empty dishes are generally kept.",
    "Option A: restaurant. While restaurants have empty dishes, they are for serving purposes and not considered a storage location for home use.",
    "Option B: pantry. A pantry is usually for storing foods, packaged goods, and sometimes utensils, but not typically for dishes.",
    "Option C: table. While a dish can temporarily be placed on a table, a table is not a proper storage space for empty dishes.",
    "Option D: kitchen cabinet. Kitchen cabinets are specifically designed for storing dishes, cookware, and utensils when they are not in use.",
    "Option E: glass. This option doesn\u2019t fit the context of where an empty dish would be stored, as it refers to a material rather than a storage location.",
    "Since kitchen cabinets are most commonly where dishes are stored when not in use, this aligns perfectly with typical household practices."
