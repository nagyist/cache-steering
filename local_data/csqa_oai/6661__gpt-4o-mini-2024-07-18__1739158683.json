  "steps": [
    "The bird is described as young and still nesting, indicating that it has not yet fully matured or gained the skills it needs for independence.",
    "A young bird in a nest typically relies on its parents for food and protection, which suggests that it may not have developed key survival skills yet.",
    "To move on from the nest, a young bird must gain the ability to fly, which is crucial for escaping predators and finding its own territory.",
    "Spreading its wings (Choice A) is an important preliminary step for flight but doesn't imply that the bird has actually learned to fly.",
    "Squawking (Choice B) could be a form of communication but does not directly correlate to moving on from the nest.",
    "Learning to fly (Choice C) is essential as it encompasses understanding how to use its wings effectively to take off and navigate.",
    "Attempting to fly (Choice D) indicates a trial process but might not be successful without the prior learning stage required to do so.",
    "Catching food (Choice E) suggests a level of independence that the young bird may not be ready for until it has successfully learned to fly.",
    "Thus, the most logical and essential action for the bird to take soon in order to move on is to learn to fly."
