  "query": "Question: Where would a soprano sing live for money?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera house\nB: movie\nC: choit\nD: theater\nE: choir",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where a soprano, who is a type of classical singer, would typically perform live.",
    "Sopranos often perform in venues that specialize in singing, particularly in the classical or opera genres.",
    "I know that opera houses are specifically designed for operatic performances and would be a primary venue.",
    "The term \"theater\" may refer to various performances, but it does not specifically cater to operatic singing like an opera house does.",
    "\"Movie\" refers to film acting, which is different from live singing.",
    "A \"choir\" typically involves a group of singers and might not specifically highlight a soprano in a solo performance.",
    "\"Choir\" (the option E) may not provide the same opportunities for earning money as a professional soloist, which a soprano would be.",
    "Given that the options do not include a more specific venue for classical singing and that opera houses are specialized for such performances, that's the best fit.",
    "I have identified \"opera house\" (option A) as the most suitable place for a soprano to sing live for money."
