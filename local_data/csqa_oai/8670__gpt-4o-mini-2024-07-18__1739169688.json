  "query": "Question: What type of explosive weapon often kills innocents long after the war is over?\n\nChoices:\nA: fireworks display\nB: bomb\nC: gun\nD: landmine\nE: army",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the terms used in the question. The phrase \"explosive weapon\" indicates that we are looking for something that detonates or causes explosions.",
    "Next, evaluate each of the answer choices based on their definitions. \"A: fireworks display\" refers to celebratory explosives, which are not typically associated with killing innocents after a war.",
    "Then, examine \"B: bomb.\" While bombs are explosive devices, they are generally used during warfare and typically have a specific target rather than being known for causing long-term hazards.",
    "Next, analyze \"C: gun.\" Guns are firearms that shoot projectiles; they do not fit the description of an explosive weapon, nor are they known for causing long-term dangers post-war.",
    "Now, look at \"D: landmine.\" Landmines are specifically designed to be buried in the ground and can remain inactive until stepped on, leading to unforeseen detonation, often resulting in civilian casualties long after conflict has ended.",
    "Finally, consider \"E: army.\" An army itself is not a type of explosive weapon; it is an organized body of military personnel. Therefore, it does not fit the description in the question.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the only option that matches the description of an explosive weapon causing casualties long after the conflict is \"D: landmine.\""
