  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what \"outward expression of happiness\" typically means. This suggests behaviors or actions that visibly demonstrate feelings of happiness.",
    "Next, I will review the options provided to see which one aligns best with the concept of expressing happiness outwardly.",
    "Option A is \"love.\" While love can be related to happiness, it is not specifically an outward expression of happiness itself.",
    "Option B is \"laughter.\" This is commonly associated with happiness and is often an immediate and recognizable expression of joy.",
    "Option C is \"spread.\" This term does not relate to the expression of happiness; instead, it refers to distributing or extending something.",
    "Option D is \"tears.\" While tears can sometimes accompany happiness (like tears of joy), they are more commonly associated with sadness and not a direct expression of happiness.",
    "Option E is \"limp.\" This term refers to a physical condition rather than an emotional expression and does not relate to happiness.",
    "After reviewing the options, \"laughter\" stands out as the most direct and recognizable outward expression of happiness."
