  "query": "Question: What does an apple tree need to grow?\n\nChoices:\nA: dirt\nB: seeds\nC: south africa\nD: park\nE: paradise",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the essential requirements for any tree to grow, including an apple tree. Typically, trees need soil (dirt) for their roots to anchor and access nutrients.",
    "Next, look at the significance of seeds. An apple tree begins from seeds; without seeds, it cannot grow into a mature tree.",
    "Then, evaluate the option of \"south africa.\" While an apple tree can grow in various climates, it's not a necessary condition for growth.",
    "Now, consider the option \"park.\" A park can certainly provide an environment for trees to grow, but it\u2019s not essential since trees can grow in various places, including gardens and wild areas.",
    "Then, examine \"paradise.\" This term is vague and not a practical condition that contributes to the growth of an apple tree.",
    "Now, let's summarize the requirements identified: trees need soil for growth and seeds to initiate their life cycle.",
    "Out of the choices given, both \"dirt\" and \"seeds\" are essential for an apple tree, but we must choose only one option.",
    "Given that \"dirt\" is fundamentally necessary for any tree's growth to provide a medium for roots, it is a more universally applicable answer over seeds, which are specific to the reproductive process."
