  "query": "Question: Where would you be most likely to see a cow?\n\nChoices:\nA: road\nB: slaughter house\nC: ranch\nD: switzerland\nE: tennessee",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where cows are commonly found. Cows are domesticated animals often associated with agriculture.",
    "Next, look at the options provided. \"A: road\" is not a typical habitat for cows, as cows are not normally found or roamed on roads.",
    "\" B: slaughter house\" is a place where cows are taken after they have been raised, which is not a typical place to see them alive and grazing.",
    "Now, consider \"C: ranch.\" A ranch is an agricultural setting where livestock, including cows, are raised and taken care of. This is a very likely place to see cows.",
    "Next, assess \"D: Switzerland.\" While Switzerland is known for its picturesque landscapes and might have cows due to its pastoral regions, it is not specifically synonymous with cows compared to a ranch.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"E: Tennessee.\" Tennessee has rural areas where cows can also be found, but like Switzerland, it doesn't specifically denote a primary location for cows compared to a ranch.",
    "After reviewing all the options, \"C: ranch\" stands out as the most unequivocal and direct answer since it is designed specifically for raising livestock, including cows."
