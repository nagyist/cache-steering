  "query": "Question: Following a killing, what are the police likely to begin?\n\nChoices:\nA: man hunt\nB: punishment\nC: going to jail\nD: retribution\nE: investigation",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what the police are likely to begin following a killing, which implies they would take action in response to an incident involving a death.",
    "Out of the provided choices, \"investigation\" seems to directly refer to the systematic process the police undertake after a crime, particularly a homicide.",
    "A \"man hunt\" refers to actively searching for a suspect who has fled, which may occur if a suspect is identified and evades capture, but is not the first step taken after a killing.",
    "\"Punishment\" implies consequences that occur after the legal process, not an immediate action taken by the police in response to the incident.",
    "\"Going to jail\" involves the process of detaining an individual after arrest, which again occurs after the police have acted on their findings, not at the onset.",
    "\"Retribution\" is a concept more associated with personal or societal vengeance rather than a police action. The police do not enact retribution.",
    "Thus, the logical and immediate action police would likely begin after a killing is an \"investigation\" to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and determine the circumstances of the killing."
