  "query": "Question: Where must you go for a blood transfusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: gurney\nB: person\nC: hospital\nD: artery\nE: vein",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what a blood transfusion is. A blood transfusion is a medical procedure that involves transferring blood or blood products into a person's circulation through an intravenous (IV) line.",
    "Since a blood transfusion is a medical procedure, it is typically conducted in a clinical or hospital setting rather than at home or in non-medical environments.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the options provided. Choice A, \"gurney,\" refers to a wheeled stretcher used for transporting patients and is not a place where a transfusion occurs.",
    "Choice B, \"person,\" does not represent a location for a blood transfusion; rather, it indicates who might receive the transfusion and is therefore irrelevant.",
    "Choice C, \"hospital,\" is a place where medical procedures, including blood transfusions, are performed by healthcare professionals in a controlled environment, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Choice D, \"artery,\" refers to a blood vessel and is not a location where a transfusion is administered; it's part of the circulatory system.",
    "Choice E, \"vein,\" is similar to \"artery\" in that it\u2019s part of the anatomy where blood is drawn for transfusions, but not a place where the transfusion occurs in a broader sense.",
    "So far, it appears that option C, \"hospital,\" is the most appropriate and logical choice, as it is the clear and correct setting for undergoing a blood transfusion procedure.",
    "Lastly, considering all the reasoning above, the answer is confirmed to be the hospital as the correct location for a blood transfusion."
