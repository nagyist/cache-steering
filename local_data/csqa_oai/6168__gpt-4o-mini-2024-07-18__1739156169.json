  "query": "Question: Jon put drops in his eyes so that they wouldn't do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fill with tears\nB: glass over\nC: see work\nD: dry out\nE: fall out",
  "steps": [
    "Jon put drops in his eyes, which typically indicates a need to address a condition related to eye moisture or comfort.",
    "One common reason for using eye drops is to prevent dryness in the eyes, which can cause discomfort.",
    "The phrase \"wouldn't do what\" implies that Jon is trying to prevent an undesirable outcome.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"dry out\" directly relates to the symptom that eye drops usually help alleviate.",
    "Choices such as \"fill with tears\" and \"fall out\" are not typically prevented by eye drops; instead, they suggest entirely different issues.",
    "While \"glass over\" and \"see work\" might relate to vision clarity, they do not align as closely with the typical purpose of eye drops.",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer is that Jon is using the drops to prevent his eyes from drying out."
