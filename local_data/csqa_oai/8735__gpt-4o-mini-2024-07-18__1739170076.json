  "query": "Question: He explained that the concept was corporeal and the student should be able to grasp it, but the student found the ideas what?\n\nChoices:\nA: intangible\nB: intangible\nC: spiritual\nD: insubstantial\nE: incorporeal",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"corporeal\" refers to something that has a physical presence or is tangible.",
    "If the student should be able to grasp the corporeal concept, it implies that the ideas should be understandable and within the realm of physical realities.",
    "However, since the student found the ideas to be something else, we need to identify the opposite or a contrasting term to \"corporeal.\"",
    "The first option \"A: intangible\" means not able to be touched or grasped, which directly contrasts with corporeal.",
    "The second option \"B: intangible\" is the same as the first option and also means not able to be touched or grasped.",
    "The third option \"C: spiritual\" suggests a connection to the non-physical or ethereal, contrasting with the physical nature of corporeal.",
    "The fourth option \"D: insubstantial\" means lacking substance or reality, which again aligns with the idea of something not being corporeal.",
    "The final option \"E: incorporeal\" directly translates to something without a material body or substance, opposing corporeal in a very direct manner.",
    "Thus, we can conclude that the student found the ideas to be contrasting with corporeal in a tangible way, likely \"intangible\" or \"incorporeal.\"",
    "Since \"intangible\" is repeated in options A and B, and both mean the lack of physical presence, that would lead us to conclude that it is the best fit."
