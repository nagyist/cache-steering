  "query": "Question: What are dark clouds likely to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: cloud vision\nB: weather\nC: awe inspiring\nD: bring rain\nE: rain water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that dark clouds are often associated with weather conditions. This leads me to conclude that they may have a significant impact on the weather.",
    "Next, I consider the physical characteristics of dark clouds. They appear dense and heavy, which suggests that they might be capable of holding moisture.",
    "Since dark clouds are usually seen when it is about to rain, I ponder the common outcome when dark clouds form in the sky.",
    "I recall meteorological knowledge that indicates dark clouds typically signify impending precipitation, particularly rain.",
    "Looking at the options provided, I notice that some choices, like \"cloud vision\" and \"awe inspiring,\" do not relate pragmatically to what dark clouds typically do.",
    "I also see that \"weather\" is too vague and doesn't specifically indicate a concrete action or result of dark clouds.",
    "Between the last two options, \"bring rain\" and \"rain water,\" I consider the nuances of each phrase.",
    "\"Bring rain\" suggests that the clouds are actively causing the event (rain), while \"rain water\" merely describes the product of rain.",
    "Thus, out of the available options, the phrasing \"bring rain\" aligns most closely with the typical behavior of dark clouds.",
    "Finally, I validate my reasoning by affirming that dark clouds do indeed precede rain, confirming that they are likely to bring rain."
