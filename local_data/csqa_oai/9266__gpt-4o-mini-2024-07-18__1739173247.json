  "query": "Question: What is a light source that does not require electricity?\n\nChoices:\nA: hallway\nB: light switch\nC: candle\nD: lamp\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a light source that operates without electricity.",
    "Options need to be evaluated based on whether they require electricity to provide light.",
    "Option A: hallway - this is a space and does not generate light on its own.",
    "Option B: light switch - this is a mechanism to control electricity and does not produce light.",
    "Option C: candle - this is a physical object that produces light through combustion and does not require electricity.",
    "Option D: lamp - typically, a lamp requires electricity to function, so it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Option E: house - similar to hallway, a house is a structure and does not emit light itself.",
    "Based on the evaluation, only option C (candle) qualifies as a light source that does not require electricity."
