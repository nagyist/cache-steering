  "query": "Question: Where does a lizard likely live?\n\nChoices:\nA: alaska\nB: garden\nC: new mexico\nD: rocks\nE: dessert",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the habitat preferences of lizards. Lizards generally thrive in warm climates and environments that provide ample sunlight.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll evaluate the choices for environments that are warm and suitable for lizards. Alaska, for instance, is a cold region and is unlikely to support lizard populations.",
    "Garden environments can host lizards, as they often have vegetation and sun, but they might not be the preferred habitat for many species that are found naturally in larger, less disturbed areas.",
    "New Mexico is known for its warm climate and diverse ecosystems, including deserts and grasslands, which are suitable for many lizard species.",
    "Rocks can also serve as habitats for lizards, offering shelter and opportunities for basking in the sun, but they are not exclusive to lizards and can be found in various environments.",
    "Deserts provide the right conditions for many lizard species, especially those adapted to arid environments. However, \"dessert\" is a misspelling and should be dismissed.",
    "Now, comparing the environments of New Mexico, gardens, rocks, and deserts: New Mexico is a region that includes both desert and garden-like areas, making it more representative of where lizards live.",
    "While gardens and rocks can host lizards, they are not geographic locations like New Mexico that fundamentally support larger populations.",
    "Since New Mexico combines favorable climatic conditions and diverse habitats, it is a strong candidate.",
    "Given these considerations, the most likely answer for where lizards thrive is New Mexico."
