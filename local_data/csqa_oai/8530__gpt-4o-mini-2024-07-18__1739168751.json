  "query": "Question: Johnny build a house somewhere on the planet.  He wanted to do so away from the city, but still close enough.

Where might he have built it?\n\nChoices:\nA: suburbs\nB: in the pond\nC: residential area\nD: newspaper\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Johnny wanted to build a house away from the city but ultimately settled for building it inside the city limits. This implies that the location he chose must be within the urban area.",
    "The choices provided include options that either directly pertain to urban living or are unrelated.",
    "Option A mentions \"suburbs,\" which is typically an area just outside urban city limits. This would not align with Johnny's decision to build \"inside\" the city limits.",
    "Option B states \"in the pond,\" which is physically impractical for building a house.",
    "Option C refers to a \"residential area,\" which is a part of the city designed for housing and is likely where Johnny would build a home.",
    "Option D, \"newspaper,\" is unrelated to the context of building a house.",
    "Option E, \"surface of earth,\" is too vague and does not specifically indicate a location \"inside the city limits.\"",
    "After evaluating the choices, option C (\u201cresidential area\u201d) is the most logical conclusion given the context of building inside the city limits."
