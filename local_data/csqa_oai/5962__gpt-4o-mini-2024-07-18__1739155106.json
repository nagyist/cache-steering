  "query": "Question: A king or queen is a member of what class?\n\nChoices:\nA: beehive\nB: ocean\nC: deck of cards\nD: monarchy\nE: wife of king",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the class that a king or queen belongs to.",
    "A king or queen is typically associated with a system of governance or hierarchical society.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, we need to determine which one directly relates to kings and queens.",
    "Choice A, \"beehive,\" refers to a structure of bees and does not relate to human societal structures.",
    "Choice B, \"ocean,\" describes a vast body of water, which again is unrelated to the concepts of royalty or governance.",
    "Choice C, \"deck of cards,\" refers to a set of playing cards, and while it may metaphorically have kings and queens, it does not represent a societal class.",
    "Choice D, \"monarchy,\" refers specifically to a form of government where a single ruler (king or queen) is in charge, making it directly related to the topic.",
    "Choice E, \"wife of king,\" while it indirectly relates to a queen, is not a class in itself but rather a specific role.",
    "Based on the analysis, the choice that corresponds directly to the class of a king or queen is \"monarchy.\""
