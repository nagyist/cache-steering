  "steps": [
    "Utensils are typically associated with food and eating.",
    "The context of \"evening activity\" suggests a time when meals are commonly eaten, which is usually dinner.",
    "Looking at the choices, options A (backpack), B (closet), C (drawer), and E (cupboard) do not relate directly to an evening meal.",
    "The option D (dinner) directly connects to the use of utensils, as they are essential for eating during dinner.",
    "Therefore, the only logical choice that aligns with both utensils and the evening activity of eating is dinner."
