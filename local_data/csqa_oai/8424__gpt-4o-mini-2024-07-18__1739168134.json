  "query": "Question: Where did a shop get the sand dollars you can buy?\n\nChoices:\nA: high school\nB: container\nC: atm\nD: ocean floor\nE: downtown area",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the potential sources for sand dollars. Sand dollars are marine animals found in ocean environments, specifically on the ocean floor.",
    "Next, I will consider the choices given. The most logical origin of sand dollars is their natural habitat, which is the ocean floor (D).",
    "I will eliminate the other choices: \n- A (high school) does not correlate with the natural environment of sand dollars. \n- B (container) is too vague and does not provide a specific relevant context.\n- C (atm) is unrelated to natural resources and suggests a mechanical or financial context, which does not apply here.\n- E (downtown area) is likely a commercial area, but it does not indicate the natural source of sand dollars.",
    "Having considered all options, I determine that option D is the only response that accurately reflects the source where shops would obtain sand dollars for sale."
