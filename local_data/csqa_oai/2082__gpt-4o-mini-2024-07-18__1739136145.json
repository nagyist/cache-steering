  "query": "Question: Joe was a weasel, but he wasn't the sort who you kept was a pet.  He was the sort that used complex words that carried multiple different meanings.  Where might you find Joe\n\nChoices:\nA: chicken coop\nB: law firm\nC: classroom\nD: terrarium\nE: museum",
  "steps": [
    "The description of Joe as a \"weasel\" suggests he might be slippery or elusive, often found in contexts where manipulation or deception is more common.",
    "The phrase \"used complex words that carried multiple different meanings\" indicates that Joe might operate in an intellectual or academic environment where such language is valued or commonplace.",
    "Considering the choices, a \"law firm\" (B) is often associated with complex language, such as legal jargon, which fits with the description of Joe using complex words.",
    "A \"classroom\" (C) can also involve complex language, particularly in higher education contexts, where students might learn about nuanced subjects.",
    "While a \"museum\" (E) can present complex ideas, it is less about verbal complexity and more about visual presentation and artifacts, making it a weaker fit.",
    "A \"chicken coop\" (A) and a \"terrarium\" (D) do not align with the quality of language described or the intellectual context suggested by Joe's characteristics.",
    "Between the law firm (B) and classroom (C), both contexts enable the use of complex words, but law firms specifically revolve around the legal profession, which often involves manipulation of language.",
    "Since \"weasels\" are often metaphorically associated with lawyers due to the nature of legal maneuvering, a law firm has a more direct implication regarding Joe's behavior.",
    "Thus, while Joe could reasonably be found in a classroom, the connotation of being a \"weasel\" most closely aligns him with the environment of a law firm."
