  "query": "Question: Janet knew she was dying from her injuries because she could feel herself doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sleeping longer\nB: getting cold\nC: death and decay\nD: change of color\nE: stop breathing",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what sensations or physical changes a person might experience when they are dying.",
    "Generally, as one nears death, certain physiological processes occur, such as changes in body temperature and circulation.",
    "One common sensation is the feeling of getting cold, as the body's circulation begins to fail and blood flow is reduced to extremities.",
    "Another sensation could relate to breathing changes, often referenced as the 'gasping' or final breathing patterns that occur when approaching death.",
    "There are also subjective perceptions of decay or the body deteriorating, but these are less common as conscious observations.",
    "Among the choices given, feeling cold (B) and feeling a cessation of breath (E) are both sensations that are immediate and directly felt by someone nearing death.",
    "Option C refers to a more abstract feeling of death, while option D involves a change in color which is typically not a conscious sensory experience.",
    "I note that E (stop breathing) can often be closely associated with imminent death and can be clearly felt; however, it might not be a feeling Janet would consciously recognize immediately.",
    "I conclude that B (getting cold) is a direct physical sensation and is often reported by those who are dying or have experienced near-death situations."
