  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what is meant by \"changing society.\" This can involve shifts in culture, technology, politics, or social structures.",
    "Next, we should consider what kinds of changes can occur in society. Positive changes may lead to improvements in various aspects of life, while negative changes can result in confusion or distress among citizens.",
    "Now, let's evaluate choice A: confusion and chaos. While societal changes can indeed lead to these feelings among some people, it does not encompass all potential outcomes of change.",
    "Evaluating choice B: depression. Similar to choice A, while some individuals may experience depression due to societal changes, it doesn't represent a broader outcome of changing society as a whole.",
    "Let\u2019s analyze choice C: better standard of living. This option reflects a positive potential outcome of societal change, particularly if the change leads to economic growth, improved public services, or technological advancements.",
    "Next, let's consider choice D: sometimes bad. While societal changes can lead to negative outcomes, this option is vague and does not specify a strong outcome.",
    "Finally, we look at choice E: anger and depression will not change the society. This option suggests that negative emotions don't affect the larger structure of society, which seems more of a statement than a potential outcome.",
    "Comparing all the evaluated options, choice C stands out as a clear and positive potential outcome of changing society, unlike the other choices."
