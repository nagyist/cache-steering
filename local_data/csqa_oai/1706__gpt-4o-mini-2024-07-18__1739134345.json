  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the consequence of having many drinks during a celebration.",
    "When people drink alcohol, one of the most common and direct effects is becoming intoxicated.",
    "Among the choices, \"getting drunk\" explicitly states the consequence of having many drinks.",
    "Although choices like \"drink too much\" is similar, it does not directly convey a consequence; rather, it describes the action itself.",
    "The other choices (A, C, and E) do not consistently relate to the direct outcome of drinking; they involve other activities.",
    "Since the question focuses on the result of drinking rather than other activities connected to it, the most straightforward and appropriate answer is \"getting drunk.\"",
    "This reasoning confirms that the main effect of excessive drinking relates to intoxication."
