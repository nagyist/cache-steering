  "query": "Question: The stud bull was brought in to breed with the prize winning what?\n\nChoices:\nA: horse\nB: cow\nC: bullbleep\nD: feeble\nE: female",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a \"stud bull,\" which is a male animal specifically used for breeding purposes.",
    "The term \"stud\" typically applies to animals like horses and cattle when discussing breeding.",
    "A \"prize winning\" refers to an animal that has won competitions or is of superior quality, often found in livestock or equine contexts.",
    "Since we are talking about a bull, it is logical to assume the breeding partner would be a female of the same species for the purpose of producing offspring.",
    "Among the choices, the only one that specifies a female animal (which could be the appropriate breeding partner for a bull) is \"cow.\"",
    "The word \"cow\" specifically refers to a female bovine, which aligns with typical breeding scenarios involving bulls.",
    "The other options like \"horse,\" \"bullbleep,\" \"feeble,\" and \"female\" are either irrelevant or too vague.",
    "\"Horse\" is not relevant as the context is specific to bovine breeding, and terms like \"bullbleep\" and \"feeble\" do not make sense in this context.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer to the question is a prize-winning cow, as bulls breed with cows."
