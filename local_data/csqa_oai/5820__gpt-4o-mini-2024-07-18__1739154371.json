    "The science major is likely to have a strong interest in subjects related to the earth and its physical characteristics.",
    "Digging in the earth suggests an interest in geology or earth sciences, which typically falls under geography.",
    "The favorite class of a science major that involves digging and studying the earth is most likely linked to understanding landscapes, natural resources, or environmental aspects.",
    "Among the given choices, geography directly correlates to the study of the earth's features, making it the most relevant option.",
    "The other choices (religion, faith, health, history studies) do not pertain to the physical study of the earth or the practice of digging.",
    "Therefore, since geography is the discipline that best matches the description of digging in the earth, it is the most logical choice."
