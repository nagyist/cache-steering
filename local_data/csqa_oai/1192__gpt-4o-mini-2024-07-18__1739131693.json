  "query": "Question: The plant suffered in the shade, where did it need to be planted instead?\n\nChoices:\nA: brightness\nB: sunny delight\nC: direct sunlight\nD: bright light\nE: tanning",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the plant suffered in the shade, suggesting it requires more light to thrive.",
    "We need to consider the choices given and determine which one best meets the plant's light requirements.",
    "Choice A, \"brightness,\" is somewhat vague and does not specify the intensity of light needed.",
    "Choice B, \"sunny delight,\" sounds positive but is also vague and doesn\u2019t specify how much sunlight is required.",
    "Choice C, \"direct sunlight,\" indicates strong, unfiltered sun exposure, which is often ideal for plants that suffer in shade.",
    "Choice D, \"bright light,\" is somewhat clear but still does not indicate the intensity as clearly as \"direct sunlight.\"",
    "Choice E, \"tanning,\" metaphorically implies sun exposure but does not directly apply to plants.",
    "Considering all options, \"direct sunlight\" (Choice C) clearly conveys the idea of the most beneficial light exposure for the plant, addressing its suffering in shade."
