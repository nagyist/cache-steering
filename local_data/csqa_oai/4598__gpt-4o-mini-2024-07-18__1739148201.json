  "steps": [
    "Identify the objective: The goal is to make new friends while socializing at a party.",
    "Consider the nature of socializing: It involves interaction with others and building connections.",
    "Evaluate the options provided: \n- A (find friends): This implies you are looking for people you already know, not necessarily making new connections.\n- B (sing): This could be entertaining but doesn\u2019t directly address making new friendships.\n- C (mix): This suggests interacting with various people, which is essential to meeting new friends.\n- D (with people): This is vague and doesn't specify a proactive action to make friendships.\n- E (see people): This is also passive and does not imply engaging in meaningful conversation or connection.",
    "Focus on the active engagement aspect: To make new friends, one must actively interact with people rather than just seeing or singing.",
    "Conclude that \"mix\" aligns best with the goal of making new friends, as it suggests mingling and engaging with different individuals at the party."
