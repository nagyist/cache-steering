  "steps": [
    "The question mentions John believing that the distance between him and Sally was insurmountable, suggesting an emotional or psychological barrier rather than a physical one.",
    "When John opened up to Sally, the context implies that their conversation led to a revelation or understanding between them.",
    "The word \u201cshared\u201d indicates that they discovered something in common, which can often lead to a feeling of connection or bond.",
    "Looking at the options: \nA (near) refers to physical placement, B (proximity) also refers to physical closeness, C (closeness) represents a bond or emotional connection, D (close) is an adjective describing being near, and E (duration) pertains to time spent together.",
    "Given the context of opening up and sharing something, emotional connections are typically described as \u201ccloseness.\u201d",
    "Both proximity and being near are physical descriptors, which seems less relevant in this context since the emphasis is on emotional connection.",
    "Therefore, \"closeness\" is the best interpretation of what they found they shared, because it captures the essence of an emotional bond rather than a physical one.",
    "Since C (closeness) encapsulates the idea of shared feelings and understanding that transcends mere physical distance, it is the final choice."
