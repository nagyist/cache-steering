  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that \"he wasn't able to enjoy the party,\" indicating that it was an environment where he was expected to have fun but was instead preoccupied.",
    "Next, it mentions he was \"worried about his things and cleaning up,\" which suggests a domestic or personal setting rather than a larger social event.",
    "A party at home or a friend's house would require someone to clean up afterward, especially if personal belongings were involved. This aligns well with \"his things.\"",
    "Looking at the first choice, \"home,\" this often implies a setting where one might have personal concerns and the responsibility to clean up afterward.",
    "The second choice, \"fraternity house,\" suggests a more chaotic environment where cleaning up might not be an individual's responsibility, making it less likely he would be personally concerned about cleaning.",
    "The third choice, \"boat,\" is an unusual location for cleaning in a traditional sense and doesn't fit the personal belongings context well, as boats usually involve transient items rather than personal possessions.",
    "The fourth choice, \"friend's house,\" could also imply similar obligations to clean up, but it might not be as likely for someone to be anxious about their own belongings if they were at a friend's house.",
    "The fifth choice, \"blowing off steam,\" is not a physical location where one would have a party; rather, it describes a state of mind or activity.",
    "Considering the options again, \u201chome\u201d appears to be the most fitting answer given the context of personal belongings and cleaning up, leading to the conclusion that the party was most likely at his home."
