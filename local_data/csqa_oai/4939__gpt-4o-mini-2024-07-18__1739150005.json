  "query": "Question: Where are small city halls usually located?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera singers\nB: detroit\nC: court\nD: towns\nE: downtown area",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a \"small city hall\" is typically associated with. It is often a local government building that serves a town or community.",
    "Next, think about the general purpose of a city hall. It usually serves as the administrative center for local governance and public services.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices provided. The options include \"opera singers,\" \"detroit,\" \"court,\" \"towns,\" and \"downtown area.\"",
    "Analyze \"opera singers.\" This option is unrelated to the concept of a city hall, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Next, consider \"detroit.\" While city halls can be located in Detroit, it refers to a specific city rather than the general location of small city halls.",
    "The option \"court\" generally refers to a place of legal proceedings and is not where city halls are primarily located.",
    "Now evaluate \"towns.\" Small city halls are indeed located in towns since they serve the local governments of these areas.",
    "Lastly, now look at \"downtown area.\" While many city halls can be found in a downtown setting, the term is more broad and doesn't specifically convey the nature of small city halls.",
    "Given that small city halls serve towns specifically, and considering the elimination of other options and the contextual criteria of the question, the best answer is \"towns.\""
