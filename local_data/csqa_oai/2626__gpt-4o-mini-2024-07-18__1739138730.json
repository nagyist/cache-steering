  "query": "Question: It was a popular and common gift this year, so he headed to the what where it would be easy to find?\n\nChoices:\nA: christmas tree\nB: christmas stocking\nC: specialty store\nD: department store\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a popular and common gift is being sought after, suggesting it is something that can be widely found.",
    "The term \"headed to the what\" implies that he is looking for a place that specializes in gifts or has a large selection of them.",
    "A \"specialty store\" (Choice C) typically focuses on specific types of products and might not necessarily have a large variety of common gifts.",
    "A \"department store\" (Choice D), on the other hand, usually has multiple sections with a broad range of products, including popular gifts for the holidays.",
    "The options \"christmas tree\" (Choice A) and \"christmas stocking\" (Choice B) refer to holiday decorations and are not places where one would buy gifts.",
    "The \"closet\" (Choice E) is a storage area and does not relate to purchasing gifts at all.",
    "Comparing \"department store\" and \"specialty store,\" a department store is more likely to carry a variety of popular gifts, making it a more suitable choice.",
    "Considering the reasoning provided, he would more easily find a common gift at a department store."
