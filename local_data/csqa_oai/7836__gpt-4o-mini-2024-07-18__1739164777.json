  "query": "Question: The revolving door had an emergency security lock because of all the money where?\n\nChoices:\nA: jewelry store\nB: mall\nC: bank\nD: hotel lobby\nE: public place",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a revolving door with an emergency security lock, which implies a location that handles large amounts of money or valuable items.",
    "Choice A, jewelry store, is a possibility since jewelry is valuable and often requires security. However, a revolving door is not commonly associated with such stores.",
    "Choice B, mall, typically has numerous stores and isn't specifically focused on money or valuables in a single location, making it less likely.",
    "Choice C, bank, fits well since banks deal directly with large sums of money and would require high security, including revolving doors that may have emergency features.",
    "Choice D, hotel lobby, is not primarily focused on money transactions and wouldn't require a revolving door for security related to cash.",
    "Choice E, public place, is too vague since it does not specify a type of location dealing with money or valuables.",
    "Based on these considerations, a bank stands out as the best fit for having a revolving door with an emergency security lock due to the security needs associated with handling money."
