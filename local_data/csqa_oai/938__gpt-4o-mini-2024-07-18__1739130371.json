  "query": "Question: Where would you put silverware once they've dried, but you're not ready to use them.\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: restaurant\nC: cupboard\nD: kitchen\nE: sink",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to put silverware after they have dried but before they are needed for use.",
    "The place should be a storage area, as the silverware should be safely stored until required.",
    "Option A (table) is not suitable since it implies a temporary spot where silverware could be used soon, not stored.",
    "Option B (restaurant) does not apply because it is not a specific location for personal storage; it refers to a place where food is served.",
    "Option D (kitchen) is a general area that contains spaces for utensils but isn't necessarily a dedicated storage location.",
    "Option E (sink) is not a suitable place to store silverware as it is typically used for washing or rinsing items.",
    "Option C (cupboard) is frequently used for storage in homes, especially for items like dishes and silverware.",
    "Since the question specifies a place to store silverware until they are ready to be used, a cupboard is the most logical choice.",
    "Reviewing all options, cupboard (C) is indeed the best option as it serves the purpose of safe and appropriate storage."
