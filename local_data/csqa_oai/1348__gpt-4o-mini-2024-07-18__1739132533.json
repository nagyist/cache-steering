  "steps": [
    "The question asks where someone will go for killing, which implies a legal consequence for committing murder or homicide.",
    "The first logical step is to consider what happens immediately after a person is accused of killing someone. Typically, this leads to an investigation.",
    "However, being investigated does not indicate a definitive location or final consequence; it is more of a process than a destination.",
    "Next, if the individual is formally charged, they will go through a court process where a trial will determine their guilt or innocence.",
    "If they are found guilty in court, the justice system primarily imposes a sentence, which often includes imprisonment.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"court\" (B) represents the legal process after the investigation, but does not imply a definitive consequence.",
    "\"Going to jail\" (C) represents the consequence that a person faces after being convicted and is a place of confinement.",
    "\"Dies\" (D) and \"death of\" (E) imply that the person who committed the killing will die, which is an unlikely legal outcome for someone who is simply being accused or convicted.",
    "Since the question specifically asks where someone will go following a killing, \"going to jail\" (C) is the most fitting answer, as it directly refers to the consequence of imprisonment resulting from a conviction.",
    "Thus, considering the process from killing to investigation, then court, and finally the likely outcome of jail, the answer is clearly related to imprisonment rather than the processes or the implications of death."
