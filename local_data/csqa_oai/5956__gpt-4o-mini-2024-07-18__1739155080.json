  "steps": [
    "To understand what happens when something is going to die, we first need to consider the typical signs of impending death in living organisms.",
    "Often, a living creature in the process of dying will first exhibit signs of sickness or poor health, which can manifest in various ways. Thus, option A (being sick) is a likely early sign.",
    "However, death is a process that involves a series of functions stopping in a relatively defined order. One of the first physiological functions to reel back due to a life-threatening condition is respiration.",
    "Option C (stop breathing) is a critical function that often indicates an imminent or ongoing biological failure leading towards death. Breathing is essential to sustain life, and its cessation is a direct precursor to death.",
    "We should also consider option D (stop moving), which might occur as a sign of weakness or failing health. However, an organism may stop moving even while still breathing.",
    "Next, option B (stop living) is a consequence of death and not a precursor. It happens only after all vital signs cease. Therefore, it isn't the first thing that happens.",
    "Lastly, option E (go to heaven) is a metaphysical concept and does not align with observable biological processes. This can be disregarded in a scientific context assessing pre-death signs.",
    "Thus, after weighing the options, it seems that being sick (option A) could happen first, or stopping breathing (option C). However, stopping breathing (option C) is a more definitive physiological sign associated with imminent death."
