  "query": "Question: What may your feet experience if you're standing in line for hours?\n\nChoices:\nA: pain\nB: frustration\nC: anger\nD: lime scale\nE: order",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the physical effects of standing for long periods. Standing in line for hours can lead to discomfort in the lower extremities, particularly in the feet.",
    "Next, think about the typical sensations associated with prolonged standing. Pain is a common experience that affects the feet, including conditions like sore arches or blisters.",
    "Now, analyze the other options provided: frustration and anger are emotions that may arise from the situation but are not directly caused by the physical act of standing.",
    "Lime scale does not relate to standing in line and is irrelevant in this context. Order is also irrelevant, as it does not pertain to a physical sensation or experience.",
    "Finally, confirm that the only option that specifically addresses the physical experience of standing in line is pain, as it directly affects the feet."
