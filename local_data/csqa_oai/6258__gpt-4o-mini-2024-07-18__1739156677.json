  "query": "Question: What does a human wear when surfing?\n\nChoices:\nA: wet suit\nB: moving car\nC: school\nD: feet\nE: healthy relationship",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what a human typically wears while surfing.",
    "Research indicates that surfers often wear specific clothing to provide warmth and protection in water.",
    "One common item worn while surfing is a wetsuit, which keeps the body warm in colder waters and protects against abrasions.",
    "The other options provided need to be analyzed to see if they fit the criteria of clothing worn while surfing.",
    "A moving car is obviously not something a human would wear; it's a mode of transportation.",
    "A school is an educational institution and has no relevance to surfing attire.",
    "Feet are body parts and not something one wears; while surfers may go barefoot, this does not fit the intention of the question.",
    "A healthy relationship also clearly does not relate to clothing and is not something worn.",
    "Thus, the only option that corresponds to the attire worn while surfing is a wetsuit."
