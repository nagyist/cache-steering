  "query": "Question: Where are a lot of offices in New York?\n\nChoices:\nA: school building\nB: skyscraper\nC: business\nD: grocery store.\nE: work",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a lot of offices are located in New York, I should consider the types of buildings that typically have office spaces.",
    "New York City is known for its tall buildings and dense urban environment, which suggests that offices are often found in buildings that can accommodate many businesses, such as skyscrapers.",
    "While schools can have administrative offices, they are not primarily designed for business offices.",
    "The grocery store option is also not typically associated with office space, as these are retail establishments focused on selling food and goods rather than providing business space.",
    "The term \"business\" could refer to various types of organizations, but it does not specify a physical location where offices are housed.",
    "\"Work\" is a more abstract term and does not indicate a specific physical location for offices.",
    "Considering the most common answer related to physical structures specifically associated with offices in New York, \"skyscraper\" stands out since many corporate offices are located there.",
    "Therefore, the best choice that represents a location where many offices are found in New York City would be \"skyscraper.\""
