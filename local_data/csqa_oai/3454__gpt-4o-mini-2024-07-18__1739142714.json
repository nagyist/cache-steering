    "The question asks about what typically follows after verbally agreeing to a deal with someone.",
    "In general, the act of verbally agreeing signifies mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms discussed.",
    "After a verbal agreement, it is common for parties to express their agreement in a physical manner as well.",
    "One common physical response to a verbal agreement is to shake hands, as it is a traditional gesture of sealing a deal.",

    "The term \"concordance\" refers to a state of agreement but is less commonly used in everyday transactions compared to physical gestures.",
