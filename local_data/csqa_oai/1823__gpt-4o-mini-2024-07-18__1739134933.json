  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the situation described: paramedics are attempting to rescue someone who is potentially aggressive and trying to hit them.",
    "The question is specifically asking about what the paramedics would need to do with their hands in this scenario.",
    "Given that the individual is trying to hit the paramedics, they must protect themselves and ensure their safety while also providing care.",
    "\"Bind\" (Choice A) could imply that they would secure the individual, but it doesn\u2019t directly relate to what they need to do with their hands regarding self-defense.",
    "\"Abandon\" (Choice B) suggests that they would leave the person, which is not typically aligned with a paramedic's duty to assist.",
    "\"Hurt\" (Choice C) implies that the paramedics would cause harm, which goes against their primary goal of helping others.",
    "\"Kidnap\" (Choice D) suggests an illegal act of taking someone against their will, which is outside the scope of paramedic duties.",
    "\"Endanger\" (Choice E) also doesn\u2019t provide a clear action related to their hands; it simply states that the situation itself is dangerous.",
    "After considering all the choices and the goal of the paramedics, the most logical action in the face of a physical threat would be to either defend themselves or restrain the person, which none of the provided options fully encapsulate.",
    "However, based on the context of protecting themselves from being hit, if they need to act with their hands in self-defense, \"hurt\" would incorrectly infer that they would inflict pain, which they ideally would avoid.",
    "Since none of the choices perfectly match what paramedics would do, all selected options seem inappropriate based on core principles of paramedic work."
