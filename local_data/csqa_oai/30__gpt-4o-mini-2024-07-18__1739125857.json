  "query": "Question: I have something in my head I want to share, what ways can I do that?\n\nChoices:\nA: write an essay\nB: organize thoughts\nC: speak information\nD: summarize main points\nE: have information",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that I have thoughts or ideas in my head that I want to communicate to others.",
    "Next, I realize that there are multiple ways to share my thoughts or information with another person or an audience.",
    "I consider 'writing an essay' (Choice A) as one possible method of sharing detailed thoughts, but it's more of a structured format rather than a direct communication method.",
    "I think about 'organizing thoughts' (Choice B), which is a preparatory step but does not directly share information; it's more about clarifying my own ideas.",
    "Next, I evaluate 'speaking information' (Choice C), which directly corresponds to communicating my thoughts verbally to others.",
    "Then, I reflect on 'summarizing main points' (Choice D). While this can be a method to share information, it's also more of a concise way to present already organized information rather than a standalone method of sharing on its own.",
    "Lastly, 'having information' (Choice E) does not really describe a method of sharing; it simply states the possession of knowledge or thoughts, but does not communicate them.",
    "Based on this evaluation, the most direct and effective way to share thoughts from my head would be to 'speak information'."
