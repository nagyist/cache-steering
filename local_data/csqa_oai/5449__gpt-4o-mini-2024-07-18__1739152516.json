  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"fighting inflation,\" which indicates a potential increase in prices over time.",
    "When inflation is present, central banks often respond by increasing interest rates to slow down borrowing and spending.",
    "For a soon-to-be homeowner, higher interest rates can lead to more expensive mortgage payments.",
    "The phrase \"had to worry about\" suggests a concern for the impact of economic changes on personal financial decisions, especially purchasing a home.",
    "Lower interest is not typically a concern during inflation, as rates usually rise in that scenario.",
    "Furthermore, raising interest rates is an action taken by banks; the homeowner would be more directly affected by the consequence of these actions, which is the result of higher rates.",
    "Therefore, of the choices available, the direct impact that a soon-to-be homeowner would worry about in the context of inflation is higher interest rates.",
    "Looking at the options: A represents lower interest, B represents the action of raising interest rates, C indicates the result of higher interest rates, D concerns lowering prices, and E involves saving money.",
    "C (higher interest rates) is aligned with the concerns of a soon-to-be homeowner facing inflation."
