  "query": "Question: Where is  a state highway likely to be crowded?\n\nChoices:\nA: of states\nB: united states\nC: american state\nD: traffic\nE: california",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a state highway is. A state highway is a road that is maintained by a state government in the United States.",
    "Next, we consider where state highways are typically located. They are found within individual states, so options related to states or specific regions should be considered.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options. \n- A: \"of states\" is vague and doesn\u2019t specify anything about a location.\n- B: \"united states\" refers to the entire country and is too broad.\n- C: \"american state\" refers to specific states in the U.S. which would have highways that could potentially be crowded.\n- D: \"traffic\" is a general concept rather than a specific location.\n- E: \"california\" is a specific state known for having crowded highways.",
    "Among the options, both C (\"american state\") and E (\"california\") refer to locations where one could find a crowded highway. However, \"california\" specifically points to a well-known example.",
    "Next, we consider the known traffic patterns in California. It has some of the busiest highways in the United States, particularly in urban areas like Los Angeles.",
    "While option C applies to all states with possible crowded highways, E provides a concrete example that is widely recognized for heavy traffic.",
    "Therefore, since we are looking for where a state highway is likely to be crowded, \"california\" as a specific location stands out as the best choice."
