  "query": "Question: What is it called when you slowly cook using a grill?\n\nChoices:\nA: backyard\nB: restaurant\nC: crockpot\nD: neighbor's house\nE: barbeque",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a term associated with cooking slowly using a grill.",
    "I need to think about what cooking method applies to grilling and involves slow cooking.",
    "Usually, when grilling, the term that comes to mind is barbeque, which often involves cooking meat slowly over indirect heat.",
    "Backyard refers to a location, not a cooking method, so it doesn't fit as an answer.",
    "Restaurant is also a place where food is prepared, and not specific to the grilling method mentioned.",
    "Crockpot refers to a slow cooker, which is a method of slow cooking, but it doesn't involve a grill.",
    "Neighbor's house is not relevant to the cooking method and is ruled out as well.",
    "Barbeque, in the context of the choices given, aligns most closely with slow cooking on a grill.",
    "Since barbeque often entails techniques that involve grilling and slow cooking, it is likely the correct term.",
    "Therefore, the best answer based on the reasoning is E: barbeque."
