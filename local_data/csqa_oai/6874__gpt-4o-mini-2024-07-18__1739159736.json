  "steps": [
    "The question states that James needed the tools now, which indicates an urgency.",
    "James reflects on a past moment when he should have been more mindful about packing the tools.",
    "The phrase \"wished he had remembered to pack them\" suggests he is looking at a past time when he could have taken the action to pack them.",
    "We need to find a choice that indicates a previous moment in time that aligns with his regret about not packing the tools.",
    "Let's analyze the choices:\n- A: \"later\" implies a future point, which does not correspond to him wishing he had remembered.\n- B: \"other time\" is vague but does imply a past moment, however, it is not specific.\n- C: \"tomorrow\" also implies a future event.\n- D: \"then\" indicates a specific point in the past, which fits the context of regretting not taking an action earlier.\n- E: \"broke\" does not seem relevant to the context given.",
    "\"D\" represents a specific past time where James could have made the decision to pack the tools.",
    "Among the choices, D clearly aligns with James's reflection on a previous moment of opportunity."
