  "query": "Question: The child couldn't lift the box of lead, it was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: toxic\nB: light\nC: isolated from sulphide pbs\nD: very heavy\nE: very dense",
  "steps": [
    "The child is unable to lift the box of lead, which suggests that the box is heavy.",
    "Lead is known for its density and heaviness compared to many other materials, which contributes to the difficulty in lifting it.",
    "Choice A (toxic) is related to health hazards, but it doesn't explain the inability to lift the box.",
    "Choice B (light) contradicts the premise that the child couldn't lift the box.",
    "Choice C (isolated from sulphide pbs) is irrelevant to the context of lifting; it refers to a specific chemical state rather than weight.",
    "Choice D (very heavy) aligns well with the inability to lift, reinforcing the idea that the box's weight is the primary reason for the child's struggle.",
    "Choice E (very dense) is true for lead, but it doesn't directly explain the lifting issue as clearly as \"very heavy\" does.",
    "Considering the context, \"heavy\" is the most straightforward explanation for the child's inability to lift the box."
