  "steps": [
    "The question asks what dogs, having four legs, can do. We should consider the common abilities associated with dogs.",
    "Dogs are well-known for their physical capabilities, especially their ability to run quickly due to their four-legged structure.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"run fast\" seems to be a direct physical advantage of having four legs.",
    "The option \"attack\" (A) can be considered, but it is not a universal action that applies only because dogs have four legs; it depends on the situation.",
    "The option \"fleas\" (C) does not relate to an action dogs can perform; rather, it refers to a condition or parasite they might have.",
    "The option \"defend\" (D) also relates to behavior and situational contexts rather than a straightforward action enabled by the four-legged structure.",
    "The option \"eat\" (E) is again not directly related to their four-legged capacity; all dogs can eat regardless of their physical structure.",
    "Evaluating all options, the ability that most directly corresponds to a characteristic associated with dogs having four legs is the ability to run fast (B).",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the best answer is the one that describes a fundamental action made possible by having four legs."
