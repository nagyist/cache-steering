  "query": "Question: What is the goal of working hard to achieve something?\n\nChoices:\nA: concentration\nB: complain\nC: pay attention\nD: focus\nE: accomplishment",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the primary objective of working hard. Typically, people put in effort to reach a specific target or outcome.",
    "Next, I consider the definitions of the answer choices to relate them to the goal of hard work. The words \"concentration,\" \"complain,\" \"pay attention,\" \"focus,\" and \"accomplishment\" each have different meanings.",
    "\"Concentration\" (A) implies directing one's mental effort towards something but does not inherently represent an end goal of hard work.",
    "\"Complain\" (B) indicates expressing dissatisfaction, which is contrary to the concept of working hard towards achieving something.",
    "\"Pay attention\" (C) suggests being alert or attentive, which is a process that may be involved when working hard, but it isn't the end goal.",
    "\"Focus\" (D) means to concentrate attention, which again is important for hard work but is more of a method than an ultimate goal.",
    "\"Accomplishment\" (E) refers to achieving something or reaching a goal. This aligns closely with the ultimate outcome that results from hard work.",
    "Thus, given that the goal of working hard is to achieve something significant, \"accomplishment\" seems to be the most fitting answer."
