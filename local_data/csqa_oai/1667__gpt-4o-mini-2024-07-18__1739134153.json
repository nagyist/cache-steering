  "steps": [
    "To determine where someone might get beads on a balcony, I first need to consider the context in which beads are typically associated with balconies.",
    "One significant event that involves beads and balconies is Mardi Gras, particularly in places known for celebrating this festival with parades.",
    "New Orleans is famously known for its vibrant Mardi Gras celebrations, where beads are thrown from balconies to parade-goers below.",
    "While an opera house or theater could potentially have balconies, they are not typically associated with the distribution of beads.",
    "Michigan is a geographical location and does not inherently have a cultural tradition linked to balconies and beads.",
    "A craft store may sell beads, but it does not typically provide a venue for someone to be on a balcony while distributing them.",
    "The context hints that the question is looking for a connection not just to beads but specifically to balconies in a celebratory event.",
    "Given the cultural significance of beads in relation to balconies in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, this location stands out as the most logical answer.",
    "I re-evaluate the other options to ensure they do not align more closely with the concept of beads on a balcony, and none match New Orleans in this regard.",
    "Therefore, based on the reasoning that the question implies a festive context, I can conclude that New Orleans is the best answer."
