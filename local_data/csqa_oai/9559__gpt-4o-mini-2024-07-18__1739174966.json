  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the common function of ice. It's important to consider the typical uses of ice in various contexts.",
    "Let's examine the choices provided. Option A suggests that ice cools water. Ice can cool water when added, but its primary use is not usually for cooling water itself.",
    "Option B states that ice cools drinks. This is a very common use of ice, particularly in beverages where it is added to make the drink colder and more refreshing.",
    "Option C claims that ice harms humans. While ice can potentially cause harm (for example, in accidents or frostbite), it is not a primary function of ice.",
    "Option D indicates that ice can become water. While this is true when ice melts, it is more of a property of ice rather than a function. It doesn\u2019t serve a purpose in the same way that cooling does.",
    "Option E involves the formation of crystals. Ice, when formed, has a crystalline structure, but this is a characteristic rather than a function.",
    "Given the analysis, the option that best represents the primary and common function of ice is B (cooling drinks). Other options either describe properties, characteristics, or functions that are not as common as cooling beverages."
