  "query": "Question: Sean wanted to go to the Met, so he took a subway stop in what city?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york city\nB: toronto\nC: large city\nD: large city\nE: metropolis",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that Sean wanted to go to the \"Met,\" which is commonly shorthand for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This museum is located in New York City.",
    "The next step is to evaluate the choices provided. The first choice is \"new york city,\" which directly correlates with the location of the Met.",
    "The remaining options are \"toronto,\" \"large city,\" and \"metropolis.\" Although \"metropolis\" may imply a large city, it is too vague and does not specify a location.",
    "Additionally, Toronto does not have a notable museum called the Met. Therefore, it is unlikely that Sean would be taking the subway there for that purpose.",
    "Next, considering the specificity of the acronym \"Met,\" which is closely associated with New York City, we can conclude that this is not an ambiguous reference and is clear in its origin.",
    "The other options being generic ('large city' or 'metropolis') do not provide a specific answer to the question asked.",
    "Therefore, the best and most accurate answer is \"new york city\" as it is where Sean went to reach the Met."
