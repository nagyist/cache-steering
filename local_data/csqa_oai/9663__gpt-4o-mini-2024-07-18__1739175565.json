  "query": "Question: Where do you put junk mail?\n\nChoices:\nA: basket\nB: trash\nC: waste bin\nD: mail box\nE: desk",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to define what junk mail is. Junk mail typically refers to unsolicited or unwanted promotional and advertising materials that clutter our mailboxes.",
    "Next, I should consider the different options provided and how they relate to disposing of junk mail.",
    "Option A, \"basket,\" is vague and could refer to any type of basket, not specifically for mail or trash.",
    "Option D, \"mail box\" does not make sense for disposing of junk mail, as that is where mail is received, not discarded.",
    "Option E, \"desk,\" implies a location where mail may be placed temporarily, but it is not a place to properly dispose of junk mail.",
    "This leads me to consider options B and C, which are both related to disposal. \"Trash\" generally refers to garbage that is thrown away, while \"waste bin\" is a synonym for a trash can.",
    "Since \"waste bin\" is a more specific term that refers to a contained receptacle meant for waste, it fits the context of where to discard items more formally.",
    "However, the choice \"trash\" is a more common term and is often understood to mean the same thing as \"waste bin\" in daily language.",
    "I must then decide which of these synonyms is more appropriate for the question posed. Both options refer to the correct idea of disposing of junk mail.",
    "To finalize, I will select the best option, which is also the widest understood and commonly used term for disposing of junk mail."
