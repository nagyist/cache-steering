  "query": "Question: James  didn't like getting in line when he was told to be the teacher.  He wasn't someone who appreciated authority figures.  He didn't like what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being ordered\nB: less confusion\nC: getting advice\nD: longer lines\nE: standing in line",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking what James didn't like, based on the context provided.",
    "The passage specifically states that James didn't like getting in line when he was told to be the teacher, which implies he has an issue with being ordered to do something he doesn't want to do.",
    "James's dislike for authority figures further suggests that he resents being told what to do, indicating that he has a general aversion to being commanded or ordered.",
    "From the choices given, option A (\"being ordered\") aligns closely with his dislike for having to get in line, as it reflects his reaction to authority.",
    "Choice E (\"standing in line\") also relates to the situation but is more specific to the action rather than the underlying issue of authority.",
    "Comparing the two choices, option A encapsulates his broader issue with being ordered, while option E is more about the particular activity of standing in line.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer that reflects James's attitude and dislike for authority is option A."
