  "query": "Question: Where can you buy a hairbrush along with bandages?\n\nChoices:\nA: drugstore\nB: hospital\nC: bedroom\nD: car\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what items are typically sold at a drugstore. Drugstores often stock personal care items, including hairbrushes and first aid supplies like bandages.",
    "Next, let's examine where a hospital is likely to sell supplies. While hospitals provide bandages, they typically do not sell personal care items like hairbrushes to the public.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the option of a bedroom. While one may find a hairbrush there, it is not a place where you would buy either a hairbrush or bandages.",
    "Next, we'll look at the car option. A car is a mode of transport and not a retail location, so you cannot buy anything inside it.",
    "Lastly, examining a house, it could potentially contain personal care items and first aid supplies, but it is not a place to go specifically to buy items.",
    "Based on these evaluations, the most logical choice is the drugstore, as it is the only option where both items are sold."
