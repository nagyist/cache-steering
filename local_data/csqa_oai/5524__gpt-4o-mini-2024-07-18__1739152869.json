  "query": "Question: Where is a special wild rosebush found?\n\nChoices:\nA: botanic garden\nB: flower garden\nC: california\nD: courtyard\nE: landscaping",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to understand more about wild rosebushes and their habitats.",
    "Wild rosebushes can grow in various locations, but certain species are native to specific areas.",
    "The question specifically mentions a \"special\" wild rosebush, which may indicate a more rare or notable species.",
    "Researching the term \"special wild rosebush\" leads me to consider species that may be endemic or particularly known in certain regions.",
    "I recall that there are distinct species of rosebushes native to California, such as the California wild rose (Rosa californica).",
    "Other options like a \"botanic garden,\" \"flower garden,\" \"courtyard,\" and \"landscaping\" might contain rosebushes but don't denote a specific location known for certain wild species.",
    "Since California is explicitly known for its biodiversity and inclusion of certain unique native plants, this choice aligns well with the idea of a \"special\" wild rosebush.",
    "Comparing the options, it appears that California stands out as the location most associated with special wild rosebushes.",
    "Given that California is known for this type of flora, it strengthens the case that the answer might be C.",
    "I will confirm that the term \"special\" in reference to wild rosebushes links directly to specific species or locations well-known for their unique or rare plant life; California fulfills this criteria."
