  "query": "Question: James went across the street for food because his was contaminated. Where might he have gone?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: garage\nC: table\nD: military base\nE: fairgrounds",
  "steps": [
    "First, we note that James went across the street specifically to get food. This suggests he was looking for a place that serves food or could provide him with food options.",
    "The first option is a neighbor's house (A). It\u2019s possible that he went to a neighbor's house, as many people share food or meals with neighbors, especially in familiar neighborhoods.",
    "Next, we consider the second choice, garage (B). Garages typically do not serve food; they are mainly used for vehicles and storage. Therefore, this option is unlikely.",
    "The third option is table (C). While a table is where food might be served or eaten, it's not a location one goes to for food, so this is not a suitable option.",
    "The fourth option is military base (D). While it\u2019s possible for a military base to have dining facilities, it\u2019s less likely for someone like James, if he is not affiliated with the military, to go across the street to a military base for food.",
    "The fifth option is fairgrounds (E), which could have food vendors or stands. However, fairgrounds are not typically found right across the street in residential areas.",
    "Considering all the options again, the most logical choice based on typical scenarios and the context provided is that James most likely went to a neighbor's house since the others either don't serve food or are unlikely for someone casually looking for a meal nearby."
