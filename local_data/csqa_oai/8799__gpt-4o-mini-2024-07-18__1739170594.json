  "query": "Question: Sally is a customer at a restaurant.  She got a table early.  What might she have done after being seated?\n\nChoices:\nA: order dinner\nB: take number\nC: pay bills\nD: finish desert\nE: wait in line",
  "steps": [
    "First, after being seated at a restaurant, customers typically proceed to order food and drinks. This is a common practice in restaurants.",
    "Since Sally got a table early, it implies that she is likely ready to make her order soon after being seated, rather than waiting or engaging in other activities that typically follow dining.",
    "Among the given options, \"order dinner\" (option A) fits this scenario as it logically follows the action of being seated.",
    "The other options, such as \"take number\" (B), \"pay bills\" (C), \"finish dessert\" (D), and \"wait in line\" (E), do not usually follow getting seated. Taking a number applies more to fast-casual dining or when awaiting a table rather than after being seated.",
    "\"Paying bills\" (C) occurs at the end of the meal, \"finishing dessert\" (D) usually follows the main course, and \"waiting in line\" (E) would happen before being seated.",
    "Since there is a clear sequence of dining where ordering comes before paying or finishing dessert, it strengthens the argument that ordering is the next appropriate action for Sally."
