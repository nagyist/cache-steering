  "query": "Question: Where would a woman store a train ticket on her person?\n\nChoices:\nA: conductor's hand\nB: purse\nC: train depot\nD: ticket booth\nE: ticket office",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where a woman would typically store a train ticket on her person, which implies she would carry it with her rather than leaving it in an external location.",
    "The options provided include various locations, some of which are not on her person but rather places related to the train ticket or its usage.",
    "Option A, \"conductor's hand,\" implies that the conductor would hold the ticket, which does not fit since the woman would not store it there.",
    "Option C, \"train depot,\" is a location where tickets might be purchased or where trains are stationed, but it does not refer to where she would personally keep her ticket.",
    "Option D, \"ticket booth,\" again refers to a location where tickets are bought, not a place where she would store her ticket on her body.",
    "Option E, \"ticket office,\" is similar to the ticket booth, indicating another place for purchasing and handling tickets, rather than personal storage.",
    "Option B, \"purse,\" is a personal item that a woman commonly uses to store various belongings such as money, identification, and tickets. This option makes the most sense as a common place to keep a train ticket.",
    "Since all the other options do not represent a personal storage method, I can conclude that the best answer for where a woman would store a train ticket is her purse."
