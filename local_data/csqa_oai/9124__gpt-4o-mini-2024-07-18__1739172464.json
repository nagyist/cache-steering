  "steps": [
    "I need to consider what actions a person might take when they wake up but are not fully ready to be up. Typically, waking up can involve some initial signs of fatigue or drowsiness.",
    "Stretching is a common action that people do to relieve tension in their bodies after sleeping. It helps to wake up the muscles and can alleviate feelings of stiffness.",
    "Yawning is another typical response when someone is feeling drowsy or transitioning from sleep. It can signify a need to increase oxygen intake or simply be a reflex as the body wakes up.",
    "Sneezing usually indicates an irritation in the nasal passages or allergies, which is not specifically linked to the state of waking up.",
    "Having fun implies an energetic and active engagement which contrasts with the idea of not being fully ready to be up. Fun activities usually require a certain level of alertness and readiness.",
    "Coughing can signify respiratory issues or irritation, which isn't a common reaction upon waking up and not feeling fully alert.",
    "Comparing the more probable reactions, stretching and yawning stand out as common behaviors when someone is waking up slowly.",
    "Between stretching and yawning, yawning is more closely associated with being drowsy and needing more time before becoming fully awake.",
    "I will now evaluate the choices according to probability and common behavior upon waking: A (stretch) and B (yawn) are both plausible, but yawning directly reflects a state of drowsiness as mentioned before.",
    "Since the question asks what one is likely to do when not fully ready to be up, yawning (B) aligns best with that state."
