  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"He was scared of skiing after the accident\" indicates that there was a negative experience related to skiing that caused fear.",
    "The use of the word \"scared\" suggests that the outcome of skiing poses a potential risk or danger to him.",
    "An accident in skiing typically involves physical harm, which often leads to broken bones or injuries.",
    "Given this context, I must consider which option reflects what he would logically want to avoid as a result of his fear.",
    "The options list potential consequences or outcomes of skiing: a broken spirit, healthy body, broken bones, cold nose, and broken legs.",
    "Both \"broken bones\" and \"broken legs\" are directly related to injuries that can result from skiing accidents.",
    "\"Broken spirit\" indicates an emotional impact, but it does not typically relate to the physical aspect of skiing leading to injuries.",
    "\"A healthy body\" is something he would generally want, rather than want to avoid, after an accident.",
    "A \"cold nose\" is a common experience in skiing but does not constitute a significant risk or harm that would cause fear.",
    "Between \"broken bones\" and \"broken legs\", \"broken bones\" covers a wider range of possible injuries that can occur through skiing-related accidents."
