  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that sometimes garbage men are sloppy, leading the garbage waste to miss the truck.",
    "We need to determine where the garbage waste typically ends up when it misses the garbage truck.",
    "The choices provided include locations such as street, sewer, landfill, and garbage dump.",
    "It's logical to consider that if garbage waste is not collected properly, it may fall onto the street.",
    "Considering the other options, a sewer is not a usual place for garbage to be found intentionally; it's typically for water and waste.",
    "The term \"landfile\" seems to be a typo and should likely refer to \"landfill.\"",
    "Landfill sites are intended to receive garbage, but the phrasing indicates this junk is somewhere it shouldn't be.",
    "The option D only states \"landfile,\" which implies a non-existing or incorrect term since it could be a typo for landfill, which contradicts the context.",
    "The option E, \"garbage dump,\" is synonymous with a landfill, but the question implies it's not in a proper dumping ground.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most logical conclusion is that the missed garbage would end up on the street \u2013 an area where it becomes litter rather than being properly disposed of."
