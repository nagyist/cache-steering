  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that addicts turn to exercise to deal with their addictions. This implies they are looking for an activity that can serve as a positive alternative to their addictive behaviors.",
    "Exercise is generally regarded as a healthy activity due to its numerous physical and mental health benefits. This suggests that it serves to fulfill a psychological or physiological need that might be associated with their addictions.",
    "One of the primary functions of exercise is to expend energy, which can be particularly useful for individuals recovering from addictions that may have caused them to have excess energy or restlessness.",
    "Option B, \"expend energy,\" directly correlates with what one accomplishes through exercise, making it a pertinent choice considering that many addictions (like substance abuse) can lead to altered energy levels.",
    "Examining the other options: \n- A: \"condition heart\" refers to a specific benefit of exercise, but it is not the main reason addicts might choose to exercise; they are typically more concerned with coping mechanisms rather than conditioning.\n- C: \"laugh\" does not relate directly to exercise; while exercise might lead to happiness, it is not inherently a laughing activity.\n- D: \"stretch\" is again a specific component of exercise, not the general purpose for which addicts might engage in it.\n- E: \"weigh\" relates to measuring, which is not relevant in the context of what the addicts are seeking from exercise.",
    "Given all of these considerations and analyzing how exercise serves as a healthy way to cope with addictions, it is clear that expending energy is a significant factor.",
    "Since option B is the most relevant to the main purpose behind why addicts might turn to exercise, it stands out as the best answer among the choices provided."
