  "query": "Question: The membrane could be observed through magnification, it protected the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: protect\nB: cell\nC: filtration\nD: animal\nE: fresh egg",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"the membrane\" which implies it is referring to a biological membrane. Biological membranes are typically associated with cells.",
    "The primary function of a membrane, particularly in cells, is to provide protection to the cell interior and maintain homeostasis.",
    "The options provided need to be evaluated in the context of what membranes protect.",
    "Option A \"protect\" is not a noun, so it cannot be the answer.",
    "Option C \"filtration\" does not align with the primary protective function of a membrane; it is more about the membrane's role in controlling substances passing through it.",
    "Option D \"animal\" could refer to cells of animals, but it is too broad and does not specifically indicate the protective nature of a membrane.",
    "Option E \"fresh egg\" refers to a specific type of cell but is also not a general or accurate representation of what membranes universally protect.",
    "Since the function of a biological membrane is primarily to protect the cell itself, option B \"cell\" stands out as the correct choice."
