  "query": "Question: If I wanted to go through a door, but it was closed, what would I have to do to it?\n\nChoices:\nA: keep people out\nB: enclose cupboard\nC: teleport\nD: glass\nE: open",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that the door is closed and I want to go through it. This implies that I need to change the state of the door from closed to open.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided. Option A, \"keep people out,\" does not pertain to action needed to go through the door; rather, it describes the function of a closed door.",
    "Option B, \"enclose cupboard,\" also does not apply since it relates to a cupboard, not a door, and does not indicate an action I can take to go through the door.",
    "Option C, \"teleport,\" is a fantastical solution that does not deal with the physical reality of opening a door; it implies an instant transfer rather than conventional action.",
    "Option D, \"glass,\" appears unrelated as it does not provide any actionable information regarding opening a closed door.",
    "Finally, I analyze Option E, \"open,\" which directly describes the action I need to take to go through a closed door.",
    "After reviewing all options, I conclude that the only viable action to pass through the closed door is to \"open\" it."
