    "The question asks about a location where melted cheese is typically found.",
    "Melted cheese is usually associated with cooked dishes rather than raw or cold items.",
    "Among the options provided, refrigerators (A and C) contain food and ingredients that may include cheese, but it wouldn't be melted in those locations.",
    "Bread (B) can sometimes have melted cheese when it is toasted or part of a sandwich, but alone, it doesn\u2019t guarantee melted cheese.",
    "Pizza (D) is a dish where melted cheese is a prominent feature, making it a strong candidate for the question.",
    "The market (E) is a place where one might buy cheese, but it does not directly imply melted cheese.",
    "Comparing the choices, the most likely option that represents a location where melted cheese is commonly found is 'pizza' due to its characteristic of having melted cheese.",
