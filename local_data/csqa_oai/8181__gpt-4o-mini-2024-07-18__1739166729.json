  "query": "Question: Where would you normally apply sunblock to protect bare skin from sunshine?\n\nChoices:\nA: meadow\nB: summer\nC: sand\nD: street\nE: beach",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the primary reason for applying sunblock, which is to protect bare skin from UV radiation caused by sunlight.",
    "Next, consider the locations where bare skin is typically exposed to sunlight, especially during activities that occur outdoors.",
    "Evaluate the provided choices: \nA: meadow - could be a place for outdoor activities but isn't specifically associated with sun exposure.\nB: summer - this is a season, not a location, though it's associated with increased sun exposure.\nC: sand - this alone doesn't denote a location where one would apply sunblock.\nD: street - while one could be exposed to sunlight here, it's not a typical place for outdoor activities promoting sunblock use.\nE: beach - this is a common location for sunbathing and swimming, where many people wear less clothing and are directly exposed to the sun.",
    "Between these options, the beach (E) is the most directly related to scenarios where people commonly apply sunblock to protect their skin.",
    "Verify if the beach setting is more associated with sunblock use than other options by considering the context of sun exposure activities like lounging or swimming, which frequently occur at beaches.",
    "Compare other options again: while you can apply sunblock at places with sand, the term \"beach\" encompasses the ideal context for applying sunblock effectively due to exposure to sunlight.",
    "Based on the analysis of several factors regarding typical behaviors and sun exposure at different locations, conclude that the beach is the most appropriate answer."
