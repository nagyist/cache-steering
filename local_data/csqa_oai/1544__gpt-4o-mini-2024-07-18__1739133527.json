  "query": "Question: The work was pure math.  It couldn't be what to practical applications?\n\nChoices:\nA: contaminated\nB: dirty\nC: smoothed\nD: corrupt\nE: applied",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates a strong focus on \"pure math,\" suggesting that the work is theoretical rather than practical.",
    "The phrase \"it couldn't be\" implies that the work should not deviate from its pure mathematical nature and cannot have practical implementations.",
    "Now, we examine the provided choices to identify which option fits the context of being opposite to practical applications.",
    "Choice A: \"contaminated\" suggests a mixture or pollution, which does not fit the context of practicality versus purity.",
    "Choice B: \"dirty\" has a similar connotation as \"contaminated\" and does not relate to the application aspect.",
    "Choice C: \"smoothed\" does not connect to the idea of practical applications versus pure theoretical work.",
    "Choice D: \"corrupt\" implies a moral or ethical degradation, which does not align with the context of mathematics and its applications.",
    "Choice E: \"applied\" directly relates to practical usage or application of concepts, making it the opposite of \"pure math.\"",
    "Thus, the word that fits the context of what pure math cannot be is E (applied)."
