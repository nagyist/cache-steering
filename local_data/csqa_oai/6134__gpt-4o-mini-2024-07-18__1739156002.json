  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the emotional response of a person who has just realized that their dog has run away.",
    "Typically, when someone loses a pet, they often experience feelings of sadness, worry, and stress.",
    "I can eliminate options that do not relate to a strong emotional response: \"park,\" \"pay bills,\" and \"promise to do\" do not connect to feelings associated with losing a pet.",
    "This leaves us with options A (become depressed) and E (welcome change).",
    "Welcoming change is unlikely since losing a pet is typically not a positive experience; therefore, it is less likely that the person would feel they welcomed this change.",
    "Option A suggests becoming depressed, which aligns closely with the emotional fallout of losing a beloved pet.",
    "Consequently, option A is the most appropriate answer, as it addresses the sadness and concern that likely accompany the realization of a dog running away."
