  "query": "Question: After chewing food and swallowing it during meals, what needs to happen for you to be able to successfully use the bathroom later?\n\nChoices:\nA: good digestion\nB: aid digestion\nC: eating\nD: sore mouth\nE: toothache",
  "steps": [
    "First, after chewing food and swallowing it, the food enters the digestive tract.",
    "Next, the food needs to be digested properly in the stomach and intestines for nutrients to be absorbed and waste to be formed.",
    "Good digestion ensures that the body can break down the food and extract necessary nutrients while also processing leftover material into waste.",
    "If digestion is effective, the waste will be prepared for elimination from the body.",
    "Inadequate digestion could lead to issues such as constipation, making it difficult to use the bathroom.",
    "The act of eating relates to the entire process of digestion, but for using the bathroom later, it is the result of digestion that is specifically important.",
    "Among the given options, \"good digestion\" directly relates to effective waste elimination.",
    "While \"aiding digestion\" could be relevant, it implies an active role rather than the necessary outcome for bathroom use.",
    "\"Eating\" is part of the process, but not a requirement after swallowing food; the focus here should be on what happens post-ingestion.",
    "The options \"sore mouth\" and \"toothache\" do not contribute positively to the process and are irrelevant to the question."
