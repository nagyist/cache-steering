  "steps": [
    "To understand the question, we need to analyze the phrase \"when darkness came.\" This suggests a time when it is nighttime or conditions are low-light.",
    "Next, we consider the nature of the options provided: moon, haunted house, bed, movies, and cellar. We need to determine what would be a common or logical choice in response to darkness.",
    "The option \"A: moon\" implies going outside to look at the moon, which is not typical behavior or a prompt when it gets dark, especially if a person is expected to remain indoors.",
    "The option \"B: haunted house\" implies a place associated with fear or supernatural elements, which may not be comforting when it is dark.",
    "The option \"C: bed\" indicates a common response for many people when it is dark, as they often feel tired or seek comfort in bed.",
    "The option \"D: movies\" implies a social setting or activity that typically takes place in a well-lit environment, such as a theater, which does not fit the context of someone feeling prompted by darkness.",
    "The option \"E: cellar\" might suggest a specific task or storage place, but it can also be associated with fear or confinement, making it less likely to be a comforting choice when it is dark.",
    "Comparing all the options, \"bed\" stands out as the most natural and soothing place for someone to go when it is dark, as most people tend to relax or sleep in their beds at night.",
    "Therefore, having considered the context and each option, I conclude that the most logical answer is \"C: bed.\""
