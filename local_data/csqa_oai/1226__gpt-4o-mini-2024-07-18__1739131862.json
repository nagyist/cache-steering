  "query": "Question: Where would the steakhouse include a view of a Great Lake?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: florida\nC: kansas city\nD: maine\nE: georgia",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the states that have a coast or a view of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes include Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.",
    "Next, look at the choices provided: A: Michigan, B: Florida, C: Kansas City, D: Maine, E: Georgia.",
    "Michigan is known for its extensive coastline on Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior. This suggests that Michigan is a strong candidate for including a view of a Great Lake.",
    "Florida, while it has coastlines, does not border any of the Great Lakes, so it's not a candidate for including a view of a Great Lake.",
    "Kansas City is located in Missouri, which is situated quite inland and does not have any coastline on the Great Lakes, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Maine is located on the eastern coast of the United States and is far from the Great Lakes, as it is located in a different region entirely, thus not a candidate.",
    "Georgia, located in the southeastern part of the U.S., does not border any of the Great Lakes either, so it cannot provide a view.",
    "After examining each option, it's clear that Michigan is the only choice that would potentially house a steakhouse with a view of a Great Lake.",
    "Since no other option is plausible, Michigan is confirmed as the correct answer."
