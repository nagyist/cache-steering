  "query": "Question: Where do you buy a cheap book?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk\nB: grocery shop\nC: house\nD: antique store\nE: discount store",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to buy a cheap book, we need to evaluate each of the provided options for their likelihood of selling books at a low price.",
    "Option A, \"desk,\" does not make sense because a desk is a piece of furniture, not a place to purchase books.",
    "Option B, \"grocery shop,\" typically sells food and household items, and while some may carry a limited selection of books, they are not a primary source for buying books and may not offer cheap options.",
    "Option C, \"house,\" is also not a location where one can purchase books. It refers to a dwelling rather than a store.",
    "Option D, \"antique store,\" may have old or rare books, but they often come at a higher price due to their age and rarity, making it less likely to find cheap books there.",
    "Option E, \"discount store,\" is a retail outlet that typically sells items at lower prices, including books. They are known for providing discounts and are likely to have a selection of economical options.",
    "Comparing all options, the only viable choice for finding cheap books is the \"discount store.\"",
    "Thus, the correct answer is E, as it is the most appropriate location for purchasing inexpensive books."
