  "query": "Question: Billy thought that he was smart, but many of his attitudes didn't were very regressive. How might you describe him?\n\nChoices:\nA: backward\nB: ignorant\nC: garish\nD: intelligent\nE: annoying",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy believed he was smart, yet many of his attitudes were described as regressive. This implies that his views or beliefs are outdated or not progressive.",
    "The term \"regressive\" typically refers to something that is returning to an earlier or less advanced state or attitude. This suggests a negative perspective on his viewpoints.",
    "Now, we need to analyze the options provided in relation to the term \"regressive.\"",
    "Option A, \"backward,\" can mean lacking progress or advancement, which aligns with the concept of having regressive attitudes. It can imply holding outdated beliefs.",
    "Option B, \"ignorant,\" means lacking knowledge or awareness in general. Although Billy may hold regressive attitudes, calling him ignorant may not be entirely accurate just based on his self-assessment of being smart.",
    "Option C, \"garish,\" refers to something that is overly bright or showy and does not relate to attitudes or intelligence in the context given, so it\u2019s not applicable.",
    "Option D, \"intelligent,\" contradicts the idea of regressive attitudes since someone who is intelligent is typically aligned with progressive thoughts. Hence, this option is not suitable.",
    "Option E, \"annoying,\" is subjective and does not directly relate to the qualities of his attitudes being regressive.",
    "Comparing the relevant options, \"backward\" fits best as it conveys the meaning of having regressive (= non-progressive) attitudes, supporting the evaluation of Billy."
