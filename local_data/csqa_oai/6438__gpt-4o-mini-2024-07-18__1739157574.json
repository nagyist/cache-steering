  "query": "Question: Where is one unlikely to get popcorn?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: movie house\nC: soccer game\nD: carnival\nE: movie theater",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will evaluate the typical food options available at each choice.",
    "Restaurants often serve a variety of foods, including popcorn or similar snacks, especially if they cater to a casual dining experience.",
    "Movie houses predominantly focus on screenings of films and are known for serving popcorn as a staple snack while watching movies.",
    "Soccer games usually have food vendors, but popcorn is not a common offering; instead, hot dogs, pretzels, and nachos are more typical.",
    "Carnivals usually have a wide range of snack foods, and popcorn is a favorite among the various offerings at carnival booths.",
    "The term \"movie theater\" is synonymous with a movie house and also is well-known for serving popcorn.",
    "Now, summarizing the evaluations: \n- Restaurants might serve popcorn but aren't famous for it. \n- Movie houses and theaters definitely serve popcorn as a primary snack. \n- Carnivals are very likely to have popcorn as part of their food options. \n- Soccer games are the least likely venue to sell popcorn.",
    "Thus, the option that stands out as least likely to serve popcorn is the soccer game."
