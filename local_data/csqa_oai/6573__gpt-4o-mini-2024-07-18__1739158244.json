  "query": "Question: John needed a new lock to lock his antique pirate artifact. What might that artifact be?\n\nChoices:\nA: plastic sword\nB: ignition switch\nC: controlling access\nD: drawer\nE: firearm",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what type of antique pirate artifacts exist. Pirates were known for items like swords, weapons, and treasure chests.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided answer choices based on common pirate artifacts. A plastic sword does not match the antique nature.",
    "Looking at \"ignition switch,\" that is not relevant to pirate artifacts as they did not exist in the pirate era.",
    "The term \"controlling access\" is vague and doesn't represent a physical artifact that would need a lock.",
    "A drawer doesn't specifically relate to piracy or an antique artifact. It could hold items, but it is not necessarily a pirate artifact itself.",
    "Lastly, a firearm could be a pirate artifact since pirates did use weapons, including guns, which might require a lock for security.",
    "Compare the remaining option \u2014 firearm \u2014 with the others. It fits the pirate theme quite well as they often had weapons.",
    "Since firearms were significant in pirate culture, it appears to be the only choice that makes sense regarding both the need for a lock and an antique pirate artifact."
