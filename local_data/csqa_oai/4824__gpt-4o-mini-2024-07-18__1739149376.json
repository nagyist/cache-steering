  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that a country is hesitant to join a union due to concerns about their status.",
    "To determine the appropriate answer, it's essential to understand what it means to be part of a union and what implications it might have for a country\u2019s autonomy or status.",
    "The term \"province\" generally refers to a territory governed as part of a larger political entity, which could imply a reduction in status for the country if it were to join a union.",
    "The other choices (plebeian, workplace, detroit, construction business) do not appear to relate directly to concerns about political status or autonomy in a meaningful way.",
    "\u201cPlebian\u201d refers to common people in ancient Rome and does not convey a geographical or political reduction in status relevant to the question.",
    "\u201cWorkplace\u201d and \u201cconstruction business\u201d are both nonsensical in this political context and irrelevant to the idea of national status.",
    "\u201cDetroit\u201d is a city and would not apply to a country\u2019s status in this context; it does not represent a political structure or reduction in autonomy.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer is \"province,\" as it most accurately reflects a situation where a country fears becoming administratively subordinate or less autonomous if it joins a union."
