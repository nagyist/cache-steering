  "query": "Question: People came far and wide for what the chef could do on the grill, if you asked most patrons they'd say it was their favorite what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cinema hall\nB: restaurant\nC: backyard\nD: hardware store\nE: back yard",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that people came for what the chef could do on the grill. This implies that the focus is on cooking or food prepared using a grill.",
    "Next, the question states that if you asked most patrons, they would say it was their favorite something. The context suggests that it relates to dining or a place where food is served.",
    "Choices A (cinema hall) and D (hardware store) do not fit, as neither is associated with food or grilling. Similarly, choice C (backyard) does not inherently suggest a place where a chef would commonly be associated with grilling, though grilling can be done in a backyard.",
    "Choice B (restaurant) is directly related to dining experiences and is commonly where chefs prepare food, including grilled items. This fits the context of patrons expressing a favorite location.",
    "Choice E (back yard) also suggests outdoor grilling, but lacks the dining-focused context implied by the term \"restaurant.\"",
    "Given that the question is specifically about the chef's grilling prowess and where people might express their favorite experience in that context, a \"restaurant\" is the most relevant choice related to a chef and grill.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer is B, as it directly associates with a chef's work and where patrons would come to enjoy his grilling skills."
