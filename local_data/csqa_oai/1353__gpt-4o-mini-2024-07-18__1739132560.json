  "query": "Question: James owned a historic deli.  It had some protections that helped him keep it open.  It was an important landmark where?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york city\nB: indianapolis\nC: office building\nD: shopping center\nE: strip mall",
  "steps": [
    "Identifying the context, the question refers to a \"historic deli\" that holds significance as a landmark.",
    "Considering the options provided, the likely places where a historic deli would be recognized as a landmark are cities rather than non-geographical terms like \"office building,\" \"shopping center,\" or \"strip mall.\"",
    "Among the geographical options, New York City is known for its delis, particularly historic ones, which have cultural significance.",
    "Indianapolis, while it may have delis, does not have the same historical or cultural association with delis as New York City does.",
    "Considering that options C, D, and E are types of structures or scenes where a deli could be located, they do not fit the context of a historic landmark.",
    "Thus, \"historic deli\" paired with \"important landmark\" suggests a location within a vibrant city known for its food culture.",
    "The only choice that fits both the historical aspect and the recognition as a landmark is New York City."
