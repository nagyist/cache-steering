  "query": "Question: John is in a dressing room changing into shorts and sweat pants.  What sort of building is he most likely to be in?\n\nChoices:\nA: gym\nB: swimming pool\nC: theatre\nD: department store\nE: boutique",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider where dressing rooms are commonly found. Dressing rooms are often present in places where people change clothes for various activities or events.",
    "Next, we analyze the context of John changing into shorts and sweat pants. Both of these clothing items are typically associated with physical activities.",
    "We need to identify the places where someone would change into such attire. A gym is a common location for people to change into workout clothes, such as shorts and sweat pants.",
    "A swimming pool is another possibility since people often change into swimsuits, but John is not changing into a swimsuit; he is changing into athletic wear.",
    "Theater dressing rooms are more focused on costumes for performances and are less likely to accommodate casual clothing changes like shorts and sweat pants.",
    "In a department store, dressing rooms are typically used for trying on various outfits, but it is less common for someone to specifically change into shorts and sweat pants for a casual outing or workout.",
    "A boutique also usually caters to more fashionable or formal attire rather than casual sportswear, making it an unlikely choice compared to a gym.",
    "Since the context and clothing indicate a casual, athletic environment, the most fitting choice remains the gym."
