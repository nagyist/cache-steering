  "query": "Question: Living in a humid climate can be uncomfortable, it leads to a lot of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sometimes bad\nB: perspiration\nC: reproducing\nD: palpitations\nE: hunger",
  "steps": [
    "Living in a humid climate means the air contains a high amount of moisture.",
    "High humidity can make it difficult for sweat to evaporate from the skin.",
    "When sweat does not evaporate efficiently, the body struggles to cool itself.",
    "As a result, people in humid environments tend to sweat more to regulate their body temperature.",
    "This increased sweating is known as perspiration.",
    "The other options, such as 'sometimes bad,' 'reproducing,' 'palpitations,' and 'hunger,' do not have a direct connection to living in a humid climate.",
    "Therefore, based on the reasoning about how humidity affects the body, the most relevant outcome is perspiration."
