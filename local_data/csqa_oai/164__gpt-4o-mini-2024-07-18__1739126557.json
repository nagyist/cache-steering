  "query": "Question: Where would you be able to hear a bassoon played in an unpleasing fashion?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: baritone woodwind sound\nC: symphony\nD: play music\nE: high school band",
  "steps": [
    "Analyze what a bassoon is and in which settings it is typically played.",
    "A bassoon is a woodwind instrument often found in orchestras and bands.",
    "Consider the nature of the options provided. Options A (orchestra), C (symphony), and E (high school band) imply formal musical settings.",
    "In a high school band, students may be less experienced and could potentially play the bassoon in an unpleasing fashion.",
    "Options A and C are both more professional environments where players are generally more skilled, making mistakes less likely.",
    "Option B, baritone woodwind sound, does not refer to a specific location or context where the bassoon would be played.",
    "Option D, play music, is too broad and does not indicate a specific setting where the bassoon might be played poorly.",
    "Thus, the most plausible answer is where inexperienced musicians are likely to play, which is the high school band.",
    "Confirm there are no alternative interpretations that would suggest a different setting for unpleasing bassoon playing."
