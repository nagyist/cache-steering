  "query": "Question: John lost his screwdriver and cannot find it.  Where would he take his lawnmower?\n\nChoices:\nA: car dealership\nB: toolkit\nC: bar\nD: repair shop\nE: tool box",
  "steps": [
    "First, we recognize that John has a lawnmower, which may need maintenance or repair since he lost his screwdriver.",
    "Next, we consider where lawnmowers are typically taken for repair or maintenance. Toolkits and toolboxes usually contain tools, but they are not locations to take a lawnmower.",
    "We analyze choice A, car dealership. This is not applicable since a lawnmower is not a vehicle that would be serviced at a car dealership.",
    "For choice C, bar, it is obviously not a place for repairing any machinery, including lawnmowers.",
    "Now we consider choice D, repair shop. This generally refers to a location where machinery, including lawnmowers, can be repaired or serviced.",
    "Finally, choice E mentions tool box. Like a toolkit, this is a storage place for tools, not a location where John would take his lawnmower.",
    "Based on the evaluation of all choices, the best option for John to take his lawnmower for help is the repair shop."
