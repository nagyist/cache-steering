  "steps": [
    "The question asks what helps a human to move.",
    "To consider the options, I need to evaluate which of them is directly related to movement in humans.",
    "Option A mentions \"two arms.\" While arms are helpful for certain types of movements, they are not the primary factor for locomotion.",
    "Option B mentions \"drinks.\" While hydration is important for overall health, it doesn't facilitate movement.",
    "Option C mentions \"stupidity.\" This is not a factor that aids in movement; rather, it is a negative trait.",
    "Option D mentions \"one body.\" While a body is necessary for movement, this description is too vague to be considered a direct mechanism of movement.",
    "Option E mentions \"muscles.\" Muscles are directly responsible for movement as they contract and allow for motion.",
    "Upon evaluating all options, it is clear that muscles are fundamental to the movement process in humans.",
    "Thus, the best answer that directly answers the question is option E."
