  "steps": [
    "Jumping up and down over a rope involves physical activity.",
    "Physical activities that require movement usually relate to exercise.",
    "Jumping rope is a common form of exercise, often used for cardiovascular training.",
    "While jumping rope can also be fun, the primary classification of the activity is related to exercise rather than just enjoyment.",
    "Headaches and feeling warm are symptoms or byproducts that may occur during physical exertion but are not primary descriptors of the activity itself.",
    "The option \"broken\" does not logically relate to jumping rope; it suggests something negative or a state rather than a form of activity.",
    "Thus, analyzing the options, the most appropriate term that captures the essence of jumping up and down over a rope is exercise."
