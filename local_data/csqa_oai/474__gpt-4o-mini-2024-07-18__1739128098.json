    "The question asks for an item made of paper that can help with navigation while traveling along a highway.",
    "We need to consider the nature of the choices provided and determine which one is a paper item related to navigation.",
    "Choice A, \"united states,\" does not refer to an item but rather a geographical entity.",
    "Choice C, \"developed land,\" refers to a type of land use and is not relevant to navigation or a paper item.",
    "Choice D, \"park,\" is an area designated for recreational purposes and is not a paper item used for navigation.",
    "Choice E, \"countryside,\" also refers to rural areas and does not pertain to a paper navigation aid.",
    "Choice B, \"atlas,\" refers to a collection of maps and is indeed an item made of paper that can be used for navigation purposes.",
    "Since \"atlas\" is the only choice among the options that fits the criteria of being made of paper and used for finding one's way, it is a suitable answer."
