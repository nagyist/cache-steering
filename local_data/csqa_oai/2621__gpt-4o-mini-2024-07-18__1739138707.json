  "query": "Question: The rug saw a lot of foot traffic and had popcorn strewn about, where was it likely?\n\nChoices:\nA: backyard\nB: bedroom\nC: desk\nD: table\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the phrase \"a lot of foot traffic.\" This suggests that the rug is in a location frequently visited or used by people.",
    "Next, evaluate where in a home people are most likely to congregate and have frequent foot traffic. The living room is a common area where people gather.",
    "Look at the second part of the clue: \"popcorn strewn about.\" Popcorn typically indicates some kind of activity, like watching a movie or having a party, which also occurs in social areas.",
    "Assess the choices with this context. The backyard could potentially have people eating popcorn, but it\u2019s less likely to have a rug than an indoor space.",
    "The bedroom is usually a private, less trafficked space and wouldn\u2019t typically have popcorn scattered around.",
    "A desk could indicate a workspace, but it is unlikely to have popcorn around and wouldn\u2019t typically have a lot of foot traffic.",
    "A table may have popcorn for gatherings, but again, it does not suggest a good deal of foot traffic on a rug.",
    "The living room, however, fits all the criteria: it has high foot traffic and is a common place for people to eat snacks like popcorn while socializing.",
    "Thus, among all the choices provided, the living room is the most logical location for a rug that saw a lot of foot traffic and had popcorn strewn about."
