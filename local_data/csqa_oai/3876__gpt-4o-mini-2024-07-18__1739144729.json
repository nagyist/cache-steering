  "query": "Question: An over-heated snake will hide where in a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: tropical forest\nC: oklahoma\nD: basement\nE: river",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of snakes and their behavior. Snakes are ectothermic creatures, meaning they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.",
    "Next, think about what happens when a snake gets overheated. It would seek a cooler environment to avoid overheating and maintain its body temperature within a healthy range.",
    "Now, evaluate the environmental conditions typically found in different options provided. Bedrooms, tropical forests, and Oklahoma climates may not consistently provide cooler environments, especially during hot weather.",
    "Focus on the basement option. Basements are generally cooler than other parts of a house due to being underground and often having less sunlight.",
    "Compare the basement to the other options: a bedroom likely has heating during colder seasons and can get warm, a tropical forest is too humid and warm, Oklahoma can have varying temperatures but can become hot and dry, and a river is not a location in a house.",
    "Reaffirm that the basement provides a controlled, cooler environment where a snake might successfully cool down.",
    "Lastly, conclude that the best choice, given the focus on the cooling aspect for an overheated snake, is indeed the basement within a house."
