  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze each option to determine where a dollar could be placed and would be difficult to retrieve without breaking it.",
    "Option A (cash drawer): A dollar can be placed in a cash drawer easily, and it can be retrieved without any difficulty.",

    "Option C (purse): A dollar can be placed in a purse, but it can be removed easily without breaking anything.",
    "Option D (box): A box can be secured, but if the box has a removable lid, the dollar can be taken out without any damage.",
    "Option E (pocket): A dollar can be placed in a pocket and taken out easily without breaking anything.",
