  "query": "Question: When there are group projects, how do people normally work on them?\n\nChoices:\nA: believe in god\nB: work in teams\nC: kiss each other\nD: receive gifts\nE: argue",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of group projects, which typically involve collaboration among individuals to achieve a common goal.",
    "I consider the dynamics of working together; people usually need to communicate and coordinate their efforts effectively in group settings.",
    "From common knowledge, team projects usually require teamwork, where group members contribute their skills and perspectives.",
    "I now evaluate each choice:\n- Choice A (believe in god) doesn't relate to the practical aspects of working on projects.\n- Choice B (work in teams) aligns with the collaborative nature of group projects.\n- Choice C (kiss each other) is not a typical behavior associated with professional or academic projects.\n- Choice D (receive gifts) is irrelevant to the fundamental structure of group work.\n- Choice E (argue) might occur in some groups, but it is not indicative of how people normally work together.",
    "After analyzing the options, \"work in teams\" stands out as the most accurate representation of how people typically approach group projects.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the correct answer is indeed reflective of regular practices in group project settings."
