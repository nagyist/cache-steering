  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a specific stereotype associated with pirates, who are often depicted as having peg legs and parrots.",
    "Pirates are known for collecting gold and treasures, which they typically hide or store in secret locations.",
    "Among the common items associated with pirates is a \"treasure chest\" where they would keep their gold and valuables.",
    "The other options listed (A, B, D, E) do not align with the commonly accepted pirate lore of treasure storage.",
    "A ring could hold gold, but it is not specific to the theme of pirate treasure.",
    "A jewelry store is a place to buy or sell jewelry, not primarily where pirates would store their collected gold.",
    "Fort Knox is a place known for storing gold, but it is associated with the U.S. government rather than pirates.",
    "A church may hold valuables but is not directly related to the theme of pirate treasure and gold collection.",
    "Given the associations with pirates and the stereotypes, a treasure chest is the most accurate storage method for gold collected by people with peg legs and parrots."
