  "query": "Question: The matter in side a can of soda is in what state?\n\nChoices:\nA: vending machine\nB: pop\nC: store\nD: liquid\nE: picnic cooler",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider what a can of soda typically contains. It is known that soda is a beverage.",
    "Next, we examine the nature of soda. It is primarily composed of water, carbonation, and flavorings, which together form a drinkable liquid.",
    "Since the primary characteristic of soda is that it is drinkable, we can eliminate options that do not describe its physical state.",
    "Option A (vending machine) and option C (store) refer to locations, and option E (picnic cooler) suggests a temporary storage solution rather than the soda itself.",
    "Option B (pop) is another term for soda but does not specifically indicate the physical state of the matter within the can.",
    "This leaves us with option D (liquid), which accurately describes the physical state of soda as it is in liquid form.",
    "After confirming our reasoning, it is clear that the matter inside a can of soda is indeed liquid."
