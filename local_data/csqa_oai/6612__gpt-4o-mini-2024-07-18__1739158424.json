  "query": "Question: Where does a waiter bring water to customers?\n\nChoices:\nA: thunderstorm\nB: bathroom\nC: enema\nD: restaurant\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a common service provided by waiters in relation to customers.",
    "Waiters typically work in establishments where food and beverages are served.",
    "One of the primary establishments where waiters operate is a restaurant.",
    "The other options such as thunderstorm, bathroom, enema, and ocean do not relate to the typical service a waiter provides.",
    "A thunderstorm is a weather event, not a service-related location.",
    "A bathroom is a location for personal hygiene and not a dining or drinking venue.",
    "An enema is a medical procedure, unrelated to food or drink service.",
    "The ocean is a body of water, and while there are dining options by the ocean, it does not specifically relate to a waiter bringing water.",
    "Therefore, the most logical and relevant answer is that a waiter brings water to customers at a restaurant."
