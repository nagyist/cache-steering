  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that while mowing the lawn, he had to be cautious about his surroundings, specifically regarding landscaping and passing cars. This indicates he is in an area where cars are nearby.",
    "The presence of cars suggests that he is in a residential area rather than something more isolated like a forest or golf course.",
    "Options B (forest) and E (golf course) can be immediately discounted because they do not typically have passing cars.",
    "The options now are A (front yard), C (back yard), and D (suburbia).",
    "A front yard is more likely to be visible to street traffic, which aligns with the concern about passing cars.",
    "A back yard is usually less visible from the street, and while there could be some risk for a passing car, it's less likely to be the primary concern when mowing.",
    "Suburbia refers to a residential area and does not pinpoint a specific location for mowing. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t directly answer the question of where he is while doing this task.",
    "Considering all the evidence, the most appropriate answer is A (front yard) since it directly relates to the concern of hitting landscaping and launching rocks at passing cars."
