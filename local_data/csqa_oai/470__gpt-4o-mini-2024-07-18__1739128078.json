  "query": "Question: Where in a town would you put your shed?\n\nChoices:\nA: next to the house\nB: keeping things in\nC: backyard\nD: farm yard\nE: ranch",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the best location for a shed, I first consider its primary purpose, which is often for storage of tools, gardening supplies, or outdoor equipment.",
    "Next, I evaluate convenience. A shed should be accessible but not obstruct the view or flow of the garden or yard.",
    "Now, I identify the locations provided in the options. Next to the house (A) might be convenient for access, but it could take away from the home\u2019s aesthetic.",
    "Keeping things in (B) is not a physical location but rather describes the function of the shed, so it doesn\u2019t serve as a valid option for placement.",
    "Looking at the backyard (C), it seems to provide a blend of privacy, accessibility, and the opportunity to enhance the overall yard space.",
    "The farm yard (D) and ranch (E) are more suitable for larger properties and more specific uses, which may not apply to a standard home environment.",
    "I factor in the likelihood that most homes have backyards, making it a common and practical location to place a shed.",
    "Also, placing the shed in the backyard allows for easier management of space compared to the front yard, which is usually more visible and can impact the curb appeal of the house.",
    "I conclude that the backyard (C) offers the best balance of convenience for access, privacy from the street, and efficient use of space."
