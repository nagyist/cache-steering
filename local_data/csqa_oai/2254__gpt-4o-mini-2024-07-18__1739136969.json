  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the common actions that teachers typically take after a lesson concludes.",
    "After teaching a lesson, teachers often encourage student engagement and understanding.",
    "Answering questions is a common practice, as it helps clarify any misunderstandings.",
    "I will evaluate the provided choices to see which one best fits typical post-lesson teacher behavior.",
    "Choices C and D (school children and school students) are not actions; they refer to groups of people.",
    "Choice E (teach children) describes what happens before the lesson, rather than after it.",
    "Choice B (pop quiz) might occur sometimes but is not a universal action taken after every lesson.",
    "Thus, choice A (answering questions) is the most typical and reasonable action that teachers engage in after teaching a lesson."
