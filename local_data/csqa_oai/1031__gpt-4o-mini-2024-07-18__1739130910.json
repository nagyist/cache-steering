  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotional responses typically associated with causing harm to another person. Many individuals experience negative emotions when they realize their actions have hurt someone else.",
    "Empowerment (choice A) usually stems from a sense of strength or control, which typically doesn't align with the feeling one might experience after inflicting pain on someone else.",
    "Luck (choice B) doesn't seem relevant, as hurting someone usually does not lead to feelings of fortune or serendipity. It's an unlikely emotional response.",
    "Punishment (choice D) is an external consequence rather than a feeling one might have. While someone might feel punished by society or relationships, it is not a direct emotional response to the act of hurting someone.",
    "Despair (choice E) could be a possible reaction, but it tends to relate more to feelings of hopelessness or deep sadness, which might not be as universally experienced as regret.",
    "Regret (choice C) is a common and likely emotional response after hurting someone, as it reflects acknowledgment of wrongdoing and concern for the other person's feelings.",
    "Comparing C and E, while despair is possible, regret typically encompasses a sense of personal responsibility and a wish for a different outcome, making it more probable.",
    "Ultimately, individuals often reflect on their actions following a situation where they have caused harm, leading them to feel regret for the pain caused."
