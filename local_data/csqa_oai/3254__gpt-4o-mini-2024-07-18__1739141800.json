  "query": "Question: Where might a student store a pencil when traveling\n\nChoices:\nA: backpack\nB: desktop\nC: classroom\nD: desk drawer\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of traveling. A student will have limited space and need to store items conveniently.",
    "Next, think about the common items a student carries when traveling. A backpack is typically used for transporting school supplies and personal items.",
    "Now, evaluate the options given. A backpack (Choice A) is a likely candidate for storing a pencil during travel since it is designed to carry items.",
    "Choice B, desktop, is not relevant as it refers to a stationary workspace.",
    "Choice C, classroom, suggests a location where the pencil could be used, not stored during travel.",
    "Choice D, desk drawer, is generally stationary and wouldn't be used for storing items while traveling.",
    "Choice E, pocket, is also a viable option, but it might not be as safe or organized as using a backpack.",
    "Overall, the most practical and common location for a student to store a pencil while traveling is in a backpack."
