  "query": "Question: Where would you give something other than money to a clerk?\n\nChoices:\nA: ticket booth\nB: at hotel\nC: shop\nD: bookstore\nE: post office",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context in which I might give something other than money to a clerk.",
    "Typically, in places where transactions occur, such as ticket booths, hotels, shops, bookstores, and post offices, various forms of exchange might happen.",
    "A ticket booth generally requires money for tickets, making it less likely that something other than money would be exchanged there.",
    "At a hotel, you may give a credit card for payment, or in some cases, you could leave a tip or provide a form of identification, but it is predominantly a monetary transaction.",
    "In a shop, similar to a hotel, you predominantly exchange money for goods. While some shops may accept barter, it is not common.",
    "In a bookstore, the situation is similar \u2014 you mainly exchange cash or cards for books, although you might occasionally trade in books for store credit.",
    "At a post office, while money is required for services, you may also give packages or letters for mailing, which fits the criteria of giving something other than money.",
    "Therefore, the post office stands out as a place where you directly hand something other than money (like a letter or package) to a clerk.",
    "Comparing the options, the post office is the most fitting location for giving something other than money."
