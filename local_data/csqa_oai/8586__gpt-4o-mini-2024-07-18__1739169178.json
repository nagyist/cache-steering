  "query": "Question: What does the sky look like on a sunny day?\n\nChoices:\nA: dark\nB: cloud over\nC: rain water\nD: appear blue\nE: starry",
  "steps": [
    "On a sunny day, the absence of clouds is a prominent feature.",
    "The sun's rays illuminate the atmosphere, causing the sky to appear in various shades.",
    "One of the most common descriptions of a clear sky when it is sunny is that it appears blue.",
    "This blue color is due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered more than other colors.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"dark\" would not accurately describe the sky on a sunny day.",
    "\"Cloud over\" and \"rain water\" also do not apply because these suggest overcast conditions or precipitation rather than clear, sunny weather.",
    "\"Starry\" might apply to a night sky, not a sunny day.",
    "Thus, the only choice that correctly describes the sky on a sunny day is \"appear blue.\""
