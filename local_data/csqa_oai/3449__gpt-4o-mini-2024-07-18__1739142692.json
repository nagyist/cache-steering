  "query": "Question: He knew that beginning work on this job would mean he couldn't get home on time for several days. What is his reaction?\n\nChoices:\nA: overtime\nB: panic\nC: excitement\nD: stress\nE: accomplishing",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that starting this job would affect his ability to return home on time for several days. This implies a significant commitment to the job.",
    "Given that he is aware of the impact on his personal time, we can infer that he might have mixed feelings about this situation.",
    "Considering the stress of a work commitment that interferes with personal life, one possible reaction could be stress. This is a common response to having to sacrifice personal time for work obligations.",
    "The option \"panic\" implies an overwhelming fear or anxiety about the situation, which is not directly suggested by the phrasing of the original statement.",
    "Alternatively, \"overtime\" is not a reaction but rather a descriptor of the work hours he may need to put in.",
    "\"Excitement\" seems less fitting because the context suggests a burden rather than a positive thrill about beginning a new job.",
    "\"Accomplishing\" may suggest completing a task, but it does not represent a reaction to the situation described in the question.",
    "Among the choices presented, \"stress\" is the most appropriate reaction as it relates to the conflict between work obligations and personal time."
