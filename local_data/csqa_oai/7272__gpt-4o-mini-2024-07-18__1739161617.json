  "query": "Question: The artist felt creating art was more than just making a picture, he felt his work had to evoke what?\n\nChoices:\nA: strong emotion\nB: work of art\nC: pleasure\nD: anger\nE: enlightenment",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the artist's perspective on the purpose of creating art.",
    "We need to consider what it means for art to evoke something; this typically refers to stirring feelings or emotions in the viewer.",
    "Let's analyze the choices given to determine which one aligns best with the idea of evoking emotions or meaningful experiences.",
    "Choice A: strong emotion - This suggests that the artist believes effective art should evoke powerful feelings in the audience.",
    "Choice B: work of art - This is too vague and does not align with the evocation of a specific feeling or experience.",
    "Choice C: pleasure - While pleasure is an emotion, it is more specific than strong emotion, and may not encompass all forms of evocation the artist might intend.",
    "Choice D: anger - This is also a specific emotion and could be considered a valid response, but it is not comprehensive of all emotions art might evoke.",
    "Choice E: enlightenment - This suggests a more intellectual or spiritual response, but it doesn't capture the emotional aspect that is usually intended by art.",
    "Among all these considerations, \"strong emotion\" stands out because it does not limit the artist's intention to a specific emotional response, but rather opens it up to encompassing all types of emotions that the art might evoke."
