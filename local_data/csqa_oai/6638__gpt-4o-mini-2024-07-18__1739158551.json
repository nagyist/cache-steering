  "query": "Question: Where does a blade help you to move from one place to another?\n\nChoices:\nA: rollerblade\nB: helicopter\nC: lawn mower\nD: scissors\nE: knife",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a blade helps you move from one place to another.",
    "Let's analyze the options one by one.",
    "Option A is \"rollerblade.\" Rollerblades have blades but mainly are a form of footwear that helps a person move.",
    "Option B is \"helicopter.\" Helicopters have blades that allow them to fly, enabling movement from one location to another.",
    "Option C is \"lawn mower.\" Lawn mowers use blades to cut grass but do not facilitate movement from one place to another; instead, they are stationary equipment.",
    "Option D is \"scissors.\" Scissors have blades designed for cutting but do not aid in transportation.",
    "Option E is \"knife.\" Knives have blades as well but do not assist in movement between locations.",
    "From the analysis, option A (rollerblade) and option B (helicopter) are the only ones that involve movement, but \"rollerblade\" is more about personal transportation while \"helicopter\" involves consistent movement from one location to another due to its ability to fly.",
    "Therefore, the best answer that fits the criteria of helping to move from one place to another based on the function of a blade is the helicopter."
