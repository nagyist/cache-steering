  "query": "Question: What is it called when you are killing people because they are bad?\n\nChoices:\nA: war\nB: get arrested\nC: joy\nD: going to prison\nE: vengeance",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the term used to describe the act of killing people that one considers \"bad.\"",
    "The options provided include \"war,\" \"get arrested,\" \"joy,\" \"going to prison,\" and \"vengeance.\"",
    "\"War\" involves large-scale conflict between groups and typically involves more than just the killing of individuals deemed as 'bad.'",
    "\"Get arrested\" refers to the act of being taken into custody by law enforcement, which does not involve killing.",
    "\"Joy\" is an emotion and does not pertain to killing or any related actions.",
    "\"Going to prison\" is a consequence of committing crimes and does not imply killing.",
    "\"Vengeance\" involves seeking revenge, which can sometimes lead to the killing of those considered 'bad,' but is not synonymous with killing itself.",
    "I conclude that while \"vengeance\" can be associated with killing, none of the given options precisely define an act of killing as the question describes.",
    "Among the choices, \"vengeance\" is the closest to what one might imply when referring to killing people viewed as \"bad\" for the sake of retribution."
