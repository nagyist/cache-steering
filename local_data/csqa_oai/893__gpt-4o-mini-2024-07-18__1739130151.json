  "query": "Question: The janitor got his pail out of where?\n\nChoices:\nA: wishing well\nB: kitchen\nC: hardware store\nD: garage\nE: utility room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where a janitor typically keeps their equipment, including a pail.",
    "A janitor's equipment is often found in areas where cleaning supplies are stored or where they can easily access tools.",
    "The options provided include several possible locations: wishing well, kitchen, hardware store, garage, and utility room.",
    "A wishing well is not a practical location for storing a janitor's pail; it is typically a decorative or functional water feature.",
    "A kitchen is likely to have cleaning supplies, but it is more common for janitors to keep their equipment elsewhere.",
    "A hardware store is a location to buy equipment but not typically where a janitor would store their supplies.",
    "A garage could contain cleaning equipment but is generally associated with automobiles, tools, or outdoor supplies.",
    "The utility room, however, is specifically designed for storing cleaning equipment, supplies, and maintenance tools.",
    "Considering the common practices for janitors, it makes the most sense that the pail would be retrieved from the utility room."
