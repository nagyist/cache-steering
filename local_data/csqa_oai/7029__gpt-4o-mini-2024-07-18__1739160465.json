  "query": "Question: What can you build for your puppy so he can sleep comfortably outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: dog house\nB: home\nC: kennel\nD: table\nE: tree",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a structure that will provide comfort for a puppy to sleep outside.",
    "A dog house is specifically designed for dogs to have a sheltered place to sleep.",
    "A home is a general term and usually refers to where a person lives; it\u2019s not typically something built specifically for a dog.",
    "A kennel is another term that can refer to a type of dog house, but it can also refer to a facility that provides lodging for dogs.",
    "A table is not a suitable structure for sleeping; it's typically used for keeping items or eating on.",
    "A tree does not provide shelter in the same way a constructed space would for a puppy to sleep comfortably.",
    "Between a dog house and a kennel, the dog house is more commonly recognized as a sleeping area specifically for dogs.",
    "Therefore, while both \"dog house\" and \"kennel\" are options, the more suitable and recognized term for providing a comfortable sleeping area specifically designed for a puppy is \"dog house.\""
