  "query": "Question: Where could you get something that is made out of wool but cannot be worn?\n\nChoices:\nA: clothing store\nB: sweater\nC: fabric store\nD: jewelry\nE: clothing factory",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an item made out of wool that cannot be worn.",
    "Wool is commonly used to create fabrics and garments, but the item in question must not be wearable.",
    "Let's analyze the choices one by one.",
    "A clothing store (Choice A) sells items that are primarily intended to be worn, such as jackets, sweaters, and hats, so this choice does not fit the criteria.",
    "A sweater (Choice B) is a wearable item made of wool, hence it does not satisfy the condition as it can be worn.",
    "A fabric store (Choice C) typically sells various types of fabric, including wool, but not necessarily in forms that can be worn directly. This aligns with the requirement of being made from wool but not wearable.",
    "Jewelry (Choice D) does not relate to wool at all, as it is typically made from metals, precious stones, or other materials, which disqualifies it.",
    "A clothing factory (Choice E) primarily produces wearable clothing items, so it also does not satisfy the condition because anything the factory makes would be intended to be worn.",
    "Given our analysis, the only option that fits the criteria is a fabric store, which sells wool in forms that cannot be worn directly as a garment."
