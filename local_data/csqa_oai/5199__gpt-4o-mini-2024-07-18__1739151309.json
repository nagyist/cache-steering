  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to get a bicycle for a child?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy store\nB: fun\nC: street\nD: university\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's evaluate the options. We know that a good place to get a bicycle for a child should be safe, reliable, and offer suitable options for children's bicycles.",
    "Next, option A, a toy store, typically offers a range of toys and might have some children\u2019s bicycles. However, the selection may be limited and not of high quality compared to specialty stores.",
    "Option B, labeled \"fun,\" is vague and does not represent a specific location to acquire a bicycle. It is irrelevant to the question.",
    "Now, option C, the street, is not a suitable place to purchase a bicycle for a child. It's not a place where bicycles are typically sold.",
    "Option D, a university, is also not appropriate. Universities do not typically sell bicycles, especially for children.",
    "Lastly, option E, a garage, could imply a variety of things. If this refers to a personal garage, it may only apply if someone has an unused bicycle they want to give away or sell, but again, this isn\u2019t a dependable method.",
    "Evaluating all the options, the most suitable answer is A (toy store) since it is the only specific retail option that may offer children's bicycles."
