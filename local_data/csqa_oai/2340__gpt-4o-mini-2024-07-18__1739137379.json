  "query": "Question: Greg couldn't pay the cash advance fee, and thus was dinged for what?\n\nChoices:\nA: late payment\nB: going backward\nC: retreat\nD: late payment\nE: basic",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the situation: Greg was unable to pay the cash advance fee.",
    "Determine the consequences of not paying a fee: Usually, failing to pay such fees can lead to additional charges or penalties.",
    "Look at the provided choices: A: late payment, B: going backward, C: retreat, D: late payment, E: basic.",
    "Notice that 'late payment' suggests a penalty for not timely paying a required fee.",
    "Assess if there are any choices that are duplicates: A and D both state 'late payment.'",
    "Evaluate the remaining choices: B (going backward), C (retreat), and E (basic) don't directly relate to the consequence of not paying a fee.",
    "Determine that the most relevant option to Greg's situation of not paying a fee is 'late payment.'",
    "Since A and D both indicate 'late payment,' it confirms that this is indeed a consequence of failing to pay the cash advance fee.",
    "Choose one of the duplicate options, A or D, since they are the same."
