  "query": "Question: What is something you do  in a bank?\n\nChoices:\nA: make noise\nB: have tea\nC: make time\nD: make payments\nE: take time",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical activities people engage in when visiting a bank. Banks are institutions dealing with financial transactions.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. \"Make noise\" (A) does not represent a common or relevant activity in a bank setting.",
    "Now consider \"have tea\" (B). This does not relate to the purpose of a bank and is generally not a bank activity.",
    "Examine \"make time\" (C). This phrase could imply scheduling or organizing, but it doesn\u2019t directly relate to a typical bank function.",
    "Analyze \"make payments\" (D). This is a common activity at a bank since people frequently make payments for loans, bills, or other services.",
    "Finally, look at \"take time\" (E). While one might spend time in a bank, it is not a specific action associated with banking operations.",
    "From the analysis, \"make payments\" (D) is the only choice that directly represents an activity typically done at a bank."
