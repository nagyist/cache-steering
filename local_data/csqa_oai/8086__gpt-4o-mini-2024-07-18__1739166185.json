  "steps": [
    "Identify the locations mentioned in the choices where water could potentially be found.",
    "Consider the quality of water that can be found in each location.",
    "A jar typically contains drinkable water, unless it's contaminated.",
    "The moon has no liquid water available for drinking, but it's not a location where one would typically drink water.",
    "On the surface of the Earth, water can be found in various forms (lakes, rivers, etc.), but not all is safe to drink.",
    "Toilets contain wastewater and are not a safe or hygienic source of drinking water.",
    "A bridge is a structure and does not inherently contain water; it also would not be a source for drinking water directly.",
    "Evaluate the most unsafe location to drink water from based on common knowledge about sanitation and safety.",
    "From the analysis, the toilet is clearly the most contaminated and unsuitable for drinking water.",
    "Although drinking from the moon and the toilet both can be considered odd, most people would agree that a toilet is the least desirable option due to hygiene concerns."
