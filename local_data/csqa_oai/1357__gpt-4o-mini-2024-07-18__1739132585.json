  "query": "Question: What is the name of a place where cargo is stored?\n\nChoices:\nA: at sea\nB: ship's hold\nC: aeroplane\nD: airplane\nE: boat",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what cargo refers to. Cargo typically means goods or products that are transported, especially by ship, airplane, or truck.",
    "Next, I need to focus on the term \"place\" where cargo is specifically stored, which means it must be a designated area or compartment.",
    "Looking at the options provided:\n- Option A \"at sea\" refers to a location but does not specify a place where cargo is stored.\n- Option B \"ship's hold\" refers to a specific part of a ship designed for storing cargo.\n- Options C \"aeroplane\" and D \"airplane\" both refer to a type of vehicle but do not indicate a specific location for storage.\n- Option E \"boat\" is similar to a ship but doesn't specify a dedicated storage area for cargo.",
    "From the reasoning above, \"ship's hold\" is the only option that clearly indicates a dedicated storage area for cargo on a vessel.",
    "I will double-check the other options to ensure they don't represent a place where cargo is stored.",
    "Since \"at sea\" does not designate a specific storage location, and the other options do not either, I can confirm that the best answer is indeed \"ship's hold.\""
