  "query": "Question: What does someone feel when they run away from a big animal?\n\nChoices:\nA: stretches\nB: go faster\nC: get away from\nD: frightened\nE: manual",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the scenario of running away from a big animal. This typically implies a situation that involves potential danger or fear.",
    "Next, assess the emotional response one might have when faced with a threat, such as a large animal approaching them. The natural instinct is likely to be fear or anxiety.",
    "Look at the choices provided: A (stretches), B (go faster), C (get away from), D (frightened), E (manual).",
    "Analyze the choices: \n- A (stretches) does not apply to the emotional response typically associated with running away from danger.\n- B (go faster) describes a potential physical action rather than a feeling or emotion.\n- C (get away from) suggests a goal or action but lacks the emotional component.\n- D (frightened) clearly indicates a strong emotional response consistent with facing a potential predator.\n- E (manual) does not relate to the context of running away from an animal.",
    "From the analysis of the emotions linked to the situation, D (frightened) emerges as the most appropriate response when confronted by a big animal.",
    "Thus, after considering the emotional implications and the context, I can confidently determine that being frightened is the primary feeling involved."
