  "query": "Question: The botanist knew the plant was living, what did he observe that led him to know that?\n\nChoices:\nA: interaction\nB: death\nC: respiration\nD: expiration\nE: chlorophyll",
  "steps": [
    "The botanist is assessing the qualities that indicate whether a plant is living.",
    "Living plants display several biological processes that are indicative of life, such as respiration or photosynthesis.",
    "Respiration in plants involves the uptake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide, which are both signs of metabolic activity.",
    "Expiration in more general terms refers to the act of breathing out, which is less specific to plant life.",
    "Chlorophyll is a pigment necessary for photosynthesis but itself does not serve as an indicator that the plant is alive; rather, it indicates the potential for photosynthesis.",
    "Interaction is too vague and can refer to many things, not specifically indicating the vitality of the plant.",
    "The most definitive process that directly signifies that a plant is living is respiration, as it accounts for essential life processes.",
    "Therefore, the botanist observed a sign of respiration, which confirmed the plant's living status."
