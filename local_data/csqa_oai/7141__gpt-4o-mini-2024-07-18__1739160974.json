  "query": "Question: The bull was old, but it still had enough energy to have a lot of sex.  It wasn't what?\n\nChoices:\nA: charge rider\nB: bullbleep\nC: female\nD: cow\nE: feeble",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about a bull that is old yet still energetic enough for mating. The wording implies a contradiction or unexpected situation.",
    "We analyze each choice to find what it means in context with the description of the bull.",
    "Choice A, \"charge rider,\" does not directly relate to the bull's ability to mate. It's about aggression towards riders and is not a suitable fit.",
    "Choice B, \"bullbleep,\" is not a standard term and seems irrelevant in understanding the bull's condition or behavior regarding mating.",
    "Choice C, \"female,\" cannot apply since the bull, by definition, is a male animal. Thus, it wouldn't fit into the context of the statement.",
    "Choice D, \"cow,\" refers to a female bovine and is not relevant to what the bull is, since a bull cannot be a cow.",
    "Choice E, \"feeble,\" means weak or lacking in strength. The statement highlights that the bull is not feeble, as it still has plenty of energy for mating.",
    "Amongst the options, \"feeble\" is the direct opposite of the bull's described energy level.",
    "All other options either do not relate directly to the characteristics of the bull or are incorrect definitions, leaving \"feeble\" as the only clear fitting option."
