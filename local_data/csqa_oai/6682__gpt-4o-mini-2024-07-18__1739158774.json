  "query": "Question: Where does a group of beaver build a dam?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: river or stream\nC: kentucky\nD: desert\nE: montana",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the natural habitat where beavers typically build their dams.",
    "Beavers are semi-aquatic mammals that thrive in near-water environments.",
    "They require a consistent water source, such as rivers or streams, to successfully build dams and create ponds for their habitat.",
    "Looking at the options provided, Canada is known for its vast areas of rivers and streams, making it a suitable place for beavers.",
    "Kentucky, while it has water sources, is a specific state and may not be the primary habitat when compared to broader areas like Canada.",
    "Deserts are not suitable for beavers since they lack the necessary water sources.",
    "Montana also has rivers and streams, which could potentially accommodate beavers building dams.",
    "However, of all the listed options, a river or stream is the most specific and fundamental location for beaver dam construction.",
    "Thus, the best fit for where a group of beavers builds a dam is clearly a river or stream."
