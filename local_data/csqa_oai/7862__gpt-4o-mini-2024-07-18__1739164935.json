  "query": "Question: Some people are morning people, others don't get going until after lunch in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: night time\nB: dusk\nC: nighttime\nD: afternoon\nE: morning",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that some people are morning people, indicating that they are active and functioning well in the morning.",
    "It then mentions that others don\u2019t get going until after lunch. This implies that these individuals are not productive or awake until later in the day.",
    "If these individuals are only active after lunch, it suggests that they are not morning persons and instead are more active in the later part of the day.",
    "After lunch generally refers to the time after midday, which typically leads into the afternoon.",
    "The possible options given are A: night time, B: dusk, C: nighttime, D: afternoon, E: morning.",
    "Considering that lunch usually leads into the afternoon, the individuals described would likely not be categorized as morning people.",
    "Since the context of the question is about people who wake up or become active after lunch, the most suitable term for their activity period would be \"afternoon.\"",
    "While \"nighttime\" (C) or \"night time\" (A) might also fit for people who are not morning people, they do not specifically relate to the time frame mentioned in the question.",
    "Therefore, since the question indicates a transition from lunch, the best answer that logically corresponds to when these non-morning individuals become active is \"afternoon.\""
