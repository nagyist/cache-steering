  "query": "Question: what happens when a train leaves the station?\n\nChoices:\nA: accelerate\nB: open doors\nC: arrive late\nD: decelerate\nE: brake",
  "steps": [
    "When a train leaves the station, it typically begins to move away from the platform where it was stationary.",
    "In order to leave the station, the train must start moving forward, which implies it needs to increase its speed.",
    "The action of increasing speed when starting to move is known as acceleration.",
    "Opening doors occurs before the train leaves the station, during the boarding process, not after it starts moving.",
    "Arriving late refers to a situation after the train has already departed; it does not happen at the moment of leaving.",
    "Deceleration typically occurs when a train is slowing down or coming to a stop, so it does not apply when the train is just leaving.",
    "Braking is the process of slowing down or stopping, which would not be relevant when a train is initiating its departure.",
    "Based on the actions involved when a train leaves the station, the only correct option is the one that describes the increase in speed."
