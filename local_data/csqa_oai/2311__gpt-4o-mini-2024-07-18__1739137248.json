    "The question asks what attending a lecture given by an expert will lead to.",
    "Lectures by experts typically provide valuable information on a specific topic.",
    "One of the primary purposes of such lectures is to educate the audience or share knowledge.",
    "We need to evaluate the answer choices in relation to the benefits of attending such a lecture.",
    "Choice A, \"inspiration,\" is a possible effect but is not guaranteed for everyone.",
    "Choice B, \"drowsiness,\" may occur if the lecture is not engaging, but that is not the primary aim of attending.",
    "Choice C, \"getting bored,\" is unlikely if the lecture is informative.",
    "Choice D, \"gain knowledge,\" indicates a direct benefit from attending the lecture, but the wording is not fully aligned with common phrasing.",
    "Choice E, \"gaining knowledge,\" uses the continuous form and implies the process of acquiring knowledge, which aligns well with attending a lecture.",
    "Both D and E relate to knowledge acquisition, but E is more grammatically suitable and reflects the ongoing nature of learning."
