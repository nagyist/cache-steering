  "query": "Question: Where might groceries go when you take them home and put them in a room that isn't the main cooking room?\n\nChoices:\nA: trunk\nB: supermarket\nC: shelf\nD: sink\nE: pantry",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what happens to groceries once they are brought home.",
    "Typically, groceries are placed somewhere for storage or easy access when cooking.",
    "The main cooking room, often referred to as the kitchen, is where food is usually prepared.",
    "Since the question specifies a room that isn't the main cooking room, we consider other common storage areas in a home.",
    "One logical option for storing groceries outside of the kitchen is a pantry, which is specifically designed for food storage.",
    "Other choices like a shelf could be part of the pantry, but it does not emphasize the food storage aspect as directly.",
    "A trunk is unrelated to food storage; it usually refers to a car or a storage box.",
    "A supermarket is where groceries are purchased, not where they are stored at home.",
    "A sink is generally used for washing items and is not a storage place for groceries.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the most suitable place for groceries in a room that isn't the main cooking area is indeed a pantry."
