  "query": "Question: If a lawyer had to explain committing perjury, they might explain it as simply telling what?\n\nChoices:\nA: guilt\nB: testify\nC: commit crime\nD: joining a jury\nE: lies",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a simple explanation of committing perjury given by a lawyer.",
    "Perjury involves making false statements while under oath, which is a legal term for lying in a formal setting.",
    "I will analyze the choices to see which one directly relates to the act of telling falsehoods.",
    "Choice A: \"guilt\" does not describe the act of telling, and it refers to a state of being rather than an action.",
    "Choice B: \"testify\" refers to the act of giving evidence or a statement under oath, but it does not directly define the act of falsehood.",
    "Choice C: \"commit crime\" is too broad and does not specify the action of lying.",
    "Choice D: \"joining a jury\" is unrelated to the act of perjury or telling.",
    "Choice E: \"lies\" directly represents the act of making false statements, which is the essence of perjury.",
    "Based on this analysis, the choice that best encapsulates the definition of perjury in terms of telling is E."
