  "query": "Question: You can find a clothing store often at what outdoor collection of merchants?\n\nChoices:\nA: ohio\nB: buying clothing\nC: park\nD: strip mall\nE: city or town",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what an \"outdoor collection of merchants\" generally refers to. This could imply a shopping area where different vendors or stores are located close together, possibly outdoors.",
    "Next, analyze each of the choices provided to see if they could potentially fit the description of an outdoor collection of merchants.",
    "Choice A, \"ohio,\" refers to a state and does not specify a type of merchant collection.",
    "Choice B, \"buying clothing,\" describes an activity rather than a location or collection of stores.",
    "Choice C, \"park,\" implies a recreational area but does not inherently suggest a collection of merchants. Parks are typically for leisure rather than shopping.",
    "Choice D, \"strip mall,\" specifically refers to a type of shopping center where multiple stores, including clothing stores, can be found. These are often outdoors and contain a variety of merchants.",
    "Choice E, \"city or town,\" would encompass a larger area that might have many different types of collections but is not as specific as a strip mall with outdoor merchants.",
    "From the analysis, \"strip mall\" (Choice D) most accurately describes an outdoor collection of merchants, including clothing stores.",
    "Verify that \"strip mall\" is indeed a prevalent term used to describe shopping venues where different stores, including clothing outlets, are located together."
