  "steps": [
    "We start by understanding the context of the sentence. It mentions that \"he golfed\" and \"she got a spa treatment.\" This indicates that the location allows for both golfing and spa services.",
    "The phrase \"they were glad they became members\" suggests that the location is a membership-based facility. This helps narrow down the options to those that commonly offer memberships.",
    "Let's analyze the choices: \nA: health centre \u2013 generally focused on fitness or medical services, typically doesn't feature golf or spa treatments prominently.\nB: resort \u2013 might offer both golf and spa services, but the phrasing doesn't strongly imply membership.\nC: country club \u2013 is known for having both golf facilities and often includes spa services, along with a membership model.\nD: house \u2013 doesn't logically fit as a place for golfing or a spa treatment.\nE: golf club \u2013 primarily focused on golfing, and while it may offer some amenities, it usually doesn't emphasize spa treatments.",
    "Considering the combination of activities mentioned (golfing and spa treatment), a country club is the most suitable option, as it typically encompasses both activities within its amenities.",
    "The other options either do not fit the activities or do not align well with the concept of membership as strongly as a country club does."
