  "query": "Question: What would happen if a salesman didn't do his job right?\n\nChoices:\nA: promotion\nB: service account\nC: sell products\nD: get fired\nE: work potential customer",
  "steps": [
    "If a salesman doesn't do his job right, it implies that he is not meeting his performance expectations or objectives.",
    "One possible consequence of not performing adequately could be a lack of sales, which leads to poor results for the business.",
    "Without successful sales, the salesman would be unable to sell products effectively.",
    "If sales performance continues to be poor, management could intervene, potentially leading to disciplinary actions.",
    "One of the most common disciplinary actions in such situations is termination of employment, or getting fired.",
    "Additionally, if the salesman is not meeting expectations but still holds his job, he might be reassigned to a less favorable role, but this does not typically lead to a promotion.",
    "Choices like \"service account\" and \"work potential customer\" do not directly address the repercussions of not doing the job right.",
    "Therefore, considering all these factors, the most definitive consequence of a salesman failing to perform his job is being let go, or getting fired."
