  "query": "Question: Many people have a mailbox where near the road?\n\nChoices:\nA: downtown area\nB: front yard\nC: porch\nD: basement\nE: hardware store",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the typical location of a mailbox in relation to people's homes.",
    "Mailboxes are commonly placed in accessible areas for mail delivery, which usually excludes indoor locations.",
    "The options provided include both residential and commercial locations, but we need to focus on where a mailbox would normally be found at a residence.",
    "Option A, \"downtown area,\" is a general locale and doesn't specifically indicate a mailbox placement.",
    "Option D, \"basement,\" is an indoor space and not a common spot for mailboxes, as it is not easily accessible for mail deliveries.",
    "Option E, \"hardware store,\" is a commercial location and not associated with individual mailboxes for residences.",
    "Option C, \"porch,\" is a potential placement for some mailboxes, however, it\u2019s not as common as being directly near the road.",
    "The most typical spot for a mailbox is right by the road in the front yard of a home to ensure convenience for mail carriers.",
    "Given this reasoning, option B, \"front yard,\" stands out as the most appropriate answer since it directly indicates a place near the road."
