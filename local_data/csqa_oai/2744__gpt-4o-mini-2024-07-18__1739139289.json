  "query": "Question: If you have some excess corn, where would you put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: silo\nB: storage building\nC: restaurant\nD: pennsylvania\nE: supermarket",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question. The mention of \"excess corn\" suggests a need for a place to store agricultural produce.",
    "Consider the function of a silo. Silos are specifically designed for storing grain and fodder, making them a common choice for corn storage.",
    "Assess the storage building option. A storage building could also serve the purpose of keeping excess corn, but it is less specialized than a silo.",
    "Evaluate the restaurant option. A restaurant would not be suitable for storing excess corn; it is intended for food preparation and service rather than long-term storage.",
    "Examine Pennsylvania as a choice. While it is a location where corn may be grown, it does not directly answer the question about where to store excess corn.",
    "Consider the supermarket option. Supermarkets do sell corn but are not designed for the storage of agricultural excess; they focus on retail rather than storage.",
    "Compare the first two options (silo and storage building). The silo is more appropriate and specialized for grain storage, particularly corn.",
    "Conclude that out of all the options, the silo is the most logical place to put excess corn."
