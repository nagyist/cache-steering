  "query": "Question: Part of child development is when he/she stops imitating and following and begins to do what on their own?\n\nChoices:\nA: grow up\nB: form opinions\nC: become adult\nD: set table\nE: gather flowers",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about a specific stage in child development when a child moves away from imitation and begins to act independently.",
    "Imitating is characteristic of younger children, who often learn by copying adults and peers.",
    "As children develop, they start to express their own thoughts and ideas, which could indicate a formation of opinions.",
    "The options provided include actions and milestones that can be associated with independence during development.",
    "\"Grow up\" (A) is a vague term and does not specifically refer to the developmental change described in the question.",
    "\"Set table\" (D) and \"gather flowers\" (E) are specific actions but do not encapsulate the broader idea of independent thinking or decision-making in context of development.",
    "\"Form opinions\" (B) implies that the child begins to think individually and critically, moving beyond mere imitation.",
    "\"Become adult\" (C) is also a vague phrase; though adulthood encompasses independence, it does not reflect the transitional stage being described.",
    "Focusing on the transition from imitation to autonomy, forming opinions (B) seems to be the best fit as it directly relates to independent thinking.",
    "Thus, the change from imitation to something self-directed is most closely associated with the ability to form one\u2019s own opinions."
