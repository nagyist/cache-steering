  "query": "Question: Where can you get on a highway in San Diego, Omaha, and Atlanta?\n\nChoices:\nA: repairs\nB: desert\nC: atlas\nD: united states\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what the question is asking. It refers to a common element found in San Diego, Omaha, and Atlanta related to getting on a highway.",
    "Next, let's analyze the options given. They include \"repairs,\" \"desert,\" \"atlas,\" \"united states,\" and \"countryside.\"",
    "Option A: \"repairs\" doesn't have a direct connection to getting on a highway in these cities.",
    "Option B: \"desert\" is irrelevant to highways and does not apply to all three locations.",
    "Option C: \"atlas\" can refer to a map that includes highways. However, it may not be universally used in all contexts of getting on a highway.",
    "Option D: \"united states\" refers to the country where all these cities are located, and it is logical that highways exist within it.",
    "Option E: \"countryside\" typically refers to rural areas, which might not be relevant when discussing getting on a highway in major cities.",
    "Considering all options, \"united states\" is the strongest candidate since highways in San Diego, Omaha, and Atlanta are all part of the highway system in the United States.",
    "To confirm, each city is indeed within the boundaries of the U.S., and all have access to highways as part of the national transportation framework."
