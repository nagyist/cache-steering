  "steps": [
    "The question refers to someone performing a role in a job, which suggests an element of showmanship or presentation.",
    "The keyword \"tiring\" implies that the person may need to muster energy to present themselves well, regardless of their true feelings.",
    "The phrase \"put on a big\" suggests that the individual must adopt a certain demeanor or display something outwardly.",
    "Among the choices, \"smile\" (B) is a common response to offer positive energy and friendliness in sales, enhancing customer interaction.",
    "While \"persona\" (A) and \"act\" (D) could fit, they do not connote the same warmth or friendliness that a smile does, especially in a sales context.",
    "\"laugh\" (C) generally involves an emotional response and may not be consistently required in a sales environment.",
    "\"singing\" (E) does not directly relate to the duties of a sales job, as it's not typically a required behavior for effective selling.",
    "Based on this analysis, the best answer that fits the context of sales and the requirement to maintain an outwardly positive presence is \"smile.\""
