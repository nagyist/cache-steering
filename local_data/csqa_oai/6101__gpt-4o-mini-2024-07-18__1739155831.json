  "steps": [
    "To determine the safest place to keep a marmot, we first need to consider the natural environment and needs of a marmot. Marmots are wild rodents that usually thrive in natural habitats.",
    "Next, we look at the protection a marmot requires. Keeping a marmot in a secure enclosure is crucial to ensure its safety from predators and environmental hazards.",
    "Now we evaluate the options provided. Keeping a marmot at home (A) might pose risks due to potential escapes or insufficient space, making this less safe.",
    "Looking at Vancouver Island (B), while it could offer a natural habitat, there are still external threats from predators and human activities, making it not the safest option for a domestically kept marmot.",
    "The option of a cage (C) considers an enclosed space specifically designed to protect pets or animals. This provides the best safety to keep them secure.",
    "Examining the United States (D) and North America (E) as choices suggests larger areas with varying environments, which could expose the marmot to risks like traffic, predators, and lack of controlled conditions.",
    "Given that the essential factor in ensuring the marmot's safety is having a secure space, the cage option stands out as the clear and most secure method to keep a marmot safe."
