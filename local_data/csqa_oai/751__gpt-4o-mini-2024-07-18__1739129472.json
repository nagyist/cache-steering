  "query": "Question: Where should an excavation never take place?\n\nChoices:\nA: construction site\nB: cemetary\nC: building\nD: city\nE: archeological site",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the nature of each choice and where an excavation might typically be considered inappropriate.",
    "Option A, \"construction site,\" often involves excavations for foundations, so it's generally not a site where excavation is prohibited.",
    "Option B, \"cemetery,\" is a sensitive location. Excavating here can disturb the resting places of the deceased, which is generally considered disrespectful and often prohibited by law.",
    "Option C, \"building,\" does not inherently suggest an inappropriate site for excavation. Excavation may take place for repair or construction purposes.",
    "Option D, \"city,\" is broad. While excavation can occur here for infrastructure purposes, certain areas may prohibit unlicensed excavation.",
    "Option E, \"archeological site,\" indicates that excavation may also occur here, but it is often regulated and requires permits to ensure the protection of historical artifacts.",
    "Based on these considerations, I note that while excavation can occur in some capacity in most locations, cemeteries have specific cultural and legal protections against being excavated.",
    "Thus, I conclude that \"cemetery\" is the location where excavation should never take place, as it disrespects the deceased and their resting places."
