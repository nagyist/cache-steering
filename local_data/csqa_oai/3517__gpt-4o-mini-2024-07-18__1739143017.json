  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the location of the Milky Way.",
    "The Milky Way is a galaxy, and galaxies are large systems that contain stars, planets, gas, dust, and dark matter.",
    "Considering the provided choices, we need to identify which options might refer to a location for the Milky Way.",
    "Option A: fog does not logically relate to the location of the Milky Way as it is a weather phenomenon.",
    "Option B: candy bar shelf is irrelevant because it pertains to a specific location in a store, not a cosmic object.",
    "Option C: stars could be related since the Milky Way is composed of billions of stars, but it's not the best descriptor for its location.",
    "Option D: space is the most precise answer since the Milky Way exists in outer space, which is where galaxies are found.",
    "Option E: refrigerator is completely unrelated as it's a household appliance and has no connection to the cosmos.",
    "Now comparing the relevant options, D (space) is a better option than C (stars) since it encompasses the entire location of the Milky Way."
