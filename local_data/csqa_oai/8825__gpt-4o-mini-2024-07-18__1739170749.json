  "query": "Question: What can a horse winning many races hope to achieve?\n\nChoices:\nA: painting\nB: triple crown\nC: apples\nD: race track\nE: kentucky derby",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to consider what achievements are typically associated with horses that perform well in racing.",
    "Horses that win many races are often celebrated and could aim for prestigious titles or awards in the racing world.",
    "A \"Triple Crown\" refers to three specific major horse races that a horse can win, which is a significant accomplishment in the equestrian sport.",
    "Other options such as \"apples,\" \"painting,\" and \"race track\" do not directly relate to accomplishments in horse racing.",
    "The \"Kentucky Derby\" is one of the major events a horse might win, but it is just one race and not an overarching achievement like the Triple Crown.",
    "Thus, while the Kentucky Derby is notable, the Triple Crown represents a higher level of achievement for a horse.",
    "Now, I can eliminate options based on what is most relevant to a horse's success in racing.",
    "Given the choices, the best option representing a culmination of success for a racehorse is the \"Triple Crown.\""
