  "query": "Question: Working in the vegetable garden everyday is good for you, you get to spend time where?\n\nChoices:\nA: backyard\nB: outside\nC: amusement park\nD: eating\nE: back yard",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you get to spend time while working in a vegetable garden every day.",
    "A vegetable garden is typically found outdoors, so the environment in which one would be spending time is likely to be outside.",
    "The answer choices include \"outside\" (B) and variations of \"backyard\" (A and E).",
    "A backyard is a specific type of outdoor area, but working in a vegetable garden generally implies more of an open outdoor space rather than a confined backyard.",
    "The amusement park (C) and eating (D) do not make sense in the context of spending time while working in a vegetable garden.",
    "Given that the question focuses on the activity of working in a vegetable garden and its outdoor aspect, \"outside\" (B) is the most direct answer.",
    "I can eliminate A, C, D, and E since the focus is on the essential nature of working in the garden rather than a specific type of yard.",
    "The remaining best-fit answer is B as it broadly captures the essence of where the activity takes place."
