  "query": "Question: Where could you find a library that people of any age can visit?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: school\nC: college\nD: inside\nE: downtown",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a library is and where it is typically located. A library is a place where books and other resources are made available for people to read and study.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option to see which places can typically accommodate the public, specifically people of any age.",
    "Option A, \"house,\" is not a public place and libraries are not found in personal residences.",
    "Option B, \"school,\" may have a library, but access to school libraries can be restricted to students of that school, thus not open to the general public of all ages.",
    "Option C, \"college,\" generally has libraries, but these are often restricted to students and faculty of that institution.",
    "Option D, \"inside,\" is too vague and does not specify a particular location where a public library would be found.",
    "Now, I will analyze option E, \"downtown.\" Public libraries are often located in downtown areas and are typically open to people of all ages, providing access to resources for the entire community.",
    "Based on my analysis, the best option where people of any age can visit a library is option E, \"downtown.\""
