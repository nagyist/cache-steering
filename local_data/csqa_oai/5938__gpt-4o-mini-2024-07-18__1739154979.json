  "query": "Question: Where would you bring a tote bag with papers in it?\n\nChoices:\nA: shopping cart\nB: the garage\nC: house\nD: school\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the purpose of bringing a tote bag with papers. Tote bags are typically used for carrying items, so I must think about where those items might be taken.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices offered. A shopping cart is meant for carrying groceries or larger items from a store, not typically used for a tote bag with papers.",
    "The garage usually contains tools, vehicles, and other storage items, which doesn't directly relate to carrying a tote bag with papers.",
    "The house is a general area, but it doesn't specify a particular reason to bring a tote bag with papers there, unless for organization or storage.",
    "School is a common place for carrying papers, such as assignments or notes, making it a plausible destination for a tote bag containing papers.",
    "The closet is generally a space for storage and not a location where one would bring a tote bag with papers, as one would not typically carry it there for an active purpose.",
    "Considering all points, the most reasonable and relevant choice for bringing a tote bag filled with papers would be school, where papers are often needed."
