  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question which is asking for a location where a person waits for food in reception.",
    "I will consider each of the choices provided and their relevance to the question.",
    "Choice A: \"restaurant\" is a common place where a person can wait for food. It directly relates to the act of dining and receptions for meals.",
    "Choice B: \"restorand\" seems to be a misspelling of \"restaurant\" and thus would not apply.",
    "Choice C: \"church basement\" typically would not be a place where food is served unless it\u2019s a special occasion. This offer does not fit the question for a regular reception.",
    "Choice D: \"feel relaxed\" describes a state or feeling, not a location. This does not fit the context of the question.",
    "Choice E: \"wedding party\" could imply waiting for food, but it is not a location in itself, so it is less directly relevant compared to a specific place like a restaurant.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the most suitable answer is clearly the restaurant, as it is commonly associated with waiting for food."
