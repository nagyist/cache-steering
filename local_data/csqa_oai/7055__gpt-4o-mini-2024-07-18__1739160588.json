  "query": "Question: If I have to pass through a ticket booth to see a concert, where is the concert?\n\nChoices:\nA: venue\nB: amusement park\nC: fairgrounds\nD: toll plaza\nE: auditorium",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a ticket booth, which is typically associated with events that require admission.",
    "Concerts are organized events held at specific locations where attendees need to purchase tickets to enter.",
    "The options given include places that are commonly associated with ticket booths: venue, amusement park, fairgrounds, toll plaza, and auditorium.",
    "A 'venue' is a general term that refers to a location where events are held, including concerts.",
    "An 'auditorium' is a specific type of venue often used for performances, including music concerts.",
    "An 'amusement park' typically has ticket booths but for rides and attractions rather than concerts.",
    "'Fairgrounds' can host events like fairs and concerts, but it is less specific than a venue or auditorium for a concert setting.",
    "A 'toll plaza' is not relevant in the context of a concert as it is more associated with road usage and not event admission.",
    "Given that both 'venue' and 'auditorium' are suitable for concerts, but 'auditorium' is more specific, we should consider it closely.",
    "However, since a concert can occur in various types of venues, the answer would still generally encompass the broader category of a venue."
