  "query": "Question: What does someone feel when they lose playing soccer?\n\nChoices:\nA: sweating\nB: work out\nC: excitement\nD: anger\nE: getting tired",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that losing a game can elicit a range of emotional responses. It's important to focus on how someone might feel specifically after a loss in sports.",
    "Next, eliminate options that do not directly relate to emotional states. For instance, \"sweating\" (A) and \"work out\" (B) are physical expressions rather than feelings.",
    "Now, evaluate the remaining options: \"excitement\" (C), \"anger\" (D), and \"getting tired\" (E).",
    "\"Excitement\" (C) is generally associated with positive experiences or competition, making it less likely to be a primary emotion after a loss.",
    "On the other hand, \"anger\" (D) is a more common response to losing, as it can stem from frustration with the game's outcome, personal performance, or perceived unfairness.",
    "\"Getting tired\" (E) is again a physical state rather than an emotional response, which helps narrow down the options further.",
    "After weighing these emotions, \"anger\" (D) stands out as a stronger likely emotional response following a loss in soccer, while the other options do not directly capture the emotional impact of losing a game.",
    "Finally, double-check if \"anger\" aligns with common experiences of players after losing. It is often noted in sports culture that frustration or anger manifests after a disappointing game."
