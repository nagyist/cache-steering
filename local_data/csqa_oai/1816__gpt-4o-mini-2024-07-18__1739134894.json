  "query": "Question: Where does blood travel in a person?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospital\nB: soccer game\nC: capillaries\nD: tubes\nE: animals",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine where blood is circulated in the body.",
    "Blood is circulated through a system of vessels, which include arteries, veins, and capillaries.",
    "Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins bring blood back to the heart.",
    "Capillaries are the small blood vessels where the exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes occurs.",
    "Given the options available, \"hospital,\" \"soccer game,\" \"animals,\" and \"tubes\" do not directly refer to the system blood travels through.",
    "\"Tubes\" could refer to blood vessels, but it is a very generic term and doesn't specify the type of vessels.",
    "The specific location where blood is actively traveling and exchanging materials is in the capillaries.",
    "Thus, among the provided choices, \"capillaries\" is the most accurate answer."
