  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a person is likely to go to buy a radio.",
    "Option A mentions \"station,\" which could refer to a radio station. However, radio stations do not sell radios; they broadcast programs.",
    "Option B states \"every car and house.\" While radios may be found in cars and houses, this does not imply that one can go to these places to purchase a radio.",
    "Option C states \"shop.\" This option is appropriate since stores generally sell radios and where one would go to specifically purchase one.",
    "Option D mentions \"bedroom.\" While some people may have radios in their bedrooms, it is not a place for buying a radio.",
    "Option E states \"space shuttle.\" This is highly impractical and unrelated to acquiring a radio, as space shuttles do not sell radios nor is it a common shopping venue.",
    "Based on the reasoning, Option C is the only logical choice where one would likely go to buy a radio."
