  "steps": [
    "The heater is typically used to provide warmth in an enclosed space, especially during colder seasons like winter and for events such as a Christmas party.",
    "The term \"city's Christmas party\" suggests that the event is organized at a larger venue rather than a private residence.",
    "Given that the heater broke down, the likely place associated with hosting such a party would be a public place that requires heating to accommodate guests comfortably.",
    "Among the options, \"public building\" (choice B) is the only one that fits as a reasonable venue for a city-organized event.",
    "Choices A (automobile), C (house), D (home), and E (train) are either too small or inappropriate for hosting a city's Christmas party at a larger scale.",
    "Since the heater breaking down directly affects the comfort level in a potentially larger venue, it further supports that the location is likely a public building.",
    "There is no logical connection of hosting a Christmas party in an automobile, house, home, or train with the heater being an essential necessity for a sizable gathering.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is that the party could no longer be hosted in a public building."
