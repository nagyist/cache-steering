  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sally took a vacation and needed a break from her hard work, which suggests she engaged in a leisure activity.",
    "Building sand castles is a common and enjoyable activity during vacations at the beach.",
    "The activity of making a sand castle typically involves creating or assembling it from sand.",
    "The choices given are A: faster, B: piece together, C: construct, D: put together, and E: working.",
    "While \"put together\" (D) and \"piece together\" (B) imply a certain assembly aspect, they are less commonly used to describe the process of building something like a sand castle.",
    "\"Construct\" (C) is a more direct and appropriate term to describe the act of building a sand castle, which encompasses not only assembling but also shaping and designing it.",
    "The word \"working\" (E) does not accurately reflect the action of building a sand castle, as it is more general and does not specify the activity.",
    "Considering the context of the question and the associated activity of building a sand castle, \"construct\" is the most fitting choice."
