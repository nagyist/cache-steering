  "query": "Question: If you're relaxing with friends and you agree with one but not the other, what have you done?\n\nChoices:\nA: keep secrets\nB: side with\nC: hang out\nD: lying\nE: talking about",
  "steps": [
    "The situation describes being with friends and having differing opinions with one of them while agreeing with another. This suggests a social interaction where opinions are shared.",
    "The act of agreeing with one friend and disagreeing with another indicates some form of alignment or support towards the viewpoint of the friend you agree with.",
    "Option A, \"keep secrets,\" does not apply here as the scenario does not involve withholding information.",
    "Option B, \"side with,\" is relevant because siding with one friend implies support and agreement, which is exactly what has happened.",
    "Option C, \"hang out,\" might describe the general activity, but it does not capture the specific action of agreeing with one friend over another.",
    "Option D, \"lying,\" is not applicable as there is no suggestion of deception in the scenario.",
    "Option E, \"talking about,\" is too vague and does not specifically address the situation of agreement and disagreement among friends.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, siding with one friend indicates a clear action taken in the context of being with friends and having differing opinions."
