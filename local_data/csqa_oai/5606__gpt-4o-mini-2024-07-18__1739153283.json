  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a situation that could temporarily prevent attendance at school.",
    "We need to analyze each choice in terms of its potential to cause a temporary absence from school.",
    "Option A, \"catch cold,\" suggests an illness that could indeed temporarily prevent someone from attending school due to symptoms like fever, cough, and fatigue.",
    "Option B, \"catching a movie,\" typically refers to watching a film and is not a reason for missing school; rather, it is an activity one might do after school or during free time.",
    "Option C, \"dropping out,\" implies a permanent decision to leave school rather than a temporary absence.",
    "Option D, \"employability,\" does not represent a reason for missing school; it refers to the ability to find work and is not directly related to school attendance.",
    "Option E, \"boredom,\" while it could make a student reluctant to go to school, does not provide a concrete reason for a temporary absence. Typically, it would not result in missing school altogether.",
    "Considering all options, the only choice that represents a condition that can legitimately cause a temporary absence from school is \"catch cold.\""
