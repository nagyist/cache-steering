  "steps": [
    "The question mentions black and white balls being kicked with feet, which suggests a sport that involves kicking.",
    "Among the choices provided, we need to identify which sporting events or games commonly involve kicking a ball. Soccer is widely known for using a spherical ball that is often black and white.",
    "Baseball involves a ball, but it is not a game where players kick the ball. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.",
    "A \"sporting event\" could refer to a variety of games, but it is too vague and does not specifically relate to kicking.",
    "\"Gym\" suggests a location for physical activities but does not directly denote a game where balls are kicked.",
    "A \"toy store\" is unrelated to the activities mentioned in the question, as it does not involve playing with balls in a game context.",
    "In soccer, players commonly kick a black and white ball, fitting the description provided in the question.",
    "Since \"soccer game\" specifically identifies a sport where players use their feet to kick a ball, this should be the correct answer.",
    "The other options do not meet the criteria set by the question regarding kicking a ball, thus further supporting that the answer must be related to soccer."
