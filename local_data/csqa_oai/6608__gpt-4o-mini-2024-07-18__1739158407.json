  "query": "Question: Where could you find a laundry room that is only used by a few people?\n\nChoices:\nA: hospital\nB: basement of apartment building\nC: college\nD: house\nE: hotel",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the primary context of each choice. A laundry room that is used by a few people suggests a space that is not heavily trafficked.",
    "A hospital typically caters to many people (patients, staff, visitors) and would likely have a laundry facility servicing lots of laundry, so it's unlikely to be the correct choice.",
    "A college might have shared laundry facilities, but these are often used by a large number of students, making it less likely to be used by only a few people.",
    "An individual house would typically have a laundry room used by the household members, which can be few, making this option quite plausible.",
    "A hotel would likely have a laundry facility for guests and staff, but this could also be quite busy, hence not fitting the criteria of being used by only a few.",
    "The basement of an apartment building may have a laundry room that is shared by a limited number of residents, which could fit the criteria of being less frequented compared to other options.",
    "I will compare the likelihood of usage: \n- Hospital: high usage\n- College: high to moderate usage\n- House: low usage (few family members)\n- Hotel: moderate to high usage\n- Basement of apartment: potentially low usage, depending on the number of tenants.",
    "Both a house and the basement of an apartment building meet the criteria of being used by a few people, but the house specifically implies it's a limited few (the family living there).",
    "Now I must make a final decision between these two: a house seems the most definitive choice for a laundry room used only by very few individuals regularly."
