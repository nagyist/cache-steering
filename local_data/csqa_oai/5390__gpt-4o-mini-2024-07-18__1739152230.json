    "The question asks for a positive action that can be taken with used glass. We need to consider the context of the options provided.",
    "Option A, \"shattered,\" implies that the glass is broken into pieces without any further purpose, which is not a constructive action.",
    "Option C, \"shatter,\" is similar to option A as it suggests breaking the glass but does not suggest a beneficial or positive outcome.",
    "Option D, \"tempered,\" refers to a process of making glass stronger, but it does not pertain to a common action taken with used glass as a whole.",
    "Option E, \"broken,\" is simply describing the state of glass and does not encompass an action that effectively utilizes the used glass.",
    "Option B, \"recycled,\" directly refers to a well-recognized and beneficial practice where used glass is processed to create new materials, reducing waste and conserving resources.",
    "Given that recycling used glass is a widely accepted and encouraged practice, it stands out as the best option among the provided choices.",
