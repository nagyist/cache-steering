  "steps": [
    "The question states that a star has 4 rocky planets and 4 gaseous planets orbiting it. This arrangement fits the characteristics of a planetary system.",
    "Rocky planets are typically smaller and are found closer to their star, while gaseous planets are larger and often found further away.",
    "Considering a star with multiple planets, it is likely part of a solar system, similar to how our Sun has several planets orbiting it.",
    "The choices provided include various unrelated concepts (Hollywood, night sky, aliens), but solar systems are recognized celestial structures.",
    "The notion of a constellation refers to a group of stars rather than planets specifically orbiting a star.",
    "Since the description specifies a star with planets, it reinforces that we are discussing a system rather than a broader concept like a constellation or the night sky.",
    "Amongst the choices, \"solar system\" directly correlates with the description of the star and its orbiting planets.",
    "Thus, analyzing the possible answers provided, only \"solar system\" relates accurately to the scenario described.",
    "The other options do not align with the characteristics mentioned in the question."
