  "query": "Question: Where could you put some olives to prevent them from getting nearby food wet?\n\nChoices:\nA: eaten\nB: glassess\nC: jar\nD: pizza\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find a container that will prevent olives from making nearby food wet.",
    "Olives are often stored in liquids, especially when they are canned or jarred.",
    "If olives are placed in a container that does not seal well, they could leak and make nearby food wet.",
    "I should consider the options provided and analyze how well they can contain olives without leakage.",
    "Option A (eaten) suggests the olives are consumed, which does not pertain to storage.",
    "Option B (glassess) does not seem relevant as it is not a container for olives.",
    "Option C (jar) represents a common storage solution that is typically airtight and can contain olives safely.",
    "Option D (pizza) does not make sense as a storage option for olives.",
    "Option E (refrigerator) is a place for storing food, but does not directly contain olives without a container.",
    "Considering all choices, only a jar is specifically designed for containing olives without causing leakage."
