  "query": "Question: George hated changes to his salary. He wanted his supply  of money to be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: remain stable\nB: stagnant\nC: constant\nD: unpleasant\nE: permanent",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the core sentiment expressed by George towards changes in his salary. He \"hated\" changes, which indicates a strong preference for stability.",
    "Consider what it means for money to be stable in this context. A stable supply of money implies that it does not fluctuate or vary.",
    "Examine the alternatives provided in the choices. \"Stagnant\" may imply no growth or change but can carry a negative connotation in a financial context.",
    "Look at the word \"constant,\" which suggests that his salary should not change and should remain at the same level over time.",
    "Explore the implications of \"unpleasant.\u201d While his feelings are negative, it does not describe the condition he desires for his salary.",
    "Assess \"permanent,\" which indicates that changes should not happen at all. This choice seems similar to \"constant,\" but it implies a more unchangeable state rather than consistency over time.",
    "Compare \"remain stable,\" \"constant,\" \"stagnant,\" and \"permanent\" to see which aligns closely with his aversion to change.",
    "Determine that \"constant\" is the most straightforward term expressing George's desire for his salary to remain unchanged.",
    "Since \"stable\" and \"constant\" are closely related in meaning, evaluate if one might be more specific to salary discussions. \"Constant\" directly addresses the concept of no variation.",
    "Conclude that George prefers a steady and predictable salary, which is best summarized by the term \"constant.\""
