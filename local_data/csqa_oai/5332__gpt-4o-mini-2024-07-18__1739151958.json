  "query": "Question: The cat was annoying because it would not leave James alone.  Whenever he locked himself down for work it would find its way into where?\n\nChoices:\nA: microwave\nB: meat loaf\nC: outside\nD: backyard\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the relationship between the cat's behavior and James's attempts to work. The cat is described as annoying for not leaving him alone, which implies it actively seeks out his presence.",
    "Next, consider the context of James locking himself down for work. This suggests he is in a space where he is trying to focus on tasks, likely a room in the house.",
    "Reflecting on domestic behavior, cats often seek companionship or curiosity leads them to where their owners are, especially in the house.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options to see where the cat is likely to go when James is trying to work.",
    "Option A, \"microwave,\" is implausible since it's not a space where a cat would typically enter.",
    "Option B, \"meat loaf,\" is unrelated as it does not represent a physical space the cat can enter or a place to find James, but rather a food item.",
    "Option C, \"outside,\" is possible but less probable since James is working indoors and the cat wouldn\u2019t naturally leave to find him during that time.",
    "Option D, \"backyard,\" is again outdoors and although a cat might go there, it does not directly align with the activity of James trying to work inside.",
    "Option E, \"bedroom,\" fits perfectly as it is a common location where cats are found when their owners are trying to work. This could also be where James would lock himself away for concentration.",
    "Since option E aligns well with the scenario described (the annoyance of the cat while James is working), it is the most reasonable conclusion."
