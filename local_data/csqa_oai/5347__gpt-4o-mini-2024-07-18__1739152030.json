  "query": "Question: Where am I if I am not eating crab, but rather lobster in the Northern United States?\n\nChoices:\nA: south carolina\nB: new england\nC: a cruise ship.\nD: maine\nE: chesapeake bay",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the person is not eating crab but rather lobster. This suggests that the location is known for lobster rather than crab.",
    "The Northern United States is identified as the general region where this activity is taking place.",
    "Lobster is particularly associated with the New England region, which includes states like Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.",
    "Maine is famous specifically for its lobster due to its coastal waters being rich in the species, and it is often recognized as a prime place for lobster in the Northern U.S.",
    "The other options include South Carolina, which is more associated with crab rather than lobster.",
    "A cruise ship may offer a variety of foods, but it does not specifically indicate a location in the Northern United States where lobster is notably sourced.",
    "Chesapeake Bay is also well-known for crabs, particularly blue crabs, and while some lobsters might be caught there, it is not primarily recognized for lobster in comparison to New England.",
    "Among the options provided, New England is the broad region associated with lobster consumption, but it includes multiple states, so it would not be a definitive location.",
    "Considering all of this reasoning, the best answer based on the specific association with lobster in the Northern United States would be Maine, as it is the most recognized state for lobster."
