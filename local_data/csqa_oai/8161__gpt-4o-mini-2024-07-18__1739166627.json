  "query": "Question: What can an injury happen to?\n\nChoices:\nA: emergency room\nB: doctor's office\nC: living thing\nD: bones\nE: accident",
  "steps": [
    "We start by analyzing the question, which asks what can an injury happen to. This implies we are looking for something that can sustain an injury.",
    "Option A is \"emergency room\". An emergency room is a place where injuries are treated, but it cannot sustain an injury itself.",
    "Option B is \"doctor's office\". Similar to the emergency room, a doctor's office is a location for treatment, not something that can be injured.",
    "Option C is \"living thing\". Living things (humans, animals, etc.) can definitely sustain injuries, making this option a strong candidate.",
    "Option D is \"bones\". Bones are parts of living organisms and can be injured (such as fractures), but they are not living entities themselves.",
    "Option E is \"accident\". An accident is an event that can cause injuries, but it is not a target that receives an injury.",
    "Considering all the options, we find that both C and D directly relate to receiving an injury, but C is more inclusive as it encompasses all living things, while D is specific to a body part.",
    "However, the question asks what can an injury happen to, and \"living thing\" directly answers that more broadly than \"bones\".",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the reasoning is option C."
