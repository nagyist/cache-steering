    "The question is asking about the effect of meeting interesting people on a contacts list.",
    "When one meets interesting people, it is common to exchange contact information.",
    "Exchanging contact information increases the number of contacts in one's contacts list.",
    "The word \"grow\" implies an increase in quantity, which is what happens when new contacts are added.",
    "The other choices refer to qualities or actions that do not directly relate to the quantity of contacts.",
    "\"Remember names\" (A) is about recalling information, not increasing the list size.",
    "\"Friendly\" (C) and \"cordial\" (D) describe demeanor but do not imply growth in contacts.",
