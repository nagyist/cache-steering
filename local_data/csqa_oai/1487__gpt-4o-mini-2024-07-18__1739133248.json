  "query": "Question: Billy liked going to the party.  He enjoyed mixing.  He liked to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: plan\nB: meet new people\nC: getting drunk\nD: have fun\nE: the watusi",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that Billy liked going to the party and enjoyed mixing, indicating he had social interactions and was likely engaging with others.",
    "The phrase \"enjoyed mixing\" suggests he found pleasure in socializing, which often involves meeting new people.",
    "Let's evaluate the choices:\n- A (plan): Planning a party may not necessarily relate to enjoying attending one.\n- B (meet new people): This aligns directly with the idea of mixing and socializing at the party.\n- C (getting drunk): Although some partygoers may enjoy drinking, it is not a direct connection to mixing or socializing.\n- D (have fun): This is a general statement but less specific than meeting new people in this context.\n- E (the watusi): This refers to a dance, which may not directly relate to his enjoyment of mixing.",
    "Choice B (meet new people) is the most relevant to Billy's enjoyment of mixing at the party.",
    "Since we are specifically looking for what Billy liked to do at the party, meeting new people fits perfectly within that context."
