  "query": "Question: The wind was heading one way, and then headed another way, what happened?\n\nChoices:\nA: change direction\nB: wave wheat\nC: wind gust\nD: dry hair\nE: blowing hard",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a scenario where the wind initially has one direction and then changes to another direction.",
    "This suggests that there has been some alteration in the wind's movement, indicating a shift from one vector to another.",
    "The term \"change direction\" directly relates to how a wind can shift its course or orientation.",
    "The other options such as \"wave wheat,\" \"wind gust,\" \"dry hair,\" and \"blowing hard\" do not precisely capture the essence of the wind changing directions.",
    "\"Wave wheat\" refers to the effect of wind on crops but does not specify a direction change.",
    "\"A wind gust\" implies a sudden burst of wind but does not necessarily mean a consistent change in direction over time.",
    "\"Dry hair\" and \"blowing hard\" pertain more to the effects of strong wind rather than the concept of it changing direction.",
    "Given that the focus of the question is specifically on the wind changing direction, the most straightforward interpretation aligns directly with option A.",
    "I have verified that option A: \"change direction\" is the most accurate representation of the event described in the question."
