  "query": "Question: Zeus was one of many men that were this in mythology?\n\nChoices:\nA: boys\nB: females\nC: feminist\nD: lady\nE: gods",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify Zeus's role in mythology. Zeus is primarily known as a god in Greek mythology.",
    "Next, I can consider the term \"many men\" in the context of Zeus. While he was indeed involved with many mortals and creatures, his main identity is as a god.",
    "Looking at the options given, I need to assess which one aligns with Zeus being a prominent figure in mythology.",
    "Choices A (boys), B (females), C (feminist), and D (lady) do not fit as they do not represent Zeus's identity as a god.",
    "Option E (gods) clearly relates to Zeus since he is one of the main gods in Greek mythology, often cited as the king of the gods.",
    "To confirm, Zeus is definitely not identified as a boy, female, or any other term that diminishes his divine status, so E is the most appropriate."
