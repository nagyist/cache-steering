  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"he was a gentle man\" suggests that he had a soft or kind demeanor, which contrasts with the description of his muscles due to working out.",
    "Working out typically leads to increased muscle mass and strength, which often changes the texture or feel of muscles.",
    "Muscles that are developed through intense physical training can often feel tough or solid, which is typically described using words like \"hard\" or \"rough.\"",
    "The options available are: harsh, fur, rough, hard, and mean. \"Harsh\" and \"mean\" do not directly relate to the texture or feel of muscles.",
    "\"Fur\" is irrelevant in the context of describing human muscles, as it refers to animal coverings.",
    "Between \"rough\" and \"hard,\" both could describe muscles, but they have slightly different implications\u2014the word \"hard\" often directly describes the firmness of the muscle, while \"rough\" could imply a more rugged texture which is less common terminology for muscles.",
    "Considering the context that he worked out, the most precise description for muscles developed through exercise would likely be \"hard.\"",
    "I will evaluate the alternatives one last time, ensuring I selected the most appropriate word based on common usage and the characteristics of developed muscles.",
    "After considering all the points, the most fitting word that aligns with the idea of muscles from working out is \"hard.\""
