  "steps": [
    "A reception held near a golf course implies a location close to or associated with the golf course facility.",
    "A large room could technically host a reception, but it doesn't specifically indicate the association with a golf course.",
    "A golf cart would not serve as a venue for a reception; it's a transport vehicle.",
    "A lobby may be part of a building associated with the golf course, but it doesn't typically serve as a standalone venue for receptions.",
    "A church basement is unlikely to be near a golf course and is not typically used for golf-related receptions.",
    "A country club is a venue that is commonly found near golf courses and often hosts receptions or similar events.",
    "Given the location and nature of the event, the most logical choice is one that ties directly to both the social aspect of a reception and the setting of a golf course.",
    "Among the options provided, the country club stands out as it has facilities specifically designed for hosting receptions and events.",
    "Thus, the most likely venue for a reception held near a golf course is a country club."
