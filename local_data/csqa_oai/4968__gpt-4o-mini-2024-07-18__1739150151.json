  "query": "Question: Where would you find an anemone off the eastern U.S.?\n\nChoices:\nA: game preserve\nB: intertidal zone\nC: atlantic ocean\nD: south pacific\nE: sea water",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what an anemone is. Anemones are marine animals belonging to the phylum Cnidaria and are typically found in ocean habitats.",
    "Next, we consider where they are commonly located. Anemones tend to inhabit various marine environments, including coral reefs, rocky shores, and sandy bottoms.",
    "Since the question specifies \"off the eastern U.S.,\" we should focus on areas in the Atlantic Ocean, as this is the ocean that borders the eastern United States.",
    "Looking at the choices, option A (game preserve) doesn\u2019t specifically relate to marine habitats where anemones are found.",
    "Option B (intertidal zone) is relevant, as some types of anemones can be found in this region where the ocean meets the land, but it is not comprehensive enough because not all anemones live solely there.",
    "Option C (Atlantic Ocean) is a broader option that includes many habitats where anemones thrive, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Option D (South Pacific) is irrelevant as it does not pertain to the eastern U.S. region.",
    "Finally, option E (sea water) is too vague because while anemones live in sea water, it does not specify a location relevant to the question.",
    "After considering all options, it's clear that anemones would prominently be found in the Atlantic Ocean, which is specifically off the eastern U.S. coastline."
