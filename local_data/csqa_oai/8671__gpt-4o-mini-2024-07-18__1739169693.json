  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the use of a saucepan. A saucepan is a kitchen utensil used for cooking and is typically kept in places related to food preparation or storage.",
    "Next, we can evaluate each of the choices provided. Choice A, \"georgia,\" does not have any relevance to the storage of kitchen items.",
    "Choice B, \"italian restaurant,\" refers more to a place where food is served rather than a personal storage area for a saucepan when not in use.",
    "Choice C, \"pan house,\" sounds like it could be a place for storing pans; however, it's not a commonly recognized term for kitchen storage.",
    "Choice D, \"kitchen cupboard,\" is a very typical location where kitchen utensils, including saucepans, are stored when they are not in use.",
    "Choice E, \"boiling water,\" is irrelevant as it describes a state or process rather than a location for storage.",
    "Upon evaluating all the options, it\u2019s evident that the most logical and common place to keep a saucepan when it's not in use is in the kitchen cupboard."
