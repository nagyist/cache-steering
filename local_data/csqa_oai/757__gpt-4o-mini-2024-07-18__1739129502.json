  "query": "Question: A person is alone in the woods and wounded, what should he do?\n\nChoices:\nA: amount to nothing\nB: visit relatives\nC: charming\nD: doctor himself\nE: cross street",
  "steps": [
    "The person is alone in the woods, which implies they are in a potentially dangerous and remote situation. Their priority should be to seek help for their wound.",
    "Visiting relatives (Choice B) may not be practical or possible if they are far from home and in the woods.",
    "Choice E, crossing a street, is not applicable since they are in the woods and there might not be a street nearby.",
    "The word \u201ccharming\u201d in choice C does not seem relevant or practical in a situation where the person is injured and needs assistance.",
    "The option to \"doctor himself\" (Choice D) suggests trying to treat their own wounds, which could be a poor choice if the injury is severe.",
    "Taking into account the urgency of the situation, the person should prioritize getting medical attention rather than attempting to self-treat.",
    "Thus, since the other options do not effectively address the person's need for assistance, the best option is that they should try to find help or treat themselves but with a plan to seek professional help later.",
    "Ultimately, while choices B, C, and E are impractical, D suggests self-treatment, which is better than doing nothing."
