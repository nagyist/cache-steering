  "query": "Question: Making the cars made a lot of noise, everybody had to wear earplugs at the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: factory\nB: mall\nC: classroom\nD: carnival\nE: big city",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions \"making the cars made a lot of noise,\" which implies a setting where loud noise is prevalent.",
    "The need for earplugs indicates that the environment is likely industrial or one that routinely produces high noise levels.",
    "A factory is a place where manufacturing occurs, typically involving machinery that generates significant noise. This aligns with the need for earplugs.",
    "The other options, such as mall, classroom, carnival, and big city, do not commonly require earplugs due to noise levels.",
    "In a mall, noise exists but is generally tolerable and does not warrant earplugs.",
    "In a classroom, the noise level is typically managed and is not at a level that would require earplugs.",
    "At a carnival, while there may be loud attractions, it is not continuous industrial noise, and earplugs would not generally be necessary.",
    "In a big city, while there is noise, it is inconsistent and varied; again, earplugs are not routinely required.",
    "Based on the understanding of the scenarios, a factory is the most logical place that matches the description of needing earplugs due to significant noise creation."
