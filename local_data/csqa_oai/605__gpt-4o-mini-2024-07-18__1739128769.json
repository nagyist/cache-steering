  "query": "Question: Where would you find a binder containing homework assignments?\n\nChoices:\nA: backpack\nB: bookcase\nC: office supply store\nD: office\nE: class room",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a binder containing homework assignments and where it is commonly used.",
    "A binder is typically used by students to organize their assignments, which implies it's likely found in a location associated with school activities.",
    "Examine each choice:\n- A backpack is often used by students to carry books and supplies, including binders.",
    "- A bookcase is primarily for storing books and is less likely to specifically store a binder of homework assignments.",
    "- An office supply store sells items like binders but wouldn't typically store personal homework assignments.",
    "- An office may have binders, but they wouldn't commonly contain homework assignments from students.",
    "- A classroom is a place where homework assignments are given and kept, making it a potential location for a binder filled with them.",
    "Now, weigh the two strongest candidates: a backpack (common for students to carry binders) and a classroom (where assignments are managed).",
    "In a classroom, it's likely that homework assignments are organized within binders specifically to keep track of them during lessons.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice for finding a binder with homework assignments is within a classroom setting, rather than carried in a backpack or stored elsewhere."
