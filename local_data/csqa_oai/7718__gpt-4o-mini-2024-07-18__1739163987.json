  "query": "Question: Where might someone need a small table?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: demonstration\nC: apartment\nD: corner\nE: furniture store",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the purpose of a small table. It can be used for various activities such as dining, displaying items, or serving as a workspace.",
    "Examine the context of a kitchen. A small table in a kitchen can serve as additional space for meal preparation, dining, or having coffee.",
    "Next, look at the concept of a demonstration. A small table might be used to display products or materials during a presentation, but it is not a common daily need.",
    "Now consider an apartment. Many apartments, which may have limited space, often utilize small tables to maximize usability in living or dining areas.",
    "Next, think about a corner. A small table could fit well in a corner to utilize space efficiently, but it's a less specific need compared to other options.",
    "Finally, consider a furniture store. While a small table can be found in a furniture store, this context is more about sales rather than a typical need for a small table.",
    "Comparing the relevance of each option, the kitchen and apartment are similar in needing small tables for regular use. However, an apartment represents a broader context of small-space living.",
    "Considering the significance, an apartment is likely the most common place where someone would need a small table for everyday use, regardless of the specific activity."
