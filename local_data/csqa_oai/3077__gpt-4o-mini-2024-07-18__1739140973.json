  "query": "Question: A monkey is out in the wild, where are they likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical areas\nB: school\nC: research laboratory\nD: pet store\nE: story book",
  "steps": [
    "Monkeys are primarily known to inhabit environments that provide them with food, shelter, and other resources necessary for their survival.",
    "Looking at the available choices, a \"school\" does not provide a natural environment suitable for a wild monkey to thrive.",
    "A \"research laboratory\" is a controlled, artificial environment that does not align with the natural habitat of wild monkeys.",
    "A \"pet store\" is also an artificial setting where some monkeys might be sold as pets, but they are not found living in the wild there.",
    "A \"story book\" is a fictional setting, which does not correspond to a real habitat. Monkeys are not found in the wild there.",
    "The option \"tropical areas\" refers to the natural habitats of many monkey species, as they are often found in rainforests and similar ecosystems that are warm and humid.",
    "Given that tropical areas are where wild monkeys naturally thrive, this is the most logical choice corresponding to the question.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it's clear that all other choices do not represent the natural habitat of monkeys as effectively as \"tropical areas\" does."
