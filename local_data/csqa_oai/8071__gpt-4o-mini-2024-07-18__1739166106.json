  "query": "Question: The man wanted a new ottoman, so where did he look?\n\nChoices:\nA: basement\nB: furniture store\nC: decoration\nD: parlor\nE: couch outlet",
  "steps": [
    "The man wants a new ottoman, which is a type of furniture.",
    "Typically, people look for furniture in dedicated spaces that sell various types of furniture items.",
    "Looking at the options, a \"furniture store\" is specifically designed to sell furniture, including ottomans.",
    "The \"couch outlet\" may also sell ottomans, but it is more specific to couches and might have a limited selection of other furniture items.",
    "The \"basement\" is unlikely to contain a new ottoman unless he already had one stored there, which contradicts the desire for a new item.",
    "\"Decoration\" is more focused on decorative items rather than functional furniture like an ottoman.",
    "A \"parlor\" is a room in a house and not a place where one typically goes to purchase furniture.",
    "Comparing all options, the most logical place to look for a new ottoman would be the \"furniture store.\"",
    "Based on this reasoning, \"furniture store\" is the best choice compared to the other options."
