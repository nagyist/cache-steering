    "The question states that he excelled at social science. Social science encompasses various fields that study society and human behavior, including geography, history, sociology, psychology, and political science.",
    "Among the given choices, we need to identify which options belong to social science.",
    "The options provided are: A (geography), B (history studies), C (math), D (religion), and E (dancing).",
    "Geography (A) is studied within social sciences as it examines the interactions between people and their environments.",
    "History (B) is also classified under social science, as it investigates human past events and their impacts on societies.",
    "Mathematics (C) does not fall under social sciences; it is considered a formal science that deals primarily with numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns.",
    "Religion (D) can be studied in the context of social sciences, particularly in anthropology and sociology, but it is not as clearly defined within social science fields as geography and history are.",
    "Dancing (E) is more an art form than a subject studied in social sciences; it does not fit into the category of social science disciplines.",
    "Given that his favorite subject was in social science, and considering the options, geography (A) and history studies (B) are the most relevant candidates, but history studies align closely with social sciences as a field of academic focus.",
    "If he excelled in social sciences and his favorite is one of the options provided, the strongest contenders are geography and history studies. Since history studies is explicitly mentioned as a choice, it will likely be seen as a more direct candidate for his favorite subject than geography."
