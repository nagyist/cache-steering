  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to keep a butcher knife?\n\nChoices:\nA: fishing boat\nB: backpack\nC: shelf\nD: pocket\nE: kitchen drawer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary purpose of a butcher knife, which is food preparation, particularly meat cutting.",
    "Next, identify locations that would be convenient and safe for storing a knife meant for food preparation.",
    "A fishing boat may not be ideal as a place to store a butcher knife, as the environment is more focused on fishing activities rather than food prep.",
    "A backpack is also not practical as it may not provide sufficient protection for the knife, and carrying it in a backpack could pose safety risks.",
    "Keeping a butcher knife in a pocket is extremely unsafe and impractical due to the potential for injury and the difficulty of access.",
    "Now consider storage options typically found in a kitchen, as that is where butcher knives are most commonly used.",
    "A shelf could be a possible option, but it may not provide the best safety or protection for the knife when not in use.",
    "On the other hand, a kitchen drawer is specifically designed to safely store utensils like knives.",
    "Moreover, a kitchen drawer allows for easy access while also minimizing the risk of accidentally cutting oneself.",
    "Based on these considerations, the most suitable and safest location to keep a butcher knife is in a kitchen drawer."
