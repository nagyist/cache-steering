  "query": "Question: If you wanted to grow an apple tree, you'd probably start where?\n\nChoices:\nA: washington state\nB: math problem\nC: garden center\nD: coloring book\nE: at the core",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the context of the question, which is about starting the process of growing an apple tree.",
    "I should consider what is necessary to grow a tree, particularly an apple tree, as a living organism.",
    "The question includes various options, some of which are relevant to horticulture and others that are entirely unrelated.",
    "Option A, \"Washington State,\" is known for its apple production, but it isn't a starting point for growing a tree unless you're considering a location.",
    "Option B, \"math problem,\" does not relate to the steps needed to grow a tree.",
    "Option C, \"garden center,\" is a place where one could obtain the necessary supplies, tools, or even the seedling or sapling of an apple tree.",
    "Option D, \"coloring book,\" is unrelated to the actual cultivation of an apple tree.",
    "Option E, \"at the core,\" is ambiguous and doesn't provide a practical step to begin growing an apple tree.",
    "Based on the reasoning above, the most logical starting point for growing an apple tree would be to visit a garden center to obtain the tree or supplies."
