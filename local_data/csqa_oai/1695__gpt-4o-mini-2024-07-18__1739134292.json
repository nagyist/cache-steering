  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"they were both happy with their membership\" suggests that the location is a place where both activities (golf and tennis) can be enjoyed.",
    "Golf and tennis are typically associated with recreational or sports facilities that offer both activities. This narrows down the possible options.",
    "\u201cSchool\u201d usually does not cater to adults for sports like golf and tennis; rather, it\u2019s focused on education, so it's unlikely to be the correct choice.",
    "\u201cPark\u201d can have tennis courts, but it usually does not feature golf facilities or memberships, making it an improbable option.",
    "\u201cCountry club\u201d is known for providing memberships that include both golf courses and tennis courts. This aligns well with both the husband and wife\u2019s activities.",
    "\u201cWimbledon\u201d specifically refers to the prestigious tennis tournament and doesn\u2019t indicate a place where both sports are available or where you can maintain a membership.",
    "\u201cHealth club\u201d usually refers to a gym and exercise facilities rather than outdoor sports such as golf, making it a less suitable option for both activities.",
    "Given that \u201ccountry club\u201d is the only choice that logically accommodates both golf and tennis and provides a membership structure, it is the most fitting answer."
