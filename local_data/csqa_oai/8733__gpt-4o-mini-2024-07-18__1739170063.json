  "query": "Question: What sort of structures do you enter through a doorway?\n\nChoices:\nA: castle\nB: airport\nC: every building\nD: wall\nE: dollhouse",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to understand what is meant by \"structures\" in this context.",
    "Structures are typically defined as physical constructions or buildings. A \"doorway\" is an entrance into these structures.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the options.",
    "Option A: \"castle\" - a castle has doorways, so this is a valid structure.",
    "Option B: \"airport\" - airports also have doorways for entering different terminals, making this another valid structure.",
    "Option C: \"every building\" - this option suggests that all buildings have doorways. Since buildings are meant for occupancy or use, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that they typically have doorways.",
    "Option D: \"wall\" - a wall is not a structure you enter; it is a part of a structure that's usually solid and does not contain a doorway.",
    "Option E: \"dollhouse\" - a dollhouse is also a structure, but it is less prevalent compared to other choices, and not all toy structures have doorways.",
    "Considering all the options, the only choice that universally applies to all entered structures is \"every building,\" as all buildings by definition have doorways."
