  "query": "Question: Eating to much will lead to what kind of pain?\n\nChoices:\nA: food\nB: getting full\nC: full stomach\nD: full belly\nE: stomach aches",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens when one overeats. Common repercussions include physical discomfort and pain in the digestive system.",
    "Next, examine the choices available. \"Food\" is too vague and does not specifically relate to the concept of pain.",
    "\"Getting full\" describes a state rather than a type of pain, so it does not fit.",
    "\"Full stomach\" could refer to the sensation after overeating but does not directly imply pain.",
    "\"Full belly\" is similar to \"full stomach\" in implying a condition rather than pain.",
    "\"Stomach aches\" directly addresses pain experienced in the stomach, which is a common result of overeating.",
    "Evaluate the appropriateness of \"stomach aches\" against the question. It correlates directly with the negative effects of eating too much.",
    "Review all candidates once more. The other terms do not denote pain, and the term \"stomach aches\" specifically indicates a painful condition resulting from overeating.",
    "Conclude that the most accurate answer to the question about the pain resulting from eating too much is \"stomach aches.\""
