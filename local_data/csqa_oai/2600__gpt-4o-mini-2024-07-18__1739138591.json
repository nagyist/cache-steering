  "steps": [
    "The question discusses a human's office job that involves being seated all day.",
    "A person with an office job needs to maintain comfort and support while working for long hours.",
    "Among the options, \"chair\" is the most relevant to comfort while seated for long periods.",
    "A desk is also important in an office environment, but it does not directly address comfort while seated.",
    "The term \"workplace\" refers to the overall environment and includes both the chair and desk, but is too broad in this context.",
    "\"Internet cafe\" implies a specific location for using the internet, not directly related to comfort in an office setting.",
    "A \"submarine\" is completely unrelated to an office job or anything about seating and comfort.",
    "Based on the context, the most logical answer is the item that directly supports comfort while sitting for extended periods.",
    "Thus, the correct answer must be focused on the individual's direct seating arrangement."
