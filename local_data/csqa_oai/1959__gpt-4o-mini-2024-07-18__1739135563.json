  "query": "Question: She was contemplating which make-up to where, what prompted her to think about this?\n\nChoices:\nA: food\nB: action\nC: thinking\nD: reflection\nE: discovery",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question, which involves her contemplating about make-up choices.",
    "The use of \"contemplating\" suggests that she is in a state of deep thought or consideration about something.",
    "This thought process is likely driven by an internal prompt, so I should focus on what could cause someone to think about make-up.",
    "The options provided suggest different types of stimuli: food, action, thinking, reflection, and discovery.",
    "Since she is considering her make-up, the prompt is more closely related to personal appearance or self-presentation rather than external factors like food or action.",
    "\"Thinking\" seems to be a general term that represents the process she is already engaged in and does not denote the prompt.",
    "\"Reflection\" implies a deep consideration or contemplation about oneself, which aligns with the scenario of choosing make-up based on personal preferences or past experiences.",
    "\"Discovery\" typically relates to finding something new, which doesn't seem to fit here as she is thinking about existing make-up.",
    "I should prioritize \"reflection\" since contemplating make-up often involves reflecting on one\u2019s identity or how one wishes to present themselves.",
    "Therefore, the most relevant option that describes what prompted her contemplation about make-up is \"reflection.\""
