  "query": "Question: Where would a human need to check how much oxygen he or she has?\n\nChoices:\nA: space shuttle\nB: underwater\nC: civilisation\nD: spacecraft\nE: graveyard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where oxygen levels are critical for survival. In normal life within civilization, oxygen is readily available, so one wouldn't need to check levels there often.",
    "Next, in a space shuttle or spacecraft, oxygen supply is limited and must be monitored closely, as it is essential for human survival in a vacuum.",
    "Underwater, particularly at great depths, oxygen may also become a concern due to the use of tanks for scuba diving which need monitoring.",
    "Evaluate the graveyard option. This location is associated with deceased individuals, meaning oxygen levels are not relevant for a living person.",
    "Acquisition of oxygen in space environments (space shuttles or spacecraft) is critical, so a human would need to frequently check oxygen levels there.",
    "While underwater scenarios involve checking oxygen levels, they are typically less critical compared to the strict requirements in space environments.",
    "Since both options A (space shuttle) and D (spacecraft) fall under similar contexts regarding oxygen monitoring, determine whether the terms are synonymous or different.",
    "\u201cSpacecraft\u201d is a broader term that includes shuttles. Thus, checking oxygen in a generic spacecraft covers both cases.",
    "Underwater conditions could lead to critical situations but generally involve temporary oxygen supply through equipment rather than a constant monitoring like in space.",
    "Finally, with the graveyard ruled out and understanding that both spacecraft options require careful oxygen level checking, the most appropriate answer remains D."
