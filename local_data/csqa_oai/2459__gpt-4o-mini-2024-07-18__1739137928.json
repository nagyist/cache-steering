  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to see more than one office building?\n\nChoices:\nA: work\nB: industrial complex\nC: city\nD: new york\nE: suburbia",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of the question, which asks for a location where multiple office buildings are likely found.",
    "Next, evaluate option A: \"work.\" This is a broad and vague term that doesn't specifically imply a location with office buildings.",
    "Now, consider option B: \"industrial complex.\" While some industrial complexes may have offices, they are primarily focused on manufacturing and industrial activities, not necessarily many office buildings.",
    "Next, examine option C: \"city.\" Cities typically contain a high density of buildings, including multiple office buildings due to business activities and commercial zones.",
    "Then, evaluate option D: \"new york.\" New York is indeed a city known for its large number of office buildings; however, it is a specific location rather than a general category.",
    "Consider option E: \"suburbia.\" While some suburbs have office buildings, they are generally less dense in office space compared to urban areas.",
    "After weighing all options, option C: \"city\" encompasses various cities, including New York, where multiple office buildings are commonly found, making it a general and appropriate answer.",
    "Lastly, while New York is specific and has many offices, the question appears to be looking for a broader category, hence \"city\" is the better choice."
