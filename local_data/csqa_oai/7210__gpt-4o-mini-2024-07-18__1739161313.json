  "query": "Question: Where could you find a weasel that is not alive?\n\nChoices:\nA: court room\nB: cherry tree\nC: chicken coop\nD: natural history museum\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "To find a weasel that is not alive, we need to consider places where taxidermy or exhibits of animals are likely.",
    "A courtroom (choice A) is generally not a place that would house any animals, alive or deceased, except perhaps as evidence, which is not typical.",
    "A cherry tree (choice B) is a natural setting primarily for flora rather than fauna and does not align with finding a deceased animal.",
    "A chicken coop (choice C) is a place for live chickens and could potentially have remains, but it is not a typical place to find a weasel, dead or alive.",
    "A natural history museum (choice D) is specifically designed to educate the public about organisms, including taxidermy specimens of various animals, so it would be highly likely to have a weasel that is not alive on display.",
    "A zoo (choice E) primarily features live animals and would not typically house deceased specimens.",
    "Comparing the options, choices A, B, C, and E don't provide suitable environments for finding a taxidermied or deceased weasel. Choice D, the natural history museum, is the only fitting location."
