  "query": "Question: Where do many vacuums store dirt?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: container\nC: fridge\nD: space\nE: clean carpet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a vacuum does\u2014it is designed to suck up dirt and debris from various surfaces.",
    "Next, I consider where the dirt that is collected by a vacuum is typically stored within the appliance itself.",
    "I recall that vacuums use bags, bins, or other types of containers to hold the dirt and debris they collect.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the provided answer choices: A: closet, B: container, C: fridge, D: space, and E: clean carpet.",
    "Looking at choice A, a closet is where a vacuum might be stored, but it\u2019s not where it holds dirt while in use.",
    "Choice B mentions a container, which aligns with my previous reasoning about vacuums storing dirt in a bag or bin.",
    "Choice C (fridge), choice D (space), and choice E (clean carpet) clearly do not pertain to where vacuums store dirt; they are irrelevant to the function of a vacuum.",
    "Therefore, among the viable options, B is the most accurate because it specifically refers to the storage unit within the vacuum that holds dirt."
