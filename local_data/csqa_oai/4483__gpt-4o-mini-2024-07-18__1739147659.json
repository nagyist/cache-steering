    "Identify the emotional states that are commonly associated with waiting. Waiting often leads to feelings of anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about the future.",
    "Analyze the specific answer choices provided. Look for which emotions or states are most relevant to the situation of waiting for an interview response.",
    "Choice A (have fun) does not relate to the emotional experience of waiting for a response from an interview and is not relevant.",
    "Choice B (patience) could be a response to waiting, but it is not necessarily the most common emotional reaction in this context.",
    "Choice C (anxiety) strongly correlates with the experience of waiting for important news because of the uncertainty involved and the stakes typically associated with job interviews.",
    "Choice D (tedious) refers to the boredom of waiting, but it is more about the experience of time rather than an emotional response.",
