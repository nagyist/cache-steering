  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that a sample needed to be pure, implying that any deviation from purity would be undesirable.",
    "The choices provided include various terms that could apply to the concept of purity.",
    "\"Corrupt\" (A) generally refers to moral degradation or loss of integrity, which doesn't directly apply to the context of a sample.",
    "\"Applied\" (B) does not relate to the state of purity and instead suggests some action or usage, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "\"Dirty\" (C) implies contamination but is a more informal term, while \"contaminated\" (D) is a more precise technical term associated with purity and uncleanliness.",
    "\"Fresh\" (E) suggests a new state but does not imply anything about purity, making it an irrelevant choice.",
    "Between \"dirty\" and \"contaminated,\" the latter is more appropriate for a scientific context where purity is affected, suggesting a specific problem rather than a general state.",
    "However, \"dirty\" could colloquially refer to an impure sample too, and after considering the context again, both dirty and contaminated share a similar meaning concerning purity.",
    "Ultimately, both \"dirty\" and \"contaminated\" could fit, but in a scientific context, \"contaminated\" might be more fitting when describing what an impure sample is.",
    "Considering these evaluations, \"contaminated\" seems the most precise despite \"dirty\" also being a valid choice."
