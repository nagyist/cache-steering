  "steps": [
    "We need to determine where an entrance hall that serves a single family is typically found.",
    "First, let's define what an entrance hall is: it is a space or area at the entrance of a building.",
    "Next, we consider the choices provided: person, large building, school, house, and mansion.",
    "The term \"person\" (Choice A) does not apply, as a person cannot have an entrance hall.",
    "A \"large building\" (Choice B) typically serves multiple people or purposes, and may have several entrances and common areas, not just a single family's entrance hall.",
    "A \"school\" (Choice C) is designed to accommodate many students, teachers, and staff, so it too would not fit the description of a single family's entrance hall.",
    "Now considering \"house\" (Choice D): a house is a dwelling that is generally occupied by a single family and usually has an entrance hall.",
    "Finally, a \"mansion\" (Choice E) is also a large dwelling but often serves single families and may include an elaborate entrance hall. However, it does not specifically indicate that it is only used by a single family in the same way as a house, which might suggest smaller scale.",
    "After analyzing all choices, the most appropriate answer for an entrance hall used specifically by a single family is a \"house\" (Choice D)."
