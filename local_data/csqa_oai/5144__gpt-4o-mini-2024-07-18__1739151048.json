  "query": "Question: The spring was warming up, what did this cause life to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: die\nB: hibernate\nC: last 100 years\nD: spring forth\nE: cause death",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the spring is warming up, which typically indicates a change in temperature and environment conducive to growth and activity in nature.",
    "During spring, many plants begin to grow, flowers bloom, and animals come out of hibernation or increase their activity levels due to the warmer weather.",
    "The options suggest outcomes that are influenced by seasonal changes, particularly the warming that occurs in spring.",
    "Option A (die) is unlikely because warmer temperatures in spring typically promote life rather than cause it to die.",
    "Option B (hibernate) is also implausible since animals usually emerge from hibernation in the spring as temperatures rise.",
    "Option C (last 100 years) does not directly relate to the effects of warming in spring, as it is a time period rather than an immediate outcome of seasonal change.",
    "Option D (spring forth) aligns well with the effects of warming weather in spring, as it suggests a resurgence of growth and life.",
    "Option E (cause death) contradicts the usual effects of spring warming, which usually brings life rather than death.",
    "After evaluating all the options, D most clearly encapsulates the typical occurrence that results from the warming of spring\u2014a rejuvenation and proliferation of life."
