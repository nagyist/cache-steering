  "steps": [
    "The question asks what can be used to plan a driving route to the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Option A: \"drawings\" is vague and does not specifically refer to a means of navigation, so it is not a practical choice for route planning.",
    "Option B: \"San Francisco Bay\" is a location, but it does not help in planning a route to the Pacific Ocean. It is already a body of water rather than a navigational tool.",
    "Option C: \"atlas\" refers to a book or collection of maps which can be used to plan routes. This is a practical and relevant choice for route planning.",
    "Option D: \"west\" is a direction, but it does not provide enough information or a practical means to plan a specific driving route to the ocean.",
    "Option E: \"southern hemisphere\" describes a geographical region but does not serve as a navigation tool for planning a route to the Pacific Ocean specifically.",
    "Comparing all options, the most suitable answer that directly addresses the question of planning a driving route is option C."
