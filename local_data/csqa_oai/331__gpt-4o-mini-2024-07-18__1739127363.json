  "query": "Question: When he touched the exposed wire he shouldn't have found it surprising that he got what?\n\nChoices:\nA: see work\nB: shocked\nC: humor\nD: startled\nE: funny",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves understanding the consequences of interacting with an exposed wire, which typically denotes a situation involving electrical current.",
    "One common reaction to touching an exposed electrical wire is an electric shock. This is a physical response to the electric current passing through the body.",
    "The word \"surprising\" suggests that the expected outcome of touching the wire should be something that is predictable or logical.",
    "Among the choices provided (A: see work, B: shocked, C: humor, D: startled, E: funny), \"shocked\" directly relates to the outcome of touching a wire carrying electricity.",
    "The other choices do not fit as directly with the context of touching an exposed wire. \"See work\" is unclear and unrelated, \"humor,\" \"funny,\" and \"startled\" may imply emotional responses, but they don't specifically relate to the physical result of electrical contact.",
    "Since \"shocked\" refers specifically to the experience of an electric shock, this choice resonates most clearly with the expected outcome of touching an exposed wire.",
    "To double check, I consider the alternatives again: \"startled\" might indicate surprise, but it doesn't imply a direct consequence like \"shocked\" does.",
    "Therefore, confirming that the immediate and logical response to contact with an exposed electrical wire is indeed an electric shock."
