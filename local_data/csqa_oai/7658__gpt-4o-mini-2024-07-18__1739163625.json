  "query": "Question: The child had learned music by ear, he had never even seen it what?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera\nB: written on paper\nC: composed\nD: teacher\nE: stolen",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that the child learned music by ear, which suggests he learned through listening rather than reading music.",
    "The phrase \"he had never even seen it\" implies something that could be visually observed.",
    "Of the choices presented, \"written on paper\" most directly relates to something that represents music visually, as music is typically written on sheet music.",
    "Other choices, such as \"opera,\" refer to a type of music performance, which he could have heard even without seeing it.",
    "The term \"composed\" refers to the act of creating music, which doesn't have a visual counterpart that can be 'seen'.",
    "\"Teacher\" refers to a person rather than something that can be seen in the context of music, so it wouldn't fit the sentence's structure.",
    "The option \"stolen\" does not relate to music and doesn't fit the context of the child's musical learning.",
    "By process of elimination, the only option that fits logically in the sentence and matches the idea of something he has never seen is \"written on paper.\""
