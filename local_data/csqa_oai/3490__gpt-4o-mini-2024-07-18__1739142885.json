  "query": "Question: What would someone be if he or she killed the biggest amount of people?\n\nChoices:\nA: effusive\nB: enabled\nC: accidental\nD: asomatous\nE: detestable",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question, which concerns the moral implications of someone who has killed a significant number of people.",
    "Next, we can examine the provided answer choices to see which one aligns best with the actions of someone who commits mass killings.",
    "Option A, \"effusive,\" relates to being overly expressive or enthusiastic, which does not correlate with the act of killing.",
    "Option B, \"enabled,\" typically means to give someone the means to do something. It does not directly pertain to someone who kills, but rather to those who might facilitate their actions.",
    "Option C, \"accidental,\" suggests that the killings were unintentional. However, mass killings are typically deliberate, which does not fit.",
    "Option D, \"asomatous,\" refers to being without a body, which is completely irrelevant to the context of killing people.",
    "Finally, option E, \"detestable,\" means deserving of hate or disgust. This term fittingly describes someone who has killed a large number of people, as such actions would generally be viewed with disdain by society."
