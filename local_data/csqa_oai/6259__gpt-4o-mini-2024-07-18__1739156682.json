  "query": "Question: She often spent money she didn't have buying products, this lead to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: spending money\nB: owning\nC: pleasure\nD: surplus of cash\nE: debt",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that she often spent money she didn't have, suggesting that her spending was beyond her financial means.",
    "Buying products without having the financial resources typically leads to incurring obligations or liabilities, such as owing money.",
    "Considering the options, \"spending money\" (A) is a general statement about what she did, but it does not directly address the consequences of her actions.",
    "\"Owning\" (B) implies having possessions, which might occur, but it does not directly reflect the negative impact of spending without resources.",
    "\"Pleasure\" (C) may be a subjective feeling associated with shopping, but spending without money does not guarantee pleasure; it could lead to stress or regret.",
    "\"A surplus of cash\" (D) is the opposite of what would occur from spending money she did not have.",
    "Lastly, \"debt\" (E) specifically refers to the state of owing money, which aligns with the implications of spending beyond one's means.",
    "Since the statements and reasoning indicate that her actions of overspending without financial capacity most logically lead to debt, option E is the direct consequence."
