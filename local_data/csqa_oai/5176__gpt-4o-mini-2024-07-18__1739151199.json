  "query": "Question: Humans tend to have what round things that dart around?\n\nChoices:\nA: two arms\nB: live forever\nC: two eyes\nD: lay eggs\nE: ten fingers",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes \"round things\" that \"dart around,\" which suggests something that is both spherical in shape and capable of quick movement.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided to see which one fits the description of \"round\" and \"darting around.\"",
    "A: \"two arms\" - Arms are not round and do not dart around. This option is not suitable.",
    "B: \"live forever\" - This is not a physical object; therefore, it doesn't fit the criteria of being a round thing that moves.",
    "C: \"two eyes\" - Eyes are generally round in shape and can dart around quickly as they track movement. This option fits the criteria.",
    "D: \"lay eggs\" - This refers to a reproductive action and does not describe a physical round object that moves.",
    "E: \"ten fingers\" - While fingers can move, they are not round objects and do not fit the description well.",
    "After analyzing all options, the only one that aligns with the description of round objects that can dart around is \"two eyes.\""
