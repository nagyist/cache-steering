  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a strong steel cable and its application in off-road driving.",
    "Off-road driving usually involves challenging terrains where vehicles might need recovery assistance if they get stuck.",
    "A strong steel cable is typically used for towing or winching over obstacles in off-road scenarios.",
    "Among the options, we must identify where a strong steel cable would be most relevant for off-road driving.",
    "Option A (ground) does not fit as it is too vague and doesn\u2019t directly relate to equipment or tools.",
    "Option B (ship) is unrelated to off-road driving, as ships are associated with water travel.",
    "Option C (construction site) could involve steel cables, but this does not specifically relate to off-road driving.",
    "Option D (winch) is often used in off-road vehicles to pull the vehicle out of difficult situations, suggesting that a strong steel cable would be essential here.",
    "Finally, Option E (tool box) refers to storage for tools, which does not directly involve the application of a strong steel cable in the context of off-roading."
