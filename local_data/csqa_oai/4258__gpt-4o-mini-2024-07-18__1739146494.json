  "query": "Question: If one sees a fox and is standing in a coastal, eastern seaboard state, where is this person?\n\nChoices:\nA: mountains\nB: arkansas\nC: louisiana\nD: california\nE: south carolina",
  "steps": [
    "The person is standing in a coastal state along the eastern seaboard of the United States. This restricts options to states that have a coastline along the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "Next, I will consider the options given: Arkansas is landlocked and does not have a coastline, so it can be eliminated.",
    "California is not on the eastern seaboard; it is located on the western side of the United States. Therefore, it can also be eliminated.",
    "Louisiana borders the Gulf of Mexico, which is not considered part of the eastern seaboard, so this option can also be eliminated.",
    "The only options remaining that are coastal eastern seaboard states are South Carolina.",
    "To confirm, South Carolina is indeed located on the eastern seaboard, along the Atlantic coast.",
    "A fox could be found in South Carolina's coastal regions, as they inhabit various environments including forests and coastal areas.",
    "Since we have eliminated all other options and confirmed that South Carolina is a coastal state where one might see a fox, this is the most logical conclusion."
