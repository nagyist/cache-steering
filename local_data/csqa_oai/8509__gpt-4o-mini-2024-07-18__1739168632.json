  "query": "Question: The shopping arcade had a lot of foot traffic, where was it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: buy gum\nB: strip mall\nC: canada\nD: busy city\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is meant by \"foot traffic.\" This usually refers to the number of pedestrians visiting a particular area, indicating a bustling environment.",
    "Next, examine the choices. A shopping arcade typically thrives in locations with high foot traffic.",
    "Choice A (\"buy gum\") does not refer to a location, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Choice B (\"strip mall\") suggests a type of shopping area but may not specifically imply a location with high foot traffic, as strip malls are often less pedestrian-oriented compared to shopping arcades.",
    "Choice C (\"canada\") is a country, and while some parts may have high foot traffic, it is too broad and does not specifically indicate a suitable location for a shopping arcade.",
    "Choice D (\"busy city\") directly implies a high volume of pedestrians, making it a strong candidate for where a shopping arcade might be located due to high foot traffic.",
    "Choice E (\"town\") could refer to a smaller area where a shopping arcade might exist, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a location with significant foot traffic compared to a busy city.",
    "Between choices D and E, \"busy city\" is more likely to have a shopping arcade due to the high population density and pedestrian activity.",
    "Therefore, the best answer based on the reasoning about foot traffic and the nature of a shopping arcade is choice D."
