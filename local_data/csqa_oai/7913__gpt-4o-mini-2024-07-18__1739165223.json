  "query": "Question: If you pour out garbage waste on the road to where will it wash away?\n\nChoices:\nA: sewer\nB: garbage dump\nC: street\nD: garbage can\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens when garbage is poured on the road. Rainwater or any liquid on the road will typically flow with gravity.",
    "Next, identify the most likely path for water runoff on a road. Roads generally have curbs and drainage systems designed to manage water flow.",
    "Now, think about where roads often drain. The majority of urban roads are designed to direct runoff into storm drains, which are connected to sewers.",
    "Consider the choices given. A \"sewer\" typically refers to the system of pipes that carry wastewater and stormwater away from streets.",
    "Evaluate the other choices: a garbage dump is not directly linked to road runoff, a \"street\" is where the garbage is initially poured out, a \"garbage can\" is a receptacle for throwing away trash, and \"school\" has no connection to waste management.",
    "Since sewage systems are designed to handle excess water and can potentially collect garbage that washes away, the most logical answer is that the waste would end up in the sewer system.",
    "Finally, recap that the only option that aligns with where poured waste would wash away due to water runoff is the sewer system."
