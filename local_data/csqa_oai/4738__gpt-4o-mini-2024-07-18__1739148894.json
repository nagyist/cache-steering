  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about how to contact a person with a certain name.",
    "To contact someone, you typically need to find their contact information, which includes a phone number or an address.",
    "Directories usually contain listings of names along with their contact information, so they could be useful.",
    "The term \"directory\" could refer to several types of records, including online directories and physical directories.",
    "\"Roster\" generally refers to a list of names, often used in contexts like sports teams or organizations, but it may not include contact information.",
    "A \"phone book\" is a traditional method of finding people's names and their phone numbers, making it directly relevant for contacting someone.",
    "The term \"certificate\" does not pertain to contact information and is not relevant to this task.",
    "\"Michigan\" is a geographic area rather than a method or resource for contacting someone.",
    "Comparing \"directory,\" \"roster,\" \"phone book,\" and \"certificate,\" the most appropriate and traditional option for finding a person's contact details is the \"phone book.\"",
    "Thus, based on the reasoning that we need a resource that provides direct contact information, \"phone book\" is the best answer."
