  "query": "Question: Where would you get an action figure if you do not have one?\n\nChoices:\nA: eat cake\nB: little boy's toy box\nC: theater\nD: bathtub\nE: toy store",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what an action figure is and where it is typically found.",
    "Action figures are toys that are often associated with characters from movies, comics, or video games, and they are usually made of plastic.",
    "Next, let's evaluate each option provided to see where action figures can usually be acquired.",
    "Option A is \"eat cake,\" which has nothing to do with obtaining action figures.",
    "Option B is \"little boy's toy box.\" While it's possible a little boy might have an action figure in his toy box, this does not imply that we can get one since we don\u2019t currently have action figures.",
    "Option C is \"theater.\" Typically, theaters do not sell action figures; they focus on films and performances. Therefore, this option is not viable.",
    "Option D is \"bathtub.\" This is clearly not an appropriate or relevant place to obtain action figures.",
    "Finally, we evaluate option E, which is \"toy store.\" A toy store specifically sells toys, including action figures, making this the most suitable option to obtain one."
