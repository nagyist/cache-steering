  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the marmoset is a new world monkey and that it can be found in a \"mile high place.\"",
    "The term \"mile high\" typically refers to places that are approximately one mile above sea level.",
    "One well-known \"mile high\" location in the United States is Denver, Colorado, which is famously known as the \"Mile High City.\"",
    "I should verify if the other options could also refer to a mile-high location.",
    "\"A: mountains\" is too general and doesn't specify a location that is recognized as a mile-high place.",
    "\"B: france\" is not known for any mile-high locations similar to Denver.",
    "\"C: texas\" does not have a city or location that is famously recognized as a mile high.",
    "\"D: colorado\" specifically includes Denver, which is a mile-high city.",
    "\"E: rainforest\" lacks a specific geographical identity related to elevation and doesn't refer to a mile-high location.",
    "Among the options, \"D: colorado\" is the most accurate since it directly relates to the mile-high city of Denver."
