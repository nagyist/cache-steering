  "query": "Question: The evacuation became mandatory, so what came on the TV?\n\nChoices:\nA: advisory\nB: mandate\nC: soap opera\nD: elective\nE: optional",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the evacuation became mandatory, indicating a serious situation that requires people to leave immediately for safety.",
    "In a mandatory evacuation scenario, authorities typically provide important information through official channels, such as television broadcasts.",
    "The choices given include types of broadcasts or directives that might be communicated during such a situation.",
    "Choice A, \"advisory,\" could be relevant to a situation where warnings are provided, but the term \"advisory\" usually refers to suggested actions rather than mandatory ones.",
    "Choice B, \"mandate,\" aligns with the term \"mandatory,\" indicating a requirement for action, but it doesn't represent something that is typically seen on television.",
    "Choice C, \"soap opera,\" is a genre of television programming that generally does not relate to urgent or mandatory communications.",
    "Choice D, \"elective,\" also refers to optional actions and does not fit the context of mandatory communication.",
    "Choice E, \"optional,\" indicates a lack of requirement, which contradicts the idea of a mandatory evacuation.",
    "Given the context of a mandatory evacuation, the most reasonable type of communication that might appear on TV would be an advisory message, but looking closely, none of the choices reflect that accurately. Hence, the best fit would be a term that approaches mandatory communication despite the lack of a perfect option.",
    "I would reconsider \"advisory\" as the most appropriate communication type that still conveys the urgency without being directly tied to an elite program like a soap opera."
