  "query": "Question: Food is usually stored on what in your pantry?\n\nChoices:\nA: bottom floor\nB: shop\nC: kitchen\nD: shelf\nE: refrigerators",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where food is typically stored in a pantry, I need to consider the function and layout of a pantry.",
    "A pantry is usually a storage space specifically designed for storing food items and kitchen supplies.",
    "Options like \"bottom floor\" and \"shop\" do not align with the typical purpose of a pantry.",
    "The \"kitchen\" is related to the pantry, as they are both areas where food is involved, but it is not specific enough.",
    "\"Refrigerators\" are used for perishable items but are not part of a standard pantry.",
    "\"Shelves\" are commonly found in pantries and are specifically used to store food items.",
    "Shelves provide organization and accessibility, making them an essential part of pantry storage.",
    "Thus, among the choices given, \"shelf\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to where food is stored in a pantry."
