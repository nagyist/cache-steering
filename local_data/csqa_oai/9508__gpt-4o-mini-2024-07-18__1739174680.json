  "query": "Question: Why are cooks hired?\n\nChoices:\nA: to be fired\nB: prepare meals\nC: season with salt\nD: better food\nE: perfect food",
  "steps": [
    "Cooks are primarily hired to fulfill specific responsibilities related to food preparation.",
    "One of the main duties of a cook is to prepare meals, which encompasses the cooking process from start to finish.",
    "While seasoning food is an important aspect of cooking, it is just one of many tasks a cook must perform; thus, it cannot be the sole reason for hiring.",
    "The goal of hiring cooks also includes enhancing the quality of the food they offer, but \"better food\" is a subjective term and does not directly define the role of a cook.",
    "The option of \"perfect food\" is also subjective and sets an unrealistic standard for the hiring of cooks, as perfection may vary by individual taste.",
    "To summarize the options, B (prepare meals) directly aligns with the primary and essential function of a cook, which is to create food for consumption.",
    "Thus, when considering the core responsibilities associated with the role of cooks, the most logical answer is to prepare meals."
