  "query": "Question: Where is a child likely to put their wagon?\n\nChoices:\nA: backyard\nB: field\nC: tool box\nD: toy store\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a child using a wagon. A wagon is typically used for play or transporting toys or items.",
    "Next, think about where children generally play and store their toys. Common places include backyards, garages, and sometimes fields.",
    "Now evaluate the options. A backyard is a typical place for a child to play, and they might put their wagon there after use.",
    "A field is also a place where a child might take a wagon to play, but it would not be a typical storage place for the wagon.",
    "Next, consider option C, a tool box. A tool box is generally not a place for a child to put a wagon since it is too small and is used for tools.",
    "Option D, a toy store, is not a plausible storage option since a child would not put their wagon there; it suggests a place to buy toys rather than store them.",
    "Lastly, a garage is a feasible option for storing toys and items like a wagon, as it is often used for storage.",
    "Comparing the final choices of backyard and garage, the backyard is typically a more direct place for a child to leave their wagon after play."
