  "query": "Question: If you're taking a break from your library, you should still put in the effort to complete what sort of form before your card stop working?\n\nChoices:\nA: delay\nB: renewal\nC: buy the card\nD: sitting down\nE: not working",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to maintaining the functionality of a library card while taking a break.",
    "If a library card is not used for a certain period, it may require some kind of action to continue being valid.",
    "Renewal is a common term used in contexts where something needs to be updated or maintained to prevent it from becoming inactive.",
    "The other options: delay, buy the card, sitting down, and not working do not fit logically into the context of a library card becoming inactive due to lack of use.",
    "\"Delay\" doesn't refer to an action needed to keep the card functional.",
    "\"Buy the card\" implies a one-time purchase rather than a maintenance action.",
    "\"Sitting down\" and \"not working\" are irrelevant to the requirements of keeping a library card active.",
    "Therefore, the correct action to maintain a library card while taking a break is to complete a \"renewal.\""

  "solution": "B"
