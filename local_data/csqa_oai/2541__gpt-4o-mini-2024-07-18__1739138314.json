  "query": "Question: Where is a marmot known to live?\n\nChoices:\nA: yellow pages\nB: jungle\nC: woods\nD: hiding place\nE: high mountains",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a marmot is. Marmots are large ground squirrels that belong to the genus Marmota.",
    "Next, consider the habitat of marmots. They are typically found in mountainous areas.",
    "Review the choices given: A (yellow pages), B (jungle), C (woods), D (hiding place), E (high mountains).",
    "Analyze choice A. The yellow pages is a directory and not a natural habitat, so it does not apply.",
    "Analyze choice B. The jungle is a dense, tropical area, which is not a typical habitat for marmots, as they prefer cooler climates.",
    "Analyze choice C. While woods may provide some habitats for certain animals, marmots are more specifically associated with rocky and mountainous regions rather than typical wooded areas.",
    "Analyze choice D. A hiding place is too vague and does not denote a specific habitat. Marmots do have burrows for shelter, but this does not constitute their living environment.",
    "Finally, analyze choice E. High mountains are known specific habitats for marmots, particularly species like the Alpine marmot and the yellow-bellied marmot."
