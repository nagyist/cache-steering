  "query": "Question: There are many sayings and metaphors about flirting, which one could be found in a machine shop?\n\nChoices:\nA: feelings\nB: sexual excitement\nC: sparks fly\nD: problems\nE: unwanted pregnancy",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify sayings and metaphors that relate to flirting. Flirting often involves attraction and chemistry between individuals.",
    "Next, we will examine the choices provided to see which one relates to the environment of a machine shop.",
    "Choices A (feelings) and B (sexual excitement) are more abstract concepts and do not have a direct connection to a machine shop.",
    "Choice D (problems) may occur in a machine shop, but it does not relate to flirting or romantic attraction.",
    "Choice E (unwanted pregnancy) is also not a metaphor and doesn\u2019t connect to a machine shop context.",
    "Now looking at choice C (sparks fly), this is a common expression that describes the excitement or chemistry that can happen when two people flirt. It also has a literal connection to a machine shop where sparks can fly during welding or machining processes.",
    "Since C ties both the metaphor of flirting and the machine shop context together, it stands out as the most relevant answer."
