    "The question asks about a location where people gather while waiting for a ride across town.",
    "We need to consider each of the choices provided to determine which is most relevant to waiting for a ride.",
    "Choice A: wedding - Generally, weddings are social events, not places for waiting for transportation; people are usually already at the venue.",
    "Choice B: bus stop - This is a common place where individuals wait for public transportation such as buses to move across town.",
    "Choice C: convention - Although conventions can involve gathering, they are less about transportation and more about events; one would not typically wait for a ride there.",
    "Choice D: pool - This location is usually associated with recreation rather than waiting for transport.",
    "Choice E: apartment - While people may be inside their apartments, it is not a typical place to gather specifically for waiting for a ride.",
    "After evaluating all options, choice B stands out as the only relevant location for waiting specifically for a ride across town."
