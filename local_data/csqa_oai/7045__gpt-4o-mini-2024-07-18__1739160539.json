  "query": "Question: Where might a snake hide?\n\nChoices:\nA: clouds\nB: tropical forest\nC: hollow log\nD: arid climate\nE: petting zoo",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where snakes are generally found. Snakes are primarily terrestrial or semi-aquatic animals that tend to prefer places where they can easily hide from predators or ambush prey.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice based on typical snake habitats. Clouds are not a feasible hiding place for snakes, as they do not have the ability to fly or reside in the air.",
    "Looking at the tropical forest, this does offer good hiding spots such as underbrush and tree cover. However, it is not the most specific option.",
    "Hollow logs are common hiding spots for snakes. They provide shelter from predators and extreme weather, making it a suitable option for snakes.",
    "An arid climate might offer hiding spots like rocks or burrows, but it is a general environmental condition and not a specific hiding place.",
    "A petting zoo typically does not provide a natural habitat for snakes, as they are usually kept in controlled environments away from the public.",
    "Comparing the options, the most specific and appropriate hiding location for a snake out of the choices provided is the hollow log.",
    "Check the other options again: clouds are impossible, tropical forests are good but not specific, arid climates are general, and petting zoos are inappropriate.",
    "Thus, the strongest answer based on the logic and reasoning is that snakes would most likely hide in a hollow log."
