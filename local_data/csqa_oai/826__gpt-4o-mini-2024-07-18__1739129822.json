  "query": "Question: The window across the street was broken and John felt guilty. He never meant to damage what?\n\nChoices:\nA: friend's house\nB: curtains\nC: space shuttle\nD: front door\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the statement. The emphasis is on John feeling guilty about causing damage.",
    "Next, identify the object that John did not intend to damage. The sentence uses \"never meant to damage,\" suggesting that the object is probably something personal or significant.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, A (friend's house) implies a location with personal ties, which could evoke guilt.",
    "B (curtains) is a specific item within a house that could easily be damaged but doesn't hold the same weight of guilt as a structure.",
    "C (space shuttle) is unlikely given the context; it's too abstract and not something usually connected with personal guilt in everyday scenarios.",
    "D (front door), although it suggests damage to a house, lacks the personal connection that A provides.",
    "E (classroom) doesn't fit the personal guilt context as closely as A does.",
    "Now, assessing the choices again: A directly implicates a friend's emotional space (the house), which aligns with feelings of guilt.",
    "The option B might also carry some weight but doesn\u2019t evoke a strong sense of guilt compared to damaging a friend\u2019s property.",
    "Therefore, A (friend's house) is the most fitting choice because the guilt described is typically associated with damaging something belonging to a friend."
