  "query": "Question: While it wasn't damaged yet, she kept a spare wooden rod with the other cleaning supplies inside the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: make a hammer\nB: carpentry shop\nC: old clock\nD: old houses\nE: broom closet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of where cleaning supplies are typically stored. Cleaning supplies are usually kept in a location that is easily accessible and organized for cleaning purposes.",
    "The choices provided include various options, but some of them are not likely candidates for storing cleaning supplies. For example, \"make a hammer\" (A) is not a storage location, \"carpentry shop\" (B) is more of a workshop setting rather than a storage area for cleaning supplies, and \"old clock\" (C) doesn't logically make sense as a storage area.",
    "Next, let\u2019s evaluate \"old houses\" (D). While it is possible to find cleaning supplies in old houses, it is not a specific location where supplies would be stored.",
    "Now I consider \"broom closet\" (E). A broom closet is specifically designed for storing cleaning tools and supplies, such as brooms, mops, and other related items.",
    "Since a broom closet is the most appropriate and specific location for keeping cleaning supplies, it stands out against the other choices.",
    "I will cross-check my reasoning: a spare wooden rod is likely a cleaning tool or accessory, further suggesting it should be stored with other cleaning supplies.",
    "Therefore, the broom closet, being tailored for such items, supports the statement that she kept a spare wooden rod with other cleaning supplies inside it."
