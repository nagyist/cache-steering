  "steps": [
    "I will evaluate the choices provided to determine which location is known for having snow consistently.",
    "A: Africa is a diverse continent with many climates, but it is generally known for warmth and does not have consistent snowfall across most of its regions.",
    "B: The North Pole is an Arctic region that is covered with ice and often has snow year-round, making it a strong candidate for this question.",
    "C: A roof could have snow on it if the conditions are right, but it does not inherently have snow; it is dependent on the weather.",
    "D: Canada is known for significant snowfall and cold winters, but there are regions in Canada that may not have snow year-round.",
    "E: The surface of the Earth is vast and varied; it includes many areas with no snow at all, so this choice is too broad.",
    "After considering the steady presence of snow, the North Pole distinctly stands out as a location that is known to always have snow."
