  "steps": [
    "To determine where excitement would not be allowed, I will analyze each option based on the typical atmosphere associated with the event or place.",
    "Option A is a hockey game. Such events are generally filled with excitement, cheers, and engaging moments, so excitement is allowed here.",
    "Option B is a boxing match. Like hockey games, boxing matches evoke a lot of excitement, enthusiasm, and cheering from the audience. Thus, excitement is allowed here as well.",
    "Option C is a library. Libraries are typically quiet places designed for study, reading, and maintaining silence. Excitement would generally not be allowed here due to the expectation of a calm atmosphere.",
    "Option D is a car show. These events often feature displays of vehicles that can evoke excitement, interest, and engagement from attendees. Therefore, excitement is allowed at car shows.",
    "Option E refers to dance events. These can be lively and energetic, and excitement is commonly encouraged during such events. Hence, excitement is allowed here too.",
    "Comparing all the options, only the library stands out as the place where excitement is typically not allowed or is discouraged."
