  "query": "Question: They made a mess eating on the sofa bed, they dripped a tangy what sauce all over it?\n\nChoices:\nA: basement\nB: guest room\nC: horseradish\nD: bathroom\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what type of sauce could be tangy. Common tangy sauces include horseradish, mustard, and certain salad dressings.",
    "Next, we should analyze the choices given. Among the options, \"horseradish\" is the only one that is specifically a sauce and known for its tangy flavor. The other choices (basement, guest room, bathroom, living room) do not refer to sauces at all.",
    "Now, we can also consider that the mention of a \"sofa bed\" suggests a casual setting where one might eat and potentially make a mess, which aligns more with a typical living area like a living room rather than the other rooms listed.",
    "We can cross-examine the candidate sauce 'horseradish' again. It is known for its strong and tangy flavor, which would logically fit the description of the mess made.",
    "It is necessary to confirm that the other options do not fit. \"Basement,\" \"guest room,\" and \"bathroom\" are places and not sauces, and \"living room\" is a space as well, further leading to the conclusion that \"horseradish\" is the best answer.",
    "Thus, by process of elimination and confirmation of flavor profiles, the correct answer to what sauce was dripped on the sofa bed is the only viable choice for tangy sauce."
