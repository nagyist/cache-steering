  "query": "Question: What happens to your bladder when you drink a lot of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: stretchable\nB: full\nC: filled\nD: padding\nE: empty",
  "steps": [
    "When you drink a lot of water, the volume of liquid in your body increases.",
    "This increase in liquid causes the kidneys to filter more urine.",
    "As urine production increases, it is stored in the bladder.",
    "The bladder has the ability to stretch as it fills with urine.",
    "When the bladder fills with urine, it reaches its capacity.",
    "A filled bladder signals the brain that it's time to urinate.",
    "Considering the choices given, \"full\" and \"filled\" both indicate that the bladder contains urine.",
    "\"Stretchable\" refers to the bladder's ability to expand, rather than its state after drinking water.",
    "\"Padding\" does not accurately describe the condition of the bladder with respect to storing urine.",
    "\"Empty\" would not accurately represent the bladder's state after drinking a lot of water, as it would be the opposite of \"filled\" or \"full.\""
