  "query": "Question: Where might someone find old clothing?\n\nChoices:\nA: trunk\nB: drawer\nC: suitcase\nD: book shelf\nE: washing machine",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where someone might find old clothing, I need to consider common storage locations for clothes.",
    "A trunk is often used for storing clothes, especially older or seasonal items, making it a viable option for old clothing.",
    "A drawer is another common place to store clothing, including possibly old or less frequently worn items, so it could also be a possibility.",
    "A suitcase is typically used for travel and may contain old clothing that hasn't been unpacked or special occasion clothing that is rarely used.",
    "A book shelf is primarily used for books and other items, and it is not a typical storage place for clothing.",
    "A washing machine is used for laundering clothes and would not be a suitable place for finding old clothing.",
    "Evaluating all options, a trunk, drawer, and suitcase could all potentially contain old clothing.",
    "Out of all options, a trunk is specifically designed for storage over long periods, giving it a stronger association with old items.",
    "I will compare the likelihood: While a trunk, drawer, and suitcase are all valid options, a trunk has the most historical context for storing old clothing.",
    "Thus, the strongest candidate for where one might find old clothing is a trunk."
