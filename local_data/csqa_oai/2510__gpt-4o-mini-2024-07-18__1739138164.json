  "query": "Question: Where does a human likely not want to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: jail\nB: church\nC: school\nD: house\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the general connotation and feelings associated with each option. \"Jail\" typically carries negative connotations as it is associated with punishment and confinement.",
    "Next, I will analyze \"church.\" Some individuals may feel uncomfortable in church due to religious beliefs or pressure to conform, but it can also be a place of community and support for many.",
    "Next, I will evaluate \"school.\" While some may have fond memories of school, others associate school with stress from academic pressures and social dynamics.",
    "Moving on, I will consider \"house.\" Generally, a house is a place of comfort and security for many individuals.",
    "Next, I will evaluate \"park.\" Parks are typically viewed as positive spaces for recreation and relaxation; most people enjoy being in parks.",
    "Now, I will rank the options based on the likelihood of discomfort or avoidance. \"Jail\" stands out prominently as a location a person definitely would not want to be.",
    "However, between \"school\" and \"church,\" considering the stressful experiences some may face in school, it may evoke stronger feelings of aversion for some individuals compared to church.",
    "Thus, I rank the final choices: \"jail\" as the least desirable place, followed by \"school,\" given the academic stress many face.",
    "Hence, the most likely answer to the question of where a human likely does not want to be is \"jail.\""
