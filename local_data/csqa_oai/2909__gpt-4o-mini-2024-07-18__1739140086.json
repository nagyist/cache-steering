  "query": "Question: What is an object that is not used in a common room likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: irregular\nB: elite\nC: rare\nD: special\nE: personal",
  "steps": [
    "I need to understand what a \"common room\" is. It typically refers to a shared space used by many people, such as a living room, lounge, or recreational area.",
    "Next, I should consider the characteristics of objects found in a common room. Common room items are usually general-purpose and shared among occupants.",
    "Now, I will analyze the term \"not used in a common room\". This suggests the object is likely specific to an individual rather than a group.",
    "Among the choices provided, I will evaluate which words best describe an object typically associated with individuation or personal use.",
    "Choice A (irregular) does not align with the theme of individual use; it refers more to deviation from the norm.",
    "Choice B (elite) suggests a high status or exclusivity, which might not necessarily connect to individual usage in a personal context.",
    "Choice C (rare) implies something uncommon, but does not inherently relate to personal usage versus commonality.",
    "Choice D (special) indicates something unique or notable. While this could apply to personal items, it's still fairly general.",
    "Choice E (personal) speaks directly to the idea of items that belong to or are for the use of an individual, contrasting clearly with the collective nature of objects in a common room.",
    "After assessing all the options, \"personal\" best describes an object not used in a common room, as it denotes items that are private and meant for individual use."
