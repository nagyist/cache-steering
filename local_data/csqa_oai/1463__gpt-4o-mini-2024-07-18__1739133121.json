  "query": "Question: If a murderer killed people related to one's family, the family members would feel what when crying?\n\nChoices:\nA: remorse\nB: retaliation\nC: terrible\nD: anguish\nE: wet",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a situation where a murderer has killed family members, which suggests a very emotional and tragic context.",
    "Family members in this situation would likely experience deep emotions as a result of such a traumatic event.",
    "The choices provided need to be analyzed in terms of their emotional relevance to someone grieving for murdered loved ones.",
    "Remorse (A) usually refers to feelings of guilt, which may not directly relate to the family members in this context.",
    "Retaliation (B) implies a desire for revenge, which is an action rather than an emotional state of crying.",
    "Wet (E) describes a physical state rather than an emotional response. Crying could lead to being wet, but it is not an emotion itself.",
    "This leaves us with \"terrible\" (C) and \"anguish\" (D), both of which pertain more to emotional states.",
    "\"Terrible\" (C) is a general descriptor of feelings and does not convey the depth of emotion typically associated with loss.",
    "\"Anguish\" (D) specifically denotes extreme distress and suffering, which aligns directly with the profound pain family members would feel in mourning.",
    "Given the context of the question, \"anguish\" is the strongest candidate as it most accurately reflects the emotional state of family members crying over such a tragic loss."
