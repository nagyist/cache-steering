  "query": "Question: Two people were grooming each other in anticipation of a party.  Why might they be grooming?\n\nChoices:\nA: looking pretty\nB: positive\nC: late\nD: get\nE: unclean",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of \"grooming\" which typically refers to activities aimed at improving one's appearance or hygiene.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices provided to understand which of them relates directly to grooming.",
    "Choice A, \"looking pretty,\" seems relevant because grooming often involves making oneself more attractive for social occasions like a party.",
    "Choice B, \"positive,\" is vague and does not directly correlate with the act of grooming.",
    "Choice C, \"late,\" does not logically connect to the concept of grooming since grooming is independent of time but rather tied to preparation.",
    "Choice D, \"get,\" is also too vague and does not provide specific reasoning related to grooming.",
    "Choice E, \"unclean,\" suggests a motivation for grooming in terms of hygiene; while this is valid, the focus here is on grooming for a social event rather than merely cleanliness.",
    "I further conclude that the strongest motivation related to the context of preparing for a party is aesthetic appeal, which aligns closely with choice A.",
    "I consider the overall context of preparing for a party and confirm that \"looking pretty\" aligns with social norms regarding grooming for such occasions."
