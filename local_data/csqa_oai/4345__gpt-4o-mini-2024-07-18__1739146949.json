  "query": "Question: From where can you take home a highlight?\n\nChoices:\nA: case\nB: office drawer\nC: marker store\nD: desk drawer\nE: office supply store",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is meant by \"a highlight.\" This could refer to a highlighter, which is commonly used for marking important text.",
    "Next, I consider where one might typically go to obtain office supplies, including highlighters.",
    "Among the options given, \"marker store\" seems to specifically relate to places that sell markers and potentially highlighters as well.",
    "I then evaluate if \"office supply store\" is another valid option, as these stores generally carry a wide variety of office supplies, including highlighters.",
    "It is also notable that \"case\" and \"office drawer\" do not typically relate to places where one buys supplies, but rather denote locations where items might be stored.",
    "Similarly, \"desk drawer\" indicates a storage place rather than a procurement point for office supplies.",
    "Now I compare \"marker store\" to \"office supply store.\" While both could provide highlighters, the latter likely has a greater selection of office supplies.",
    "However, since the question asks from where one can take home a highlight and not just where they can buy it, I realize that both \"marker store\" and \"office supply store\" are valid options.",
    "Given that an \"office supply store\" is more ubiquitous and widely accessible for purchasing office items, it stands out as a better answer."
