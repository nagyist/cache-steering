  "steps": [
    "Younger investors typically have a longer time horizon for their investments, which allows them to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns.",
    "A risky investor is someone who is willing to accept potential losses in the short term for the potential of greater gains in the long term.",
    "The primary goal of an investor is usually to increase their wealth over time through the appreciation of their investments.",
    "Therefore, a younger, risky investor would likely focus on high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities to maximize their potential gains.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, \"gain wealth\" aligns with the objective of increasing one's financial position through strategic investment.",
    "Other options like \"lose money\", \"save money\", \"sell stock\", and \"back project\" do not fit the profile of a younger risky investor's goal.",
    "Thus, the most suitable choice reflecting the goal of such an investor is to \"gain wealth.\""
