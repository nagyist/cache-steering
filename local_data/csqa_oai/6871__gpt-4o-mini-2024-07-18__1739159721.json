  "query": "Question: When I have a sponge, but am unsure of where to use it, where should I use it?\n\nChoices:\nA: wet surface\nB: clean dishes\nC: collect water\nD: hold water\nE: wet surface",
  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that a sponge is often used for absorbing and applying liquid.",
    "Next, I consider the meaning of the options provided. \"Wet surface\" implies a place that may need to be wiped or dried.",
    "I note that \"clean dishes\" suggests a specific task of cleaning, which is a common use of a sponge.",
    "The option \"collect water\" suggests using the sponge to gather excess liquid, which is another common use.",
    "The option \"hold water\" indicates that a sponge can retain water, but it doesn't imply a purpose of application or cleanup.",
    "I observe that there are two options stating \"wet surface\" and \"wet surface\" again, which may be redundant.",
    "I compare the potential uses: using a sponge to \"clean dishes\" is a direct application, whereas \"hold water\" does not apply an action.",
    "Additionally, the tasks of \"collecting\" and \"cleaning\" involve active use while \"holding\" and \"wet surface\" don't suggest an active purpose.",
    "Between the options, cleaning dishes seems like a direct task for the sponge, but the redundancy of \"wet surface\" causes confusion.",
    "However, I conclude that while cleaning dishes is valid, using it on a wet surface could also imply a necessary action when unsure where to use it."
