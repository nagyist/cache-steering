  "query": "Question: Where do kids play with a ball that is concrete?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: soccer field\nC: soccer game\nD: central park\nE: pool table",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what it means for a ball to be played with on a surface that is concrete. Concrete surfaces are typically hard and durable.",
    "Next, I will consider where such concrete surfaces are commonly found. Options include streets, sports facilities, parks, and recreational areas.",
    "Choice A indicates \"street.\" Streets are indeed concrete, and kids often play with balls in street games. This is a plausible choice.",
    "Choice B states \"soccer field.\" Although soccer is played on a field, most soccer fields are covered with grass or turf, not concrete. So this option does not fit the requirement.",
    "Choice C states \"soccer game.\" A soccer game is an event that occurs on a field, which again is not necessarily concrete.",
    "Choice D mentions \"central park.\" While parks can have concrete areas, they typically have grass or dirt areas for play, making this option less appropriate.",
    "Choice E refers to \"pool table.\" A pool table is indeed a concrete surface but is not a common place for kids to play with a typical ball like a soccer or basketball.",
    "After analyzing all options, the only choice that directly aligns with a concrete surface where kids traditionally play with a ball is the street."
