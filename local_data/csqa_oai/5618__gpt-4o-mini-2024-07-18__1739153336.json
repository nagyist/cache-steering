  "query": "Question: If you break someone's nose while wrestling what will come out of it?\n\nChoices:\nA: erections\nB: wins\nC: bruises\nD: aches and pains\nE: blood",
  "steps": [
    "First, breaking someone's nose typically causes physical damage to the nasal structure.",
    "When the nose is broken, one of the most common consequences is bleeding, as the blood vessels in the area are ruptured.",
    "The medical term for bleeding from the nose is \"epistaxis,\" which is commonly observed after a nasal injury.",
    "Although bruises could also form around the area due to injury, they are a secondary effect of the broken nose.",
    "The mention of \"aches and pains\" is also relevant, but it is more general and doesn't specifically refer to the immediate consequence of a broken nose.",
    "\"Erections\" do not relate to the physical injury of a broken nose and aren't a direct consequence of wrestling.",
    "\"Wins\" is also not applicable here since the question pertains to physical outcomes rather than competition outcomes.",
    "Given these considerations, the most direct and immediate outcome of breaking someone's nose while wrestling would be bleeding."
