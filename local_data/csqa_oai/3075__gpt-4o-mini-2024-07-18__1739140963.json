  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider what options are available for storing a drink that won't be used soon.",
    "The choices provided are a cabinet, a camelback, a cup, a backpack, and a can.",
    "A cup is typically used for immediate consumption, so it wouldn\u2019t be suitable for long-term storage.",
    "A camelback is primarily a hydration pack, designed for carrying beverages during activities; it wouldn\u2019t be ideal for storing a drink for a long time without usage.",
    "A backpack can carry drinks, but it doesn't specifically serve as a storage solution for drinks if they are not immediately needed.",
    "A can is a sealed container that is designed for drinks, but it is usually consumed relatively soon after being opened.",
    "A cabinet is specifically designed for storage and is likely the best choice for placing a drink that you do not plan to use soon.",
    "Judging by the purposes of each option, a cabinet provides the safest and most appropriate option for long-term storage."
