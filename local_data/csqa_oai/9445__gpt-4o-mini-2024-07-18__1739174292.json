  "query": "Question: James went to Sarah's birthday party on the day after his father died.  He wanted her to be what?\n\nChoices:\nA: mourn\nB: dead day\nC: happy\nD: new age\nE: funeral",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James attended Sarah's birthday party after his father's death, which indicates he is in a somber mood but still felt the need to celebrate Sarah's birthday.",
    "Since it was Sarah's birthday party, the occasion is typically a celebration rather than a time for mourning or sadness.",
    "James's presence at the party suggests that he wanted to ensure Sarah enjoyed her special day, despite his own grief from losing his father.",
    "The term \"happy\" aligns with the general purpose of birthday celebrations, which is to bring joy and happiness to the person being celebrated.",
    "Choices like \"mourn,\" \"funeral,\" and \"dead day\" convey negativity or sorrow, which are not suitable for a birthday context.",
    "\"New age\" could be relevant to birthdays in a broader sense but does not specifically capture what James would want for Sarah on her birthday.",
    "Overall, the focus should be on what James hoped for Sarah in light of the celebration that day.",
    "Given the context of a birthday party, the most logical and fitting choice for what James wanted for Sarah is her happiness."
