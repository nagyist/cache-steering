    "The question indicates that the people wanted to stop the parade; thus, they needed to create an obstacle to achieve this goal.",
    "Among the choices given, we need to identify which option best represents an action or setup that could effectively block or hinder a parade.",
    "A carnival usually involves festivities and entertainment, which would not be a method of stopping a parade.",
    "A public place could serve as a location for the parade or a gathering but does not inherently act to thwart it.",
    "An apartment is a type of building and does not relate to stopping a parade at all.",
    "A space shuttle has no relevance to a ground-based parade, making it an unlikely choice as an obstacle.",
    "A roadblock, on the other hand, is specifically designed to obstruct traffic and could effectively stop a parade from proceeding.",
    "Considering these analyses, a roadblock is the only option that directly aligns with the intent to thwart the parade."
