  "steps": [
    "The question asks about sharing files with someone and the necessary connection for that action.",
    "When considering different ways to share files, \"wires\" might imply physical connections like USB cables, but it's not the only method.",
    "A \"freeway\" has no relevance to file sharing as it pertains to transportation rather than digital connections.",
    "\"Radio\" suggests communication through radio waves, but it's not commonly used for direct file transfers between users.",
    "An \"electrical circuit\" generally refers to the path that electrical current flows through and does not directly pertain to file sharing.",
    "A \"computer network\" provides a system that allows multiple computers to connect to each other to facilitate file sharing, whether wired or wireless.",
    "With a computer network, files can be shared over the internet or local connections, making it the most suitable option for this context.",
    "Examining all the options, \"computer network\" stands out as the most logical and relevant choice for file sharing capabilities.",
    "Verifying the options further confirms that indeed, a computer network is what enables file sharing most effectively."
