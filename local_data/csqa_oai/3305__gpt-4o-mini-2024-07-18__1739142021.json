  "query": "Question: What is a performance by actors on tv to promote buying a certain product?\n\nChoices:\nA: newspaper\nB: show\nC: theatre\nD: movie\nE: commercial",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the answer, we need to examine what the question is asking: it refers to a performance by actors on TV that promotes the purchase of a specific product.",
    "The context suggests we are looking for a type of performance that is specifically designed for advertising purposes.",
    "Looking at the options, \"newspaper\" (A) does not fit since it is a print medium and not a performance.",
    "\"Show\" (B) is broad and can refer to many different types of performances, but it does not specifically imply advertising or promotion.",
    "\"Theatre\" (C) refers to live performances typically held in physical venues, and thus does not apply since we are focusing on TV.",
    "\"Movie\" (D) refers to films which are also not typically designated as promotional performances for a product on TV.",
    "\"Commercial\" (E) specifically refers to brief performances that aim to advertise and promote products, and they are primarily broadcasted on TV.",
    "Given that \"commercial\" aligns with the description of promoting a product through a performance by actors on TV, this will be the most suitable choice."
