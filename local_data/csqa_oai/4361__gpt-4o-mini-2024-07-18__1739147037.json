  "query": "Question: The invasive A.I. was designed to scan the crowd, where most saw a mass of humanity the evil machine could pick out each what?\n\nChoices:\nA: solitary\nB: single person\nC: few people\nD: crowd\nE: individual",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions an \"invasive A.I.\" that scans the crowd, suggesting that the A.I. has advanced capabilities to differentiate between individuals in a populated space.",
    "The phrase \"where most saw a mass of humanity\" implies that the A.I. can see beyond the surface level of the crowd, which most people perceive as a large group without distinction.",
    "The wording \"pick out\" indicates that the A.I. can identify and isolate specific entities from the crowd, rather than viewing them as indistinguishable objects.",
    "Looking at the choices provided:\n- A: \"solitary\" suggests something alone, but doesn\u2019t emphasize the scanning process.\n- B: \"single person\" implies the A.I. is able to identify one individual among many.\n- C: \"few people\" implies it can identify a small group, which may not be the focus of the scanning technology.\n- D: \"crowd\" contradicts the purpose of distinguishing specific entities since it's synonymous with mass.\n- E: \"individual\" also emphasizes the specific nature of the identification, similar to \"single person.\"",
    "\"Single person\" (B) suggests pinpointing one individual specifically while \"individual\" (E) can be more general, as it can also encompass the broader concept of any person.",
    "However, in a context where the A.I. is designed to scan and select, \"individual\" conveys the idea of being able to identify any person at a more nuanced level when compared to \"single person.\"",
    "Both B and E are strong candidates, but given the context of the A.I. choosing distinct entities rather than focusing on merely one, \"individual\" captures the essence of the technology's capability.",
    "Thus, based on the reasoning above, the best fit is \"individual\" as it aligns most closely with A.I.'s ability to discern various people in a crowd."
