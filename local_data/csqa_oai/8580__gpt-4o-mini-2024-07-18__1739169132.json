  "steps": [
    "The situation describes a child running quickly and hitting their foot on a rock, which suggests an accident or injury.",
    "When a person, particularly a child, hits their foot on a rock while running, it is logical that they might lose their balance or experience pain.",
    "Considering the scenario, losing balance often leads to falling down after such an incident.",
    "The other options do not logically follow after hitting a foot on a rock\u2014playing tag (A) would be unlikely immediately following an injury, while flying rock (C) is not a reasonable outcome from this action, and breathing (D) is an involuntary action that doesn\u2019t relate to the incident, and becoming an adult (E) is completely unrelated to the events described.",
    "Thus, the most likely and immediate consequence after hitting his foot on the rock would be that the child falls down (B)."
