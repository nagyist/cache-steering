  "query": "Question: Where do lizards like to sun themselves?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden\nB: jazz club\nC: tropical rainforest\nD: rocky places\nE: tanning bed",
  "steps": [
    "Lizards are cold-blooded reptiles, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature.",
    "To warm up, lizards need to sun themselves in areas that provide adequate sunlight.",
    "Potential options for sunbathing include open areas where they can absorb heat directly from the sun.",
    "A garden typically has open spaces but can also have shade, which may not be ideal for sunbathing.",
    "A jazz club, being indoors and usually dimly lit, would not be suitable for lizards to sun themselves.",
    "A tropical rainforest, while warm and humid, usually has a dense canopy that limits direct sunlight penetration.",
    "Rocky places often have sunny spots between the rocks where lizards can bask in sunlight without obstruction.",
    "Tanning beds are artificial and not a natural habitat where lizards would be found.",
    "Considering all the options, rocky places clearly provide the best combination of sunlight and a natural environment for lizards to sunbathe."
