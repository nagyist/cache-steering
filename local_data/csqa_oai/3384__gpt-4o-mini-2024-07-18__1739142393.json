  "query": "Question: Where do you store your deodorant when not using it?\n\nChoices:\nA: medicine cabinet\nB: spray\nC: medicine chest\nD: own bathroom\nE: shower",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the storage location of deodorant when it is not in use.",
    "Deodorants typically need to be stored in a cool, dry place to maintain their effectiveness.",
    "A medicine cabinet is a common place to store personal care items, including deodorant.",
    "A medicine chest is another term that could refer to a similar storage space as a medicine cabinet.",
    "The option \"own bathroom\" suggests a general location but does not specify a specific storage area.",
    "\"Shower\" is typically where body care routines happen but may not be the best place to store deodorant when not in use due to humidity.",
    "The option \"spray\" does not make sense in the context of a storage location; it is a type or format of deodorant.",
    "Between A (medicine cabinet), C (medicine chest), and D (own bathroom), the former two are more specific storage areas suitable for deodorant.",
    "I need to distinguish between A and C. Both A and C refer to similar storage options, and the terms may vary by region or preference.",
    "Considering common usage, \"medicine cabinet\" (A) is a more standard term for personal care item storage."
