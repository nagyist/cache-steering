  "query": "Question: What kind of place could have thousands of statue?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: theatre\nC: large city\nD: water fountain\nE: central park",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of where thousands of statues might be found. Statues can be located in a variety of settings, but the sheer number makes certain options more plausible than others.",
    "Next, I analyze each option. A church might have some statues, often religious figures, but it's unlikely to have thousands.",
    "Then, I consider a theatre. While a theatre could have decorative elements, it typically does not house thousands of statues either.",
    "Next, I evaluate the possibility of a \"large city.\" Large cities can have numerous statues in parks, squares, and public buildings, making thousands of statues more feasible.",
    "I then look at the option of a water fountain. While large fountains may have decorative statues, thousands in one fountain is implausible.",
    "Lastly, I consider a central park. While a central park can host many statues, particularly in large urban parks, it is not guaranteed to have thousands spread throughout it.",
    "Comparing all options, the best fit seems to be a \"large city\" because it can encompass numerous locations with a high quantity of statues, including parks, monuments, and public spaces."
