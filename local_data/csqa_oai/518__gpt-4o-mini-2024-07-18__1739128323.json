  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"everybody raised a drink and cheered\" suggests a celebratory action, as raising a drink usually indicates a toast or recognition of a moment.",
    "Out of the choices provided, \"toasting\" (choice B) aligns closely with the action of raising a drink, as it is common to raise a glass in celebration or honor during a toast.",
    "Next, the term \"celebrating\" (choice E) also fits well, as cheering often accompanies celebrations, which can involve toasting.",
    "Option A (were thirsty) seems less relevant here. Just because people are raising drinks does not imply they were thirsty; they could be celebrating or toasting regardless of thirst.",
    "Option C (getting drunk) does not directly relate to the act of raising a drink and cheering, as it implies an excessive indulgence rather than a specific action that people participate in socially.",
    "Option D (refreshment) implies quenching thirst but does not capture the social aspect of raising a drink and cheering, which typically signifies a gathering with a purpose.",
    "Now, we should compare B (toasting) and E (celebrating) as the two most relevant options, both capturing the essence of the action described.",
    "Since \"toasting\" is a specific act often associated with a celebration, it could be viewed as a subset of \"celebrating.\" Thus, celebrating is broader, while toasting is more specific.",
    "However, since the context provides an action (raising a drink and cheering) that strongly indicates a celebration, \"celebrating\" encompasses the entire scenario more completely than just \"toasting.\""
