  "query": "Question: What does an interstate highway go accross?\n\nChoices:\nA: united states of america\nB: gps\nC: nebraska\nD: texas\nE: developed nations",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the primary purpose of an interstate highway. Interstate highways are designed to facilitate transportation across regions and states in the United States.",
    "Recognize that interstate highways connect multiple states together. They are a comprehensive system specifically within the United States.",
    "Consider each of the provided answer choices.",
    "Choice A refers to the \"United States of America,\" which is the overall system within which interstate highways operate.",
    "Choice B, \"GPS,\" is a navigation tool that does not directly represent what an interstate highway crosses but rather helps facilitate travel on such roads.",
    "Choice C, \"Nebraska,\" is a specific state that an interstate highway may cross but does not encompass the entire scope of what interstate highways are designed to do.",
    "Similarly, choice D, \"Texas,\" is another specific state which, like Nebraska, may be crossed by interstate highways.",
    "Choice E, \"developed nations,\" is too broad and does not represent the specific context of interstate highways, which are predominantly a feature of the United States.",
    "From the reasoning above, choice A, \"United States of America,\" is the only answer that correctly summarizes the entity that interstate highways go across as they link states within the country."
