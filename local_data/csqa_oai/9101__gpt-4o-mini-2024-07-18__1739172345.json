  "steps": [
    "The context mentions that Danny has a mouse that is jumping around when he moves it, which likely refers to a computer mouse rather than a live animal.",
    "I need to determine where a computer mouse might typically be found.",
    "The options provided include various places, some of which seem more relevant than others.",
    "Option A (abandoned houses) does not seem relevant as that does not typically relate to where a computer mouse would be.",
    "Option B (corn field) is also irrelevant for a computer mouse, as it refers to an agricultural setting.",
    "Option C (cupboard) could theoretically be a place where one might store office supplies or electronics, but it seems less likely for a mouse that is meant for immediate use.",
    "Option D (cabinet) might also refer to a place where tech gadgets could be stored, similar to a cupboard.",
    "Option E (desktop) makes the most sense because a computer mouse typically sits on or near a desktop for easy access during use.",
    "Given that Danny needed a new mouse, it follows that he would look on his desktop for the existing one that is malfunctioning.",
    "Thus, the best answer to where his mouse might be is on his desktop, as that is the most relevant and common place for a computer mouse."
