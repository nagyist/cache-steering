  "query": "Question: What is food that is able to be eaten?\n\nChoices:\nA: spoiled\nB: necessary to live\nC: edible\nD: supermarket\nE: unhealthy",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a type of food that is capable of being consumed.",
    "To answer this, we need to analyze the options provided to see which one aligns with the concept of food that can be eaten.",
    "Option A: \"spoiled\" refers to food that has gone bad and is not safe for consumption, so this does not fit.",
    "Option B: \"necessary to live\" describes food that is essential for survival, but it does not specifically indicate that the food is edible.",
    "Option C: \"edible\" clearly means that something is safe to eat, directly aligning with the question of what can be eaten.",
    "Option D: \"supermarket\" refers to a place where food is sold, not a type of food itself, so it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Option E: \"unhealthy\" describes food that may be bad for one's health, but it does not indicate whether it is edible or not.",
    "After evaluating all the options, \"edible\" stands out as the only term that specifically means something can be eaten."
