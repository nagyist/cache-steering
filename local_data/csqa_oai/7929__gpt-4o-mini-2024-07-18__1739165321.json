  "query": "Question: The companies had been working well together, so they decided to extend their working what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shorten\nB: contract\nC: compress\nD: fur\nE: retract",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that the companies had been working well together, which suggests a positive relationship between them.",
    "The phrase \"extend their working\" implies that there is a desire to increase or prolong the nature of their collaboration.",
    "Let's analyze the choices: \n- A: shorten - This contradicts the idea of \"extending.\"\n- B: contract - This could imply formalizing their agreement or making it legally binding, which aligns with the idea of extending a partnership.\n- C: compress - This also suggests reducing something, which is contrary to extending.\n- D: fur - This term does not fit contextually in relation to working together and is irrelevant.\n- E: retract - This also suggests pulling back, which again contradicts extending a collaboration.",
    "Since \"extend\" typically refers to making an existing situation longer or larger, the best choice that aligns with prolonging or enhancing their working relationship is to \"extend their working contract.\"",
    "Considering all of the above reasoning, the most appropriate answer is B."
