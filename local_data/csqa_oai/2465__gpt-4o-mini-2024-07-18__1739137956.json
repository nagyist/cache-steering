  "query": "Question: If there is no windows in the area where are you likely to find a fire extinguisher?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: stairwell\nC: school bus\nD: window\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question: it specifies an area without windows.",
    "Next, consider the purpose of a fire extinguisher, which is to provide immediate access to put out fires in case of an emergency.",
    "Evaluate the choices in terms of where one would typically find fire extinguishers and their placement in areas without windows.",
    "Choice A (house) may have fire extinguishers in various places, but a house usually has windows; therefore, it's less likely it will be in a windowless area.",
    "Choice B (stairwell) is plausible because it could be a windowless area and fire extinguishers are often found in stairwells for safety purposes in case of a fire in higher floors.",
    "Choice C (school bus) generally does have windows and may not necessarily have an accessible fire extinguisher, thus it's less likely to be the answer.",
    "Choice D (window) is not relevant as it contradicts the idea of no windows.",
    "Choice E (garage) can also have fire extinguishers, but garages typically do have ventilation options such as windows, increasing the likelihood of windows being present.",
    "After evaluating all options, the stairwell, being a location dedicated to safety without the requirement of natural light (windows), is the strongest candidate."
