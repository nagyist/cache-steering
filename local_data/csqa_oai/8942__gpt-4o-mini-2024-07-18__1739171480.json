  "steps": [
    "Identify what the question is asking. The question inquires about a specific place in the Pacific Northwest known for having many apple trees.",
    "Recall the geography of the Pacific Northwest region, which primarily includes states like Washington and Oregon.",
    "Consider the significance of apple orchards in the context of the Pacific Northwest. Washington state is widely recognized for its apple production, being one of the leading apple-producing states in the U.S.",
    "Examine the choices provided. Michigan and New York have significant apple industries, but they are not located in the Pacific Northwest.",
    "Assess if 'valley' and 'fields' can be considered specific locations. These are too vague and do not refer to specific geographic locations recognized for apple production.",
    "Narrow down the candidates based on the geographical focus of the question. The only clear candidate for a region with apple orchards in the Pacific Northwest is Washington State.",
    "Verify if Washington State has a notable reputation for apple production. Yes, it is often called the \"Apple State.\"",
    "Confirm that other options (Michigan, New York, valley, fields) do not satisfy the requirement of being in the Pacific Northwest or are too vague.",
    "Conclude that the correct answer is the only clear, specific place known for a significant number of apple trees in the Pacific Northwest. This is Washington State."
