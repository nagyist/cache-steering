  "query": "Question: After getting dressed very formally and getting the stereotypical viewing glasses, they went to the ticket office where?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie theaters\nB: eye doctor\nC: opera house\nD: auditorium\nE: end of line",
  "steps": [
    "The characters are described as being very formally dressed and wearing \"stereotypical viewing glasses.\"",
    "\"Very formally dressed\" suggests they are attending an event that typically requires formal attire, such as the opera or a concert.",
    "The mention of \"stereotypical viewing glasses\" could imply they are going somewhere where watching or viewing something is the primary activity, potentially relevant for theater or performance.",
    "Analyzing the ticket office location: a movie theater, an eye doctor, an opera house, an auditorium, and an end of line, not all destinations typically require tickets.",
    "The eye doctor would not require a ticket and doesn't fit with the formal attire or viewing glasses context.",
    "The end of line suggests a place that isn't typically associated with events, so it is also unlikely.",
    "Auditoriums can host various events but are less specific than the other choices.",
    "A movie theater is common, but attending a movie typically doesn\u2019t require formal attire.",
    "The opera house is a place where formal attire is expected and it matches with the viewing glasses for enjoying a performance.",
    "Comparing all factors, the most coherent choice together with the mentioned characteristics leans towards the opera house."
