  "query": "Question: Where would a zoo keep a lemur?\n\nChoices:\nA: bank\nB: australia\nC: cage\nD: forrest\nE: hole",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the environment where a zoo would typically house animals. Zoos are designed to provide a controlled environment for animals, allowing for their safety and the safety of visitors.",
    "Next, we note that lemurs are wild animals that need specific living conditions which can mimic their natural habitat, but still provide safety and accessibility for caregivers and visitors.",
    "We review the options provided. A bank is not an appropriate place for any animal. It is an establishment primarily for financial transactions.",
    "Australia is not a place provided by zoos to keep animals. While some zoos may exist in Australia, the term does not relate specifically to where a lemur would be housed.",
    "A cage is a common structure found in zoos designed specifically for containing animals. It provides a safe environment and prevents animals from escaping while allowing visitors to observe them.",
    "A forest, while a natural habitat for lemurs, does not apply to the context of a zoo where animals are kept in controlled environments.",
    "A hole is not a typical structure for animal containment in a zoo. It lacks the necessary features for safety and care.",
    "After analyzing all options, the most appropriate place for a zoo to house a lemur is a cage."
