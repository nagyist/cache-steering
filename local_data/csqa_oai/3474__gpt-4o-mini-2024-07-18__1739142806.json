    "A war zone (A) is where soldiers serve but is not typically a place for honoring them due to the nature of the environment.",
    "The White House (B) is a significant governmental location where ceremonies to honor soldiers might take place, such as state funerals or awards.",
    "Guns (C) are weapons used by soldiers; they are not a location where soldiers would be honored.",
    "A battlefield (D) refers to a location of combat and may serve as a site where soldiers are remembered, but it's typically not where formal honoring occurs.",
