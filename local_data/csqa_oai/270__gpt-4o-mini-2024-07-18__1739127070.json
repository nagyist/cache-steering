  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which appliances typically use water and soap in their operation.",
    "I know that washing machines are designed to clean clothes and rely on water and detergent (soap) for this process.",
    "Next, I will consider the other options: a space shuttle does not use water or soap in its primary operation, as it's designed for spacecraft missions.",
    "A blender primarily uses liquid (not necessarily water) to mix ingredients and doesn't involve soap in its function.",
    "Disneyland is a theme park and does not operate using water and soap as part of its function; it's an entertainment venue.",
    "The surface of the Earth is a geographic term and does not relate to an appliance or utilize water and soap functionally.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only appliance that routinely uses both water and soap is the washing machine.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer to the question is the washing machine, corresponding to option A."
