  "query": "Question: Sean made a mistake on the test, but it wasn't an accident.  Why did he do it?\n\nChoices:\nA: torment\nB: success\nC: correction\nD: correct answer\nE: on purpose",
  "steps": [
    "Sean made a mistake on the test, and it is stated that it wasn't an accident. This implies that his mistake was intentional or deliberate.",
    "The options provided are: A (torment), B (success), C (correction), D (correct answer), E (on purpose). I need to find out which option aligns with the idea of an intentional action.",
    "Since the mistake was not an accident, I can eliminate options that imply an unintended consequence. A (torment) does not directly relate to the context of making a mistake on a test. B (success) does not correlate with making a mistake. C (correction) sounds more like an action taken post-mistake than the act of making a mistake itself. D (correct answer) also implies a positive outcome which contradicts the idea of making a mistake.",
    "This leaves option E (on purpose), which directly corresponds to the statement that the mistake was not an accident. It implies that Sean intentionally made the mistake.",
    "Therefore, among all the given options, the one that best explains why Sean made the mistake is that he did it \u201con purpose.\u201d"

  "solution": "E"
