  "query": "Question: James is very interested in other planets.  He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what?\n\nChoices:\nA: love\nB: zoo\nC: school\nD: space shuttle\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "James is interested in planets and space exploration, specifically Mars. This indicates a strong fascination with outer space.",
    "Since he reads books about Mars, it is clear that he is gaining knowledge about space travel and Martian exploration.",
    "The phrase \"he dreams of being on what\" refers to an aspiration or ambition related to his interest.",
    "Considering the choices, \"love,\" \"zoo,\" and \"library\" do not align with James' interests in space or planets.",
    "\"School\" could potentially relate to his interest in learning about Mars but does not directly connect with his dream of traveling or being on Mars.",
    "\"D: space shuttle\" refers specifically to vehicles designed for space travel, which correlates directly with both his interests and aspirations regarding Mars.",
    "Since the context involves James dreaming of traveling beyond Earth, the most logical and fitting choice is related to space travel.",
    "Given that \"space shuttle\" is the only option directly tied to his dream of being in space, it stands out as the correct answer."
