    "A hand is commonly understood as a body part found at the end of an arm.",
    "The choices presented involve different terms that might not directly relate to the definition of a hand.",
    "Choice A, \"body part,\" suggests that a hand is a component of the human body.",
    "Choice B, \"foot,\" refers to a different body part found at the end of a leg and is not synonymous with a hand.",
    "Choice C, \"handglide,\" is a term that doesn't refer to the anatomical structure of a hand but might suggest a method of gliding using hands.",
    "Choice D, \"feet,\" again refers to a distinct body part unrelated to hands.",
    "Choice E, \"help,\" does not relate to the anatomical concept of a hand but rather the action of assisting or providing support.",
    "By examining all the choices, \"body part\" (A) directly describes what a hand is, while others do not.",
