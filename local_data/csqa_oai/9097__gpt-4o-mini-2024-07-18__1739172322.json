  "steps": [
    "The context states that \"to stay on the team he had to pass class,\" which indicates the importance of academic performance.",
    "Since he is working with a tutor, it implies that he is seeking help to improve his understanding and performance in the class.",
    "The most logical action they would begin to undertake with a tutor, especially in the context of improving grades, would be to engage in studying.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"study hard\" (C) fits perfectly with the idea of needing to improve academically.",
    "The other options don't align as well: \"homework\" (A) is specific and not an action they would necessarily begin together; \"smart\" (B) doesn't represent an action; \"take test\" (D) is a result of studying rather than what they began to do; \"study last minute\" (E) implies procrastination which doesn't demonstrate a commitment to passing the class.",
    "Thus, the choice that best reflects their actions together would be \"study hard.\""
