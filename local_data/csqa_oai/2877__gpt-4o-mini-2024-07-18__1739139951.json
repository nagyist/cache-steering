  "query": "Question: Which country is very known to have a mine and explosion problem?\n\nChoices:\nA: pennsylvania\nB: mountain\nC: cambodia\nD: desert\nE: canada",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the question, which mentions a \"mine and explosion problem.\" This suggests a country that has experienced issues related to landmines or unexploded ordnance.",
    "Next, I will consider the provided choices. Choices A, B, D, and E do not represent countries, as A (Pennsylvania) is a state in the USA, B (mountain) is a geographic feature, and D (desert) is a type of landscape. E (Canada) is a country but is not particularly known for mine and explosion problems.",
    "Considering choice C (Cambodia), I recall that Cambodia has a history of landmine contamination due to conflict in the latter half of the 20th century, especially from the Khmer Rouge era. This has led to ongoing issues with landmines and explosive remnants of war.",
    "Next, I will verify if there are any other countries among the options that might have a mine and explosion problem.",
    "Since A, B, D, and E do not represent countries known for mine issues, I reinforce that Cambodia is notably recognized for its extensive landmine problem.",
    "To confirm, I recall that various international organizations have focused on mine clearance efforts in Cambodia due to the severe impact on its civilian population.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all available choices and their relevance to the question, C (Cambodia) emerges as the definitive answer for the country known for having a mine and explosion problem."
