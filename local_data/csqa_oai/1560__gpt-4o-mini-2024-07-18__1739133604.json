  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where soldiers who are not deployed eat their food.",
    "Typically, soldiers who are not deployed are stationed at various locations, and one possible place for them to eat is where they live or stay.",
    "Option A suggests they might eat at a neighbor's house, which is not common for soldiers and doesn't apply specifically to their living situation.",
    "Option B states they eat at home. This is a plausible scenario as many soldiers live off base or return home when not deployed.",
    "Option C refers to a military base. Soldiers often have dining facilities available on base where they can eat their meals regularly.",
    "Option D mentions a shelf. This is not a location where food is eaten; rather, it is a storage space for food items.",
    "Option E suggests they eat in a kitchen. While this is true, it does not specify the context specifically related to military life.",
    "Between options B and C, while soldiers can eat at home, the military base provides a designated and structured environment for meals.",
    "It is common for soldiers to utilize the facilities at military bases because of convenience and camaraderie with fellow service members.",
    "Thus, for soldiers not deployed, a military base is a likely and common place for them to eat regular meals."
