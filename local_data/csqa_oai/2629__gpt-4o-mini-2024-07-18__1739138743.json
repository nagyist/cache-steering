  "steps": [
    "I want a glass of milk, so I need to consider where it is likely to be available.",
    "One common place to find milk in a school setting is the cafeteria, as they often serve drinks alongside meals.",
    "Looking at other options, \"home\" would not be relevant since I am already at school and am looking for immediate access to milk.",
    "\"Under the cow\" is a humorous option but not practical, as I am at school and not on a farm.",
    "The \"menu\" does not directly provide milk; it would simply list available food and drink options.",
    "\"Accompaniment to meal\" indicates that milk could be consumed with food, but it does not specify where one would actually find it.",
    "After eliminating the options that are not applicable, the cafeteria is the most logical choice to find a glass of milk at school."
