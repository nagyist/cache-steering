  "query": "Question: Rap is not usually associate with what music often performed by an orchestra?\n\nChoices:\nA: folk\nB: rock\nC: good music\nD: country music\nE: classical",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the characteristics of rap music. Rap is typically characterized by rhythmic vocal style and is often associated with urban culture.",
    "Next, consider the characteristics of music often performed by an orchestra. This includes complex compositions, often utilizing classical instruments like strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion.",
    "Now, look at the choices provided. Folk music usually includes acoustic instruments and traditional themes, which can be performed in various settings and may sometimes involve orchestral arrangements.",
    "Rock music typically features electric instruments and can incorporate orchestral elements, especially in symphonic rock.",
    "Country music often includes storytelling and can also feature orchestral instruments in arrangements, especially in more symphonic styles.",
    "Classical music is directly associated with orchestral performance and consists of complex compositions that do not relate to rap.",
    "Evaluate the option \"good music.\" This is subjective and doesn't explicitly relate to orchestral performance.",
    "Since rap is distinctly outside the realm of what is traditionally associated with orchestral music, the choice that represents the least association is classical music, which represents a direct contrast to rap.",
    "Confirm that classical music is the clear outlier. It is fundamentally different from rap and typically performed by orchestras."
