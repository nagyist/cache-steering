  "query": "Question: The Canadian farmer wondered if potatoes would grow where he lived, where was his likely location?\n\nChoices:\nA: main course\nB: prince edward island\nC: ireland\nD: french fries\nE: idaho",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the climate and agricultural conditions suitable for growing potatoes. Potatoes generally thrive in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and fertile soil.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Options A (main course) and D (french fries) are not geographical locations; they refer to food items and therefore can be disregarded.",
    "Now, analyze option B (Prince Edward Island). This region in Canada is known for its agriculture, including potato farming, making it a plausible candidate.",
    "Look at option C (Ireland). Ireland is famous for its potato production historically, but it is not located in Canada. The question asks for a location where a Canadian farmer lives.",
    "Consider option E (Idaho). Idaho is known for being one of the top potato-producing states in the US, indicating that potatoes do grow there, but it is also not located in Canada.",
    "With this analysis, it appears that the best candidate based on the information provided and the context of the question is Prince Edward Island, as it aligns with being a place where a Canadian farmer could grow potatoes."
