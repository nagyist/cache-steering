  "query": "Question: What could have a title on it which takes up a large percentage of the space?\n\nChoices:\nA: magazine article\nB: safe deposit box\nC: indicating accomplishment\nD: indicating identity\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what type of items or concepts typically have titles that occupy a large portion of their visible surface area.",
    "Next, consider various options: a magazine article usually has a prominent title, while items like a safe deposit box or library likely do not showcase large titles since they contain or hold materials rather than displaying titles.",
    "Now, looking deeper into the remaining relevant options: \"indicating accomplishment\" or \"indicating identity\" could also imply a title, but we must analyze if these take up a substantial amount of space.",
    "An \"indicating accomplishment\" title could often be on certificates or awards, where the title can indeed take up a significant area. However, it still depends on how it is designed, and not all accomplishment indicators have large titles.",
    "An \"indicating identity\" title might refer to items such as name tags, ID cards, or similar entities. Here again, the title size can vary significantly, but usually doesn't take up a large majority of the space.",
    "On the other hand, a magazine article typically has a large and visually striking title that can take up a considerable part of the front cover or the first page of an article, visually dominating the layout.",
    "Thus, when comparing the likelihood of these options having a sizable title, the magazine article is most likely to meet that criterion since it is designed to attract attention with a big title.",
    "In conclusion, among the choices, the magazine article consistently stands out with its title that occupies a significant percentage of the space it covers."
