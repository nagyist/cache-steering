  "query": "Question: The shark was sick of the confines of its tank, what was it looking for?\n\nChoices:\nA: sea world\nB: tomales bay\nC: great oceans\nD: the key\nE: tropical waters",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that the shark is feeling confined in its tank, suggesting a desire for a larger, more open environment.",
    "The phrase \"sick of the confines\" implies that the shark is seeking freedom or a return to a more natural habitat.",
    "Among the options, \"great oceans\" suggests vastness and a natural setting, much different from a tank.",
    "\"Sea world\" and \"tomales bay\" are more specific locations which may also imply some form of confinement.",
    "\"The key\" does not relate to the idea of seeking a large, open space or natural habitat.",
    "\"Tropical waters\" suggests a type of water but still doesn't convey the same vastness as \"great oceans\".",
    "Out of all the options, \"great oceans\" best aligns with the desire for freedom and space.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, \"great oceans\" is the most appropriate choice."
