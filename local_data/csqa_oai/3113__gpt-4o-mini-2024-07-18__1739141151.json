  "query": "Question: where do you buy the freshest apples?\n\nChoices:\nA: shop\nB: fridge\nC: farmers market\nD: a tree\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environment in which apples are typically sold.",
    "Freshness can depend on how recently the apples were harvested and how they are stored.",
    "A farmers market generally offers produce directly from growers, often picked and sold on the same day.",
    "A tree would provide the freshest apples directly from the source, but it isn't a purchasable option for most people.",
    "A shop can offer apples, but these may not always be fresh, as they could have been stored for a longer time.",
    "A fridge is not a place to buy apples; it's a storage location.",
    "A grocery store typically stocks apples, but they may not be as fresh as those found at a farmers market.",
    "Comparing the choices, the farmers market stands out for fresh produce availability.",
    "Considering all the factors, a farmers market is likely to provide the freshest apples available for purchase."
