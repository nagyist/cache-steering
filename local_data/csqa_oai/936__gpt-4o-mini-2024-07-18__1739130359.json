  "query": "Question: What is a convenient place for a bus station?\n\nChoices:\nA: maps\nB: street\nC: catch bus\nD: city centre\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what characteristics define a convenient place for a bus station. Typically, convenience refers to accessibility and proximity to common destinations.",
    "Next, a bus station should be located where it is easily reachable for a large number of people. This often means being close to major roads or pedestrian pathways.",
    "I will analyze the options provided. The option \"A: maps\" does not represent a physical location, so it cannot be a convenient place for a bus station.",
    "Next, \"B: street\" could refer to a location, but it is quite vague and does not specify which street or how convenient it would be for bus service.",
    "Then I consider \"C: catch bus\", which is again not a physical location and thus cannot be a convenient place for a bus station.",
    "Now, looking at \"D: city centre,\" this is often a highly populated area with many amenities and services, making it a prime location for a bus station.",
    "Lastly, \"E: school\" could be a convenient place for a bus station, especially for students. However, it is likely to serve a more limited clientele compared to the city centre.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most convenient place for a bus station is the city centre, as it would serve a larger population and provide better access to various services."
