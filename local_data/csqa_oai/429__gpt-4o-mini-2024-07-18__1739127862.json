  "query": "Question: Where is a likely place to view an old copy machine?\n\nChoices:\nA: industrial area\nB: museum\nC: barn\nD: school\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature of an old copy machine. It is a piece of office equipment that typically has been used in work environments.",
    "Evaluate the options based on environments where old copy machines would likely still be found or displayed.",
    "A barn may occasionally have old equipment, but it is not a typical place for office equipment, making it less likely.",
    "An industrial area might house old machines, but they would likely be more industrial rather than office-related.",
    "A museum often displays historical items, and if the copy machine has historical significance, it could be appropriate to find one there.",
    "Schools may have older equipment, but they also tend to upgrade technology, making them less likely to have an \"old\" copy machine on display.",
    "Offices commonly upgrade their equipment, but older models might still be found in the back storage or abandoned style; however, they aren't likely to be prominently displayed or available for viewing.",
    "Considering the evaluation, the most fitting answer aligns with the idea of public viewing of historical or old items: the museum."
