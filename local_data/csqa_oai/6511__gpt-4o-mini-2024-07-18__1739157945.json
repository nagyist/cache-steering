  "query": "Question: The shark kept bumping into piers and couldn't seem to get out into open water, where was it stuck?\n\nChoices:\nA: television show\nB: pacific ocean\nC: san francisco bay\nD: new england\nE: gulf of mexico",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question. It mentions a shark that is bumping into piers, which suggests a confined area close to human structures.",
    "Next, evaluate each answer choice. A television show does not provide a physical location, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Now, look at the Pacific Ocean. While it is a vast body of water, it is open and does not match the description of a shark being stuck near piers.",
    "The next option is San Francisco Bay. This is a well-known area that has piers and could easily confine a shark, preventing it from reaching open water.",
    "New England is a region that includes various coastal areas, but it lacks a specific reference to piers associated with a significant shark issue. It also does not specifically provide the context of a single bay.",
    "The Gulf of Mexico, like the Pacific Ocean, is a large open body of water and would not be a reasonable choice for a shark getting stuck by piers.",
    "Thus far, the only option that consistently aligns with the scenario of a shark bumping into piers is San Francisco Bay.",
    "Considering the other options, San Francisco Bay is the most fitting location for a shark experiencing issues navigating in the presence of piers.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing each option with respect to the scenario presented, the final answer is confidently San Francisco Bay."
