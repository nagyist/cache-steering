    "First, let's analyze the effects of murder on the family of the victim. One immediate effect is emotional pain.",
    "Great sorrow is a likely reaction for the family of the victim, as they lose a loved one in a tragic and violent manner.",
    "Next, we consider fear. The family might experience fear about personal safety, anxiety about the criminal justice system, or fear of future violence.",
    "A guilty conscience is typically associated with the perpetrator of the murder rather than the victim's family.",
    "Bankruptcy might occur due to legal fees or loss of income, but it is not a direct emotional or psychological consequence of the murder.",
    "Finding God could be a response for some individuals in seeking comfort or answers, but this is not universally applicable.",
    "Among the options, great sorrow (D) and fear (B) emerge as the most directly relevant effects on the family of the murdered.",
    "However, great sorrow (D) is a more universal and immediate emotional response than fear (B), which can depend on the specifics of the situation.",
    "After considering all effects, great sorrow is the most significant and defining impact on the family of someone who has been murdered."
