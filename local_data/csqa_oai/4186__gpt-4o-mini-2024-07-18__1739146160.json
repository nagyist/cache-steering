  "query": "Question: A monkey is native to what place that usually has no people?\n\nChoices:\nA: research laboratory\nB: south africa\nC: rain forest\nD: playful mood\nE: canada",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is meant by a \"monkey\" and its natural habitat. Monkeys are typically found in regions with lush vegetation and abundant food sources.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option A, \"research laboratory,\" does not fit as it is a human-made environment.",
    "Option B, \"south africa,\" is a geographical location, but it does not specifically indicate a place typically devoid of human presence, as many areas in South Africa are inhabited.",
    "Option C, \"rain forest,\" is a natural habitat known for its dense vegetation, high biodiversity, and, generally, lower human population density.",
    "Next, assess option D, \"playful mood,\" which is an emotional state and not a location, thus making it irrelevant to the question.",
    "Finally, consider option E, \"canada.\" This is a country that has regions with wilderness, but it does not specifically refer to a location where monkeys typically live, as monkeys are not native to Canada.",
    "From this analysis, the best answer that indicates a natural habitat for monkeys that usually has no people is \"rain forest.\""
