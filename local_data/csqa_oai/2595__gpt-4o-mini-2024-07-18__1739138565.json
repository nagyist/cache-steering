  "steps": [
    "Identify the purpose of the question, which is to find a location where one can purchase a piano.",
    "Evaluate each of the given options as a potential place to buy a piano.",
    "Option A, music school: Music schools primarily focus on teaching music rather than selling instruments, so it's unlikely you can buy a piano there.",
    "Option B, music store: Music stores are specifically designed to sell musical instruments, including pianos. This is a strong candidate.",
    "Option C, concert hall: Concert halls are venues for performances and do not sell instruments, making this option irrelevant for purchasing a piano.",
    "Option D, neighbor's house: While it might be possible to buy a piano from a neighbor, it\u2019s not a common or standard way to purchase a piano.",
    "Option E, symphony orchestra drawing room: This option suggests a location associated with orchestra members and performances; it is not a retail space for selling pianos.",
    "Given the evaluations, the most logical place to buy a piano is the music store."
