  "steps": [
    "When people touch a hot stove, they immediately experience a strong and painful sensation.",
    "This sensation is caused by the high temperature of the stove, which can damage skin tissues.",
    "The pain signals are sent to the brain quickly to prompt the person to withdraw their hand.",
    "For most individuals, touching a hot stove leads to a physical burn injury.",
    "Since the injury is painful, it also serves as a serious reminder to avoid touching hot surfaces in the future.",
    "In this context, the action that directly occurs as a result of touching a hot stove is a burn.",
    "The other choices do not relate directly to the physiological response to touching a hot stove.",
    "Choices B (teach each other), C (believe in god), D (learn), and E (cross themselves) do not directly describe the consequence of that action.",
    "Therefore, the most accurate representation of the immediate consequence of touching a hot stove is that people burn themselves."
