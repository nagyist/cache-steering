  "steps": [
    "To begin with, an apple tree grows outdoors, typically in an agricultural or natural setting where suitable conditions for fruit-bearing trees exist.",
    "Next, one typically sees an apple tree in locations known for apple cultivation, which includes many regions in the world, but it is especially prevalent in certain areas of the United States and other temperate countries.",
    "Considering the context of seeing an apple tree, it implies the person is likely to be in an environment where trees can grow, thus leading to a conclusion that they are outside rather than indoors.",
    "Looking at the choices available, 'A: canada' and 'E: washington state' are specific locations, while 'B: spring' refers to a season that is associated with apple blossoming.",
    "However, the most direct answer regarding the physical presence of an apple tree would not be seasonal or specific to a location, but more about the state of being.",
    "Thus, one tends to be \"outside\" when seeing an apple tree, as trees grow outdoors and this is the most logical and general answer without needing to tie it to specific geography.",
    "Among the choices, 'D: outside' is the only option that solidifies the idea of a tree being seen in an outdoor environment."
