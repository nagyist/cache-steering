  "query": "Question: Going into a trance is often associated with what sort of unconscious involuntary movement at night?\n\nChoices:\nA: hungry\nB: peacefulness\nC: religious experience\nD: loss of balance\nE: sleepwalking",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify what unconscious involuntary movement at night is generally associated with going into a trance.",
    "Going into a trance often refers to a state of altered consciousness, which may occur during sleep or when someone is in a deeply relaxed state.",
    "I recall that sleepwalking is a behavior that occurs during non-REM sleep, which is a state of altered consciousness where individuals may not be fully aware of their surroundings.",
    "Out of the choices provided, I need to find which one specifically relates to involuntary movements that occur during the night.",
    "The options A (hungry) and B (peacefulness) do not directly relate to nocturnal movements.",
    "Option C (religious experience) also is not specifically linked to involuntary movement; rather, it's more of a subjective experience.",
    "Option D (loss of balance) can occur for a variety of reasons but is not specifically tied to the concept of going into a trance or unconscious movement at night.",
    "Considering the remaining option, E (sleepwalking), it is known that sleepwalking involves moving about while in a state of sleep and occurs during transitions in consciousness, making it closely related to the idea of going into a trance.",
    "I conclude that the choice that best describes unconscious involuntary movement at night associated with going into a trance is indeed sleepwalking."
