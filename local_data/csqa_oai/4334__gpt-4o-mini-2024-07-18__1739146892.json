  "query": "Question: There is no skylight or anything else to let in light in what kind of structure?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: office building\nC: windowless room\nD: roof\nE: glass box",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the structure that does not let in light, we need to analyze the characteristics of each option.",
    "A house typically has windows that allow light in, so it cannot be the correct answer.",
    "An office building generally has windows as well, thus allowing natural light, so it is not a suitable answer either.",
    "A windowless room is characterized by the absence of windows, which would prevent any light from entering. This makes it a strong candidate for the answer.",
    "A roof is not a complete structure and typically does not have the context of being a room; it doesn't directly describe whether light comes in or not.",
    "A glass box is specifically designed to let light in, as glass is transparent; it cannot be the answer.",
    "Comparing all options, the only structure described that is devoid of windows and thus lacks light is the windowless room.",
    "We can now finalize our reasoning: the correct answer is a structure specifically defined as having no windows, allowing no light in at all."
