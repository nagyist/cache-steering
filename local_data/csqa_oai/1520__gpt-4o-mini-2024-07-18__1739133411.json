  "steps": [
    "To determine where children would go to see different animals, we need to consider places that are known for having various species of animals.",
    "Schools typically focus on education and do not have live animals on display, so option A, school, is unlikely.",
    "A zoo is specifically established to house and display a wide variety of animals for public viewing, making option B, zoo, a strong candidate.",
    "A soccer game, represented by option C, is primarily a sporting event and does not involve animals, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Disneyland, option D, is an amusement park that features rides and attractions but is not primarily focused on animals; it may have some animal exhibits but not in the same capacity as a zoo.",
    "A cricket stadium, option E, like a soccer game, is centered around a sporting event and would not typically feature animals.",
    "Considering the purpose and primary focus of each option, the only place where children can clearly see a diverse array of animals is a zoo."
