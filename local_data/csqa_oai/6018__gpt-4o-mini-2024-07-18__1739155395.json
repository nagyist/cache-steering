  "steps": [
    "The question involves maintaining the coolness of a gel container.",
    "We need to consider environments that are typically cool or can maintain low temperatures.",
    "First, let's evaluate the choices: \n- A tube may not provide a cool environment. \n- A theatrical light generates heat, making it unsuitable.",
    "The option \"park\" could be cool but is not a controlled environment.",
    "Next, evaluating \"refrigerator\": it is designed to maintain low temperatures and is a controlled cooling environment.",
    "Lastly, \"bathroom\" may have some cooling effect due to moisture but generally doesn\u2019t guarantee cool temperatures as a refrigerator does.",
    "Comparing all options, the refrigerator is the best fit to keep the gel cool as per the instructions on the container."
