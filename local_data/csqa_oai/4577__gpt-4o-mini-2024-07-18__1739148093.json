  "query": "Question: Some cars have racing lines on them called?\n\nChoices:\nA: seat belts\nB: breaks to help stop\nC: designs\nD: stripes\nE: radios",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine what characteristic racing lines refer to on cars. Racing lines usually indicate a visual feature rather than a functional component.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"seat belts\" (A) are a safety feature, while \"brakes\" (B) are a functional component for stopping the vehicle. Neither of these relates to visual design.",
    "Next, I see \"designs\" (C) which could refer to various visual elements, but it is somewhat vague.",
    "The term \"stripes\" (D) appears to indicate specific markings or patterns applied to the car's exterior, which aligns with the idea of racing lines as a visual design element.",
    "Finally, \"radios\" (E) are related to entertainment in the car, which again does not match the idea of racing lines.",
    "Given \"stripes\" is a more precise fit for what racing lines could refer to, while \"designs\" is too broad and not exclusively related to racing aesthetics.",
    "Thus, among the choices, the closest term that signifies visual markings on a car, such as racing lines, would be \"stripes.\""
