  "query": "Question: The sensor would just the distance then set off an alarm, the installation expert explained it was called a what kind of sensor?\n\nChoices:\nA: near\nB: closeness\nC: here\nD: proximity\nE: this",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a sensor that measures distance and sets off an alarm based on that measurement.",
    "Common types of sensors that detect distance include those used for detecting proximity to objects.",
    "Analyzing the provided choices, \"near\" and \"closeness\" imply a measurement related to distance, but they are not standard technical terms for sensors.",
    "The term \u201cproximity\u201d refers specifically to the closeness of an object and is commonly used in the context of sensors that detect how close something is.",
    "The term \"here\" does not relate to a type of sensor, nor does \"this,\" as they are more locational and not technical terms for measurement.",
    "Given this information, the most suitable answer that accurately describes a type of sensor that measures distance and sets off an alarm is \"D: proximity.\""
