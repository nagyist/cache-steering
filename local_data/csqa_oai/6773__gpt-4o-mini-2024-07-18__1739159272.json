  "query": "Question: The plate needed to be put away where did the mother put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: flea market\nB: kitchen cupboard\nC: dishwasher\nD: restaurant\nE: museum",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to understand what \"putting away\" usually implies in a domestic setting, particularly concerning a plate.",
    "Typically, when a plate is used, it's either cleaned and put in a storage area or left to air dry. The destination would be a place that safely stores dishes for future use.",
    "A flea market is not a place to store a plate; rather, it's a venue for selling items. Thus, option A can be ruled out.",
    "A restaurant is a commercial setting where dishes are used and then probably put in a cleaning area but not stored there for personal use. Thus, option D is also unlikely.",
    "A museum is related to displaying art or historical artifacts and wouldn\u2019t serve as a storage location for everyday dishes. Therefore, option E can be eliminated.",
    "A kitchen cupboard is a typical storage space for dishes, including plates, in a home. This makes option B a plausible choice.",
    "A dishwasher is for cleaning dirty dishes. Once the cleaning cycle is completed, the plates would typically need to be transferred somewhere else for storage. Therefore, option C is not where plates are \"put away.\"",
    "Now, I have narrowed down the most logical choice for where a mother would \"put away\" a plate, which is in the kitchen cupboard."
