  "query": "Question: Billy was a forgiving person.  When Marna confessed to him, she felt what?\n\nChoices:\nA: redemption\nB: absolution\nC: great relief\nD: very sad\nE: make up",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy was a forgiving person, which indicates that he tends to forgive others and possibly encourages them to feel a sense of relief after seeking forgiveness.",
    "Marna confessed to Billy, which suggests she was likely sharing something weighty or burdensome that she felt guilty about.",
    "Given that Billy is forgiving, Marna\u2019s confession to him may lead her to expect a positive reaction from him, possibly releasing her from her feelings of guilt.",
    "The word \"confessed\" implies that she was holding onto something troubling, which can create a sense of anxiety or burden until the secret is revealed.",
    "When someone confesses something they feel guilty about and receives forgiveness, it generally leads to feelings of relief because they no longer have to carry that burden alone.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate the choices:\n- A: redemption: This could apply, but it doesn't directly address how Marna might feel immediately after confessing.\n- B: absolution: Similar to redemption, it relates to being released from sin, but it doesn't explicitly describe her feelings.\n- C: great relief: This directly corresponds with the emotional aftermath one typically experiences after confessing to someone forgiving.\n- D: very sad: This contradicts the likely outcome of receiving forgiveness.\n- E: make up: This suggests an act of reconciliation but does not necessarily reflect her emotional state.",
    "Among the options, \"great relief\" is the most fitting choice because it clearly reflects how someone typically feels after confessing and being forgiven, particularly in the context of a forgiving person like Billy."
