  "query": "Question: Where would a human expect to find manufacturing operations?\n\nChoices:\nA: factory\nB: school\nC: grocery store\nD: band\nE: aircraft",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what manufacturing operations entail. Manufacturing involves the process of producing goods from raw materials, typically in a large-scale setting.",
    "Next, I will look at the choices provided and see which option is most associated with the production of goods.",
    "Option A, 'factory', is commonly known as a place where manufacturing happens. Factories are specifically designed and built for production.",
    "Option B, 'school', is primarily an educational institution and does not focus on manufacturing.",
    "Option C, 'grocery store', sells goods but does not typically engage in manufacturing processes.",
    "Option D, 'band', refers to a musical group and does not relate to manufacturing at all.",
    "Option E, 'aircraft', represents a type of transportation vehicle but does not specify a location for manufacturing.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only clear location associated with manufacturing is 'factory'.",
    "I will do a quick review of each option to confirm my reasoning: a factory is for manufacturing, a school is for education, a grocery store sells items, a band is a music group, and an aircraft is a product."
