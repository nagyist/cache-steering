  "query": "Question: What contains a ball to help it work efficiently?\n\nChoices:\nA: football field\nB: bearing\nC: gymnasium\nD: playground\nE: pool table",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify which option refers to something that contains a ball as part of its function or mechanism.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"bearing\" stands out because bearings are mechanical components that reduce friction between moving parts, often using balls (ball bearings) to facilitate smooth motion.",
    "The other options can be analyzed as follows: \n- A football field does not contain a ball in a mechanical sense; it is just a location for playing football.\n- A gymnasium is primarily a space for various sports and activities but is not specifically designed to use a ball mechanically.\n- A playground is an area for play and may have balls but is not pinpointed for efficiency in mechanical terms.\n- A pool table includes balls; however, it is not related to mechanical efficiency like bearings are.",
    "Given that \"bearing\" explicitly refers to a mechanical device that incorporates balls to assist in motion and reduce friction, it is the best choice.",
    "Now, I will confirm that no other option fits the criteria as well as \"bearing,\" particularly in the context of mechanical efficiency."
