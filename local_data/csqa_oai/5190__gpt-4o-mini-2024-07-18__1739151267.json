  "query": "Question: What is a yard usually part of?\n\nChoices:\nA: subdivision\nB: neighborhood\nC: file\nD: city\nE: property",
  "steps": [
    "A yard is typically an area of land surrounding a house or building.",
    "Yards are generally associated with residential properties where people live.",
    "The term \"property\" refers to a piece of real estate that can include a house and its surrounding yard.",
    "While a yard can be seen in subdivisions and neighborhoods, the most direct relationship is with \"property.\"",
    "A subdivision is a type of property development, so it may have yards, but it is not as general a term as \"property.\"",
    "\"Neighborhood\" is a larger area that may contain multiple properties, each with their own yards.",
    "\"File\" is not a relevant term when discussing yards, as it pertains to data rather than land.",
    "A \"city\" also encompasses many properties, but it is too broad for a specific relationship with a yard.",
    "Based on these considerations, the direct relationship of a yard to the available choices strongly suggests it is part of a property."
