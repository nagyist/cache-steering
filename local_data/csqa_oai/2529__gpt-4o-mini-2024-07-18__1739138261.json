  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the wife's reaction upon seeing her husband in new clothes, particularly focusing on how she spoke to him.",
    "The phrase \"looking sharp\" typically implies that someone is well-dressed or has a stylish appearance, which often elicits positive feedback.",
    "Considering the options provided, \"complimentary\" would align with a positive reaction to someone's new or stylish attire.",
    "The other choices\u2014\"inaccurate,\" \"inelegant,\" \"loudly,\" and \"dull\"\u2014do not suggest a favorable response or do not relate directly to how one might speak positively about someone's appearance.",
    "Analyzing the context further, a compliment would naturally arise when seeing someone who is well-dressed, reinforcing the idea that the wife would likely express admiration.",
    "Hence, the logical inference is that the wife would speak to her husband in a manner that is affirmative and kind about his new look.",
    "In conclusion, \"complimentary\" stands out as the most fitting choice in describing how his wife would speak to him given the positive context of the situation."
