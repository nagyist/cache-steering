  "query": "Question: I was driving a car and had a heart attack at 80 mph, what awaits me?\n\nChoices:\nA: new car\nB: wreak\nC: getting somewhere\nD: death\nE: getting tired",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a person driving at a high speed (80 mph) and experiencing a heart attack.",
    "A heart attack can lead to loss of consciousness, impaired ability to control a vehicle, and could result in a crash.",
    "Given that the person is at high speed, losing control of the vehicle would likely lead to an accident, or \"wreak.\"",
    "While having a heart attack often leads to serious consequences, the future in that specific scenario is most directly influenced by the event of the heart attack.",
    "Now considering the options: \"new car\" is impractical if an accident occurred, \"getting somewhere\" implies a destination which may not be relevant if a heart attack prevents reaching it, \"getting tired\" seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "The only choice that aligns with the dire situation of experiencing a heart attack while driving is \"death,\" especially given the lack of immediate medical assistance.",
    "While \"wreak\" might imply a crash or destruction, it doesn't encapsulate the finality of the event leading to severe consequences.",
    "In conclusion, given the gravity of suffering a heart attack while driving, the most logical outcome is death."
