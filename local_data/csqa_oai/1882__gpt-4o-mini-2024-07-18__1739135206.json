  "steps": [
    "The question describes a situation where a friend's leg is shaking due to nerves, which usually indicates anxiety or restlessness.",
    "The action of reaching out and grasping the leg suggests an intention to provide comfort or stability to the friend.",
    "To grasp or hold something is typically done to reduce movement or prevent it from shaking.",
    "The phrase \"so it would\" implies that the action of grasping is intended to change the state of the leg from shaking to a more stable position.",
    "Among the choices provided, we need to identify which option aligns with the concept of reducing or stopping the trembling.",
    "Choice A: \"rattle\" does not fit, as it implies movement rather than stillness.",
    "Choice B: \"be still\" is a valid option, but it sounds less natural in this context.",
    "Choice C: \"nod\" is not relevant since it doesn't relate to stopping the leg from shaking.",
    "Choice D: \"steady\" could work, but it is less clear than option E.",
    "Choice E: \"stay still\" directly conveys the intent to stop the shaking and suggests maintaining a state of stillness, aligning with the action of grasping."
