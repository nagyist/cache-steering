  "steps": [
    "Start by considering the natural habitat of a marmot. Marmots are typically found in mountainous and open grassy areas, such as meadows and alpine regions.",
    "Look at the choices given. \"Wilderness\" is a broad term, but it can definitely encompass the natural, mountainous habitats of marmots.",
    "Evaluate the choice \"South America\". Although there are species of marmots in North America, the term does not generally apply to South America, where other similar rodent species are found.",
    "Consider \"jungle\". Marmots are not found in jungles as they prefer open, alpine, and rocky terrains rather than dense, tropical forests.",
    "Assess the choice \"in its den\". While it is true that marmots live in dens, this option implies a specific location rather than a general likelihood of finding them.",
    "Evaluate \"New Zealand\". Marmots are not native to New Zealand, which further eliminates this as a potential place to find them in the wild.",
    "Since we ruled out all other options and \"wilderness\" is the only one that fits the general habitat description for marmots, this seems to be the most logical choice."
