  "steps": [
    "To determine where a person would put an automobile when not using it, we first consider the function of each option.",
    "A garage is a designated space for parking vehicles when they are not in use. This makes it a suitable option.",
    "The highway, fast lane, and freeway are all types of roadways where vehicles are driven. Clearly, these are not places to park a car when it's not in use, so they should be eliminated.",
    "The street is a public area where vehicles can be parked temporarily, but it is not a dedicated space and can sometimes pose risks or be against regulations.",
    "Among the options, the garage private space is the most ideal for parking a vehicle when it is not in use.",
    "Comparing the street and garage, a street is less secure and has more restrictions compared to a garage, which offers protection for the vehicle.",
    "Revisiting the answers, the only option that aligns perfectly with the concept of putting a car away when it\u2019s not in use is the garage.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer, considering all reasoning, is clearly option A (garage)."
