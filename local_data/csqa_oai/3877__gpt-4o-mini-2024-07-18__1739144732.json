  "query": "Question: He wanted a saxophone, so he went where?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: case\nC: marching band\nD: orchestra\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that he wanted a saxophone, which is a musical instrument.",
    "To acquire a saxophone, it's likely he would go to a place that sells musical instruments rather than a grocery store, which does not typically sell instruments.",
    "The option \"case\" is not a place; it's a storage item for instruments, so it's not applicable.",
    "The option \"marching band\" is a group or activity rather than a physical location.",
    "The option \"orchestra\" is also a type of musical group, so it cannot be the place where someone would go to buy a saxophone.",
    "The only option left is \"music store,\" which is a specific location where musical instruments, including saxophones, are sold.",
    "Given that he specifically wanted a saxophone, the most logical place for him to go would be a music store.",
    "Since other options do not provide the right context (either being groups or irrelevant locations), we can conclude the answer confidently."
