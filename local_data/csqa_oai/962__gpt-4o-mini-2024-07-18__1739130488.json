    "The question emphasizes the importance of washing hands before eating to avoid getting germs onto food.",
    "We need to identify what could be affected by consuming contaminated food.",
    "Looking at the choices: A (water), B (doctor), C (spread disease), D (mouth), and E (ear), we assess each option.",
    "Option A (water) relates to cleanliness, but it's not directly associated with germs from food.",
    "Option B (doctor) suggests a person who treats issues caused by germs but does not relate directly to the intake of food itself.",
    "Option C (spread disease) is a consequence of not washing hands, but it is not the direct answer to what gets germs inside.",
    "Option D (mouth) is a direct entry point for food and thus for any germs that may be present on the food.",
    "Option E (ear) is not related to the consumption of food and germs entering the body during eating.",
