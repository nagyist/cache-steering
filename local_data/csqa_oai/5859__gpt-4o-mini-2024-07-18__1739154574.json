  "steps": [
    "The situation presents a problem: the tomatoes are dying. This indicates that something needs to be done to address the problem.",
    "Option A (\"feel stupid\") does not suggest any action to remedy the situation; rather, it implies a feeling of regret or self-blame.",
    "Option B (\"eat fruit\") is unrelated to the context of dying tomatoes. Eating fruit does not resolve the issue at hand.",
    "Option C (\"thank god\") seems out of context with the immediate concern of the health of the tomatoes. This option does not indicate any action.",
    "Option D (\"water garden\") directly addresses the problem of the dying tomatoes. Lack of water is a common reason for plants to die, so watering the garden could help revive them.",
    "Option E (\"run\") is also irrelevant to the situation. Running does not address the issue with the tomatoes.",
    "From the analysis, the most logical response to the problem of dying tomatoes would be to take action that could potentially save them.",
    "Therefore, the best next action based on the given options is to \"water the garden.\""
