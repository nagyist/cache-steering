  "query": "Question: How do you signal that you are agreeing with someone on a deal?\n\nChoices:\nA: lie\nB: nodding\nC: shaking hand\nD: nod and smile\nE: whistle",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of signifying agreement with someone in a deal. This typically involves non-verbal or verbal communication that signals consent or affirmation.",
    "Next, I will examine the options provided to see which one is most commonly associated with signaling agreement. \"Lie\" (A) does not fit as it implies dishonesty, not agreement.",
    "\"Nodding\" (B) is a simple non-verbal gesture indicating agreement, but it might not be considered formal or definitive in a deal context.",
    "\"Shaking hand\" (C) is a traditional and widely accepted practice for sealing a deal, often representing a mutual agreement between parties.",
    "\"Node and smile\" (D) combines agreement with a friendly gesture but may still lack the definitive action that shaking hands conveys in formal settings.",
    "\"Whistle\" (E) typically does not signify agreement and is more associated with attention-seeking or playful behavior.",
    "Considering the context of a 'deal,' where a clear sign of agreement is often required, \"shaking hands\" emerges as the most appropriate option.",
    "I will double-check the specific nuances of the other options to ensure that \"shaking hands\" stands out as the best choice. \"Nodding\" merely indicates agreement but does not finalize a deal as shaking hands does.",
    "Thus, between all options, \"shaking hands\" (C) is the most recognized gesture associated with formal agreement in a deal-making scenario."
