  "query": "Question: If you're pouring water over grounds what type of drink are you making?\n\nChoices:\nA: cup of coffee\nB: brook\nC: synagogue\nD: tea\nE: sink",
  "steps": [
    "Determining the common beverage made by pouring water over grounds is the first step. Grounds typically refer to ground coffee or tea leaves.",
    "If the grounds are coffee grounds, pouring hot water over them results in coffee. This matches option A: cup of coffee.",
    "If the grounds are tea leaves, pouring hot water also results in tea. This matches option D: tea.",
    "However, the question is ambiguous since it doesn't specify whether the grounds refer to coffee or tea. Both A and D could be considered correct based on the type of grounds used.",
    "Next, analyzing the other choices: B (brook) refers to a natural water body, C (synagogue) is a place of worship, and E (sink) refers to a plumbing fixture. None of these are relevant to making a drink.",
    "Since both A and D are legitimate beverages that can be made from grounds, I must determine the more common interpretation in the context of pouring hot water.",
    "Coffee is arguably the more prevalent drink made with grounds in many western cultures, often referenced simply as \"pouring water over grounds.\"",
    "Recognizing this tendency, I will select option A (cup of coffee) as the most likely answer."
