  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a term that describes something that is not bad but also not too good, suggesting a middle ground or average quality.",
    "The options provided include terms that denote varying levels of quality, from very positive to more neutral or negative.",
    "\"Excellent\" (A) and \"outstanding\" (B) both indicate a high level of quality and are not applicable because they suggest something is very good.",
    "\"Exceptional\" (C) implies a level of quality that is above average, which again means it cannot describe something that is just not bad but not too good.",
    "\"Superior\" (D) also implies a higher quality than average, so it does not fit the description.",
    "\"Sufficient\" (E), however, suggests a level of quality that is adequate, meeting the minimum requirement without being exceptional or outstanding.",
    "Since \"sufficient\" indicates something that is acceptable or just enough, it fits the description of something that is not bad but also not good."
