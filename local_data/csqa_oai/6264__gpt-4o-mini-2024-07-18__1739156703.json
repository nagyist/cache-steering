  "query": "Question: Where can a ferret hide easily?\n\nChoices:\nA: cousin's house\nB: taxi cab\nC: wood pile\nD: own home\nE: in a fridge",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the nature of ferrets, which are small animals known for their curious and playful behavior. They often like to explore and find cozy spots to hide.",
    "Next, I evaluate each option based on potential hiding places that would be accessible and suitable for a ferret's size and behavior.",
    "Option A: \"cousin's house\" - While a ferret could hide there, it would depend on the layout of the house and whether there are suitable hiding spots. It\u2019s not a guaranteed option.",
    "Option B: \"taxi cab\" - This is a less feasible hiding spot for a ferret, as it is a confined space and not very accommodating for hiding.",
    "Option C: \"wood pile\" - This option provides potential for plenty of nooks and crannies among the wood, offering ample hiding opportunities for a ferret.",
    "Option D: \"own home\" - A ferret could certainly hide in its own home, but this option is quite general and may not be as effective as a specific hiding spot like the wood pile.",
    "Option E: \"in a fridge\" - This is not a safe or practical hiding spot for a ferret. It is also unlikely for a ferret to hide in there, as it is not a natural behavior for them.",
    "After evaluating all options, the wood pile stands out as the most suitable and effective hiding spot, providing both safety and shelter for a ferret."
