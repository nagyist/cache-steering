  "query": "Question: The amateur didn't realize his chicken wouldn't lay enough eggs without a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: tuna\nB: eaten\nC: rooster\nD: cow\nE: chopped",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a chicken that doesn't lay enough eggs, implying a context related to egg production.",
    "Chickens typically require a rooster to fertilize eggs for them to produce more eggs. Without a rooster, hens may lay fewer eggs.",
    "The presence of a rooster is essential for breeding, but hens can still lay eggs without one, though the quantity may be lower.",
    "Reviewing the provided choices, I need to determine which one is most closely related to the lack of egg production in chickens.",
    "Choice A (tuna) is unrelated to egg-laying in chickens.",
    "Choice B (eaten) doesn't connect to the concept of laying eggs.",
    "Choice D (cow) also doesn't pertain to chicken egg-laying, as cows are a completely different type of animal.",
    "Choice E (chopped) likewise does not relate to laying eggs or the need for a rooster.",
    "Choice C (rooster) fits perfectly as it connects directly to the requirement for hens to produce eggs, especially in terms of fertilization and stimulating productivity.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the amateur needs a rooster for his chicken to lay more eggs successfully."
