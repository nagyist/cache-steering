  "query": "Question: Where would someone find freshest possible eggs?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: grocery store\nC: in a salad\nD: bird's nest\nE: chicken coop",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to clarify what is meant by \"freshest possible eggs.\" Fresh eggs are those that have been laid very recently, ideally still warm from the hen.",
    "Next, I will consider each choice to see where fresh eggs can typically be found.",
    "Choice A (supermarket): Supermarkets sell eggs, but these are often collected and packaged some time after they are laid, so they may not be the freshest option.",
    "Choice B (grocery store): Similar to supermarkets, grocery stores also sell eggs that have already been packaged, meaning they are not as fresh as newly laid eggs.",
    "Choice C (in a salad): This option is unlikely as salads generally contain processed or pre-packaged ingredients, not fresh eggs.",
    "Choice D (bird's nest): While bird's nests can contain eggs, not all bird eggs are safe or intended for human consumption, and they may not be a typical source for fresh eggs.",
    "Choice E (chicken coop): Chicken coops are where hens live and lay their eggs. Eggs collected directly from a chicken coop are the freshest possible, as they haven't been stored or processed.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the chicken coop is the clear choice for where one can find the freshest possible eggs."
