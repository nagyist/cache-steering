  "query": "Question: If an altar is in danger of vandalism, where should it be placed?\n\nChoices:\nA: adoration of god\nB: temple\nC: museum\nD: ceremony\nE: sanctuary",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the primary purpose of the altar. An altar is generally a sacred space used for rituals, worship, or offerings, often in religious settings.",
    "Next, I consider what environments might be at risk for vandalism. Public spaces, particularly those that may attract non-reverent visitors, could pose a higher threat.",
    "I also need to think about environments that offer protection from vandalism while still serving the altar's purpose. A space that allows for reverence and worship would be ideal.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"adoration of god\" could refer to a personal worship context, while \"temple\" is a broader term that often describes the structure housing an altar and involves regular public access.",
    "A \"museum\" protects artifacts and has security measures, but it generally lacks the solemn and spiritual environment an altar would need.",
    "\"Sanctuary\" suggests a safe and sacred space often within churches or temples where worship occurs, fitting the need for reverence and protection.",
    "\" Ceremony\" commonly refers to the event itself rather than a place, making it unsuitable for protecting an altar from vandalism.",
    "We can conclude that \"sanctuary\" provides both spiritual significance and a protective environment for an altar against vandalism."
