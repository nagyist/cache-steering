  "query": "Question: What old models are likely to be made of wood?\n\nChoices:\nA: car\nB: tree\nC: hardware store\nD: lumberyard\nE: boat",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which of the given options refers to something that was historically or typically made of wood.",
    "I'll analyze option A: \"car.\" Cars are primarily made of metal and plastic, especially in modern times, so they're not likely to be made of wood.",
    "Next, I'll consider option B: \"tree.\" While trees are made of wood, they are not a model or item made from wood; rather, they themselves are the source of wood.",
    "Now, I'll look at option C: \"hardware store.\" A hardware store sells various items, and while it might sell wooden items, it is not itself a model made of wood.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll consider option D: \"lumberyard.\" A lumberyard is a place where lumber is stored and sold. It deals with wood but isn't something made of wood itself.",
    "Finally, I'll analyze option E: \"boat.\" Historically, many types of boats, especially older models, were constructed from wood, making this a likely candidate.",
    "Having evaluated all the options, the only item that historically is made of wood, especially in terms of old models, is the boat."
