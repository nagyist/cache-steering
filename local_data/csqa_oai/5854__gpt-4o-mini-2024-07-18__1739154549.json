  "steps": [
    "The question asks about emotional responses to a horrible sight at a high area of elevation.",
    "A horrible sight typically invokes negative feelings related to what one perceives.",
    "Among the options, \"disgust\" is a plausible reaction to seeing something horrible.",
    "\"Diminishment,\" \"jealous,\" \"depression,\" and \"reduction\" do not directly relate to a visual response to a horrible sight.",
    "\"Depression\" can be an emotional response, but is more about a long-term emotional state rather than a direct reaction to a sight.",
    "\"Disgust\" directly captures the immediate emotional response one might feel when encountering something revolting or horrifying.",
    "Evaluating the remaining options, none provide a suitable emotional response comparable to \"disgust.\"",
    "Thus, it appears that the answer most clearly related to the situation is \"disgust.\""
