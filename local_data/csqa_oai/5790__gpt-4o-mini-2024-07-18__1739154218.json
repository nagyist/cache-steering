  "query": "Question: Billy shoplifted a cheap watch.  Where might he have grabbed it from?\n\nChoices:\nA: jewellers\nB: guard tower\nC: department store\nD: police station\nE: bedroom drawer",
  "steps": [
    "Billy shoplifted a cheap watch, suggesting that it is likely a location where inexpensive items can be found.",
    "A jeweller typically sells high-end or quality jewelry, including expensive watches, making it an unlikely choice for stealing a cheap watch.",
    "A guard tower is primarily a security structure and wouldn't have watches or any items for sale, making it an illogical choice for where to shoplift a watch.",
    "A police station would have regulations and surveillance preventing shoplifting, so it is not a plausible location for this activity.",
    "A bedroom drawer might contain personal items, including a watch, but it is unlikely to be the location from which Billy would shoplift since it implies stealing from someone's private property rather than a public retail setting.",
    "A department store typically carries a variety of inexpensive watches and is a common place for shoplifting to occur, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Considering the likelihood of where a cheap watch can be found, a department store stands out as a logical choice.",
    "The other options (jewellers, guard tower, police station, bedroom drawer) fall short based on their context and function.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most plausible location from which Billy might have grabbed the watch is the department store."
