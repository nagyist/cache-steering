  "query": "Question: Where do people view more than one rosebush?\n\nChoices:\nA: hedgerow\nB: temperate climate\nC: botanical gardens\nD: beehouse\nE: backyard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify what a rosebush is and where it is commonly found. Rosebushes are typically cultivated in various environments and are often grown for their flowers.",
    "Next, I will consider the choices given and analyze where rosebushes are likely to be found in groups or multiple plants.",
    "Choice A, \"hedgerow,\" refers to a fence or boundary formed by a dense row of shrubs or low trees. While a hedgerow could contain multiple plants, it does not specifically imply rosebushes.",
    "Choice B, \"temperate climate,\" describes a type of climate rather than a specific place where one would view rosebushes. Rosebushes can grow in temperate climates, but this isn\u2019t a location.",
    "Choice C, \"botanical gardens,\" is a dedicated area where various plants, including multiple rosebushes, are cultivated and displayed for public viewing. This is a strong candidate because these gardens are often designed to showcase a variety of plant species.",
    "Choice D, \"beehouse\" (or beehive), primarily serves the purpose of housing bees and is not typically associated with growing or displaying rosebushes.",
    "Choice E, \"backyard,\" is a plausible location for rosebushes, as many people plant rosebushes in their yards. However, this does not guarantee they can view more than one, depending on the individual's garden layout.",
    "Having analyzed all options, the most logical place where one is likely to view several rosebushes specifically would be found in botanical gardens, as they are designed to showcase various plants and offer a space to view multiple rosebushes at once."
