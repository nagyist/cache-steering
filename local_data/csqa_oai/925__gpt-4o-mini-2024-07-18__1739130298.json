  "steps": [
    "We start by analyzing the context of the question, which refers to a student who is about to graduate. Graduation typically signifies the completion of a particular level of education.",
    "Given the choices, we should identify which option signifies an educational setting that a graduating student would no longer be part of.",
    "Choice A (library) is a resource for students and is not specific to graduation; graduates might still use the library.",
    "Choice B (parties) could be events that students attend, but graduation does not inherently mean students stop attending parties\u2014these are social events and not education-related.",
    "Choice C (kindergarten class) directly refers to an early education level. If a student is about to graduate, they are likely moving beyond kindergarten.",
    "Choice D (bar) is a place where adults typically socialize but not directly tied to the educational experience of students.",
    "Choice E (school) is another direct educational setting. If a student graduates, they certainly will no longer be attending the school they are graduating from.",
    "Now comparing choice C and E: while both C (kindergarten class) and E (school) suggest settings a student would move on from, graduation usually implies leaving the entire school level rather than just a specific class.",
    "After careful consideration, choice E (school) is a more accurate answer than choice C (kindergarten class) because it encompasses all educational experiences at that institution upon graduation."
