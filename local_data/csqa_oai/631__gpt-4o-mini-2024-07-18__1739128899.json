  "steps": [
    "The question suggests that to create societal change, the initial step should involve personal transformation or introspection.",
    "Option A suggests riots, which typically involve external expressions of protest rather than individual change.",
    "Option B suggests voting, which is also more of a collective action rather than a personal change.",
    "Option C suggests changing oneself, which aligns directly with the idea of starting from within to effect change.",
    "Option D suggests social activism, which involves engaging with society but still is an external form of change rather than personal change.",
    "Option E suggests simply changing clothes, which does not correlate with the concept of meaningful change at a societal level.",
    "Among the given choices, only option C directly indicates an internal change as a prerequisite for broader societal transformation.",
