  "query": "Question: The man washed clothes, but needed more than water, what did he need?\n\nChoices:\nA: gather up\nB: get dirty\nC: use soap\nD: use water\nE: washcloth",
  "steps": [
    "The man washed clothes, which indicates he is engaging in a laundry process.",
    "The statement \"needed more than water\" suggests that water alone is insufficient for the task.",
    "In typical laundry scenarios, using just water may help rinse the clothes but is often not effective for cleaning.",
    "Commonly, laundry requires a detergent or cleaning agent to effectively remove dirt and stains.",
    "Among the given choices, \"use soap\" (option C) directly implies using a cleaning agent, which supports the need for more than just water.",
    "The other options do not adequately address the need for an additional cleaning agent:\n- \"gather up\" (A) relates to preparation but not the cleaning itself.\n- \"get dirty\" (B) contradicts the act of washing.\n- \"use water\" (D) is redundant since it's already established he is using water.\n- \"washcloth\" (E) relates more to a tool for cleaning but doesn't imply a cleaning agent.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer is the one that directly addresses the need for a cleaning agent, which is soap."
