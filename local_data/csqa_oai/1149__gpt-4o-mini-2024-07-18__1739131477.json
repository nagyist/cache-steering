  "query": "Question: Female ants don't have wings and can only get around by doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: crawl\nB: follow one another\nC: running\nD: circle food\nE: fly",
  "steps": [
    "First, I should consider the general characteristics of female ants. Female ants, particularly those that are not queens, do not possess wings in their adult form.",
    "Next, I need to explore how these wingless female ants move. Since they lack wings, flying is not an option, which eliminates choice E.",
    "Crawling is a common method of movement for many insects, including ants. This leads me to consider choice A, which states that they \"crawl.\"",
    "I should also evaluate the other options. Choice B, \"follow one another,\" while possible, does not specifically describe how an ant moves; it describes a behavior rather than a movement method.",
    "Choice C, \"running,\" is another potential movement option. I need to determine if running is a common characteristic among female ants.",
    "In my knowledge of ant behaviors, crawling is indeed the primary mode of locomotion for non-winged ants, including the worker and queen ants when they are in their normal state.",
    "Running and crawling can often be used interchangeably in casual descriptions, but it's important to recognize that the primary mode of movement for ants is crawling.",
    "Choice D, \"circle food,\" describes a behavior that may occur during foraging or feeding, but it does not accurately describe how they move in general.",
    "Based on this analysis, I can conclude that crawling is the most precise term to describe how female ants, who do not have wings, typically get around."
