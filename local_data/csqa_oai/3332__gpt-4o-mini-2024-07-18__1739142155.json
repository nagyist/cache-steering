  "query": "Question: What item has parts such as rods and pistons?\n\nChoices:\nA: sporting goods store\nB: engine\nC: cool\nD: eyeball\nE: fishing camp",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what is meant by \"parts such as rods and pistons.\" These components are commonly associated with mechanical systems.",
    "Pistons are typically found within engines, where they move within cylinders to create motion. Rods can also refer to connecting rods that connect the pistons to the crankshaft.",
    "Next, I should consider the other choices: A sporting goods store is a retail space, D and E (eyeball and fishing camp) are not mechanical items, and C (cool) doesn't refer to an item.",
    "Given the association of rods and pistons with engines specifically, this aligns perfectly with the choice labeled \"engine.\"",
    "Consequently, I can eliminate options A, C, D, and E since they do not contain components like rods and pistons relevant to mechanical operations.",
    "Additionally, I should re-check the logic\u2014both rods and pistons are indeed critical components of an engine's functionality, reinforcing that the answer correlates strongly with the item in question.",
    "In conclusion, the only viable answer that matches the description given in the question is engine."
