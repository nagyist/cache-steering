  "query": "Question: What is likely the result of unprotected sex?\n\nChoices:\nA: orgasm\nB: children\nC: pregnancy\nD: giggle\nE: herpes",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of unprotected sex. It usually means that no contraceptive method is being used to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).",
    "Determine the primary biological result of unprotected sex in terms of reproduction. When sperm meets an egg without contraception, there is a high chance of conception.",
    "Next, analyze the potential outcomes of unprotected sex. These can include pregnancy, the possibility of STIs, and sexual pleasure.",
    "Focus on the outcomes. While A (orgasm) and D (giggle) are feelings or actions, the key biological concern after unprotected sex is pregnancy (C).",
    "Assess the relevance of the other options. While E (herpes) is a potential outcome of unprotected sex due to STIs, it is more specific and does not encompass the broader outcome of reproduction.",
    "Conclude that children (B) can result from pregnancy (C), but the more direct and immediate result of unprotected sex would be considered pregnancy itself.",
    "Since pregnancy (C) leads to the possibility of having children (B), it solidifies that C is a more immediate consequence of unprotected sex."
