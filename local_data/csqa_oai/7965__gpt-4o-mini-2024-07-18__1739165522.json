  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what happens when food is consumed. When we eat, our body immediately begins the process of digestion.",
    "During digestion, a variety of physiological responses occur, including salivation, gastric secretion, and increased peristalsis in the intestines.",
    "The immediate effect of eating is that we start to feel fullness as food fills the stomach and stretches its walls.",
    "The sensation of fullness is a signal to the brain that we have consumed food, which occurs relatively quickly after eating.",
    "We also begin to absorb nutrients from the food we have eaten, but this process takes longer to initiate and have effects on the body.",
    "Defecating and pooping are terms used to describe the elimination of waste, which happens much later in the digestion process and is not an immediate effect of eating.",
    "\"Reduced\" is vague and does not specify what is being reduced, thus it doesn't relate directly to the immediate effects of eating.",
    "\"Gaining weight\" is a longer-term effect based on calorie surplus, and it does not represent an immediate consequence of eating.",
    "Therefore, the immediate outcome following the act of eating is primarily feeling full or satisfied after the meal."
