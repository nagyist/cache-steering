  "query": "Question: Marcy couldn't cry.  She didn't want her parents to know that she was sad.  She hid her sobs by doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shed tears\nB: be happy\nC: laughing\nD: smile\nE: talk",
  "steps": [
    "Marcy is trying to conceal her sadness from her parents.",
    "To hide her sobs, she must engage in an action that illustrates the opposite of her internal feelings.",
    "Sobbing typically involves crying, so her behavior must not involve shedding tears (A).",
    "Being happy (B) doesn\u2019t directly address how she hides her sobs; instead, it represents a general state rather than a specific action.",
    "Laughing (C) can serve as a way to cover up her sadness, as laughter often masks emotional pain.",
    "Smiling (D) is a similar action to laughing, potentially making her seem happy despite her true feelings.",
    "Talking (E) does not directly relate to hiding sobs; it could expose her emotions rather than conceal them.",
    "Both laughing and smiling could serve to mask her true feelings, but laughing is more associated with concealing sadness.",
    "Therefore, I will consider laughing as the primary action that Marcy might choose to cover her sobs."
