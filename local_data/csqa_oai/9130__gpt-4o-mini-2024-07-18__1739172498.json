  "query": "Question: If you see a fox in a southern delta state, where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: hen house\nB: louisiana\nC: south carolina\nD: wildlife\nE: tennessee",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"southern delta state,\" which implies a geographical region that is characterized by delta landforms and is located in the southern United States.",
    "The Mississippi River Delta is one of the most prominent delta regions in the United States, and it primarily covers the state of Louisiana.",
    "While other states, such as Tennessee and South Carolina, may also have foxes, they are not specifically known for being delta states like Louisiana.",
    "The phrase \"if you see a fox\" suggests that the question is about where foxes are commonly found, which can apply to several southern states; however, the term \"southern delta state\" narrows it down significantly.",
    "Considering the geographical attributes and wildlife in Louisiana, it is a well-known habitat for various species, including foxes, particularly in delta areas.",
    "South Carolina, while southern, does not distinctly characterize itself as a delta state in the same way that Louisiana does.",
    "Tennessee has some delta territories but is more commonly associated with its mountainous regions and barriers to delta formation.",
    "The option \"wildlife\" is not a state, and therefore does not fit the category of the question, which looks for a state-name as an answer.",
    "After evaluating all the options, Louisiana stands out as the most plausible answer to where one might see a fox in a southern delta state."
