  "query": "Question: How do you show that you are agreeing with someone?\n\nChoices:\nA: handshake\nB: kiss\nC: nodding\nD: lie\nE: shaking hand",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of agreeing with someone. Agreement can often be expressed through non-verbal communication, which includes body language and gestures.",
    "Next, I should evaluate the options provided. A handshake (A and E) and a kiss (B) are more formal or affectionate actions and may not necessarily signify agreement specifically.",
    "Then, I need to analyze the action of nodding (C). Nodding is a commonly recognized gesture that people use to show they are in agreement with what someone is saying.",
    "I should also consider the option of lying (D). Lying inherently suggests disagreement or deceit, so it does not fit the criteria for showing agreement.",
    "Comparing all the actions, the strongest and most universally understood action for showing agreement is nodding (C).",
    "Since handshake options (A and E) and a kiss (B) are either not specific to agreement or are more context-dependent gestures, I can conclude that nodding is the most straightforward and clear way to show agreement.",
    "Lastly, I can confirm that nodding is widely recognized in both casual and formal situations as a positive affirmation of understanding and agreement."
