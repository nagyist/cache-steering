  "query": "Question: His system wouldn't boot, he decided to buy a whole new one where?\n\nChoices:\nA: place\nB: computer store\nC: computer science\nD: human body\nE: online",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to analyze the situation of someone whose system wouldn't boot. This suggests that they need a replacement for a computer or system.",
    "Next, I should consider where one might go to purchase a new computer system. Physical locations like stores or online options are relevant to this scenario.",
    "Looking at the options provided, \"computer store\" clearly indicates a physical location where computers are sold.",
    "The option \"online\" also suggests a method of purchasing, indicating that one can buy a new computer system through an internet service.",
    "Analyzing the less relevant options, \"computer science\" does not make sense in this context as it refers to a field of study rather than a place to buy a computer.",
    "Similarly, \"human body\" is completely unrelated to the question as it does not pertain to computers or purchasing.",
    "Now, I consider which of the two relevant options, \"computer store\" or \"online,\" is more appropriate for purchasing a whole new system.",
    "Both \"computer store\" and \"online\" are viable options, but \"computer store\" specifically denotes a physical location.",
    "Given that he decided to buy a whole new system, both options could be right, but I need to select one. Since \"computer store\" refers to a physical purchase, it feels like a more traditional response to buying.",
    "Ultimately, to complete the reasoning, I conclude that the most specific and relevant option is \"computer store,\" which directly relates to the context of buying a new computer."
