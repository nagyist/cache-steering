  "query": "Question: If you're a small dog owned by your father's mother, where would you live?\n\nChoices:\nA: the enterprise\nB: baby carriage\nC: basket\nD: grandma's house\nE: barbeque",
  "steps": [
    "We start by identifying the key phrase in the question: \"small dog owned by your father's mother.\" This indicates that the dog is owned by your grandmother (father's mother).",
    "Next, we consider where a dog typically lives. Since the dog is owned by the grandmother, it\u2019s logical to think that the dog would live in her home.",
    "Now, we analyze the choices given:\n- A: the enterprise \u2013 not relevant to a dog's living situation.\n- B: baby carriage \u2013 typically used for transporting babies, not suitable for a dog.\n- C: basket \u2013 while a dog could be placed in a basket, it doesn't suggest a primary living place.\n- D: grandma's house \u2013 this directly relates to the ownership connection established earlier, as dogs live where their owners live.\n- E: barbeque \u2013 this does not relate to a dog's living conditions.",
    "Given that the dog is owned by the grandmother, the most logical answer to where the dog would live is at \"grandma's house.\"",
    "Since \"grandma's house\" matches perfectly with the owner relationship and is reasonable for a dog\u2019s residence, we confirm this choice."
