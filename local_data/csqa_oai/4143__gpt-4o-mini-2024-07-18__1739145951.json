  "steps": [
    "Susan is described as an \"ordinary person,\" indicating that she does not stand out in terms of personality or background.",
    "However, the phrase \"her skills were not ordinary\" suggests that her skills are above average or noteworthy.",
    "The word \"extraordinary\" comes to mind, but it's not one of the choices. Instead, I'm looking for synonyms or similar meanings.",
    "The choices provided are: A: exceptional, B: strange, C: spectacular, D: unusual, E: special.",
    "\"Exceptional\" typically means better than average and aligns with the idea of extraordinary skills.",
    "\"Strange\" implies something unusual or out of the ordinary, but it has a negative connotation and doesn't fit \"skills\" being not ordinary in a positive sense.",
    "\"Spectacular\" conveys something visually impressive or extraordinary. While it could fit in a context of skills, it doesn\u2019t resonate as well as \u201cexceptional\u201d.",
    "\"Unusual\" suggests something not common, but it lacks the positive connotation that would affirm Susan's impressive skills.",
    "\"Special\" indicates something distinctive or set apart, but it also does not convey the level of excellence implied in the context.",
    "Among all the provided options, \"exceptional\" is the strongest match for skills that are considerably above ordinary, fitting the context of Susan having notable abilities."
