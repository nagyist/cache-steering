  "query": "Question: Accidents involving cars affect who?\n\nChoices:\nA: hurt people\nB: happen anywhere\nC: happen to people\nD: happen anytime\nE: happen to kids",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks who is affected by car accidents.",
    "We need to identify the options that refer specifically to individuals or groups that can be impacted by such accidents.",
    "Option A (\"hurt people\") implies that there are individuals who sustain injuries in car accidents, which is true, but it's somewhat vague.",
    "Option B (\"happen anywhere\") refers to the locations of accidents rather than the people involved, making it less relevant.",
    "Option C (\"happen to people\") directly addresses the notion that accidents occur to individuals, which aligns with the concept of individuals being affected.",
    "Option D (\"happen anytime\") indicates timing and does not specify who is affected, thus it is not relevant.",
    "Option E (\"happen to kids\") is too specific; while kids can be affected, it does not encompass all individuals affected by car accidents.",
    "Comparing the options, A and C seem to relate to people affected by accidents, but C is more inclusive as it covers all people rather than just those who are hurt.",
    "Since C encompasses the idea that car accidents happen to all types of people, it is the best choice."
