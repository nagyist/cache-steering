  "steps": [
    "When someone is having difficulty learning a subject, it often leads to negative emotions or feelings.",
    "Frustration is a common response when trying to grasp challenging concepts or material, particularly in subjects like science that can be complex.",
    "I can consider the other options: \n- Smiles (A) would not likely be a result of difficulty in learning.\n- Accidents (C) are not directly related to learning experiences; they typically pertain to physical mishaps.\n- Becoming happy (D) contradicts the idea of having a hard time learning, as happiness is generally associated with success or ease.\n- Experiment (E) can occur during learning, but simply having a hard time does not guarantee that experiments will lead to positive outcomes.",
    "Given that frustration is a common emotional response to challenges, it stands out as the most likely experience for someone struggling with science."
