  "steps": [
    "The question asks what should be done when shopping for an expensive product to ensure getting the best deal.",
    "Among the available choices, some are relevant to the shopping process and obtaining the best deal, while others are not.",
    "Choice A, \"compare prices,\" suggests evaluating different offers, which is essential for finding the best deal on an expensive item.",
    "Choice B, \"standing in line,\" does not directly relate to finding the best price or deal; it's more about the experience of shopping rather than ensuring a good price.",
    "Choice C, \"meeting friends,\" is not relevant to the shopping process or making a purchasing decision.",
    "Choice D, \"live without it,\" implies forgoing the purchase entirely, which does not help in finding a deal.",
    "Choice E, \"purchasing,\" indicates the act of buying, but it lacks any strategy for ensuring the best deal.",
    "Since the most relevant action that directly contributes to getting the best price on an expensive product is to compare prices, it stands out as the best choice.",
    "Thus, based on the reasoning, the final answer is clear."
