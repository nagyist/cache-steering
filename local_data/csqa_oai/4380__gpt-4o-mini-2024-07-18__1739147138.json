    "The question asks for a crucial step to avoid problems when going somewhere.",
    "I need to clarify what \"problems\" might refer to, such as getting lost, being late, or not having necessary resources.",
    "Planning is generally important in any journey to ensure that everything goes smoothly.",
    "Among the choices, A: \"plan ahead\" suggests preparing before the journey, which can help prevent issues.",
    "Choice B: \"find out where\" is partially relevant but might refer more to gathering information rather than preparation.",
    "Choice C: \"highway\" does not directly address preparation or avoidance of problems.",
    "Choice D: \"know where to go\" also speaks to having a destination, but again, this is more about having information rather than preparation.",
    "Choice E: \"get going\" does not imply any form of preparation and could lead to problems if done without planning.",
    "Considering these reasons, \"plan ahead\" encapsulates the most comprehensive approach to avoiding problems."
