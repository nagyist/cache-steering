  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the person can only have a small dog, implying that their living situation may have restrictions on space.",
    "A dog show (Choice A) is not a suitable living situation; it is an event space and not a place to reside.",
    "A tree (Choice C) is not a viable option for living as it does not provide shelter or a proper living environment for a person or a pet.",
    "A farm (Choice D) would generally allow for larger animals and more space, making it less likely that someone residing there would only be limited to small dogs.",
    "The concept of a neighbor's yard (Choice E) suggests a temporary or informal living arrangement, which is also unlikely to be a primary residence.",
    "Considering these factors, Manhattan apartments (Choice B) tend to be small and are known for having restrictions on pet sizes due to limited space.",
    "Manhattan living often accommodates individuals who may only have small dogs due to apartments being smaller and more confined compared to other living arrangements.",
    "Based on space restrictions and common living situations, the most likely place for someone limited to a small dog to live is a Manhattan apartment."
