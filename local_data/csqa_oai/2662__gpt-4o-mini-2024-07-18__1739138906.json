  "query": "Question: Where does confetti float?\n\nChoices:\nA: streets\nB: big cities\nC: air\nD: water\nE: shredder",
  "steps": [
    "Confetti is typically made of lightweight materials, which allows it to remain airborne for a short duration after being released.",
    "When confetti is thrown, it tends to rise up into the air before gradually descending due to gravity.",
    "The environment in which confetti is released greatly influences its movement; for example, at celebrations, confetti is often thrown into the air.",
    "While confetti can land on different surfaces (such as streets or water), its initial motion after being thrown is upward into the air.",
    "In the context of the choices provided, the option that best fits where confetti initially floats is \"air.\"",
    "Although confetti may eventually land on streets, in water, or be shredded, these scenarios occur after the confetti has floated momentarily in the air.",
    "The main characteristic of floating in this context should be based on the immediate effect of being thrown, which is in the air.",
    "Therefore, considering all the above points, the correct answer that specifies where confetti primarily floats is in the air."
