  "query": "Question: The car was out in the sun all day, what happened to the interior?\n\nChoices:\nA: set off\nB: melted\nC: heat up\nD: back up\nE: red",
  "steps": [
    "The car was exposed to sunlight for an extended period, which typically leads to increased temperatures inside the vehicle.",
    "The interior of a car can get quite hot when it is parked in direct sunlight, often reaching much higher temperatures than the outside air.",
    "Increased temperatures can cause various effects on materials inside the car, but it is more common for the interior to heat up rather than melt or set off.",
    "The term \"melting\" usually applies to substances that can transition from solid to liquid, which is not relevant for most interior car materials unless we are discussing specific plastics under extreme heat.",
    "The options \"set off\" and \"back up\" do not align with the physical effect of the sun on a car's interior.",
    "\"Red\" might refer to discoloration but does not describe what happens when the interior is subjected to heat from the sun.",
    "Given the straightforward and common reaction of the car's interior to sunlight, \"heat up\" is the most appropriate answer."
