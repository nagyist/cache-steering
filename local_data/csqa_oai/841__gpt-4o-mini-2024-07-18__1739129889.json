  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the context of the question, which pertains to animals that produce milk.",
    "Next, I will consider each option provided in the answer choices to determine if they are animals.",
    "The first option, A: supermarket, is not an animal; it's a place where groceries are sold.",
    "The second option, B: pig, is indeed an animal. Pigs do produce milk as they are mammals.",
    "The third option, C: cow, is also an animal. Cows are well-known for their milk production.",
    "The fourth option, D: refrigerator, is a household appliance, not an animal. It does not produce milk.",
    "The fifth option, E: store, is a type of business or location, not an animal.",
    "From the analysis, only B (pig) and C (cow) are valid animal responses, but only cows are commonly associated with milk production in agricultural contexts.",
