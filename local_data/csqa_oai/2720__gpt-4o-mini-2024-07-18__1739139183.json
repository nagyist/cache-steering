  "query": "Question: The only place you'd find a marmoset in what gold rush region would be in a zoo?\n\nChoices:\nA: in wild\nB: your moms house\nC: burrow\nD: american west\nE: national park",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the habitat of marmosets. They are small primates native to South America, particularly in the tropical forests of Brazil. They are not found in the wild outside of their native regions.",
    "Next, I consider the context of the question which refers to the \"gold rush region.\" The American Gold Rush primarily took place in the American West, particularly in areas like California during the mid-19th century.",
    "I evaluate the choices provided. Choice A (\"in wild\") is inaccurate since marmosets would not be found in their natural habitat in a gold rush region like the American West.",
    "Choice B (\"your moms house\") seems irrelevant and not a factual option regarding where marmosets can be found.",
    "Choice C (\"burrow\") suggests a type of animal shelter but is misleading, as marmosets do not live in burrows.",
    "Choice D (\"american west\") is the gold rush region mentioned but does not suit the marmoset's natural habitat as they are not native there.",
    "Finally, I examine choice E (\"national park\"). While national parks can contain diverse ecosystems, marmosets wouldn't naturally inhabit a national park in the American West, as they are not native to that location.",
    "Since the only place a marmoset could be found in the context of the American West would be in a zoo, it indicates that they are kept there for conservation and viewing by the public."
