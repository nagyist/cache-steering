    "Identify the key concept in the question: If people are busy, what behavioral tendencies do they exhibit?",
    "Consider the options given and how each relates to being busy. Individuals who are busy are generally focused on their tasks.",
    "Evaluate option A: \"make lists\". This could be a behavior of busy individuals for organization, but it may not be the most common or immediate action.",
    "Evaluate option B: \"trade places\". This option is unlikely, as busy individuals usually stick to their tasks rather than swapping roles.",
    "Evaluate option C: \"talk to each other\". If people are busy, they might not have time or the inclination to engage in conversation.",
    "Evaluate option D: \"hurry along\". This option resonates well, as busy people often move quickly to manage their responsibilities.",
    "Evaluate option E: \"say 'hello' to one another\". While this could happen, busy people are less likely to stop for greetings when they are preoccupied.",
    "After considering all options, \"hurry along\" (D) is the most logical behavior for people who are busy. They tend to rush in their activities."
