  "query": "Question: Where are there often multiple personal televisions?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: bar\nC: liquor\nD: living room\nE: cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what context the question is referring to when it mentions \"multiple personal televisions.\"",
    "Next, I will analyze the choices given: A: house, B: bar, C: liquor, D: living room, E: cabinet.",
    "Choice A, \"house,\" could potentially have multiple personal televisions, especially in different rooms.",
    "Choice B, \"bar,\" might have televisions, but they are typically not personal as they are shared among patrons.",
    "Choice C, \"liquor,\" does not fit as it refers to a type of beverage and not a place where televisions can be found.",
    "Choice D, \"living room,\" is a common space within houses where multiple televisions could be present, often in homes with family members who enjoy different shows.",
    "Choice E, \"cabinet,\" is unlikely to have televisions as it is usually a piece of furniture used for storage.",
    "Now I need to evaluate more closely between the two strong competitors: \"house\" and \"living room.\"",
    "A \"house\" may have multiple televisions in various rooms (e.g., bedroom, basement, living room), while a \"living room\" specifically refers to one area.",
    "Therefore, while both \"house\" and \"living room\" could potentially have multiple televisions, \"house\" would fit more universally as the broader category that allows for multiple locations."
