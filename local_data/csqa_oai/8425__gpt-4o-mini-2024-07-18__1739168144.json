  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what a reception area is: a designated space where visitors are greeted and attended to upon entering a business.",
    "Next, consider the nature of the businesses listed in the choices, specifically those that operate 24 hours. A bank typically has restricted hours, while hotels and hospitals are known for operating continuously.",
    "Now, focus on the businesses that are open 24 hours. Hotels provide accommodations and services to guests at all times, and hospitals operate continuously to provide emergency and medical services.",
    "Evaluate the reception area in the context of each choice. Banks do have reception areas, but they are not open 24 hours. Law firms usually operate during normal business hours and may not have a reception area open all day.",
    "Hospitals do have reception areas where patients and visitors are welcomed, and since they operate 24/7, the reception is always staffed.",
    "Hotels also have reception areas and are designed to accommodate guests at all hours. The reception desk in a hotel is a crucial part of guest services.",
    "Considering that both hotels and hospitals have reception areas and are open 24 hours, we need to determine which one is the most fitting based on the question's context.",
    "Hotels primarily focus on accommodating guests, providing services that require a reception area that is consistently functioning, whereas hospitals primarily serve medical needs.",
    "Given that the question specifically asks for a business where you would find a reception area in a facility you spend 24 hours, a hotel fits this need better since guests may stay overnight.",
    "Thus, out of all choices, the most likely place where you would find a reception area in a business at which you would spend twenty-four hours is a hotel."
