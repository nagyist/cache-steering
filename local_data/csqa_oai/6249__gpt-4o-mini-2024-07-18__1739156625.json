  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze each option to determine where people might display screen savers of sunshine.",
    "Option A, \"street,\" does not seem a suitable answer as streets are physical locations and do not involve screen savers.",
    "Option B, \"glass,\" is also not relevant, as glass does not represent a digital medium where screen savers can be used.",
    "Option C, \"moon,\" is unlikely since people do not use screen savers featuring sunshine on the moon.",
    "Option D, \"summer,\" suggests a season where sunshine is prevalent but does not directly indicate the use of screen savers.",
    "Option E, \"desktop,\" refers to a computer environment where screen savers can be displayed.",
    "Given that screen savers are digital images or animations set to activate on computer desktops, option E is the most logical choice.",
    "People commonly use screen savers of sunshine on their desktops to create a pleasant visual during inactivity."
