    "Given the choices presented, I should look for options that align with the theme of chaos or accidents.",
    "Choice A, \"on planet earth,\" does not relate to any form of chaos or disaster; it is too broad.",
    "Choice B, \"train wreck,\" directly ties to the phrase \"fly off the rails\" since it evokes an image of a train losing control and crashing.",

    "Choice D, \"school,\" is not connected to the phrase and suggests a structured environment rather than one of disorder.",
