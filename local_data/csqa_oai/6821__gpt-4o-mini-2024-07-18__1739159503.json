  "steps": [
    "I need to identify places where names of accommodations can be found.",
    "A hotel is a type of accommodation, which suggests it might not be a source for names, but rather a place to stay.",
    "A phone book traditionally contains listings of various businesses, including hotels and motels, indicating it may provide names of places to stay.",
    "A motel is similar to a hotel, and while it represents a type of accommodation, it also does not directly serve as a source for names but rather as a location itself.",
    "An item found in a story book is likely fictional and not a reliable source for real accommodations.",
    "The city itself might have places to stay, but it does not represent an actual source for the names of accommodations.",
    "Out of all the choices, the phone book is the only one that explicitly serves as a directory listing names of places where one could stay."
