  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to understand what the bartender typically does when serving cocktails at a bar.",
    "Cocktails are usually made by combining various ingredients, which is commonly referred to as mixing.",
    "The question asks what bartenders will often do to the cocktails they serve, suggesting an action related to the preparation of the drinks.",
    "The provided choices include various actions and concepts related to socializing and interaction.",
    "Among the choices given, \u201cmix\u201d directly relates to the process of creating cocktails.",
    "The other options like \"meet people,\" \"have friends,\" \"with people,\" and \"see people\" pertain more to social interactions rather than the physical preparation of cocktails.",
    "Since the focus is specifically on what bartenders do to the cocktails rather than any social aspects, the best choice is one associated with the preparation method.",
    "Therefore, \"mix\" is the only option that accurately describes the action taken by bartenders concerning cocktails."
