  "query": "Question: There were so many guests for Thanksgiving, where did the host put the extra table?\n\nChoices:\nA: hall\nB: kitchen\nC: neighbor's house\nD: card room\nE: livingroom",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where hosts usually set up extra tables during large gatherings, particularly on holidays such as Thanksgiving.",
    "The hall could be a possible location because it's often a space that can accommodate additional furniture.",
    "The kitchen typically has less space available for extra tables since it's primarily used for cooking and food preparation.",
    "A neighbor's house is unlikely, as hosts rarely borrow space from neighbors for extra guests unless it's a very special situation.",
    "A card room, although it might provide some space, is usually a more specialized area and less likely to be used for seating guests compared to other common areas.",
    "The living room is a very common space for guests to gather and it often has sufficient space to accommodate an additional table.",
    "Comparing the options, the hall and living room both stand out as feasible options, but the living room is typically more used for gatherings.",
    "Since it's Thanksgiving and the emphasis is on comfort and social interaction, the living room seems like the best choice for placing an extra table.",
    "Therefore, I will conclude the most logical option where the extra table would be placed is in the living room."
