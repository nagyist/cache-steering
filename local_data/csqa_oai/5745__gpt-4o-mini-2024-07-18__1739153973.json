  "query": "Question: Where would you likely find a laser in a university?\n\nChoices:\nA: cd players\nB: laboratory\nC: aircraft\nD: hospital\nE: cdrom drive",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a laser is and its common uses. Lasers can be used in a variety of applications, including technology, medicine, and research.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided: \nA: cd players - While some CD players may have lasers to read discs, this is not a primary feature or a typical area for university-related activities involving lasers.",
    "Look at option B: laboratory. Laboratories in universities often utilize lasers for experiments, research, and demonstrations, particularly in fields like physics, engineering, and biology.",
    "Now check option C: aircraft. While lasers can be used in aviation for various technologies (like laser range finders), it is not primarily associated with university settings.",
    "Evaluate option D: hospital. Hospitals do use lasers for medical procedures, but this is not directly related to university settings unless it involves medical education or research.",
    "Finally, consider option E: cdrom drive. Similar to option A, CD-ROM drives use lasers, but again, this is not a university-specific application.",
    "Based on the evaluation, the most logical location for finding a laser in a university context is the laboratory (option B)."
