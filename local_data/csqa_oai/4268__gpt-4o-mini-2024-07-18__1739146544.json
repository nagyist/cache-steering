  "query": "Question: When I go to Spain, what should I try to practice first?\n\nChoices:\nA: stand upright\nB: courtesy\nC: further education\nD: speak spanish\nE: cross street",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider the context of visiting Spain and what would be most relevant to practice upon arriving there.",
    "Spain is a Spanish-speaking country, so understanding the local language is essential for communication.",
    "Among the choices, \"speak Spanish\" directly relates to effective interaction with the locals.",
    "The other options, while they have some relevance, do not directly enhance my experience in Spain as much as speaking the language would.",
    "\"Stand upright\" is a general behavior not specific to Spain, and \"cross street\" is about navigation rather than cultural assimilation.",
    "\"Courtesy\" is important, but it can be expressed more effectively through language.",
    "\"Further education\" is a broader concept and may not be the immediate focus for a traveler in Spain.",
    "Thus, practicing Spanish would likely enable me to engage more fully and enriched with the local culture during my visit.",
    "Considering all of the above, the most pertinent choice would be to practice language skills upon arrival in Spain."
