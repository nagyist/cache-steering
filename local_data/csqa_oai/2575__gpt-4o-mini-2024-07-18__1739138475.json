  "query": "Question: Where is there a very large graveyard?\n\nChoices:\nA: arlington\nB: city\nC: every town\nD: church grounds\nE: on the ocean",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what is meant by \"very large graveyard\". This typically refers to a cemetery or burial ground that accommodates many graves.",
    "Consider choice A: \"arlington\". Arlington National Cemetery is a very large and well-known graveyard in the United States that holds many graves, particularly of military personnel.",
    "Consider choice B: \"city\". While many cities have graveyards, saying \"city\" alone does not specify a large graveyard.",
    "Consider choice C: \"every town\". This implies that all towns have large graveyards, which might not be true as not every town has a significant cemetery.",
    "Consider choice D: \"church grounds\". Some churches do have graveyards, but they tend to be smaller and may not be \"very large\" compared to larger cemeteries.",
    "Consider choice E: \"on the ocean\". This is atypical for graveyards, as they are generally located on land rather than in the ocean.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, Arlington National Cemetery (choice A) stands out as a specific and recognized large graveyard, making it the most suitable choice for the question."
