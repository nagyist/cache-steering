  "steps": [
    "The question states that the new place she was moving to is advertised as pet-friendly, but it won't allow her small dog. This suggests that the place has specific restrictions on pet ownership despite the general advertisement.",
    "Option A, \"trailer park,\" typically allows pets, especially in many family-friendly areas, but it can vary widely based on the individual park\u2019s rules.",
    "Option B, \"Germany,\" is a location and doesn't fit as a specific type of dwelling, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Option D, \"basket,\" is not a reasonable living space for a person, making it irrelevant in the context.",
    "Option E, \"grandmother's house,\" could potentially be pet-friendly or not depending on the grandmother\u2019s personal preferences, but it doesn\u2019t fit the reasoning of being a regulated dwelling with explicit pet restrictions.",
    "Option C, \"apartment complex,\" is a well-known type of dwelling that often has regulations regarding pet ownership, including weight limits and breed restrictions, which aligns with the situation described in the question.",
    "Since the question specifies that her new place advertises being pet-friendly yet does not allow small dogs, it is most likely a formal establishment like an apartment complex that has set rules.",
    "From the reasoning, the most logical answer is option C given the context of pet regulations in apartment complexes."
