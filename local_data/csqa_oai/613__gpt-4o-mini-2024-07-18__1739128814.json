  "steps": [
    "To analyze Sarah's situation, we consider that she thought she had been home all evening, indicating she was likely home after sunset.",
    "If Sarah was home all evening, it implies she was not out during the evening hours, which typically stretch from the end of the afternoon into the night.",
    "The only time she could have left the house before being home all evening would need to be at a time before evening began.",
    "Evaluating the potential options provided, we must find a time that occurs before evening.",
    "Evening usually begins after sunset, which varies, but generally begins in the late afternoon and extends through night. Therefore, any time before evening could be included among the earlier times of day.",
    "Looking at option A: early morning (a time very early in the day), option B: day time (which can encompass a lot of the hours from morning to afternoon), option C: night (clearly not applicable as she was home then), option D: afternoon (the latter part of day time), and option E: daytime (also encompasses the time before evening).",
    "The best options for when she could have left before being home in the evening would be \"early morning,\" \"daytime,\" or \"afternoon\".",
    "Since \"daytime\" and \"afternoon\" would still fit the criteria of being home before evening, however, \"early morning\" specifically indicates a time before day has fully started, which is logically the only concrete time she could have left.",
    "Confirmation of options points that while many of them could encompass the time before evening, \"early morning\" stands out as a singular time frame that clearly separates itself from the later part of the day and fits the statement of having left earlier without being home."
