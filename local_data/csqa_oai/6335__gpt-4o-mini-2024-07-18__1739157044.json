  "query": "Question: Where would a doctor train before gaining a practice?\n\nChoices:\nA: butcher shop\nB: golf course\nC: nursing home\nD: medical school\nE: medical office",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of medical training, which typically involves extensive education and preparation in a formal setting.",
    "Identify the options provided and determine which one is related to formal education in medicine.",
    "Option A is a butcher shop, which is unrelated to medical training.",
    "Option B is a golf course, which has no connection to medical practice.",
    "Option C is a nursing home. While it may involve medical care, it is not a place for initial medical training.",
    "Option D is medical school, which is specifically designed for training future doctors.",
    "Option E is a medical office, which typically serves as a practice area rather than a training facility.",
    "Based on the reasoning, medical school is the formal environment where doctors undergo the necessary education and training before practicing medicine."
