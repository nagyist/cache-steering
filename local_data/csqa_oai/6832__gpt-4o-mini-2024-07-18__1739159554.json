  "query": "Question: Where could an electric razor be exposed to water?\n\nChoices:\nA: medicine cabinet\nB: outside\nC: k mart\nD: bathroom\nE: wal mart",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the purpose of an electric razor, which is primarily used for shaving facial hair, often in a setting where water might be involved.",
    "Evaluate option A: a medicine cabinet. Typically, a medicine cabinet stores pharmaceuticals and health items, but it\u2019s not likely to be a place where an electric razor is regularly exposed to water.",
    "Evaluate option B: outside. While an electric razor might be used outdoors in theory, it is uncommon and generally not exposed to water in an outdoor environment.",
    "Evaluate option C: K Mart. This is a retail store. While razors might be sold here, the exposure to water would not typically happen in a retail setting.",
    "Evaluate option D: a bathroom. This is a common location for using electric razors where water can be present (e.g., while shaving or washing the face).",
    "Evaluate option E: Wal Mart. Similar to K Mart, this is a retail environment where razors might be sold but does not provide exposure to water.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option where an electric razor could realistically be exposed to water during its use is in the bathroom."
