  "query": "Question: Someone lacking immortality will one day be?\n\nChoices:\nA: kick the bucket\nB: mortal\nC: dead\nD: can die\nE: dying",
  "steps": [
    "We start by noting that the question refers to someone who lacks immortality, which implies that they are subject to death.",
    "Lacking immortality means that the individual will eventually experience a final end, which is colloquially referred to as \"dying.\"",
    "Out of the choices given, \"kick the bucket\" (A) is an informal way of saying someone has died but does not directly answer what happens to someone lacking immortality.",
    "\"Mortal\" (B) is a descriptor of being subject to death but does not indicate the outcome that will occur eventually.",
    "\"Dead\" (C) is a definite state that occurs after dying, so it aligns closely with what eventually happens to someone lacking immortality.",
    "\"Can die\" (D) implies the potential for death, but it does not confirm it as an eventuality.",
    "\"Dying\" (E) is a process leading to death, but it does not specify the final outcome, which is being dead.",
    "Among the options, \"dead\" (C) most accurately reflects the final state for someone who lacks immortality."
