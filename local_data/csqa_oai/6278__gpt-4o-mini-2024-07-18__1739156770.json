  "steps": [
    "First, we should identify common characteristics or behaviors associated with blue birds.",
    "Blue birds are often recognized for their beautiful coloration, which might lead to behaviors related to mating and territory.",
    "Singing is a common behavior in many bird species, including blue birds, which use song to communicate and attract mates.",
    "While blue birds certainly spread their wings to fly, this is not unique to them and doesn't specifically characterize their behavior compared to other birds.",
    "Picking berries is a specific feeding behavior; some blue birds do eat berries, but it's not universally known as a defining characteristic.",
    "Laying eggs is a general behavior of all birds, not specific to blue birds, so it doesn't help us identify what blue birds are particularly known for.",
    "Screaming is an unusual behavior for blue birds; they are more often celebrated for their melodious songs rather than loud calls.",
    "Based on the information gathered, singing songs is the most well-known and specific behavior associated with blue birds."
