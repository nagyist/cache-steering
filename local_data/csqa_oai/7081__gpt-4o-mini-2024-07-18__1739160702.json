  "query": "Question: Using a television allows you to take in audio as well as what kind of information?\n\nChoices:\nA: eye strain\nB: entertained\nC: boredom\nD: visual\nE: news",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking what type of information can be received through a television, in addition to audio.",
    "Televisions are primarily devices used for visual display, and they present both audio and visual content.",
    "Among the choices given, we need to identify which pertains to the type of information other than audio.",
    "Choice A, \"eye strain,\" does not refer to information; it refers to a condition that might result from overuse of visual devices.",
    "Choice B, \"entertained,\" is a subjective experience and not a specific type of information received from a television.",
    "Choice C, \"boredom,\" is also a subjective feeling and not relevant to the type of information delivered by a television.",
    "Choice D, \"visual,\" directly refers to what a television displays; this is relevant information gained from watching television.",
    "Choice E, \"news,\" while it is a type of content that can be delivered via television, it does not specify the type of information like \"visual\" does.",
    "Since we are looking for the type of information, \"visual\" is the most appropriate choice as it encompasses everything that is displayed on a TV screen."
