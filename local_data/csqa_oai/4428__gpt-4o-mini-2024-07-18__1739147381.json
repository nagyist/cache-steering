  "query": "Question: Both sides in World War I used what to cause death that is now banned?\n\nChoices:\nA: homicide\nB: poisonous gas\nC: cyanide\nD: nuclear weapons\nE: massive weapons",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options provided. We are looking for a substance or method used during World War I that led to death and is now banned.",
    "Option A, homicide, is not a specific weapon or method used in warfare, so it doesn't fit the description.",
    "Option C, cyanide, while a poisonous substance, was not commonly used as a weapon in WWI. It has been used more notoriously in other contexts like chemical warfare by the Nazis in WWII, but not predominantly in WWI.",
    "Option D, nuclear weapons, were not developed during World War I; they came into existence during World War II, so this cannot be the answer.",
    "Option E, massive weapons, is vague and does not refer to a specific banned substance or method. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Now, let's consider option B, which is poisonous gas. Historical evidence shows that poisonous gas was indeed used in World War I, including types like chlorine and mustard gas. Following the war, the use of these chemical agents became heavily restricted and is widely considered banned under various treaties.",
    "Given that poisonous gas was specifically utilized to cause death during World War I and is now banned, it fits the criteria of the question perfectly."
