  "query": "Question: Joe is looking for his comb, which he keeps near a mirror.  Where might he try looking for  it?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedstand\nB: medicine cabinet\nC: suitcase\nD: barber shop\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where Joe typically keeps his comb. The question states he keeps it near a mirror.",
    "Mirrors are commonly found in bathrooms or places where grooming occurs, suggesting locations associated with personal care.",
    "A bedstand is generally associated with sleeping areas and would not typically be a place for grooming tools like a comb.",
    "A medicine cabinet is usually located in a bathroom and often contains grooming supplies such as combs, scissors, and toiletries.",
    "A suitcase is generally used for travel and would not usually be a permanent location for a comb that is regularly used.",
    "A barber shop does contain combs, but it's not a place where Joe would keep his personal comb; he likely uses it at home.",
    "A pocket is also an unlikely place for Joe to keep his comb, as it is a larger item that is not practical to carry around in a pocket.",
    "Thus, the most logical choice for where Joe might try looking for his comb, which he keeps near a mirror, is the medicine cabinet."
