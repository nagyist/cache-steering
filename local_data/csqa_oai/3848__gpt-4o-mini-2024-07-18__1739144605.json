  "query": "Question: When not playing your mandolin, where would you store it?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: musical instrument store\nC: instrument case\nD: music shop\nE: music store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is typically done with musical instruments when they are not in use. Instruments need to be stored properly to protect them from damage.",
    "Next, think about the options listed. A closet might be a place to store various items, but it may not provide adequate protection for a mandolin.",
    "Look at the option of a musical instrument store. This is a location where instruments are sold, not where an individual would store their personal instrument.",
    "Consider the option of an instrument case. This is specifically designed for storing musical instruments and protecting them from environmental factors and potential damage.",
    "Evaluate the other choices like \"music shop\" and \"music store.\" Similar to the musical instrument store, these are commercial locations for purchasing instruments, not for storage.",
    "After reviewing the options, the instrument case stands out as the most practical and protective choice for storing a mandolin when it is not being played.",
    "Thus, the best and most logical answer, based on the purpose and function of the items mentioned, is the instrument case."
