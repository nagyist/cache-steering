    "The question states that if students work hard, it implies that their effort will have a positive impact on their performance.",
    "We need to evaluate the options provided to determine which one directly correlates with the idea of students performing well due to hard work.",
    "Option A, \"excel in soccer,\" does not logically connect to general student performance associated with studying or academic work.",
    "Option B, \"do well,\" is a broad term that can relate to students achieving good grades or success in academic settings due to hard work.",
    "Option C, \"read books,\" doesn't necessarily reflect performance; it represents an activity, which may or may not result in improved performance.",
    "Option D, \"amount to,\" is vague and does not specify how students would perform or what kind of performance is expected from hard work.",
    "Option E, \"better comprehension,\" could be a result of hard work, but it is a more specific outcome rather than an overall performance measure.",
    "Among the options, B (\"do well\") is the most fitting choice because it embodies the outcome typically expected when students exert effort in their studies."
