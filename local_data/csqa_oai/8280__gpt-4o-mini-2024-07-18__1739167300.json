  "steps": [
    "North America experiences winter at the beginning of the year because it is located in a specific part of the Earth.",
    "The key factor for seasonal changes is the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbit around the Sun.",
    "During December to February, the Northern Hemisphere, which includes North America, is tilted away from the Sun.",
    "Because of this tilt, the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight during these months, resulting in colder temperatures and winter conditions.",
    "In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun during this period, experiencing summer.",
    "Therefore, the occurrence of winter in North America at the start of the year is directly linked to its location in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "The other choices either directly refer to aspects of the continent or generic terms that do not accurately explain the seasonal phenomenon.",
    "The term \"northern hemisphere\" specifically identifies the area of the Earth responsible for winter at this time of year.",
    "Thus, the correct answer must link North America to its position relative to the Earth's hemispheres."
