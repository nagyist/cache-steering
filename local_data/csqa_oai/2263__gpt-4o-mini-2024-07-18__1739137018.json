  "query": "Question: A man is supposed to walk closer to the street when with a?\n\nChoices:\nA: female group\nB: father\nC: gods\nD: boys\nE: lady",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context in which the man is walking. The question suggests social norms regarding men's behavior in different contexts.",
    "Consider the different choices and how they relate to societal expectations. Men often walk closer to the street when with women to protect them.",
    "Analyze each option: \n- A: female group - \"group\" may include multiple women, which fits the context.\n- B: father - typically does not require moving closer to the street.\n- C: gods - not applicable as it involves a spiritual concept rather than a social situation.\n- D: boys - does not imply a protective instinct as closely as women do.\n- E: lady - this is a specific term for a woman, suggesting a similar protective instinct.",
    "Compare the best options: both A (female group) and E (lady) suggest walking closer to the street for protection.",
    "Determine if there's a distinction between a \"female group\" and \"lady\". A \"lady\" implies a single individual, while a \"female group\" implies a collective.",
    "Evaluate which option aligns more with traditional chivalric behavior. The term \"lady\" carries a stronger connotation of protection in this context than a collective group.",
    "Reassess how the protective behavior would apply in a modern context versus traditional norms. Despite shifts in norms, a man still tends to walk closer to a \"lady\" for protection.",
    "Consider if both A and E could be equally appropriate. While A describes the scenario broadly, E is precise and directly highlights the individual relationship."
