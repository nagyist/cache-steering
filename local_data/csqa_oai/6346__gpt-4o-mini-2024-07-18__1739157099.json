  "query": "Question: In order to see a story on the big screen what must you do?\n\nChoices:\nA: go to movies\nB: visualize\nC: reading\nD: open book\nE: sketching a picture",
  "steps": [
    "To see a story on the big screen, one usually expects a visual representation of that story.",
    "The term \"big screen\" typically refers to movies or films that are shown in theaters.",
    "Given the options, \"go to movies\" directly relates to the act of watching films in a theater setting.",
    "The other options, such as \"visualize,\" \"reading,\" \"open book,\" and \"sketching a picture,\" do not directly pertain to experiencing a story on the big screen.",
    "\"Visualize\" implies imagining rather than actually seeing a story presented in film form.",
    "\"Reading\" and \"open book\" refer to engaging with a text, not a film.",
    "\"Sketching a picture\" also does not align with viewing a story on screen; it refers to creating art rather than experiencing it through film.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate action that leads to seeing a story on the big screen is going to the movies."
