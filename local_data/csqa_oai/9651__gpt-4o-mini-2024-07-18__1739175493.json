  "query": "Question: Where might  jellyfish stay warm?\n\nChoices:\nA: atlantic ocean\nB: bikini bottom\nC: japanese restaurant\nD: store\nE: pacific ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the habitats where jellyfish are commonly found. They are aquatic creatures that thrive in oceans.",
    "Next, assess the specific choices given. Options A (Atlantic Ocean) and E (Pacific Ocean) are both extensive bodies of saltwater known to host jellyfish.",
    "Further evaluate choice B (Bikini Bottom). This is a fictional underwater city from the animated series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and doesn\u2019t represent a real-life habitat for jellyfish.",
    "Now, examine choice C (Japanese restaurant). While jellyfish can be served in some cuisines, it's not their natural habitat and generally not a place where they would stay warm.",
    "Consider choice D (store). This option doesn't pertain to the natural warm habitat of jellyfish.",
    "Between the remaining choices A and E, both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can get warm in certain areas, but the question asks where jellyfish might stay warm, not merely where they could be found.",
    "Jellyfish are typically more prevalent in warmer waters, which might suggest certain regions or currents within these oceans.",
    "However, without further specifics about which regions are warmer or the context of \u201cstaying warm,\u201d it makes sense to regard natural, open water over commercial venues.",
    "Considering overall common knowledge, jellyfish are more associated with warmer ocean waters, making both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans plausible.",
    "Ultimately, both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans contain warmer areas where jellyfish can thrive, resulting in no single answer being definitively correct; however, the restaurant setting does not hold up as a natural habitat for the jellyfish."
