  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the big man was all size and no talent\" suggests that the individual is physically imposing but lacks skill. This often refers to a player in a sport where size is an advantage.",
    "The mention of \"the coach taught him to defend the key\" indicates that the context involves a sport where defending a specific area (the key) is important. In basketball, the \"key\" is the painted area near the basket.",
    "The phrase \"make it his home\" suggests that the big man was being encouraged to dominate this area, which aligns well with basketball where players are often trained to protect their territory or area near the rim.",
    "Considering these points, the context of the statement aligns with basketball. Defending the key is a crucial aspect of basketball strategy, especially for taller players.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, A (action) is vague, B (florida) is not relevant, C (basketball court) directly correlates to the context of defending the key, D (pocket) is unrelated, and E (purse) is also irrelevant.",
    "Since only one option directly connects to the sport-related context involving defense and the key, C (basketball court) appears to be the most logical answer."
