  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the place to purchase birth control pills.",
    "Birth control pills are a type of medication that typically require a prescription from a healthcare provider.",
    "After acquiring a prescription, one can buy birth control pills from various locations, primarily pharmacies or drug stores.",
    "A drug store is a common retail location where medications, including birth control pills, are dispensed to customers.",
    "Considering the other options, A (woman's purse) and D (medicine cabinet) are places where pills are kept, not purchased.",
    "B (Riley's) is not specified as a pharmacy or a place that sells medical supplies, so it doesn't fit the answer context.",
    "E (bedroom) also refers to a location where pills might be stored, but not where they are purchased.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer among the options for where to buy birth control pills is a drug store."
