  "query": "Question: What's one characteristic that separates a person from a stuffed dummy?\n\nChoices:\nA: absorb moisture\nB: cross street\nC: experience pain\nD: deceive himself\nE: dead",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify a characteristic that distinguishes a living human from an inanimate object like a stuffed dummy.",
    "A stuffed dummy does not have the ability to absorb moisture like a living organism does.",
    "Option A, \"absorb moisture,\" could apply to a living person but not specifically separate them from a stuffed dummy since the dummy can retain moisture to some extent.",
    "Next, we consider option B, \"cross street.\" While a person can cross a street, a stuffed dummy cannot, suggesting this could be a potential distinguishing feature.",
    "However, crossing a street is more an action of mobility rather than a fundamental characteristic.",
    "Looking at option C, \"experience pain,\" this is a crucial characteristic that living beings possess. A stuffed dummy cannot feel pain at all, making this option distinctive.",
    "Option D, \"deceive himself,\" seems more aligned with the complexities of human consciousness and self-awareness rather than a straightforward characteristic separating a person from a dummy.",
    "Lastly, option E, \"dead,\" is not applicable because a stuffed dummy is not alive to be considered dead; it's simply an object.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, \"experience pain\" (C) stands out as a definitive characteristic separating a person from a stuffed dummy."
