  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the biological function of having sex, which implies a focus on the natural processes and purposes that sex serves in biology.",
    "In biological terms, one of the primary functions of sexual reproduction is the continuation of a species, which involves combining genetic material from two parents to create offspring.",
    "While sex can have other benefits and purposes in a broader context (such as emotional bonding or pleasure), these are not strictly biological functions.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, \"reproduce\" (Choice B) explicitly refers to the biological function of producing offspring.",
    "The other options\u2014\"compliments\" (A), \"sweating\" (C), \"talented\" (D), and \"affluent\" (E)\u2014do not correlate with the biological function associated with sex.",
    "Given that \"reproduce\" aligns directly with the biological function of sex, it becomes clear that this is the correct answer."
