  "steps": [
    "The question indicates a person is watching a movie, which suggests they are likely in a location designed for that activity.",
    "Cinemas are specifically designed for watching movies, providing a screen, seating, and sound systems tailored for this experience.",
    "The park is generally an outdoor space for recreation, and while some parks may have outdoor film screenings, they are not primarily designed for watching movies.",
    "Martorell is a town in Spain, but the name alone does not indicate a location specifically for watching movies.",
    "A jeep is a type of vehicle and not a place where one would typically watch a movie.",
    "An airplane can show movies, but it is not a dedicated movie-watching venue like a cinema.",
    "In contrast, the other options either do not provide a setting specifically for watching a movie or are less likely for that primary purpose.",
    "Therefore, considering all the options, the best answer is where one would usually go to watch a movie: at the cinema."
