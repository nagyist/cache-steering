  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of \"traveled deeper and deeper\" which implies moving into a space that is enclosed or has layers.",
    "Note that the phrase \"the light faded away until it was pitch black\" suggests a complete lack of light, indicating a place where natural light cannot penetrate.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided. A \"porch\" is generally an outdoor space and would not lead to complete darkness.",
    "An \"attic\" might be dark, but typically there is still some light from windows or openings, and one wouldn't usually describe going \"deeper\" into an attic.",
    "A \"beach\" is also an outdoor space, and while one might walk away from the water into the darkness, it doesn't fit the idea of going deeper.",
    "The \"ocean\" is a vast, deep body of water, and it is well-known that light diminishes rapidly underwater. This aligns with the description of arriving at pitch blackness.",
    "The \"universe\" could also be considered dark and vast, however, the notion of traveling deeper into the universe doesn't match a conventional experience as compared to the ocean.",
    "Considering the act of traveling into an environment where one would descend and experience increasing darkness, the ocean makes the most sense.",
    "Thus, the best answer according to the reasoning is that John might be in the ocean, where it is common to describe the depth and lack of light."
