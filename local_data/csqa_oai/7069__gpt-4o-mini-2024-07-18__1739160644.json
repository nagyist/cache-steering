  "steps": [
    "The question is about what can be determined using an ultrasound when a woman is pregnant.",
    "Ultrasounds are commonly used in prenatal care to provide images of the fetus.",
    "One of the primary uses of ultrasound is to determine the sex of the baby.",
    "The ultrasound technician can look for certain physical markers that differentiate male from female fetuses.",
    "Other options provided, like \"talk nonsense,\" \"cry,\" \"begin to talk,\" and \"learn to speak,\" are not applicable to the context of an ultrasound.",
    "Therefore, the most relevant and logical answer is that an ultrasound can be used to find out if the baby is a boy or a girl.",
    "Now, I will review the answer choices to confirm the best fit.",
    "Among the choices A, B, C, D, and E, option B (\"boy or girl\") directly relates to what can be discovered during an ultrasound.",
    "The other options do not relate to ultrasound or pregnancy at all."
