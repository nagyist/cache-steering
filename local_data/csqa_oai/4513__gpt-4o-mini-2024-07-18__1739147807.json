  "steps": [
    "To analyze this question, I need to consider what the fundamental requirement of committing murder is.",
    "Murder involves the unlawful killing of another person. Therefore, a key aspect of murder is that another person must die as a result of the act.",
    "Option A (gun) suggests a specific method of committing murder, but it is not a requirement since murder can occur by various means (e.g., poisoning, stabbing).",
    "Option B (go to jail) implies the consequence of being caught for murder, but it is not part of the act of committing murder itself.",
    "Option C (die) directly addresses the outcome of murder. For murder to occur, the victim must die.",
    "Option D (own death) does not relate to the act of committing murder, and it is not a requirement.",
    "Option E (great sorrow) refers to the emotional impact of murder, but it does not fulfill the requirement for the act of murder itself.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the only choice that directly correlates with the definition of murder as an unlawful killing is option C (die)."
