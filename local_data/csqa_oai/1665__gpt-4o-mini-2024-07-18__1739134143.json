  "query": "Question: Where could a human run to hide if someone was chasing them in the midwest?\n\nChoices:\nA: cornfield\nB: workplace\nC: restroom\nD: star trek\nE: space",
  "steps": [
    "The question requires identifying a suitable hiding place for a human in the Midwest when being chased.",
    "Midwest is known for its agricultural landscape, which includes open fields and farms.",
    "A cornfield is a prominent feature in many areas of the Midwest, often providing cover for someone trying to hide.",
    "Workplaces typically have open areas where it would be difficult to hide without being seen.",
    "Restrooms provide some privacy, but they are usually indoor spaces and may not offer effective concealment from a pursuer.",
    "Star Trek and space do not relate to tangible hiding places on Earth or in the Midwest specifically.",
    "Given these considerations, the cornfield stands out as the most viable option for hiding.",
    "I will now compare the other options against the cornfield option to reaffirm my choice.",
    "The workplace and restroom would likely not be as effective for hiding in a chase scenario as there are often people around.",
    "The settings of Star Trek and space are irrelevant for hiding from a chase in the Midwest context."
