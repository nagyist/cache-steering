  "query": "Question: The grain-seller needed dry storage, where should he put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: pantry\nB: storage closet\nC: building\nD: wet\nE: warehouse",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the requirement for \"dry storage\". This indicates a need for a location that is not exposed to moisture or humidity.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices against the requirement for dry conditions. \"Pantry\" typically holds food and may have some moisture, so it may not be the best choice.",
    "Consider \"storage closet\". While it can be dry, it may not have the space or conditions suitable for bulk storage of grain.",
    "Looking at \"building\", it is too vague and does not necessarily imply dry conditions for storing grain.",
    "Investigate \"wet\". This option is clearly unsuitable as it explicitly suggests moisture, which is detrimental for storing grain.",
    "Now, consider \"warehouse\". This is most commonly used for storing bulk products and can provide dry, controlled conditions suitable for grain.",
    "Reflect on the nature of the product being stored. Grain is particularly sensitive to moisture, necessitating a dedicated dry space.",
    "After reviewing all options, \"warehouse\" clearly aligns with the need for dry storage due to its specifications for bulk storage.",
    "No other options provide the necessary conditions as effectively as a warehouse would for dry grain storage."
