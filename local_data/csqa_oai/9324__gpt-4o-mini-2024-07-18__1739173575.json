  "query": "Question: Where might sheep go to a show?\n\nChoices:\nA: walmart\nB: wolf\nC: farm\nD: meadow\nE: fairgrounds",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question. \"Sheep\" suggests that this is about livestock or farm animals.",
    "Next, examine the choices for relevance to sheep. \"Walmart\" is a retail store, and does not pertain to sheep or a place where they might be shown.",
    "Then, look at \"wolf.\" While wolves are predators of sheep, they are not a location where sheep would go. This choice is not applicable.",
    "Next, analyze \"farm.\" Farms often have sheep, but typically, a farm is not a place where sheep go to show themselves.",
    "Now consider \"meadow.\" A meadow is a natural setting where sheep might graze, but it also doesn\u2019t conventionally serve as a location for shows involving sheep.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"fairgrounds.\" Fairgrounds are traditional locations where livestock shows, including sheep shows, are held during fairs.",
    "Since \"fairgrounds\" is the most logical option for where sheep would go to be shown, it is determined to be the best answer."
