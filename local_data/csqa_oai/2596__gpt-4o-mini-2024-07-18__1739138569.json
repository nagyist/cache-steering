  "steps": [
    "Consider the question, which asks what the result of having a sizable lunch would be. A sizable lunch typically means a meal that is substantial or large in quantity.",
    "Having a large meal can lead to feeling physically full, as the stomach has more food to accommodate, which usually happens after consuming a significant amount of food.",
    "When one eats a sizable lunch, the immediate physical response is often a sense of fullness, as the stomach expands to hold the food.",
    "Feeling full could lead to other reactions like satisfaction or even sleepiness, but the most direct outcome of the act of having a sizable lunch is the feeling of fullness.",
    "Assess the choices provided: A (give up) doesn\u2019t relate to a meal, B (obesity) pertains to a long-term effect of consistently large meals, C (feeling satisfied) might happen but is more subjective, D (get sleepy) can occur but is not guaranteed, and E (feel full) directly describes the immediate physical effect.",
    "Between 'feeling satisfied' and 'feeling full', while both can occur, 'feeling full' is more directly tied to the act of finishing a sizable meal.",
    "Thus, after careful consideration, the most fitting answer, which results from consuming a sizable lunch, is a feeling of fullness."
