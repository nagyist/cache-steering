  "query": "Question: A government seeks what over it's people?\n\nChoices:\nA: country\nB: trouble\nC: city\nD: sun\nE: control",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what a government seeks over its people.",
    "When governments operate, they typically aim to maintain authority and regulate the conduct of citizens.",
    "The option \"country\" refers to a geographical area or nation, which is not something a government seeks over its people but rather an entity that a government governs.",
    "The option \"trouble\" suggests disruption or chaos, which is contrary to what a government would want to achieve.",
    "The option \"city\" is similar to \"country\" in that it refers to a location, not something a government seeks in terms of governance.",
    "The option \"sun\" carries connotations of light or warmth, but does not relate to governance or authority.",
    "The option \"control\" is the act of exercising authority over people, space, and affairs, which directly relates to the primary function of any government.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"control\" is the most logical answer since it embodies the relationship between a government and its citizens."
