    "The term \"soggy\" typically refers to something that is wet or damp, indicating the presence of moisture or water.",
    "If the ceiling is soggy, it suggests that there is an unusual amount of moisture reaching the ceiling from above.",
    "Since the ceiling is part of the structure of a building, the most likely source of excess moisture is the roof.",
    "If the roof has an issue that allows moisture to reach the ceiling, it could mean that water is penetrating through the roof.",
    "A common problem that leads to moisture accumulation in a ceiling is a leak in the roof.",
    "The possibility of a leak aligns with the definitions and known issues that can cause a ceiling to be soggy.",
    "Options B (building), C (field), D (metaphor), and E (sag) do not directly relate to the cause of a soggy ceiling.",
    "To summarize, a soggy ceiling strongly suggests a problem with the roof, particularly pointing towards a leak."
