  "query": "Question: Where can someone likely use more than one washing machine?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: laundromat\nC: communal laundry\nD: wash clothes\nE: cellar",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will evaluate the options by determining where multiple washing machines might be commonly found or utilized.",
    "Option A, \"house,\" typically has one or sometimes two washing machines at most, depending on the size of the household. Hence, it is less likely to provide more than one machine for use.",
    "Next, I look at option B, the \"laundromat.\" Laundromats are designed for public use and often have several washing machines available for customers. Thus, it is a strong candidate for multiple machine usage.",
    "Now, I will check option C, \"communal laundry.\" Communal laundry facilities can be located in apartment buildings or certain residential areas, and they often have multiple machines available for residents to use, which makes this option also plausible.",
    "Considering option D, \"wash clothes,\" this phrase refers more to the action of washing itself rather than a location. Therefore, it does not fit the context of where to find multiple washing machines.",
    "Lastly, I review option E, \"cellar.\" A cellar does not specifically imply the presence of multiple washing machines; it could just be a storage area or private wash area, which typically does not contain multiple machines.",
    "I compare options B and C, both of which can legitimately have multiple washing machines. However, \"laundromat\" is even more definitive in providing such a multitude of machines for the public.",
    "I will take a moment to evaluate possible overlaps or the context of public vs. private usage. While a communal laundry can have multiple machines, it may not always be accessible to many people at once, reducing its suitability compared to the laundromat.",
    "Ultimately, I conclude that laundromats are the most common location that encompasses a larger number of washing machines typically used by various customers simultaneously."
