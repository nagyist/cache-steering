  "query": "Question: Sally was a real estate agent but she was a bad one.  She didn't do well because people knew that she would oversell some features of the homes she sold. They assumed that she was always doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cover up\nB: lie\nC: manipulate\nD: exaggerate\nE: incompetent",
  "steps": [
    "Sally was known to oversell features of the homes she sold, which directly suggests that she was not presenting the homes honestly or accurately.",
    "People's assumptions about someone who oversells typically involve a lack of trust in their honesty or integrity concerning the details of the homes.",
    "The phrasing \"oversell some features\" implies that she may have embellished or overstated the qualities of the properties.",
    "Considering the options, the term \"lie\" (B) seems to denote a complete fabrication, whereas \"exaggerate\" (D) relates more to the act of overstating characteristics which aligns closely with her behavior of overselling.",
    "\"Manipulate\" (C) implies a more calculated approach to influence others' perceptions, while \"cover up\" (A) suggests concealing negative information rather than embellishing positive features.",
    "The notion of being incompetent (E) could imply a lack of ability; however, the focus here is more on her conduct than her skills.",
    "As Sally oversold features and led people to have doubts about her sincerity, the most accurate assumption people would make about her would be that she tends to \"exaggerate.\"",
    "Among the choices, \"exaggerate\" captures the essence of her actions in a way that aligns with how people would perceive her selling practices."
