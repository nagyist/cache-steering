  "query": "Question: He knew the kickoff wouldn't happen right away, so he waited a quarter past the what before he turned on the football game?\n\nChoices:\nA: hundredweight\nB: upper\nC: hour\nD: quarterlight\nE: school year",
  "steps": [
    "The kickoff mentioned implies it is with respect to time, particularly when considering a game that has a scheduled start.",
    "The phrase \"quarter past the what\" indicates we are looking for a unit of time to fill in the blank.",
    "Among the choices provided, options like A (hundredweight), B (upper), and D (quarterlight) are not standard measurements of time.",
    "Option E (school year) also does not fit, as it delineates an academic calendar rather than a time measurement relevant to a specific time of day.",
    "Option C (hour) stands out as it is a standard measurement of time and fits well within the context of when to expect the kickoff.",
    "When it\u2019s \u201cquarter past the hour,\u201d it implies a specific time (for example, 1:15 if one were referring to the first hour), and this logically fits the flow of waiting for a game to start.",
    "Since the question is asking for what he waited a quarter past, \u201chour\u201d is the correct context for timing related to the game\u2019s start.",
    "Therefore, based on the reasoning that we are looking for a unit of time and \u201chour\u201d is the only relevant option, we conclude this is the right choice."
