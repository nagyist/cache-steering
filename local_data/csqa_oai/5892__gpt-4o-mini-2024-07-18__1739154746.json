  "query": "Question: Where are all ferret found before they are captured?\n\nChoices:\nA: hutch\nB: tree house\nC: north america\nD: rocky mountains\nE: out of doors",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what ferrets are and their natural habitat. Ferrets are domesticated animals, often kept as pets, and originally descended from wild species found in Europe, particularly the European polecat.",
    "Next, recognize the question asks about where ferrets are found prior to being captured. Being domesticated, they do not live in the wild in the same way wild animals do, especially in North America.",
    "Now, look at the choices given. Choice A (hutch) refers to a type of enclosure where ferrets are kept, which doesn't answer the question of their natural habitat.",
    "Choice B (tree house) doesn\u2019t make sense since ferrets don't inhabit tree houses.",
    "Choice C (north america) is a location which suggests ferrets could be found there, but this is misleading since they are not a native species to this region in their wild form.",
    "Choice D (rocky mountains) is also not applicable as ferrets do not inhabit mountainous regions in the wild.",
    "Choice E (out of doors) is the most fitting because it suggests an outdoor environment, which is where domesticated ferrets might be found before being captured if they escape.",
    "Now, evaluate which choice best satisfies the idea of their existence before capture. Wild ferrets or ferret-like animals inhabit open spaces rather than confined locations typically.",
    "Thus, after eliminating choices A through D and confirming E\u2019s suitability, the conclusion is formed based on the reasoning established through analysis of their characteristics and habitats."
