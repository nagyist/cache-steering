  "steps": [
    "The teacher indicated that the topic would be on the test.",
    "This implies that the material covered is critical for the students' understanding and preparation for the test.",
    "If a subject or topic is important enough to be included in a test, it is reasonable to conclude that the content discussed is significant.",
    "The language used by the teacher implies that the students should focus on this material as it can affect their grades or understanding.",
    "Looking at the choices, 'very important' aligns well with the implication of needing to learn material that will appear on a test.",
    "The choice 'joyful or painful' does not directly relate to the educational importance of the topic.",
    "'Exposure' does not fit in this context as it doesn't directly convey the significance of learning the material for an upcoming test.",
    "'Fun' and 'free' are also not related to the necessity of understanding a topic for academic performance; they suggest a different context entirely.",
    "The only choice that appropriately reflects the significance of what was being taught in relation to the upcoming test is 'very important.'"
