  "query": "Question: If you hit someone while driving what could happen to that person?\n\nChoices:\nA: deaths\nB: get arrested\nC: moving\nD: using gas\nE: may die",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the ramifications of hitting someone while driving. The primary concern is the physical harm that could be caused to the individual involved.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. \"Deaths\" suggests that the person could die as a direct result of the accident, while \"may die\" implies a possibility of severe injury that could lead to death.",
    "Analyze the option \"get arrested\". While it's plausible that the driver could face legal consequences, the person who was hit may not necessarily face arrest unless they were breaking the law in some way.",
    "Look at \"moving\". In what context could the individual be moving after being hit? It's not inherently relevant since being struck usually requires assistance or leads to incapacitation.",
    "Lastly, \"using gas\" does not correlate in any meaningful way with the scenario of someone being hit while driving, as it deals with fuel consumption rather than consequences of a crash.",
    "Between the possibilities of experiencing severe injury or fatality, \"may die\" seems to capture the uncertain reality of injury severity better than \"deaths,\" which implies a definitive outcome rather than a possibility.",
    "Therefore, weighing the choices, \"E: may die\" reflects the potential consequences for the person who was hit, recognizing that there is a chance for serious injury without definitively stating they have died."
