  "query": "Question: The class got to tour the launch pad, one student looked up imagining all the shuttle launches from where?\n\nChoices:\nA: nasa\nB: space center\nC: movie\nD: florida\nE: cape kennedy",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a tour of the launch pad, which implies a location where space shuttles are launched.",
    "Two prominent places known for shuttle launches are Cape Canaveral and NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.",
    "The term \"space center\" is quite general and could refer to any space-related facility, hence it\u2019s less specific than Kennedy Space Center.",
    "NASA is the organization that oversees space missions, but it does not specifically refer to the physical location of launch pads.",
    "\"Florida\" is a state where the Kennedy Space Center is located, but it does not directly reference the launch pad itself.",
    "\"Cape Kennedy\" is an alternate name for the Kennedy Space Center, making it directly relevant to the question about shuttle launches.",
    "The phrase \"looking up imagining all the shuttle launches\" suggests a location where one would actually see these launches, which is at the Kennedy Space Center.",
    "Since \"Cape Kennedy\" is the name associated with the physical location of NASA's launch facilities, it is the most precise answer.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all the choices, the best answer that directly relates to the launch pad for shuttle launches is \"Cape Kennedy\"."
