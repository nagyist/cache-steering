  "query": "Question: What is a negative external consequence for someone who takes part in a killing?\n\nChoices:\nA: dies\nB: being imprisoned\nC: blood\nD: bloody mess\nE: feeling of guilt",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is meant by \"negative external consequence.\" This typically refers to an outcome that negatively affects someone other than the direct participant in an action.",
    "Next, I examine the choices given to see which could qualify as a negative external consequence.",
    "Choice A, \"dies,\" relates to someone who is taking part in a killing but is not an external consequence; it refers to the individual involved rather than an external party.",
    "Choice B, \"being imprisoned,\" can also be considered a direct consequence for the individual who commits the act rather than an external effect on others.",
    "Choice C, \"blood,\" does not clearly articulate a negative consequence that impacts others and is more descriptive of the aftermath of a killing.",
    "Choice D, \"bloody mess,\" describes the scene left behind after the act but does not indicate how it negatively impacts anyone other than as a result of the killing.",
    "Choice E, \"feeling of guilt,\" refers to the internal emotional state of the individual committing the act rather than an external consequence affecting others.",
    "Upon reviewing the choices, it appears that \"being imprisoned\" (choice B) seems to be the only option that outlines a potential legal and social negative consequence that can arise from committing a killing, affecting not just the perpetrator but society at large."
