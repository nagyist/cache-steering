  "query": "Question: Where would one catch a connection flight?\n\nChoices:\nA: wires\nB: freeway\nC: electrical circuit\nD: wall\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the term \"connection flight.\" This term typically refers to an additional flight that one takes after arriving at an airport to reach a final destination.",
    "I will now evaluate each of the provided options to see which one is most relevant to catching a connecting flight.",
    "Option A, \"wires,\" does not have a logical connection to catching a flight; it refers to electrical components.",
    "Option B, \"freeway,\" is related to ground transportation and does not pertain to aviation or catching flights.",
    "Option C, \"electrical circuit,\" is also not related to traveling or flight connections, as it pertains to electrical engineering.",
    "Option D, \"wall,\" does not signify any location associated with flights or airports.",
    "Finally, I will review Option E, \"airport.\" An airport is a designated place where flights arrive and depart, and it is where connection flights are typically caught.",
    "Comparing all options, the only reasonable and appropriate answer regarding where one would catch a connection flight is \"airport.\""
