  "steps": [
    "The question asks what killing is usually thought of as, which implies common perceptions or associations with the act of killing.",
    "Let's evaluate the choices one by one starting with option A (funeral). While killings can lead to funerals, \"funeral\" is not a direct association with the act of killing itself.",
    "Next, option B (horrible) suggests a negative connotation. Many people view killing, particularly murder, as a horrible act due to the loss of life and its moral implications.",
    "Moving to option C (remorse), which implies feelings of regret. While some may feel remorse after killing, this is not a general thought associated with the act itself.",
    "Looking at option D (premeditated), this term applies to a specific type of killing that is planned in advance. However, it does not reflect a broader view of killing as a whole.",
    "Finally, option E (going to jail) is a consequence of killing but does not directly describe the act itself. It\u2019s more about the legal repercussions.",
    "Comparing all options, \"horrible\" stands out as a general and widespread perception of killing in society, making it the most fitting answer."
