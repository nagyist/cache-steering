  "steps": [
    "To determine how geese normally travel, I will consider their natural behaviors and capabilities. Geese are birds, and their primary mode of long-distance travel is flying.",
    "I should analyze the options provided. Option A states \"carried by people,\" which is not a natural behavior for geese. While they may be transported in such a way occasionally, it is not how they normally get from place to place.",
    "Option B, \"guard house,\" does not relate to the question of how geese travel. A guard house is not a mode of transportation.",
    "Option C, \"fly,\" aligns with the fact that geese are capable of flying and often migrate long distances using this ability. It seems to directly answer the question regarding their typical method of travel.",
    "I will evaluate option D, \"follow ultralight airplane.\" Although some geese may be led by ultralight aircraft during specific conservation efforts, this method is not typical for all geese or their natural behavior.",
    "Finally, option E, \"group together,\" refers to social behavior rather than a specific method of travel. While geese do often travel in groups, this does not answer the question of the mode of travel itself.",
    "Having evaluated all available options, flying is clearly the most accurate representation of how geese normally get from place to place."
