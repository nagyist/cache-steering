  "query": "Question: She wanted to try out her brand new hair dryer, but her hair practically dried on it's own before she got it out of the well packaged what?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: trash\nC: drug store\nD: beauty salon\nE: box",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that she wanted to try her new hair dryer but her hair dried on its own before she could get it out of something. This implies that she had a physical object containing the hair dryer that needed to be opened first.",
    "Considering the options provided, we need a term that commonly refers to the container of consumer products, particularly electronics like a hair dryer.",
    "Option A, \"bathroom,\" does not refer to a container and instead denotes a location where one might use a hair dryer.",
    "Option B, \"trash,\" implies disposal, which is not relevant in the context of trying to use a new product.",
    "Option C, \"drug store,\" does not refer to a container but rather a place where personal care products can be purchased, which does not make sense in this context.",
    "Option D, \"beauty salon,\" also represents a location where a hair dryer may be used, but does not indicate a container.",
    "Option E, \"box,\" refers directly to a container that a new product typically comes in, such as the packaging for a hair dryer.",
    "The need to open a packaging container before using the product aligns with the context of the sentence. Therefore, \"box\" is the most appropriate choice."
