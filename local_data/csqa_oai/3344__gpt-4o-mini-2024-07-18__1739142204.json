  "query": "Question: She felt like she never had any support, people always seemed to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: marriage\nB: ignore\nC: let down\nD: aid\nE: neglect",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies that the individual feels a lack of support from others.",
    "To understand the context better, we evaluate the choices to see which word most closely aligns with the sentiment of feeling unsupported.",
    "Choice A: \"marriage\" does not relate to the idea of support, so I can eliminate this option.",
    "Choice B: \"ignore\" suggests that people are not paying attention to her, which can be a form of lack of support, but it does not encapsulate the entire feeling.",
    "Choice C: \"let down\" implies a sense of disappointment, as if the person was expected to provide support but failed to do so. This could resonate with the feeling of not having support.",
    "Choice D: \"aid\" suggests a form of active support but doesn't capture the emotional aspect of feeling unsupported when people fail to provide that aid.",
    "Choice E: \"neglect\" also implies a lack of support, indicating that people are failing to care for the individual. It carries a similar meaning to \"ignore\" but highlights a more emotional withdrawal.",
    "Now I consider the nuance in the meanings of \"let down\" (C) vs \"neglect\" (E). \"Let down\" indicates an expectation that was not met, which aligns closely with feeling unsupported.",
    "Both C and E can be seen as valid, but \"let down\" (C) captures the emotional disappointment more effectively than \"neglect\" (E) does, which feels colder and more detached.",
    "After considering all these aspects, I conclude that the best choice that describes the sentiment of feeling a lack of support is \"let down.\""
