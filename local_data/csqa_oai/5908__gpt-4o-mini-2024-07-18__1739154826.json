  "steps": [
    "The man has been on the road for hours, indicating he is likely tired or seeking comfort.",
    "The mention of \"seats\" suggests a place where people can sit and rest, rather than an activity-based environment.",
    "The options include places like a rest area, show, bowling alley, space shuttle, and doctor's office.",
    "A rest area is specifically designed for travelers to stop and take a break, which aligns with the context of having been on the road for hours.",
    "A show generally involves activity, and it's unlikely someone would look longingly at seats after a long commute unless they are waiting or resting.",
    "A bowling alley and a space shuttle are also not appropriate since they are more focused on activity rather than rest.",
    "A doctor's office does have seating but is not a typical stop for someone traveling long distances; it usually involves an appointment.",
    "Considering all of this, the best fit for where the man could be looking longingly at seats after hours on the road is a rest area."
