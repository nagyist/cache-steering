  "query": "Question: where can you catch a ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: sporting goods store\nB: shooting range\nC: bowling alley\nD: sporting event\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is asking about activities where one can physically catch a ball.",
    "Evaluate choice A: a sporting goods store is a place to buy sports equipment but is not a location where one actively catches a ball.",
    "Evaluate choice B: a shooting range typically involves shooting firearms, not catching balls, so this option is irrelevant.",
    "Evaluate choice C: a bowling alley is primarily for bowling; while you may throw a bowling ball, it is not a facility for catching balls in general.",
    "Evaluate choice D: a sporting event is a scenario where various sports are played, and catching a ball is a common action in many sports, such as baseball or football.",
    "Evaluate choice E: the street can be a casual place to play catch, but it is not specifically designed for that purpose like a sporting event is.",
    "Compare the evaluated choices to determine which one clearly allows for the activity of catching a ball.",
    "Identify choice D, a sporting event, as the best answer since it most directly relates to contexts where catching a ball is a fundamental part of the activity."
