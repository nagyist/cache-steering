  "query": "Question: What could a solicitor do to warn of upcoming litigation?\n\nChoices:\nA: write letter\nB: claim compensation\nC: reporting it to the government\nD: buy house\nE: charge according to time",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a solicitor could do to warn of upcoming litigation, focusing on preventive or advisory actions.",
    "Option A suggests writing a letter, which is a common method for solicitors to communicate and inform parties about legal matters, including potential litigation.",
    "Option B involves claiming compensation, which is a reactive measure rather than a warning. This does not address the goal of warning about upcoming litigation.",
    "Option C suggests reporting it to the government. While there may be specific scenarios where this is applicable, it is not a general method for a solicitor to warn about litigation.",
    "Option D, buying a house, is entirely unrelated to the topic of litigation warning. This option does not fit into the context of a solicitor's role.",
    "Option E discusses charging according to time. While solicitors may charge for their services, it does not relate to the act of warning about litigation.",
    "After evaluating all the options, writing a letter (Option A) stands out as the most logical and relevant action a solicitor would take to warn parties about potential litigation."
