  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the rooms that typically assist in working from home rather than leisure or personal activities.",
    "A bedroom is primarily a personal space meant for sleeping and may not usually be associated with a working environment.",
    "A bathroom is a functional space intended for personal hygiene, and it is not suitable for working or has a side chair.",
    "A building is a general term and does not represent a specific room; therefore, it is not relevant to the question.",
    "A table is a piece of furniture and while it is important for working, it does not denote a room itself.",
    "An office is specifically designed for work and usually includes comfortable seating arrangements which may or may not include a side chair.",
    "However, the question specifies a \"room\" that does not typically have a side chair and helps with work from home.",
    "Among the choices, only the office fits the description of assisting with work while implying that it may typically not have a side chair (perhaps in a minimalistic setup).",
    "Since an office is the room effectively designed for work, it logically serves the purpose, even if it might traditionally include other types of seating."
