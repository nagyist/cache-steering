  "query": "Question: What might be the result of getting hit while crossing the street?\n\nChoices:\nA: death\nB: injury\nC: traffic jam\nD: accidents\nE: fear",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of being hit while crossing the street. This scenario implies that a vehicle impacts a pedestrian.",
    "Next, evaluate the possible consequences of such an impact. The immediate outcomes could be severe and varied.",
    "One outcome could be death, especially if the impact is at a high speed and involves a larger vehicle.",
    "Injury is another likely consequence, which can range from minor bruises to serious bodily harm.",
    "Evaluating choices, traffic jams (choice C) typically arise from road incidents, but are more about the aftermath rather than a direct result to the person being hit.",
    "Accidents (choice D) are a general term which could apply but don't specifically reflect the direct consequences to a pedestrian; they describe the event rather than the result.",
    "Fear (choice E) may be a psychological result, but is not a direct physical consequence of getting hit.",
    "Upon analyzing the choices, both death (A) and injury (B) are serious, direct results. However, the option \"injury\" (B) reflects a more common outcome in pedestrian accidents than death (A).",
    "Considering the typical outcomes and their prevalence, the most straightforward and likely result of getting hit is injury."
