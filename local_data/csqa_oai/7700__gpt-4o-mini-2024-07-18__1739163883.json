  "query": "Question: Where would computers be used for sorting?\n\nChoices:\nA: labyrinth\nB: mit\nC: post office\nD: university\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what sorting involves. Sorting typically requires organizing or arranging items in a specific order, which can be done more efficiently using computers than manually.",
    "Next, evaluate each option based on where sorting tasks are commonly required. A post office, for instance, deals with a large volume of mail that needs to be organized based on various criteria such as destination, size, or delivery priority.",
    "Then, think about the role of technology in a post office. Modern post offices utilize computers for sorting mail to increase speed and accuracy, as manual sorting would be time-consuming and prone to errors.",
    "Consider the other options: a labyrinth is not typically a location where sorting is necessary. MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) may utilize computers for various sorting tasks, but it's not specifically known for sorting operations like a post office. Universities might have sorting needs, but they don't focus on sorting as a primary function. A large city might have sorting needs in terms of logistics and distribution, but it is not a specific operation like a post office.",
    "Review the necessity and frequency of sorting operations. The post office represents a consistent high-volume environment for sorting, justifying the use of computers for efficiency.",
    "Confirm that other options do not compete with the post office in terms of regular, essential sorting operations. Using a computer for sorting purpose is most relevant in the context of mail distribution at a post office.",
    "Finally, conclude that the most appropriate answer based on the focus of sorting operations is the post office."
