  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the context of the question, which is regarding the causes of difficulty in breathing.",
    "Next, I analyze each of the provided choices to see if they relate directly to difficulties in breathing.",
    "Choice A, \"files,\" does not have any connection to breathing difficulties and appears to be unrelated.",
    "Choice B, \"asthma attacks,\" is a specific medical condition known to cause significant difficulty in breathing due to the constriction of airways.",
    "Choice C, \"living,\" is too broad and ambiguous; while living involves breathing, it does not directly explain a specific cause of difficulty.",
    "Choice D, \"sustaining life,\" like choice C, is broad and does not specifically refer to any problems associated with breathing difficulties.",
    "Choice E, \"giving life,\" is also vague and does not specifically relate to breathing difficulties directly.",
    "Considering the analyses, choice B stands out distinctly as the only clear and specific cause of difficulty in breathing.",
    "I double-check the other options to confirm that none of them describe a known cause of respiratory distress or difficulty in breathing as effectively as asthma attacks."
