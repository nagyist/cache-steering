  "query": "Question: What would a bird do if it wanted to scoop up more air?\n\nChoices:\nA: fly high\nB: head south\nC: lay eggs\nD: squawk\nE: spread wings",
  "steps": [
    "To scoop up more air, a bird would need to increase its exposure to the air around it.",
    "Flying high could potentially allow a bird to encounter less air resistance and catch more air.",
    "Heading south does not directly correlate with the bird's ability to scoop up air; it is more of a directional choice than an action relevant to air intake.",
    "Laying eggs is not related to the bird's need for air, as it is a reproduction action.",
    "Squawking is a vocalization and does not assist the bird in obtaining more air.",
    "Spreading wings is a primary action for a bird to increase its surface area in the air, allowing it to glide and scoop up more air effectively.",
    "Considering all options, spreading wings directly supports the action of taking in more air.",
    "The combination of flying high and spreading wings could both increase air intake, but the latter specifically focuses on the mechanics of air capture.",
    "After evaluating all choices, the best action a bird can take to scoop up more air is to spread its wings."
