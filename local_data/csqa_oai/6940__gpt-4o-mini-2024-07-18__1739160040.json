  "query": "Question: What draws ground water away from your and your neighbor's yard?\n\nChoices:\nA: house next door\nB: next house\nC: suburbs\nD: ditch\nE: trees",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider the context of the question which asks about what might draw groundwater away from yards.",
    "Groundwater typically moves due to various factors including soil composition, vegetation, and existing structures that may influence water flow.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: \"house next door,\" \"next house,\" \"suburbs,\" \"ditch,\" and \"trees.\"",
    "\"Houses\" in proximity could potentially impact water flow due to their foundations and landscaping, which might redirect water.",
    "\"Suburbs\" is a broader term and does not specify an element that directly draws water away from a yard.",
    "A \"ditch\" is specifically designed for water drainage and could actively draw groundwater away from adjacent yards.",
    "\"Trees\" consume groundwater through their roots, but they do not draw it away in the same manner as a drainage system.",
    "Assessing the most direct influence on drawing groundwater, a \"ditch\" would be the most logical choice as it is specifically intended for that purpose.",
    "Ruling out the other options based on the specific influence on groundwater flow leads to the final assessment of the choices."
