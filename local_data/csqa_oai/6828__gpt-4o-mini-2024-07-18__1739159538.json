  "query": "Question: Sonny thought the concert hall was best located in a place with a lot of people.  Where might he put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: university building\nB: shopping malls\nC: commercial building\nD: theater\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "The question poses that Sonny believes the best location for a concert hall should be in an area with a lot of people.",
    "We need to evaluate each choice in terms of how many people are typically found in those locations.",
    "Option A: A university building usually has a lot of students and faculty, but it's limited to academic events and isn't always busy.",
    "Option B: Shopping malls are generally crowded with shoppers and visitors, definitely a place with a high volume of people.",
    "Option C: Commercial buildings can attract a number of people based on their purpose, but not all commercial areas are busy.",
    "Option D: A theater receives a number of attendees during specific events, but overall foot traffic may not match the constant flow in other locations.",
    "Option E: City areas are typically bustling and are more likely to have a high population density all the time, making it a prime candidate.",
    "Comparing all options, shopping malls and city locations are the most populated areas.",
    "However, shopping malls might have crowds only during peak hours, while city areas can attract people at all times.",
    "Since Sonny values a location with a lot of people constantly, a city offers the best overall option for a concert hall."
