  "query": "Question: If clothes have developed a smell and can't be washed what should you do with them?\n\nChoices:\nA: hang in closet\nB: sniff\nC: get dirty\nD: become soiled\nE: air out",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the clothes have developed a smell and can't be washed, which means we need to consider alternatives to cleaning.",
    "Hanging the clothes in a closet (choice A) would not remove the smell and might still cause other clothes to absorb that odor.",
    "Sniffing the clothes (choice B) does not offer a solution to the problem of the smell; it merely allows one to confirm the issue.",
    "Getting dirty (choice C) is not relevant to the problem of dealing with smelly clothes; it implies an action that does not solve the odor issue.",
    "Becoming soiled (choice D) similarly does not relate to addressing the smell, and would also worsen the situation.",
    "Airing out the clothes (choice E) is a potential solution as it allows for fresh air to circulate around the clothes, which might help in reducing or eliminating the smell.",
    "Analyzing the options, airing out (choice E) appears to be the best method for addressing the issue at hand since it can help to diminish odors."
