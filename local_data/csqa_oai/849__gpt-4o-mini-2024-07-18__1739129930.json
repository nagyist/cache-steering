  "steps": [
    "Bill bought an upright piano, which is a large piece of furniture that typically requires a dedicated space for it to be placed.",
    "If he didn't have anywhere to put it, that implies he lacked sufficient space that was suitable for a piano.",
    "A band setting would likely have instruments already set up and would not be ideal for housing a piano long-term.",
    "A music room typically would be designed for music practice and should have space for a piano.",
    "The terms \"college\" and \"university\" generally refer to institutional living arrangements where students often have limited space, such as dormitories.",
    "A dorm room is usually not designed to accommodate large furniture like an upright piano, suggesting that living in a college or university setting would pose a challenge.",
    "On the other hand, a house usually provides ample space for larger furniture items.",
    "Since Bill did not have anywhere to put the piano, it implies he was likely living in a constrained environment.",
    "Out of the given options, \"college\" or \"university\" are the most likely options that would limit his ability to place a piano.",
    "Both \"college\" and \"university\" refer to similar environments that provide limited accommodation, but they can often overlap in meaning; thus, I will identify the broader category often associated with such limitations."
