  "query": "Question: A judge was on his bench serving justice, what was his most important principle?\n\nChoices:\nA: honest\nB: lawyre\nC: fair\nD: arranging files\nE: tell truth",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the primary role of a judge in the context of serving justice. A judge's primary responsibility is to ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices given in relation to the primary responsibility of a judge. The keyword here is \"justice.\"",
    "Choice A, \"honest,\" is essential for a judge but does not directly get to the core principle of serving justice as a judge.",
    "Choice B, \"lawyre,\" is likely a typographical error or a miswording and does not represent a clear concept applicable to a judge\u2019s principles.",
    "Choice C, \"fair,\" clearly aligns with the principle of serving justice. Fairness is fundamental in adjudicating cases and ensuring equal treatment under the law.",
    "Choice D, \"arranging files,\" is an administrative task and does not relate to the principles or ethos of serving justice.",
    "Choice E, \"tell truth,\" is important, but it falls short compared to the encapsulating concept of ensuring fairness as a broader judicial principle.",
    "Considering all the choices and their relation to the judicial role, \"fair\" is the most encompassing principle that judges strive to uphold while serving justice."
