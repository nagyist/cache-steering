  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the reason someone wants to get warm when they are cold.",
    "To understand this, we consider what it means to be cold. Coldness is typically an uncomfortable state.",
    "The motivation to change from an uncomfortable state is to seek comfort or relief from the cold.",
    "Among the given options, we are looking for an option that describes the desire to get warm in the context of seeking comfort.",
    "Option A (to do somersaults) does not relate to the feeling of being cold.",
    "Option B (feel comfortable) directly addresses the need to escape the discomfort caused by cold.",
    "Option C (you're cold) states a condition rather than a reason for wanting to get warm.",
    "Option D (were cold) also presents a state rather than a reason or motivation.",
    "Option E (more comfortable) could be seen as a reason but is less direct than option B, which specifically mentions \"feel comfortable.\"",
    "Considering all options, the most appropriate and complete answer that encapsulates why someone wants to get warm when they are cold is option B."
