  "query": "Question: Sarah was cooking thick gravy in her saucepan because she wanted some authentic soul food.  Where might Sarah live?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen cupboard\nB: italian restaurant\nC: georgia\nD: south\nE: boil vegetables",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Sarah is cooking thick gravy, which is often associated with soul food, particularly in Southern cuisine.",
    "Soul food has deep roots in African American culture and is commonly found in the Southern United States, especially states like Georgia.",
    "Option A, \"kitchen cupboard,\" refers to a storage place and does not indicate a location where one might live or cook soul food.",
    "Option B, \"italian restaurant,\" is unrelated to the cooking of soul food, which is distinctly Southern and not Italian.",
    "Option C, \"georgia,\" is a state known for its Southern cuisine, including soul food, making it a plausible location for Sarah.",
    "Option D, \"south,\" is also relevant as it pertains to the larger geographical area known for soul food; however, it lacks the specificity of being a direct location like Georgia.",
    "Option E, \"boil vegetables,\" describes a cooking method rather than a potential location for Sarah to live or cook.",
    "Considering that Georgia is very representative of soul food culture and would likely be where Sarah lives if she is preparing authentic soul food, Option C is the most fitting choice."
