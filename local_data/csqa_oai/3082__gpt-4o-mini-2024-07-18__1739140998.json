  "steps": [
    "An unprepared person would likely feel stressed about the upcoming final exams due to not having studied adequately.",
    "This stress can manifest as anxiety, which is a common emotional response in high-pressure situations like exams.",
    "Despite knowing that exams can lead to graduation (option A and D), graduation is a result of performing well on the exams, which an unprepared person does not feel confident about.",
    "Being unprepared does not lead to feelings of happiness (option C) since they are likely to worry about their performance.",
    "Headaches can also be a physical symptom of stress and anxiety, but they are not as directly linked to the emotional experience as anxiety itself (option E).",
    "Therefore, the primary experience of an unprepared person in this context is anxiety."
