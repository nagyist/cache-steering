  "query": "Question: If you're standing in front of people holding index cards what are you likely doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: learning\nB: oral report\nC: office supply store\nD: card catalogue\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what the scenario of standing in front of people holding index cards implies, I first consider the context of holding index cards.",
    "Index cards are often associated with organizing information, such as notes or prompts.",
    "In a learning environment, students may use index cards to assist with presentations or while participating in discussions.",
    "An \"oral report\" could involve using index cards as cue cards to help the speaker remember their points or structure their talks.",
    "In contrast, an \"office supply store\" mostly pertains to purchasing rather than performing or discussing.",
    "A \"card catalogue\" refers to an older method of organizing library materials, which does not generally involve people holding index cards in a presentation context.",
    "The option \"library\" could be associated since libraries sometimes conduct educational sessions; however, it is more general and doesn't fit the specific scenario of holding cards.",
    "Considering the scenario closely resembles a formal presentation or report-style setting, I deduce the most likely answer is \"oral report,\" as it specifically involves presenting information in front of an audience."
