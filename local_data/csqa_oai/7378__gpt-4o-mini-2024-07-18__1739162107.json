  "query": "Question: You'll likely have a kitchenette in what place where you sleep away from home?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: hotel room\nC: apartment\nD: allen key\nE: dormroom",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the different options provided: A) house, B) hotel room, C) apartment, D) allen key, E) dormroom.",
    "Consider what a kitchenette is: A small kitchen area with cooking facilities, typically found in accommodations.",
    "Evaluate option A (house): A house may have a full kitchen, but it's generally not a place where you would sleep away from home regularly.",
    "Evaluate option B (hotel room): Many hotel rooms, especially those aimed at longer stays, might have a kitchenette, making this a strong candidate.",
    "Evaluate option C (apartment): Apartments are typically designed for longer-term living and generally have full kitchens or kitchenettes, but they may not be considered a place where you \"sleep away from home\" in the same way as hotels.",
    "Evaluate option D (allen key): An allen key is a tool and not relevant to the question about sleeping arrangements or kitchenettes.",
    "Evaluate option E (dormroom): Dorms often have shared kitchen spaces, but individual dorm rooms may not always have kitchenettes, making this option less likely.",
    "Consider the context of sleeping away from home: A hotel room is designed specifically for that purpose and is likely to have kitchen facilities available.",
    "Compare the strongest candidates: Hotel room (B) and apartment (C), but a hotel room specifically caters to temporary stays with kitchenettes, supporting the idea of \"sleeping away from home.\"",
    "Conclude that the most direct answer relating to the question about having a kitchenette while sleeping away from home is B (hotel room)."
