  "query": "Question: If you see a policeman in the street waving flashlights what are they there to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: jump\nB: arrest criminals\nC: book robber\nD: direct traffic\nE: wave on",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the situation: a policeman is waving flashlights in the street.",
    "The presence of a policeman usually indicates law enforcement activity or public safety measures.",
    "Waving flashlights suggests more of a signaling action rather than an aggressive or arrest-oriented action.",
    "I recall that policemen often use flashlights to direct traffic, especially in situations where traffic lights may not be functioning, or during road accidents.",
    "The options given include various actions a policeman might take. \"Direct traffic\" aligns well with the action of waving a flashlight.",
    "The options also include actions like \"arrest criminals\" and \"book robber,\" which are more focused on law enforcement but do not correlate directly with the action of waving flashlights.",
    "Additionally, \"jump,\" \"book robber,\" and \"wave on\" do not seem to fit with the context of using flashlights in a street setting.",
    "Given the primary purpose of a policeman waving flashlights in the street is likely to manage the flow of traffic and ensure safety, I can eliminate other answer choices.",
    "I conclude that the most appropriate answer based on the reasoning is \"direct traffic.\""
