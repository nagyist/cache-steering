  "query": "Question: Artie Shaw became famous playing a clarinet in what outfit?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchestra\nB: jazz band\nC: rock band\nD: music store\nE: music studio",
  "steps": [
    "Artie Shaw is known as a clarinetist and bandleader primarily in the jazz genre.",
    "His music career peaked during the swing era, which was characterized by big bands and jazz orchestras.",
    "The question specifically asks about an \"outfit,\" indicating a type of ensemble or group he played with, rather than a venue or other settings.",
    "The choices include \"orchestra,\" \"jazz band,\" \"rock band,\" \"music store,\" and \"music studio.\"",
    "\"Orchestra\" is a broad term that may not specifically refer to the jazz focus of Shaw's music.",
    "\"Rock band\" does not fit because Shaw was not associated with rock music.",
    "\"Music store\" refers to a place where music is sold or instruments are bought, and does not represent a performance outfit.",
    "\"Music studio\" indicates a space for recording music, again not an outfit where one would perform.",
    "\"Jazz band\" is most closely associated with Artie Shaw's style and the groups he led during his career.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer regarding the type of outfit Artie Shaw became famous playing his clarinet with is a \"jazz band.\""
