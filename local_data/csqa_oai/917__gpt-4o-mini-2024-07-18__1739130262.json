  "query": "Question: If a person does something to hurt someone else, they might do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel sorry\nB: trust god\nC: cross street\nD: ride a bike\nE: lend money",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what it means to hurt someone else. Hurting someone can imply either physical or emotional harm.",
    "Next, we consider the emotional responses that can follow an action that causes harm. One common reaction is feeling regret or remorse.",
    "Looking at the options provided, we analyze if feeling regret or remorse aligns with any of them.",
    "Option A: \"feel sorry\" directly correlates with the feeling of remorse after hurting someone, suggesting an emotional reaction.",
    "Options B, C, D, and E need to be analyzed against this emotional context.",
    "Option B: \"trust god\" does not explicitly link to a direct emotional response to hurting someone and feels more contextual rather than immediate.",
    "Option C: \"cross street\" does not relate to emotional fallout from an action. It is a neutral action without emotional relevance.",
    "Option D: \"ride a bike\" is another action unrelated to the emotional state following harm caused to someone else.",
    "Option E: \"lend money\" also does not connect with the emotional process of feeling remorse; rather, it implies a transactional relationship.",
    "After analyzing all options, Option A stands out as the only relevant emotional response for someone who has caused harm, which is feeling sorry for their actions."
