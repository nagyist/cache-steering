  "steps": [
    "We need to evaluate each of the choices given in relation to their reputation for steakhouses.",
    "Maine is known for seafood, especially lobsters, but does not have a strong association with steakhouses.",
    "Florida is a large state with diverse cuisine, but it is not particularly famous for steakhouses, rather known for its seafood and tropical dishes.",
    "Arizona has a variety of culinary influences but does not specifically stand out for its steakhouses compared to other regions.",
    "Kansas City is famously known for its barbecue culture and is also recognized for having a rich steakhouse tradition, often celebrated in culinary circles.",
    "Michigan also has a diverse food scene but is not specifically renowned for steakhouses in the same way that Kansas City is.",
    "Upon comparing the notable culinary traditions of each region, it seems Kansas City is the only area recognized explicitly for its steakhouses.",
    "Thus, Kansas City is the most fitting choice when identifying a relatively small area known for its steakhouses as compared to the other larger states listed."
