  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about potential consequences or outcomes of touching wild animals.",
    "The phrase \"you weren't supposed to touch the wild animals\" implies that doing so could lead to a negative or dangerous situation.",
    "We need to evaluate each of the choices to see which one logically fits with the reason for not touching wild animals.",
    "Choice A: \"lie down\" does not represent a negative consequence of touching wild animals.",
    "Choice B: \"run away\" could be a reaction to being touched, but it isn't a consequence that would present a danger.",
    "Choice C: \"bite\" suggests a potential aggressive response from the animal, which aligns with the danger of interacting with wildlife.",
    "Choice D: \"keep alive\" doesn\u2019t relate logically since the context is about consequences of touching them, not their survival.",
    "Choice E: \"feel pain\" is an outcome that may occur, but it doesn't convey a direct danger to the person touching the animal.",
    "Based on the analysis, choice C (\"bite\") is the most appropriate answer as it indicates a direct and dangerous potential consequence of touching wild animals."
