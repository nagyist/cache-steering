  "query": "Question: John was going bathing in a public hot spring in japan, but he was embarrassed. What wasn't he comfortable with?\n\nChoices:\nA: cleanliness\nB: other people\nC: dry skin\nD: use soap\nE: nudity",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the setting of a public hot spring in Japan, which typically involves social interaction and cultural norms regarding nudity and body exposure.",
    "John's embarrassment likely stems from being in a setting where people are usually naked due to the customs of hot springs, which makes nudity a significant factor.",
    "Evaluate the other options: \n- Cleanliness (A) might be a concern, but hot springs are generally perceived as clean.\n- Other people (B) could cause discomfort, but it is less likely to be a primary source of embarrassment compared to nudity in this context.\n- Dry skin (C) and use of soap (D) are not typically associated with embarrassment in a hot spring setting.",
    "Given that hot springs often require participants to be unclothed, it is reasonable to conclude that John's embarrassment stems mostly from feelings regarding nudity.",
    "Therefore, among all the answer choices, the one that most directly relates to John's discomfort in this public bathing scenario is nudity."
