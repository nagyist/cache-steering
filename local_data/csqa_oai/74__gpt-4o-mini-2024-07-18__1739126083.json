  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the basics of playing tennis. A tennis racket is essential to hit the ball, but it alone doesn't make someone good at tennis.",
    "Next, while having a tennis court is necessary to play the game, simply having access to a court doesn't directly contribute to one's skill level. Therefore, option D is not sufficient.",
    "Now, competition can help improve a player's skills through practice and experience, but it is not a requirement for playing well since one can practice alone.",
    "Legs are important for movement and agility on the court, but they are a physical attribute and do not encompass the broader range of skills needed.",
    "Skill is a key requirement for playing tennis effectively, encompassing aspects like technique, strategy, and consistency, which are necessary to perform well in matches.",
    "After evaluating each option, skill stands out as the essential element needed to be good at playing tennis; without skill, winning or playing well is not feasible."
