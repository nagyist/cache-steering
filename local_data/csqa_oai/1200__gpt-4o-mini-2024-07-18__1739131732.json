  "query": "Question: Where in your shirt can you keep your plane ticket?\n\nChoices:\nA: terrorists hands\nB: pocket\nC: airport\nD: back pocket\nE: briefcase",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to understand the context of the question, which is asking about a location in a shirt where a plane ticket can be kept.",
    "Next, I consider the available options and how they relate to the context of a shirt or clothing in general.",
    "Option A mentions \"terrorists hands,\" which is not a valid location in a shirt or clothing item.",
    "Option C refers to \"airport,\" which is a location, but again, it is not a valid part of a shirt.",
    "Option D, \"back pocket,\" usually refers to the location of pants, not a shirt, so it does not meet the criteria for being in a shirt.",
    "Option E, \"briefcase,\" is also not a location in a shirt or clothing.",
    "Now, I reconsider option B, which is \"pocket.\" Many shirts have pockets, particularly dress shirts or casual shirts, where a plane ticket could logically be stored.",
    "Therefore, option B is the only logical choice that directly answers the question regarding a shirt location.",
    "I have analyzed all the options, and after assessing them, I conclude that the correct and sensible answer is option B."
