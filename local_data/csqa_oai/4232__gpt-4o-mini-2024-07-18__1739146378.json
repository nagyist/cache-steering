  "query": "Question: It was going to be a long winter during his commute, the heater had gone out in his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: house\nC: automobile\nD: living room\nE: public building",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"commute,\" which typically refers to traveling from one place to another, often involving a vehicle.",
    "Given that the context is about winter and a heater being out, it's important to consider where one would most likely need a heater during commutes in winter.",
    "While an \"office\" and a \"house\" are places where people may experience heating issues, they are not directly related to commuting.",
    "The \"automobile\" is the mode of transportation used during a commute, making it a strong candidate for the location of a faulty heater in this context.",
    "A \"living room\" could potentially have a heater issue, but it does not relate to commuting.",
    "A \"public building\" may also have heating issues, but it is not typically a place one would commute to in an informal, personal context without additional detail.",
    "Since the focus is on the long commute and the heater being out during winter, the most logical answer is where heating is essential in a commuting context, which aligns best with \"automobile.\"",
    "No other options directly relate to the scenario of commuting and the need for a heater as effectively as \"automobile.\""
