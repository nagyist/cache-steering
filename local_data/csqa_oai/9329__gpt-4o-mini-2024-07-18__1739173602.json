  "query": "Question: Where do you keep a book to read before bed?\n\nChoices:\nA: school room\nB: allen key\nC: classroom\nD: bedside table\nE: coffee table",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one would typically keep a book to read before bed.",
    "To determine the best answer, I need to consider common places people keep books that are intended for bedtime reading.",
    "A bedside table is a common place for books, as it is located next to the bed and easily accessible during bedtime.",
    "A classroom (C) may have books, but it is not a suitable place for personal bedtime reading since it is primarily for educational use.",
    "A school room (A) is similar to a classroom and thus not relevant for personal bedtime reading.",
    "An allen key (B) is a tool and not related to the question about keeping books.",
    "A coffee table (E) could also hold books, but it\u2019s typically in the living room or another common area, rather than specifically for bedtime use.",
    "Given the context of reading a book just before bed, the most logical choice would be the bedside table, as it is designed to hold items used at night.",
    "After analyzing all the options, \"D: bedside table\" is the most suitable answer."
