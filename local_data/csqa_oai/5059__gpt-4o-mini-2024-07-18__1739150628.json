  "steps": [
    "The phrase mentions that the speaker loves crab but does not find it readily available where they live in a rural area.",
    "Considering the options, we need to identify which location is rural and may have a limited availability of crab.",
    "Option A: outside could refer to any rural area but is vague and not a specific location.",
    "Option B: Alabama is a state that has rural areas, but it is not particularly known for its crab.",
    "Option C: Virginia has coastal regions and areas known for crabbing, but also has rural areas.",
    "Option D: Cape Cod is known for its seafood, particularly crab, making it less likely that someone would struggle to find crab there.",
    "Option E: fish market is not a location but rather a type of place where crab can be found, so it cannot be the answer.",
    "Based on the information, Virginia is a state where crabs are available but perhaps not as commonly found in rural areas compared to coastal regions.",
    "Since Alabama may not fit as closely with the idea of crabs being less accessible, Virginia seems to be a more likely answer given its geography and seafood availability."
