  "query": "Question: If someone committed perjury, but the evidence was taken illegally, what might happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: mistrial\nB: going to jail\nC: tension\nD: go to jail\nE: aquittal",
  "steps": [
    "If someone commits perjury, it means they have knowingly lied under oath, which is a criminal offense.",
    "However, if the evidence against them was obtained illegally, this could lead to issues in the trial process.",
    "The legality of how evidence is obtained is crucial in court and can affect the admissibility of that evidence.",
    "If key evidence that proves perjury was obtained illegally, it might not be admissible in court.",
    "The defense could argue to have the case dismissed or declare a mistrial based on the violation of the defendant's rights.",
    "A mistrial refers to a trial that is invalid due to an error or serious misconduct, such as the introduction of illegally obtained evidence.",
    "If the case is declared a mistrial, it does not mean that the person who committed perjury will automatically go to jail.",
    "Going to jail is a possible outcome if the perjury is proven with admissible evidence; however, if all evidence is thrown out due to its illegal nature, the perjury charge may not hold.",
    "The other choices, such as \"tension\" and \"acquittal,\" do not directly relate to the legal consequences associated with perjury and illegal evidence.",
    "Thus, the most logical outcome when illegal evidence is used in a perjury case is that it may result in a mistrial."
