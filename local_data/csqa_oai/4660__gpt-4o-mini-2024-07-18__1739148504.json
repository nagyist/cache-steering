  "query": "Question: She said you had to pay extra for her to swallow semen, something you'd only hear from a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: you're curious\nB: prostitute\nC: pornstar\nD: gay man in love\nE: you're into",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions paying extra for a specific act, which implies a transactional nature.",
    "The phrase \"you'd only hear from\" suggests that the answer is likely a profession or a particular lifestyle where such transactions are commonplace.",
    "Considering the choices, \"prostitute\" typically refers to someone who engages in sexual acts for payment, which aligns with the idea of charging extra for specific acts.",
    "The term \"pornstar\" also fits since they perform sexual acts on camera and may have similar pricing structures for different acts, albeit in a different context.",
    "The remaining options do not directly relate to a payment structure for sexual acts; \"gay man in love\" and \"you're into\" do not fit the transactional context.",
    "Since the phrase \"pay extra\" is more closely associated with prostitution due to its direct nature, I will prioritize this option.",
    "While pet peeve statements could be made about performers in adult films, the question leans more towards the transactional aspect attached to prostitutes.",
    "Therefore, my strongest candidates are B: prostitute and C: pornstar, but B aligns best with the phrasing of paying extra."
