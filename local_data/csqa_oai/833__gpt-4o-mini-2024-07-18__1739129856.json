  "query": "Question: What business uses lots of potatoes?\n\nChoices:\nA: fast food restaurant\nB: vegetable market\nC: ireland\nD: produce market\nE: dessert spot",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the options provided to see which business is most dependent on potatoes.",
    "A fast food restaurant often uses potatoes extensively, particularly for items like French fries, potato cakes, or as sides. So this is a strong candidate.",
    "A vegetable market may sell potatoes but doesn't use them in a business sense as much as it sells various vegetables. Therefore, it's less applicable.",
    "Ireland is a country where potatoes are popular, but this does not directly correspond to a business. Thus, this option is not a direct answer.",
    "A produce market also sells potatoes but, similar to the vegetable market, it doesn't utilize them in a business-focused manner. It primarily serves as a place that offers a variety of produce.",
    "A dessert spot is unlikely to use potatoes significantly, as desserts typically focus on sweet ingredients like fruits, sugars, and dairy.",
    "Reviewing my analysis, the fast food restaurant stands out because of its reliance on potatoes for a wide variety of menu items.",
    "The other options (vegetable market, Ireland, produce market, dessert spot) do not have the same level of dependency on potatoes for their operations as a fast food restaurant does.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the most appropriate choice is the fast food restaurant."
