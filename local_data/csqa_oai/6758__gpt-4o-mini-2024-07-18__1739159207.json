  "query": "Question: What's the first thing you have to do to return to work one day?\n\nChoices:\nA: make sure properly dressed\nB: it department\nC: leave work\nD: go to meeting\nE: get out of bed",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the very first action necessary to return to work one day.",
    "Returning to work implies the need to begin the process of getting ready for the day.",
    "Looking at the options, \"get out of bed\" is a fundamental starting point before any other action can be taken.",
    "The option \"make sure properly dressed\" comes after leaving the bed; one needs to get out of bed first before dressing.",
    "The option \"it department\" does not relate directly to the act of preparing for a workday; it's more of a resource rather than an action to return to work.",
    "\"Leave work\" seems to contradict the question since it implies that one is already at work and needs to exit, which does not apply to the action of returning.",
    "Going to a meeting is usually a part of the workday, occurring after you have returned or started your day at work.",
    "Therefore, the only choice that aligns with the very first step in the return to work process is \"get out of bed.\""
