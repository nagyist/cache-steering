  "query": "Question: I was depressed and my friends threw me a party, why did they do that?\n\nChoices:\nA: reciprocity\nB: make happy\nC: make money\nD: get drunk\nE: embarrassing yourself",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the person was depressed and their friends threw them a party.",
    "Throwing a party is typically associated with positive emotions and celebrations, which contrasts with the person's feeling of depression.",
    "The primary motive for friends to throw a party for someone who is feeling down is most likely to uplift their spirits and improve their mood.",
    "Looking at the options provided:\n- A: reciprocity refers to returning a favor, which doesn\u2019t directly align with the scenario at hand.\n- B: make happy is directly aligned with the intention behind throwing a party for someone who is depressed.\n- C: make money does not relate to the scenario, as the focus is on emotions rather than finances.\n- D: get drunk might apply in a party context but does not address the depression aspect or the friends' intentions clearly.\n- E: embarrassing yourself isn\u2019t applicable in this context as it implies a negative connotation rather than an uplifting one.",
    "Among the available options, the one that most clearly reflects the intention of friends throwing a party to combat someone's depression is B: make happy.",
    "Given that B (make happy) aligns most closely with combating depression through celebration, it is the most logical choice."
