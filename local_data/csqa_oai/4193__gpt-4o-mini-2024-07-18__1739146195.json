  "query": "Question: where do some monkeys tend to live taht is hot?\n\nChoices:\nA: rain forest\nB: tree tops\nC: treetops\nD: great outdoors\nE: tropical areas",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the climate preferences of monkeys. Many species of monkeys are well-adapted to warm environments.",
    "Next, I will consider common habitats where monkeys are typically found and relate those to the options provided.",
    "Monkeys are often associated with rainforests, which are known for their hot and humid conditions.",
    "I will look at \"treetops,\" which refers to the upper layer of forests where many monkeys can be found, but this is not a distinct region or climate.",
    "\"Great outdoors\" is a general term that can refer to any natural environment, but it does not specifically indicate warmth or a preferred habitat for monkeys.",
    "\"Tropical areas\" specifically indicate regions that are hot and are not strictly limited to forests; this aligns well with where many monkeys reside.",
    "\"Rain forest\" and \"tropical areas\" both are hot habitats but \"tropical areas\" is broader and encompasses various forms of ecosystems, including rainforests.",
    "\"Tree tops\" can refer to a specific part of a habitat rather than a type of environment, thus is less relevant when considering where monkeys live in relation to heat.",
    "Based on the analysis, there are direct matches to monkey habitats, and both rainforests and tropical areas denote hot locations, but the term \"tropical areas\" is more encompassing.",
    "Now, I will decide between the more general \"tropical areas\" and the specific \"rain forest.\" However, given the overall climate context in which monkeys are found, \"tropical areas\" feels like the strongest answer."
