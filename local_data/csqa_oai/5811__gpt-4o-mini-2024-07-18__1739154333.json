  "steps": [
    "The question states that the bald eagle avoided big cities. This implies that the eagle prefers habitats that are more natural and less urbanized.",
    "Next, I consider the choices given: Canada, Maine, Countryside, United States of America, and Florida. I need to identify which of these options represents a more rural or natural environment.",
    "Canada is a vast country with many natural landscapes, but it can also have urban areas.",
    "Maine is a state known for its wilderness, coastlines, and rural areas, making it a contender for a place the bald eagle might prefer.",
    "The term \"countryside\" more directly indicates rural areas, which align with the preference for natural habitats away from urban developments.",
    "The United States of America as a whole includes both urban and rural areas, making it too broad to definitively support the bald eagle's preference stated in the question.",
    "Florida is known for its natural landscapes, particularly wetlands and beaches, but it also has many urban areas, especially in cities like Miami.",
    "Among all the choices, \"countryside\" explicitly indicates an area that is rural and does not typically include urban elements, matching the bald eagle's preference.",
    "I now compare the two strongest candidates for rural environments: Maine and countryside. While Maine is rural, \"countryside\" more generally encompasses what these areas represent.",
    "Thus, based on this reasoning, I conclude that the best answer to which kinds of places the bald eagle preferred is \"countryside.\""
