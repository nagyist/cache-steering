  "query": "Question: Press people were waiting for the embarrassed politician to give his resignation speech, what were they expecting to hear?\n\nChoices:\nA: national park\nB: opera\nC: yodel\nD: confession\nE: vehicles",
  "steps": [
    "The context involves a politician who is embarrassed, which suggests a situation involving scandal or controversy.",
    "Press people typically gather for significant announcements, especially when a politician is expected to resign.",
    "A resignation speech usually involves the individual addressing their faults or mistakes publicly, which aligns closely with the concept of a confession.",
    "The other options do not logically connect to a resignation. A national park, an opera, yodeling, or vehicles do not align with the expectation from an embarrassed politician.",
    "In a resignation speech, the audience would expect the politician to acknowledge their actions and explain why they are stepping down, which can be construed as a confession.",
    "Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the press people were expecting the politician to admit wrongdoing or provide reasons for their resignation, aligning with option D."
