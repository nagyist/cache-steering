  "query": "Question: What might intense competing cause someone to feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: argument\nB: tension\nC: anger\nD: happiness\nE: stress",
  "steps": [
    "Intense competition typically involves individuals or teams striving to outperform one another.",
    "In a competitive environment, emotions can run high as the stakes increase.",
    "Feelings associated with competition often include both positive and negative emotions, depending on the context.",
    "Common negative emotions related to fierce competition may include frustration, anxiety, and stress.",
    "Tension is another feeling that can arise due to the pressure of competition.",
    "Anger may also emerge when one feels they have been wronged or if rivalries become personal.",
    "Happiness, although a possible outcome of winning, is not a direct feeling stemming from the act of competing intensely itself.",
    "Stress is closely related to tension and can manifest as a result of high-pressure situations typical in intense competition.",
    "Considering the options, both tension and stress are valid feelings tied to intense competition.",
    "However, since the question asks for what intense competing \"might cause someone to feel\" without specifying a particular feeling, it would be reasonable to conclude that stress is a predominant feeling resulting from such competition."
