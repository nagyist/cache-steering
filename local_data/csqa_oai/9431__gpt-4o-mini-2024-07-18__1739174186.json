  "query": "Question: Jane bought a small dog half way through her trip while driving back home to Toronto from Mexico.   Where might she have bought the dog?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: illinois\nC: basket\nD: ball stopped\nE: person's house",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Jane bought a small dog while she was driving back to Toronto from Mexico, suggesting she might have purchased the dog in a location that is along the route of her drive.",
    "The route from Mexico to Toronto would likely take her through the United States, and Illinois is a state that falls along that route.",
    "Options A, C, D, and E need to be evaluated as potential locations for purchasing a dog.",
    "Option A (Canada) may not be plausible, as she was driving back from Mexico and may not have crossed back into Canada before purchasing the dog.",
    "Option C (basket) does not make sense as a place to buy a dog as it is an inanimate object.",
    "Option D (ball stopped) likewise doesn't make sense as it is not a location or entity where a dog could be bought.",
    "Option E (person's house) could be a possibility, as people often sell pets from their own homes, but it's less common and typically less formal than buying from a store or shelter.",
    "Given that option B (Illinois) represents a state where such purchases are more typically made, it stands out as the most likely option.",
    "To recap, A (Canada) is less likely because she was coming from Mexico, C (basket) and D (ball stopped) are not relevant, and E (person's house) is a valid but less conventional option. B (Illinois) represents a reasonable location during her journey."
