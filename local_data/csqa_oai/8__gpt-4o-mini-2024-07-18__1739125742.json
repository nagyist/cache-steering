  "query": "Question: What do people use to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen?\n\nChoices:\nA: shirt pocket\nB: calligrapher's hand\nC: inkwell\nD: desk drawer\nE: blotter",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the common methods or tools used to absorb excess ink when using a fountain pen.",
    "Fountain pens can sometimes leak ink or produce excess ink during use, leading to a need for absorption.",
    "A blotter is a tool specifically designed for absorbing ink and preventing smudging on paper after writing.",
    "While options like a shirt pocket or a desk drawer are not practical for absorbing ink, they might be mentioned as places where someone could inadvertently get ink.",
    "An inkwell is used to hold ink but does not serve the purpose of absorbing excess ink from a fountain pen.",
    "A calligrapher's hand may get ink on it but isn\u2019t designed for the purpose of absorption and is less practical than a blotter.",
    "Therefore, the best option that indicates a dedicated tool for absorbing ink is a blotter.",
    "I will review the options again: \n- A is not practical.\n- B is not a dedicated tool for absorption.\n- C is utilized for holding ink, not absorbing it.\n- D does not serve any purpose related to absorbing ink.\n- E is specifically designed for absorbing excess ink.",
    "Since E (blotter) is specifically intended for absorbing ink, it confidently stands out as the correct answer."
