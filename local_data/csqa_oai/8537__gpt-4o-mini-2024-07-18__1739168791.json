  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a person will have when they are very happy.",
    "The choices provided are: own car, be rich, catch cold, believe in God, and experience joy.",
    "The only choice that directly relates to the emotional state of happiness is \"experience joy.\"",
    "\"Own car,\" \"be rich,\" and \"believe in God\" can all be associated with various feelings but do not specifically tie to happiness as a direct experience.",
    "\"Catches cold\" is an undesirable physical condition and is not related to happiness at all.",
    "\"Experience joy\" aligns closely with being very happy since joy is a synonym or component of happiness.",
    "Considering the context and the emotional aspect, \"experience joy\" stands out as the only relevant option.",
    "I can confirm that joy is a fundamental part of happiness and one would \"have\" joy in the state of being very happy.",
    "There are no other options that describe the state or outcome of being very happy as succinctly and accurately as \"experience joy.\""
