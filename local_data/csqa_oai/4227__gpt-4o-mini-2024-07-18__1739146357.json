  "query": "Question: Sometimes when you go into a deep trance, what happens when you no longer feel attached to your body?\n\nChoices:\nA: meditation\nB: closed eyes\nC: loss of control\nD: tingling\nE: memory loss",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a state of deep trance and involves a lack of attachment to the body. This indicates a shift in consciousness or perception.",
    "It is important to distinguish between different experiences that can occur in a deep trance, such as altered awareness or physical sensations.",
    "Meditation is often associated with deep trances and altered states, which could lead to feelings of detachment. However, it doesn't specifically address the disconnection from the physical body.",
    "Closed eyes are a common aspect of entering a trance but do not specifically describe the feeling of detachment.",
    "Loss of control could refer to a feeling of being unable to direct one's actions or thoughts, which might happen during a deep trance. This could align with losing attachment to the body.",
    "Tingling is often a physical sensation some people experience during deep relaxation or trance states, but it again does not directly describe the concept of detachment.",
    "Memory loss is a possible outcome of a very deep trance but is not necessarily the primary experience associated with the feeling of detachment from the body.",
    "Among the options, loss of control (C) seems to be the most relevant to the feeling of no longer being attached to one's body during a deep trance.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating the meanings of all choices in the context of detachment from the body during a trance, loss of control stands out as the most appropriate answer."
