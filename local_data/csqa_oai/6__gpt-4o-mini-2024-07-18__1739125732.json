  "query": "Question: The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it?\n\nChoices:\nA: garbage can\nB: military\nC: jewelry store\nD: safe\nE: airport",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the nature of a drawstring bag. Drawstring bags are typically lightweight and used for casual purposes such as carrying personal items, workout gear, or light travel items.",
    "Next, I consider the possible locations listed in the choices. A garbage can is unlikely as it does not make sense to check baggage to throw it away, and it is not a destination.",
    "Then, I look at the military option. While it is possible that someone could have a drawstring bag in a military context, it is not a common item associated with military travel, which usually involves more durable gear.",
    "Next, I evaluate the jewelry store option. A drawstring bag might be used when someone is going shopping, but it doesn't specifically suggest a destination of a jewelry store.",
    "Now I consider the option of a safe. A drawstring bag does not logically connect to a safe, as safes are meant for securing items, not a destination for carrying items to.",
    "Lastly, I consider the airport option. It is common for travelers to use drawstring bags for personal items or carry-ons, particularly in an airport setting where ease of access and light baggage are beneficial.",
    "Having analyzed all potential options and their relevance to a drawstring bag, it is clear that the most logical destination for a checked drawstring bag is the airport."
