  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"plain landscape,\" which suggests a flat geographical area without significant elevation changes.",
    "Since the individual saw the landscape \"begrudgingly,\" it implies he had a preference for a different type of geography that he found more appealing or impressive.",
    "The choices provided include various types of geographical features: mountain, gorge, and cliff, which are all associated with elevation and dramatic landscapes.",
    "Looking closely at the options, \"mountain\" (A) denotes a significant elevated area, while \"gorge\" (C) refers to a deep, narrow valley typically formed by erosion, and \"cliff\" (E) is a steep face of rock and earth.",
    "\"Hatred\" (B) and \"fantastic\" (D) do not represent geographical features; \"hatred\" is an emotion, and \"fantastic\" is an adjective that doesn't specify a geographical type.",
    "Considering he may have missed a dramatic elevation, the options 'mountain', 'gorge', and 'cliff' are the only relevant ones.",
    "Out of those, a \"mountain\" represents a large and majestic elevation, which strongly contrasts with a \"plain landscape.\"",
    "In contrast, a \"gorge\" or \"cliff\" might not convey the same sense of grandeur or substantiality that missing a 'mountain' would imply.",
    "Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that he missed a 'mountain\u2019 since it embodies the absence of significant topographical features when comparing it to a plain."
