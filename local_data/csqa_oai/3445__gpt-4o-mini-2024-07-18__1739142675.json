  "query": "Question: The doctor could tell there was a problem with his lung right away, every time he would breathe he would also what?\n\nChoices:\nA: inhaling\nB: cough\nC: wheeze\nD: inhale\nE: inhale and exhale",
  "steps": [
    "The question begins by stating that the doctor noticed a problem with the lung right away. This suggests there is a noticeable symptom that occurs during breathing.",
    "A common audible symptom associated with lung issues can be a wheezing sound, which occurs during breathing due to narrowed airways.",
    "Next, I consider the other options. \"Inhaling\" and \"exhaling\" happen every time someone breathes but are not symptoms indicating a problem with the lung.",
    "\"Cough\" is another possible symptom but it is not something that occurs every time one breathes. It can occur as a reaction to specific irritants or issues but is not consistent with every breath.",
    "\"Wheeze,\" on the other hand, specifically indicates an abnormal sound during breathing that is often associated with conditions such as asthma or bronchitis, both of which affect lung function.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"wheeze\" aligns best with the symptoms that would indicate a problem with the lung as experienced every time the patient breathes.",
    "Thus, considering all symptoms and their associations with lung issues, I conclude that \"wheeze\" is the most appropriate choice."
