  "steps": [
    "I need to determine what \"he resisted doing\" based on the context of being a \"poor patient.\"",
    "Generally, a \"poor patient\" might indicate someone who is not conforming to expected behaviors for health improvement, which could include taking medications or engaging fully in the treatment process.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, option D (\"take pills\") stands out as a common action that patients might resist, especially if they are not fully committed to their treatment or if they feel helpless about their situation.",
    "Options A (\"appear better\") and C (\"will to survive\") do not directly correspond to an action prompted by nurses; they suggest more about the patient's mindset rather than specific actions.",
    "Option B (\"visit doctor\") seems less relevant, as nurses typically prompt patients for ongoing care at the moment rather than suggesting doctor visits in a broader context.",
    "Finally, option E (\"pay bill\") does not relate to healthcare actions or treatments in the same way as taking medication does.",
    "Thus, the only viable option that aligns with a patient resisting the advance of their treatment, as prompted by nurses, is option D (\"take pills\")."
