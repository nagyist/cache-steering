  "query": "Question: There's always more than one shopping bag full of food after a trip where?\n\nChoices:\nA: garden\nB: grocery store\nC: closet\nD: restaurant\nE: mart",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what type of places typically involve buying food. The question specifies shopping bags full of food, so we are looking for locations where food is sold.",
    "Next, evaluate option A: garden. A garden is primarily a place to grow food, not necessarily a place where food is purchased or stored in bags. This option is unlikely.",
    "Now look at option B: grocery store. Grocery stores are specifically designed for purchasing food, and it is common to leave with multiple bags full of groceries after shopping. This option seems very likely.",
    "Consider option C: closet. A closet is used for storage, not for shopping or purchasing food. Thus, this option does not fit the criteria of where one would end up with shopping bags full of food.",
    "Evaluate option D: restaurant. While you might acquire takeout from a restaurant that involves bags full of food, it is not as common to have multiple bags every time you visit a restaurant. This option is less likely than option B.",
    "Finally, look at option E: mart. A mart typically sells a variety of goods including food items, and one can also leave with bags of food. However, \"grocery store\" is more commonly associated with purchasing food in bags.",
    "After analyzing all options, the best answer based on commonly accepted experiences with food shopping is option B: grocery store, as it is the most relevant to the context of leaving with shopping bags full of food."
