  "steps": [
    "After jogging, a person's body undergoes various physiological changes due to exercise.",
    "One notable change is an increase in heart rate and body temperature, which results from the increased energy demand.",
    "To help cool down the body, sweating is one of the body's primary mechanisms.",
    "While jogging can also cause feelings of exhaustion, this is not exclusive and can vary greatly depending on the individual's fitness level and duration of jogging.",
    "Shortness of breath might occur after jogging, especially for those not accustomed to physical exercise, but it's more of a temporary condition rather than a common outcome for everyone.",
    "Breath problem is a vague option and does not directly indicate what happens to a typical healthy person after jogging.",
    "Shin splints are a type of injury that can occur from jogging, but they do not occur in everyone and are not an immediate outcome of the activity.",
    "Given that sweating is a direct and common physiological response after performing vigorous physical activities like jogging, it is the most appropriate choice."
