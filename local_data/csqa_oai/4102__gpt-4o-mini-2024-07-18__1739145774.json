  "query": "Question: Sam reflected on his long life, which started in 1918.  How long has Sam lived?\n\nChoices:\nA: graveyard\nB: cause death\nC: end\nD: last 100 years\nE: spring forth",
  "steps": [
    "Identify Sam's birth year, which is provided as 1918.",
    "Determine the current year. For the purpose of this problem, I will assume it is 2023.",
    "Calculate the span of years from 1918 to 2023 by subtracting the birth year from the current year: 2023 - 1918.",
    "Perform the subtraction: 2023 - 1918 equals 105.",
    "Sam has lived for 105 years.",
    "Examine the answer choices to determine which one reflects the duration of Sam's life.",
    "Choices 'A', 'B', and 'E' do not relate to a duration of life or age.",
    "Choice 'C' simply states \"end,\" which does not quantify time.",
    "Choice 'D', \"last 100 years,\" is the only option that aligns closely with the length of Sam's life, despite being an approximation.",
    "Although Sam has lived for exactly 105 years, \"last 100 years\" implies a significant duration of life covering that timeframe."

  "solution": "D"
