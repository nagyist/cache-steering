  "query": "Question: When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood?\n\nChoices:\nA: burned\nB: polished\nC: carved\nD: composted\nE: nailed",
  "steps": [
    "To see a reflection, a surface typically needs to be smooth and shiny.",
    "Burning wood generally results in a charred and uneven surface, which is unlikely to reflect light effectively.",
    "Polishing wood involves smoothing its surface and applying a finish, which can make it shiny and reflective.",
    "Carving wood typically removes material in a way that creates grooves and unevenness, making it less likely to reflect light effectively.",
    "Composting wood breaks it down into organic matter, eliminating any properties that would allow it to reflect light.",
    "Nailing does not change the surface of the wood in a way that would impact its reflective properties.",
    "Among the options, only polishing wood creates a condition suitable for reflection.",
    "Therefore, the only option that would allow you to see your reflection in wood is the one where it is polished."
