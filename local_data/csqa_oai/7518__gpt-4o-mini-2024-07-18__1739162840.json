  "query": "Question: The condominium has public recreational areas, what was the purpose of these?\n\nChoices:\nA: park cars\nB: complex\nC: florida\nD: washington\nE: community",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify what \u201cpublic recreational areas\u201d typically refer to in the context of a condominium.",
    "Public recreational areas are spaces designed for the enjoyment and activities of the community living in the condominium. These might include parks, pools, gym areas, or gathering spaces.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided to see which one indicates a purpose that aligns with community enjoyment and use.",
    "Choice A (\"park cars\") suggests a practical function related to parking rather than recreation, which doesn't fit the description of recreational areas.",
    "Choice B (\"complex\") refers to a physical structure or grouping of buildings and does not capture the purpose of recreational areas.",
    "Choice C (\"florida\") does not relate to the purpose of public recreational areas; it appears to be a geographic reference rather than a purpose.",
    "Choice D (\"washington\") also refers to a geographic location without describing the function of recreational spaces.",
    "Finally, choice E (\"community\") directly connects to the purpose of public recreational areas, as they are intended for the benefit and use of the community members living in the condominium."
