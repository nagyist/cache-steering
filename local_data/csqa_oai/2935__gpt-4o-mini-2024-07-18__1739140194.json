  "query": "Question: What could cause you to not be sleeping well?\n\nChoices:\nA: being at a party\nB: relaxation\nC: have fun\nD: death\nE: nightmares",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that \"sleeping well\" implies a state of restfulness and ease during sleep.",
    "Next, think about the factors that can disrupt sleep. Emotional states, external environments, and physical discomfort often come into play.",
    "Now look at choice A, \"being at a party.\" This can disrupt sleep due to noise and excitement, making it a possible cause of poor sleep.",
    "Next, evaluate choice B, \"relaxation.\" Typically, relaxation aids sleep; therefore, it is unlikely to cause poor sleep.",
    "Then, consider choice C, \"have fun.\" While having fun might lead to staying up late and thus affect sleep, it is more indirectly related and generally does not directly cause poor sleep.",
    "Now analyze choice D, \"death.\" The emotional impact and grief associated with death can significantly affect sleep quality, making this a possible cause.",
    "Finally, look at choice E, \"nightmares.\" Nightmares directly disrupt sleep and can lead to waking up frequently at night, making this a strong candidate for a cause of poor sleep.",
    "After examining all choices, the most direct causes of poor sleep are nightmares (E) and emotional distress from death (D), but nightmares are a more common and direct factor affecting sleep quality."
