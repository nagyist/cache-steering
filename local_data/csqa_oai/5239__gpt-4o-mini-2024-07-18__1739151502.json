  "query": "Question: Where would you buy a notepad along side condoms or toothpaste?\n\nChoices:\nA: back pocket\nB: meeting\nC: street seller\nD: drug store\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the items mentioned: a notepad, condoms, and toothpaste. These items are typically bought in stores that cater to personal and health needs or everyday supplies.",
    "Next, think about where one might commonly find all three items. Condoms are usually sold in places that also sell health or personal care products, which narrows down the possible locations.",
    "The options provided include locations that range from informal (like a street seller) to formal (like a drug store).",
    "A back pocket is not a buying location, so we can eliminate option A.",
    "A meeting is not a buying location and does not correlate with purchasing these items, so option B can be eliminated as well.",
    "A street seller could possibly sell some items like condoms but is unlikely to stock a notepad or toothpaste regularly, making option C less likely.",
    "A drug store is a common place to find personal care items and everyday supplies, such as condoms and toothpaste. It is likely they would carry notepads as well, aligning with all three items.",
    "School has a focus on educational items, and while a notepad might be found there, it would not include condoms or toothpaste in a typical school environment, so option E is not valid.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing the given options, the best fit that includes the possibility of purchasing a notepad along with condoms and toothpaste is a drug store."
