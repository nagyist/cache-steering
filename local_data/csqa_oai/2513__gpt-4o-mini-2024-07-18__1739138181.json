  "steps": [
    "The question states that the living room was set up for the party, implying it was ready to host guests.",
    "The question specifically asks where people tended to congregate while the mother worked, suggesting that these are likely areas nearby or commonly used during gatherings.",
    "The \"wireroom\" and \"ocean\" options seem implausible in this context for people congregating, as they don\u2019t typically relate to a household setting or party atmosphere.",
    "The \"hallway\" is a potential option, but it\u2019s often a transitory space rather than a common area where guests would socialize.",
    "The \"outside\" could be a possibility, but it depends on the context of the party, whether outdoor spaces were accessible and appealing.",
    "The \"kitchen\" is typically a central area when people are gathering for events, as it often contains food and drinks and serves as a social hub for informal interactions.",
    "Considering practicality and the typical dynamics during a party, it's reasonable to conclude that the kitchen would likely attract people who want to socialize or snack while someone else is working in another part of the house.",
    "Based on these considerations, people would likely congregate in the kitchen while the mother worked, as it is a common gathering space in homes during social occasions."
