    "The question asks for actions that ensure accuracy when writing a term paper.",
    "Accuracy in a term paper is often achieved through thorough and reliable information.",
    "Research is a critical component of producing accurate content in academic writing.",
    "Having knowledge is also important, but it is generally derived from research rather than being a standalone action.",
    "Going to the library could enhance research efforts but isn't strictly necessary since research can also be conducted online or through other sources.",
    "Eating is unrelated to the accuracy of a term paper and does not contribute positively to the creation of the paper in terms of content.",
    "Getting ideas can be helpful, but ideas alone do not guarantee accuracy without substantiation through research.",
    "Among the options, \"do research\" (Choice A) directly facilitates the accuracy of the term paper.",
