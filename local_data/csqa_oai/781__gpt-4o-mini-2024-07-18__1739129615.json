  "query": "Question: where do you store wine?\n\nChoices:\nA: attic\nB: basement\nC: art show\nD: church\nE: bar",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general conditions required for wine storage. Wine should be stored in a cool, dark place with stable temperatures and humidity levels.",
    "Next, evaluate the options. An attic is often subject to temperature fluctuations due to heat exposure and is generally not ideal for storing wine.",
    "Then, consider a basement. Basements often have cooler temperatures and are less exposed to light, which makes them a common choice for wine storage.",
    "Now, examine the option of an art show. While art shows may have displays of wine, they are not suitable places for storing wine long-term.",
    "Consider the church option. A church is also not designed or intended for storing wine, which further negates this option.",
    "Next, think about a bar. Bars do store wine, but they are not primarily places for long-term storage; rather, they are places to serve and consume wine.",
    "By this analysis, the only option that provides the right environment for wine storage, focusing on temperature control and light protection, is the basement.",
    "Thus, considering all options, the most suitable place from the choices provided for storing wine is the basement."
