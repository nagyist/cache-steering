  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a digital artist modifying a copy of a famous picture.",
    "The purpose of modifying a famous picture is typically to create something that stands out or is different from the original.",
    "Considering the choices: \"creation\" doesn't specifically capture the essence of altering an existing work, \"new\" implies originality, but might not emphasize the artist's intention to differentiate, \"unique\" directly implies making something one-of-a-kind, which aligns with the goal of modification, \"soft copy\" refers to a digital format rather than the modification itself, and \"paste\" is unrelated to the artistic process.",
    "Among the choices presented, \"unique\" best represents the aim of a digital artist to transform a copy of a famous picture into something singular, especially in a creative context.",
    "Checking the implications of the other options reinforces that \"unique\" does indeed capture the relationship between modification and creativity effectively."
