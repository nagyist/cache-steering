  "query": "Question: The cabin wasn't as small as it seemed.  It was, in fact, multiple bunkrooms connected by a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: room\nB: hall\nC: palace\nD: spacecraft\nE: villa",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the sentence. It mentions that the cabin consists of multiple bunkrooms, which suggests that there are additional connecting spaces between these rooms.",
    "The word that connects multiple rooms typically refers to a passage or corridor. Therefore, I should look for a word that conveys this meaning.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the answer choices given:\n- A: room - This does not imply a connecting space; it's too similar to the bunkrooms mentioned.\n- B: hall - This suggests a passage or corridor, which fits the context of connecting multiple rooms.\n- C: palace - This would imply something much grander than what is being described; it does not fit.\n- D: spacecraft - This is completely unrelated to the context of a cabin with bunkrooms.\n- E: villa - This suggests a larger living space, which is not appropriate for a description of bunkrooms.",
    "Out of all the choices, only \"hall\" suggests a corridor or a space connecting different rooms, making it the most logical choice.",
    "To reinforce this conclusion, \"hall\" is commonly used in architecture as a term for a sizeable passageway or corridor that connects rooms, further supporting its suitability."
