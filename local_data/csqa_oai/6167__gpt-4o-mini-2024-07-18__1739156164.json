  "query": "Question: Billy lived alone by a lake.  He was told he had to move because people weren't allowed to live where?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york\nB: state park\nC: underwater\nD: dead body\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "Billy lived alone by a lake, indicating that his living situation is potentially linked to nature and possibly regulated by local laws.",
    "He was told he had to move, which suggests that there are rules or regulations that prohibit living in certain locations.",
    "Considering the choices given, options A (New York) and E (Michigan) refer to states, not specific regulations about living by a lake.",
    "Option B (state park) is a likely candidate because many state parks have regulations that prohibit permanent residences to preserve natural habitats.",
    "Option C (underwater) is more of a humorous or nonsensical choice, as living underwater is not a feasible situation for any human.",
    "Option D (dead body) refers to a crime or law enforcement issue rather than a location restriction for living.",
    "Based on the reasoning and the context of living regulations, it seems that the most logical answer is that Billy was living in a place he shouldn't be, such as a designated state park."
