  "steps": [
    "I will analyze what it means to \"hang\" something on a building. This implies attaching an object to the structure in a way that it stays suspended or is supported by it.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each of the provided options to see if they can be physically hung on or from a building.",
    "Option A: \"grow.\" This is an action, not a tangible object that can be hung. Plants can grow on buildings, but this isn't a direct hanging.",
    "Option B: \"fall down.\" This is a state or action and not something you can hang. It signifies something dropping rather than being suspended.",
    "Option C: \"face north.\" This describes a direction rather than an object. It cannot be hung on a building either.",
    "Option D: \"cast shadow.\" This describes an effect rather than an object. A shadow can result from objects on a building but is not something that can be hung.",
    "Option E: \"target.\" A target can refer to a physical object typically used for aiming or marking, and it is possible to hang a target on a building.",
    "After analyzing all options, the only viable option that could be hung on a building is \"target.\" The others are not practical or possible to hang."
