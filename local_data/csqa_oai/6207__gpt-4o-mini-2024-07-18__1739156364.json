  "query": "Question: Where would a teacher store their upright piano?\n\nChoices:\nA: music class\nB: piano store\nC: band\nD: music store\nE: music room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where a teacher would typically need to use an upright piano for their teaching purposes.",
    "A music class is a setting where a teacher might use a piano for teaching music concepts, but it is typically a more general space.",
    "A piano store would primarily sell pianos and is not a place for a teacher to store their piano.",
    "The \"band\" setting usually refers to a group of musicians focusing on ensemble playing, which may not involve teaching a piano specifically.",
    "A music store also serves as a commercial space for selling musical instruments and has no relevance to storing a piano for instructional use.",
    "The term \"music room\" is often used to describe a dedicated space in schools for music education, where instruments like pianos are typically stored.",
    "Considering the context, the music room would be the most logical location for a teacher to store their upright piano when not in use for lessons.",
    "Therefore, based on this reasoning, the final answer aligns with the characteristics and functions of a music room."
