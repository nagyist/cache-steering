  "query": "Question: Jim's grass didn't get any sunlight because he parked his car over it.  The grass began to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: continue to grow\nB: turn brown\nC: changes color with seasons\nD: dry\nE: burn",
  "steps": [
    "The grass needs sunlight for photosynthesis, which is essential for its growth and health.",
    "When Jim parked his car over the grass, it obstructed the sunlight from reaching the grass.",
    "Without sunlight, the grass cannot perform photosynthesis effectively.",
    "If the grass does not receive enough sunlight, it will start to weaken and show signs of distress.",
    "One common sign of stressed grass due to lack of sunlight is that it starts to turn brown.",
    "While grass may dry out if deprived of water, the specific effect of a lack of sunlight primarily leads to discoloration.",
    "Considering the options given, \u201cturn brown\u201d directly correlates with the impact of insufficient sunlight.",
    "Other options, like \u201cburn\u201d and \u201cdry,\u201d are not the most suitable descriptors of the initial effect from just lacking light.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer that describes the condition of the grass due to lack of sunlight is \"turn brown.\""
