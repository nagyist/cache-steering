  "steps": [
    "The phrase indicates that she had a visible reaction or behavior that conveyed her interest in the boy.",
    "The options provided include behaviors or actions that could indicate attraction or interest.",
    "Option A suggests that \"make eye contact\" could be a form of signaling interest, but it specifies the action rather than a constant behavior.",
    "Option B, \"smile,\" is a common and consistent way someone shows liking or attraction toward another person.",
    "Option C, \"another person,\" does not fit in the context of her feelings toward the boy she was talking to.",
    "Option D, \"listening,\" could indicate engagement but does not necessarily convey romantic interest as directly as smiling might.",
    "Option E, \"compliment,\" could suggest interest but is not something that would be constant; it is more of an occurrence than a persistent behavior.",
    "Among all options, \"smile\" (Option B) stands out as a constant behavior that would clearly indicate she liked the boy."
