  "query": "Question: What chore might a child have to do after breakfast, before getting on the bus?\n\nChoices:\nA: drop out of school\nB: ask questions\nC: enter school\nD: wash dishes\nE: read book",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a chore that a child might need to complete after breakfast but before going to school.",
    "Chores usually refer to tasks that need to be done at home, often as part of daily responsibilities.",
    "Option A, \"drop out of school,\" is not a chore; it's a major life decision and wouldn't be something a child would do on a day-to-day basis.",
    "Option B, \"ask questions,\" does not fit as a chore; it's more of an action one might take at school or in learning but not at home.",
    "Option C, \"enter school,\" is the act of going to school and doesn't qualify as a chore; it's part of the school day, not a task to be done at home.",
    "Option D, \"wash dishes,\" is a common household chore that children might be assigned to do after meals, including after breakfast.",
    "Option E, \"read book,\" is typically an activity rather than a chore; it doesn\u2019t relate to responsibilities after breakfast.",
    "Out of all the options, \"wash dishes\" aligns best with the concept of a chore that a child could do at home."
