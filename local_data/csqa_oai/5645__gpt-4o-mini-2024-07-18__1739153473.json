  "query": "Question: After procreating what can't some people handle that makes them turn to the government?\n\nChoices:\nA: triplets\nB: having children\nC: added responsibilities\nD: quintuplets\nE: large family",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies that after the act of procreating, some individuals face challenges that lead them to seek assistance from the government. We need to identify what those challenges are.",
    "Looking at the options, we can evaluate each one to see if it aligns with the struggles that might cause someone to turn to the government for help.",
    "Option A: \"triplets\" refers to a specific number of children that can be stressful, but does not encompass the overall situation that people face when they have children.",
    "Option B: \"having children\" is quite broad and does not specify a particular challenge that leads people to seek government support.",
    "Option C: \"added responsibilities\" seems to encapsulate the challenges and stress that come with parenthood, which can indeed lead individuals to seek assistance, making it a strong contender.",
    "Option D: \"quintuplets\" is similar to option A in that it specifies a larger number of children, but again it does not fully address the overall concerns faced by parents.",
    "Option E: \"large family\" is also a broad term and while it recognizes the increase in number, it fails to zero in on the stress or inability to manage these responsibilities.",
    "Comparing the options, option C directly addresses the issue of handling increased responsibilities, which is a key factor in why some people might turn to the government for support."
