  "steps": [
    "The question asks what should be given to all applicants regardless of their background when applying for a job.",
    "I need to evaluate the meaning of each choice in relation to job applications.",
    "Choice A, \"critical thinking,\" refers to a skill that might be assessed but is not something given to applicants.",
    "Choice B, \"congratulated,\" suggests that applicants should receive congratulations, but this is not universally applicable in the context of job applications.",
    "Choice C, \"equal opportunity,\" signifies that applicants should have the same chance to apply and be considered for the job, which aligns with fair hiring practices.",
    "Choice D, \"compliments,\" would also not be a standard practice in job applications; it's subjective and not relevant.",
    "Choice E, \"raffle tickets,\" is not relevant to job applications and does not pertain to the hiring process.",
    "Having evaluated all options, \"equal opportunity\" stands out as a fundamental principle in hiring practices to ensure fairness.",
    "Therefore, the best choice that responds to the question is \"equal opportunity.\""
