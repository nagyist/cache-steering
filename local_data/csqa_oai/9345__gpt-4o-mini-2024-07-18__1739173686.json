  "steps": [
    "The question asks where Bill would check his breaker box after experiencing a power outage.",
    "A breaker box is typically located in areas that are connected to the electrical system of a house.",
    "Among the given choices, we need to determine which location is most likely to house a breaker box.",
    "Option A, \"rest area,\" is not applicable as it refers to a public or community space and not a residential area.",
    "Option B, \"refrigerator,\" is an appliance and does not contain a breaker box.",
    "Option C, \"church,\" is also a public building and doesn't have a direct relevance to Bill's personal home and breaker system.",
    "Option D, \"toy store,\" is similarly irrelevant because it is a commercial establishment and not related to Bill's home.",
    "Option E, \"basement,\" is a common location in many homes where electrical systems, including breaker boxes, are often situated.",
    "Considering all of these points, the most logical choice for where Bill would check for his breaker box is the basement."
