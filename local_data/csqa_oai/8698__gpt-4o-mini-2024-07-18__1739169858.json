  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a large over-the-road transport that provides a view from a window seat.",
    "Let's analyze the options provided. \nA: Space shuttle - This is not a road transport, as it operates in space.\nB: Car - Although cars have windows and can be driven on roads, they are not classified as large transport vehicles.\nC: Taxi - Taxis are similar to cars in that they are not typically large transport but can be considered as such in some contexts. However, they do not generally have multiple seat options or a large capacity.\nD: Computer screen - This is not a vehicle at all, hence does not fit the description of transport.\nE: Bus - Buses are large vehicles designed for road transport and have multiple seats along with large windows.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that is classified as a large over-the-road transport is E: bus.",
    "Buses specifically offer multiple window seats that allow passengers to enjoy views during the ride, aligning with the initial request in the question.",
    "Thus, the appropriate choice for the question asked is the bus."
