  "query": "Question: Bill saw a wild animal some place where he never expected to see one.  What might that place have been?\n\nChoices:\nA: zoo\nB: cafe\nC: park\nD: outside\nE: woodland",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what a \"wild animal\" is. Wild animals are typically not domesticated and are usually found in their natural habitats or in areas close to those habitats.",
    "Next, I will analyze the choices given one by one to see which might be an unusual place to encounter a wild animal.",
    "A zoo is specifically designed to house wild animals, so it wouldn't be unexpected to see one there. This option does not fit the criterion.",
    "A cafe is a place where people eat and would generally not be a habitat for wild animals. Seeing a wild animal in a cafe would indeed be unexpected, but it might not be a natural setting.",
    "A park can often be a place where wild animals are seen, as many parks are designed to be natural spaces within urban environments or have wildlife present. It's not particularly unexpected to see a wild animal there.",
    "The term \"outside\" is very broad and could refer to many places, including urban streets or natural settings. However, it's too vague to determine if seeing a wild animal would be unexpected.",
    "Woodland areas are natural habitats for many species of wild animals, so seeing a wild animal there wouldn\u2019t be surprising either.",
    "I need to determine which place would be most unexpected. A cafe stands out as the most unlikely option where one would expect to see a wild animal.",
    "Based on the analysis, while a cafe is not a natural habitat, viewing a wild animal there would definitely be surprising and unexpected."
