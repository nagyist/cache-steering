  "query": "Question: The potato wants to grow, where should it be placed?\n\nChoices:\nA: pantry\nB: paper bag\nC: underground\nD: boiling water\nE: drawer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of potato plants. Potatoes are tubers that grow underground as part of their life cycle.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. The pantry and drawer are enclosed spaces that typically do not provide an ideal growing environment for plants.",
    "Then, evaluate the paper bag. While it can provide some protection, it lacks the necessary moisture and soil for a potato to grow properly.",
    "Now, look at the option of boiling water. Potatoes are often cooked in boiling water, which is detrimental to their structure and would not support growth.",
    "Finally, the underground option stands out as being the only viable choice for a potato to grow. Potatoes naturally grow in the soil, where they can absorb nutrients and moisture."
