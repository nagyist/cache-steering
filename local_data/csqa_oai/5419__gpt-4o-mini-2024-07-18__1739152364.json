  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Joe and Jane's negotiations have become \"less than professional\" and have begun to compromise their objectivity.",
    "We need to analyze what actions could be considered unprofessional in the context of a business negotiation.",
    "Option A, \"compromises,\" does not fit as it refers to making concessions that are a normal part of negotiations.",
    "Option B, \"eloping,\" is unrelated to business negotiations and does not fit the context.",
    "Option C, \"calmness,\" is a positive attribute and would not be described as unprofessional.",
    "Option D, \"fucking,\" is a vulgar term that implies unprofessional behavior in a personal context, which could indeed compromise their objectivity.",
    "Option E, \"handshake,\" is a formal gesture often associated with business agreements and does not suggest unprofessionalism.",
    "Given the analysis, the only option that clearly reflects a behavior that would be considered unprofessional in the context is Option D."
