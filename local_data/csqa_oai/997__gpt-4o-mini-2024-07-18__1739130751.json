  "query": "Question: If a human wants to enjoy another human's company, where might they go?\n\nChoices:\nA: place of work\nB: office\nC: friend's house\nD: workplace\nE: deep thought",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of enjoying another person's company. This typically suggests a social interaction rather than a professional one.",
    "Next, evaluate the options given in relation to social gatherings versus work-related environments.",
    "The options A (place of work), B (office), and D (workplace) are all related to professional settings and typically less conducive to enjoying someone's company in a relaxed manner.",
    "Option E (deep thought) does not represent a location where humans can enjoy each other's company and is more of a mental activity.",
    "This leaves option C (friend's house), which is a typical setting for social interactions where people can relax and enjoy one another's companionship.",
    "Assess the social nature of visiting a friend\u2019s house compared to the other more formal environments presented in the options.",
    "People typically gather at a friend's house for social events such as dinners, game nights, or casual hangouts, making it ideal for enjoying company.",
    "Therefore, C as a friend's house fits best with the context of the question regarding enjoying another human's company."
