  "query": "Question: If you need to store old clothes and want to keep moths away you can put them in what large rectangular storage container?\n\nChoices:\nA: trunk\nB: basement\nC: trash\nD: trash\nE: box",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify a suitable storage container for old clothes that also keeps moths away.",
    "Trunks are often used for storage and can be airtight, which may help keep moths away.",
    "Basements may not be ideal as they can be damp and attract insects, including moths.",
    "Trash containers are used for disposing of waste and are not suitable for storing clothes.",
    "The word \"box\" can refer to various generic containers but lacks specific attributes related to moth prevention.",
    "Comparing the options, the trunk appears to be the most secure and suitable option for long-term storage to prevent moth infestations.",
    "The box could be sealed or not; it depends on the type, but it's less traditional for this purpose compared to a trunk.",
    "We can eliminate the trash options clearly as they are not meant for storage but rather for disposal.",
    "With a trunk being a traditional storage item designed for keeping items safe and secure, it stands out as the best choice.",
    "Finally, the only practical choice that directly addresses both storage and moth prevention is a trunk."
