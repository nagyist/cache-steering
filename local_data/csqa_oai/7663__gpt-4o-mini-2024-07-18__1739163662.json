  "query": "Question: Because of foot rails coming loose, he always kept a screwdriver behind the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: toolbox\nB: bookcase\nC: bar\nD: repair shop\nE: toolkit",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that someone kept a screwdriver behind something due to foot rails coming loose. This suggests that the item behind which the screwdriver is kept is related to a situation where regular repair or fixtures might be needed.",
    "Let's analyze the choices. A toolbox (A) typically contains various tools used for repairs and maintenance, which makes it a plausible place to keep a screwdriver.",
    "A bookcase (B) is primarily for holding books and is less relevant to tools or repairs. Thus, it\u2019s unlikely to be the right choice.",
    "A bar (C) could relate to foot rails, as bars often have foot rails for customers. It would make sense for someone to keep a screwdriver handy behind the bar for quick repairs if the foot rails were coming loose.",
    "A repair shop (D) is a place for repairs, but typically one wouldn\u2019t keep a personal tool like a screwdriver \u201cbehind\u201d it; tools would more likely be stored within the shop itself.",
    "A toolkit (E) is a collection of tools but isn't a physical object behind which someone would keep a screwdriver; it\u2019s more of a portable collection.",
    "From this analysis, option C (bar) seems the most logical choice considering its direct connection to the issue of foot rails that need maintenance."
