  "query": "Question: What is the main ingredient in making bread?\n\nChoices:\nA: yeast\nB: oven\nC: flour\nD: bread pan\nE: kitchen light",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what is essential for creating the basic structure of bread.",
    "Consider the primary ingredients typically found in bread recipes. Commonly, flour is listed as a fundamental component.",
    "Evaluate the role of the other choices: yeast is important for fermentation and rise, but is not the main ingredient. The oven is necessary for baking, but does not form the bread itself. A bread pan holds the bread shape but is not an ingredient. A kitchen light is irrelevant to the process of making bread.",
    "Reaffirm that flour is the primary substance that gives bread its structure, supporting the fermentation process, and allowing for the necessary texture.",
    "Cross-check the importance of flour against other ingredients: without flour, making bread is not feasible as it is the basis of dough.",
    "Conclude that while other elements (like yeast) are significant, none fulfill the primary role as flour does.",
    "Finalize the reasoning by confirming the essential nature of flour in the composition of bread relative to the other options listed."
