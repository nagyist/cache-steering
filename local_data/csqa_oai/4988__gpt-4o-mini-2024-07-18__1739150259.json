  "query": "Question: Alcohol wasn't allowed at the meeting, so where did the alcoholic put his flask?\n\nChoices:\nA: science lab\nB: laboratory\nC: coat pocket\nD: the meeting room\nE: chemistry lab",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that alcohol was not allowed at the meeting, indicating that the alcoholic needed to hide their flask in a place where it would not be discovered.",
    "The options provided include various types of locations: science lab (A), laboratory (B), coat pocket (C), the meeting room (D), and chemistry lab (E).",
    "Locations A, B, and E (science lab, laboratory, chemistry lab) are all places associated with experiments or work where the presence of alcohol would be highly inappropriate.",
    "Option D (the meeting room) is explicitly mentioned as the place where alcohol isn't allowed, making it an unsuitable choice for hiding the flask.",
    "This leaves option C (coat pocket) as the most reasonable place to hide the flask, as it is a personal item that could be concealed without drawing attention to it.",
    "In typical scenarios, individuals who wish to discreetly carry alcohol may use their clothing, specifically a coat pocket, to conceal such items.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the alcoholic would choose to put the flask in the coat pocket to avoid detection."
