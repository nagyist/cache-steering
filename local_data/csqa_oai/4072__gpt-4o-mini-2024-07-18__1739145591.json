  "query": "Question: If you exercise intensely what can happen to your respiration?\n\nChoices:\nA: tiredness\nB: shortness of breath\nC: injury\nD: fitness\nE: thirst",
  "steps": [
    "When exercising intensely, the body requires more oxygen to fuel the muscles.",
    "As the demand for oxygen increases, the respiratory rate typically increases to meet this demand.",
    "This increased respiratory effort can lead to a feeling of shortness of breath, especially if the exercise is vigorous.",
    "Shortness of breath occurs as the body tries to take in more oxygen to keep up with the exertion levels.",
    "Other factors such as the intensity of exercise and individual fitness levels can also affect respiration during intense activities.",
    "While tiredness might occur, it is more of a general symptom and not directly related to respiration.",
    "Injuries can happen during intense exercise but they are not a direct result of changes in respiration.",
    "Improved fitness is a potential long-term benefit of regular intense exercise, but it is not an immediate consequence of respiration during the activity.",
    "Thirst may arise due to dehydration from sweating but again, it is not directly related to respiration.",
    "Thus, the most relevant and immediate consequence of intense exercise on respiration is the feeling of shortness of breath."
