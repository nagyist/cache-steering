  "query": "Question: The high rollers began playing poker, there were no blinds so they all did what?\n\nChoices:\nA: skill\nB: losing money\nC: bet their shoes\nD: ante\nE: attention",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that there were no blinds in the poker game. In traditional poker games, blinds are mandatory bets placed by players to stimulate betting and create a pot.",
    "Without blinds, players may need to contribute to the pot in another way to initiate betting. This means they would need to put money into the pot before any cards are dealt.",
    "One common method used in poker when there are no blinds is the \"ante\". An ante is a small bet that all players are required to put into the pot before the hand begins, ensuring that there is something to play for.",
    "Let's analyze the other options: \n- A: skill - While skill is important in poker, it doesn't address the situation created by the absence of blinds.\n- B: losing money - This could happen, but it is not a direct action taken by the players in the absence of blinds.\n- C: bet their shoes - This is an unusual and impractical option which is not typically done in poker.\n- E: attention - While players may pay attention, this is not an action that they would universally take in response to the absence of blinds.",
    "Given that none of the other options make sense as a action in place of the absence of blinds, the most fitting answer related to poker is \"ante\"."
