  "steps": [
    "The sentence begins with \"Even though people in the team sometimes what,\" indicating that the missing word or phrase should contrast with the idea that they \"argue constructively.\"",
    "To \"argue constructively,\" it suggests that despite some negative behavior, they still manage to have productive discussions.",
    "The choices need to be examined to find something that people might do that could lead to constructive arguing.",
    "Choice A: \"are related\" does not introduce any conflict or constructive behavior.",
    "Choice B: \"sign checks\" is unrelated to the context of arguing.",
    "Choice C: \"like popcorn\" does not fit into the context of arguing; it\u2019s more of a simile or metaphor that doesn\u2019t convey disagreement.",
    "Choice D: \"disagree with each other\" fits well because it indicates a point of contention that could lead to constructive discussion.",
    "Choice E: \"talk to each other\" does not imply any conflict or disagreement; it suggests open communication without indicating the constructive nature.",
    "Out of the five options, \"disagree with each other\" is the clearest choice, as it indicates a source of conflict that can lead to constructive arguments."
