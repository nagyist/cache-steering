  "query": "Question: The cotton needed to be sent to the shirt factory in the Piedmont, where should it get sent?\n\nChoices:\nA: by airplane\nB: medicine cabinet\nC: north carolina\nD: georgia\nE: fabric",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where the cotton should be sent in relation to the shirt factory.",
    "The Piedmont region refers to a plateau that lies between the Atlantic Coastal Plain and the Appalachian Mountains, which stretches through several states.",
    "North Carolina is part of the Piedmont region and has a significant textile industry.",
    "The shirt factory mentioned is most likely in North Carolina, specifically in its Piedmont area, as it is known for textile production.",
    "Georgia, while nearby and also a state involved in textile production, is not part of the Piedmont region.",
    "Sending cotton \"by airplane\" would not make geographical sense in this context; it is simply about transporting raw materials to the factory.",
    "A \"medicine cabinet\" does not relate to the transportation of cotton or textile manufacturing in any way.",
    "\"Fabric\" is the end product of processed cotton and not a transportation option or destination.",
    "Thus, the most logical and relevant choice for where the cotton should be sent is North Carolina."
