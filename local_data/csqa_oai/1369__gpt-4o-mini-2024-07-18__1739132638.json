  "query": "Question: The flour was stored away from the kids so they couldn't play with it, where was it?\n\nChoices:\nA: pantry\nB: grocery store\nC: cupboard\nD: kitchen\nE: table",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the flour was stored away from the kids to prevent them from playing with it, implying it is kept in a secure or designated storage area.",
    "The pantry is typically a storage area for food items, and it is often out of reach for children, making it a plausible location.",
    "A grocery store is not a reasonable answer since it is a commercial place for buying groceries, not a storage location for an individual's flour.",
    "A cupboard is also a common storage space in kitchens for food and other items, and it can be secured (e.g., by closing a door) to keep it away from children.",
    "The kitchen itself is too broad of a category; it encompasses various areas, including pantries and cupboards, and does not specifically indicate a secure storage place.",
    "The table is not a suitable option, as it is typically a surface for preparing or eating food, likely within reach of children.",
    "Both pantry and cupboard are good candidates, but a cupboard is more general and widely used for storing not just food, while the pantry is more specific to food items.",
    "Considering the context of storing flour specifically, a pantry is a dedicated storage area for such items and indicates a location away from children.",
    "Ultimately, although both pantry and cupboard could be safe areas, the pantry is specifically tailored for food storage, showcasing the intention to keep flour away from children."
