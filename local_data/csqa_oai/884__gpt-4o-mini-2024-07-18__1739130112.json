  "steps": [
    "The question implies that ice fishing is associated with a significant body of water in Michigan, specifically mentioning \"the greatest of the Michigan's greats.\"",
    "Michigan has five Great Lakes: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. However, Lake Ontario is not in Michigan, so we focus on the remaining four lakes.",
    "The phrase \"surprisingly far out\" suggests a large body of water, as ice fishing typically requires substantial frozen surface areas.",
    "Looking at the options, A (pond) and C (aquarium) are not large bodies of water and are thus unlikely candidates for \"the greatest of the Michigan's greats.\"",
    "Option B (underwater) does not refer to a body of water suitable for fishing, as it lacks the physical attributes of being a surface area.",
    "This leaves us with options D (Lake Superior) and E (body of water), but the phrase \"greatest of the Michigan's greats\" most likely refers specifically to one of the Great Lakes rather than just any body of water.",
    "Considering Lake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes by surface area, it stands out as the best fit for the description provided in the question.",
    "While option E (body of water) is technically correct, it is vague, and the question appears to seek a more specific identification.",
    "Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the question is D (Lake Superior) as it is both a \"great\" lake and a substantial body of water where ice fishing can be done extensively."
