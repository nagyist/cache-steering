  "query": "Question: Where do students keep rubber bands?\n\nChoices:\nA: trees\nB: drug store\nC: trash\nD: bedside table\nE: classroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify common places where students might keep or store rubber bands.",
    "Rubber bands are typically used for organizing items, so students might keep them where they store school supplies.",
    "Looking at the choices, a \"bedside table\" (Choice D) is generally used for personal items and not typically for school supplies.",
    "\"Classroom\" (Choice E) seems plausible because students may use rubber bands during class for various tasks.",
    "A \"drug store\" (Choice B) is a place to buy items but not where students would typically keep rubber bands.",
    "\"Trash\" (Choice C) is unlikely as it does not denote a storage or keeping place but rather a disposal place for unwanted items.",
    "\"Trees\" (Choice A) is not a logical place for students to keep rubber bands, as they do not provide a suitable or safe space for storage.",
    "Among the analyzed options, the \"classroom\" logically stands out as a likely place where students might keep rubber bands for their use during lessons.",
    "Thus, out of all the available choices, \"classroom\" seems to be the most correct answer for where students might keep rubber bands."
