  "query": "Question: The teacher explained it used a cathode ray tube like other screens, but this what measured things?\n\nChoices:\nA: vacuum tube\nB: television\nC: computer\nD: cathode ray\nE: oscilloscope",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a device that uses a cathode ray tube and is associated with measurement.",
    "A cathode ray tube is a technology typically used in older televisions and computer monitors.",
    "The context of measurement suggests a specific application of cathode ray technology rather than general display use.",
    "An oscilloscope is a device that visually represents electrical signals and often utilizes a cathode ray tube for its display function.",
    "The other options: A (vacuum tube), B (television), C (computer), and D (cathode ray) do not specifically indicate measurement devices as the primary focus.",
    "Television (B) provides visual output but is not primarily a measurement device.",
    "Computer (C) could refer to many devices, but it does not directly relate to the use of a cathode ray tube for measurement.",
    "Vacuum tube (A) is a broader term, and while it refers to a technology that encompasses cathode ray tubes, it does not specifically imply measurement.",
    "The best match for the context of using a cathode ray tube for measurement is indeed the oscilloscope (E).",
    "Hence, the answer must be E as the oscilloscope measures electrical signals and utilizes a cathode ray tube."
