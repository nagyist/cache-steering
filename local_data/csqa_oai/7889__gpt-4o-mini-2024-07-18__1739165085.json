  "query": "Question: What carries blood toward the heart?\n\nChoices:\nA: pumps\nB: vein\nC: hospital\nD: person\nE: soccer game",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what carries blood toward the heart. The heart has different types of blood vessels associated with it.",
    "There are arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins carry blood toward the heart.",
    "Since the question specifically asks what \"carries blood toward the heart,\" I can eliminate any option that does not fit this description.",
    "Looking at the options presented, A (pumps), C (hospital), D (person), and E (soccer game) do not directly carry blood; they represent other concepts or entities.",
    "The only option left that describes a vessel responsible for carrying blood toward the heart is B (vein).",
    "I will confirm that veins are indeed known for carrying deoxygenated blood back to the heart from various parts of the body.",
    "In summary, veins are integral components of the circulatory system responsible for returning blood to the heart.",
    "Thus, based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is B (vein)."
