  "query": "Question: If a person has stage fright and is about to go on stage what will they experience?\n\nChoices:\nA: ridiculous\nB: anxiety\nC: open sores\nD: happiness\nE: different",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify what stage fright is. Stage fright, also known as performance anxiety, is the fear or anxiousness a person feels before or during a performance in front of an audience.",
    "Next, I consider the emotional responses typically associated with stage fright. Common feelings include nervousness, fear, and anxiety.",
    "Now, I will examine the given choices to see which best aligns with these common responses to stage fright.",
    "Choice A: \"ridiculous\" does not capture the feelings associated with anxiety or stage fright.",
    "Choice B: \"anxiety\" seems to directly describe one of the feelings a person experiencing stage fright would likely encounter.",
    "Choice C: \"open sores\" appears irrelevant as it does not relate to emotional responses or feelings one might have before a performance.",
    "Choice D: \"happiness\" contradicts the nature of stage fright, which is characterized by fear and anxiety, not joy.",
    "Choice E: \"different\" is too vague and does not specifically address any feelings associated with stage fright.",
    "Since choice B explicitly describes a common emotional reaction to stage fright, it strongly matches the experience someone would have in this situation."
