  "steps": [
    "Simon's instructions were not clear, which indicates there was a lack of clarity in what was communicated.",
    "When instructions lack clarity, it often leads to misunderstandings or confusion regarding what needs to be done.",
    "The word \"confusing\" aligns with the idea that unclear instructions can lead to difficulty in understanding them.",
    "The other choices need to be evaluated: \n- \"park\" (A) does not relate to instructions.\n- \"invisible\" (B) suggests something can't be seen, which doesn't fit with unclear instructions.\n- \"obscured\" (D) could imply the instructions were hidden or hard to see, but it doesn't specifically convey confusion.\n- \"misunderstood\" (E) implies that the instructions were interpreted incorrectly, which could relate, but isn't the direct consequence of them being unclear.",
    "Among the choices, \"confusing\" (C) directly expresses how Claire found the instructions, as she struggled to comprehend them clearly."
