  "query": "Question: A wind from the east is often referred to as a what kind of wind?\n\nChoices:\nA: north\nB: westward\nC: western\nD: westerly\nE: eastside",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a term that describes a wind coming from the east.",
    "Winds are typically named for the direction they come from. Therefore, a wind from the east would be termed based on a direction associated with the east.",
    "The term \"easterly\" is commonly used for winds that blow from the east toward the west.",
    "Looking at the answer choices provided, none of the options include \"easterly.\"",
    "We need to identify which option could be the equivalent or the closest match in terminology.",
    "Option D is \"westerly,\" but that refers to winds coming from the west.",
    "Options A (north), B (westward), and C (western) do not fit the description of winds from the east as they describe winds from the north or west.",
    "Option E (eastside) is not a term used in meteorology for wind direction.",
    "Since there are no direct matches among the choices for a wind blowing from the east, I must consider the potential mismatch meaning \"westerly\" as perhaps being used inaccurately.",
    "However, based on common terminology, east winds are most validly sought as \"easterly,\" and since we have none provided, I conclude that perhaps \"westerly\" is the less clear misinterpretation of the question asking for the wind that affects the area west of the east wind."
