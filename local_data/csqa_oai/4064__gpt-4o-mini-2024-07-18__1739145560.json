  "steps": [
    "The question asks what using a driving car could help someone to be, suggesting a beneficial or productive outcome of driving a car.",
    "I need to analyze each of the choices to determine which one represents a positive benefit of driving a car.",
    "Choice A, \"stop sign,\" refers to a traffic regulation and doesn't indicate a state someone can be. It's not relevant.",
    "Choice B, \"car crash,\" is a negative event that could occur if someone is driving carelessly, so this does not fit the idea of \"helping someone.\"",
    "Choice C, \"pollution,\" is a negative consequence associated with cars, reflecting environmental issues, which is again not a benefit.",
    "Choice D, \"on time,\" represents a positive outcome of using a driving car. Driving can help someone arrive at their destination punctually, especially compared to walking or using public transport.",
    "Choice E, \"run out of gas,\" reflects a potential negative scenario and again does not represent a benefit of using a car.",
    "From the analysis, the only choice that implies a beneficial outcome of using a driving car is \"on time.\""
