    "Lizards are generally found in warm environments where they can bask in the sun.",
    "They thrive in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and moist areas.",
    "Common human-altered habitats where lizards can be found include backyards, gardens, and rock walls.",
    "The term \"great outdoors\" refers broadly to all natural environments away from urban areas and can encompass many habitats where lizards are found.",
    "A stream bed represents a specific type of habitat that may harbor lizards but is not as general as some of the other options.",
    "In gardens, lizards often find plentiful insects to eat and places to hide, making it a suitable habitat.",
    "Backyards can also provide similar features to gardens, including plants and insects, which attract lizards.",
