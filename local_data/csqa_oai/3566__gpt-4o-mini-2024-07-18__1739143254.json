  "query": "Question: The journalist had a simple approach, see story; do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sit down\nB: would read\nC: reading\nD: remember\nE: write down",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question which revolves around the actions of a journalist after seeing a story.",
    "Journalists typically follow a process of capturing or reporting information once they have identified a story.",
    "The primary action taken by a journalist after recognizing a story is to document it or write about it.",
    "Next, I analyze the provided answer choices to determine which one aligns with the typical behavior of a journalist.",
    "Choice A \"sit down\" does not directly relate to the action of addressing the story.",
    "Choice B \"would read\" is not an appropriate next action since reading is typically not the primary step taken after seeing a story.",
    "Choice C \"reading\" similarly does not capture the active response required of journalists.",
    "Choice D \"remember\" implies retention but fails to encapsulate action required for reporting.",
    "Choice E \"write down\" is a direct and active response that is consistent with what a journalist would do after seeing a story.",
    "Thus, the best-fit action based on the context provided is to \"write down\" the story."
