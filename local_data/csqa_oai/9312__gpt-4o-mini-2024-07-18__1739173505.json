  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the possible locations of the mailbox in relation to my house and the next block.",
    "Considering the typical placement of mailboxes, they are commonly located near the street rather than at a front door or within a building.",
    "Checking the options provided: \n- A (front door) is unlikely because mailboxes are usually outside.\n- B (post office) is not a viable option as it refers to a public building, not a mailbox.\n- C (apartment complex) does not seem logical unless I live in the complex.\n- D (street corner) is a common place for mailboxes as they are accessible for mail delivery.\n- E (fence) could potentially be an option, but typically mailboxes are placed at the edge of the property along the sidewalk or street.",
    "I note that D (street corner) is often a conventional location for mailboxes since it is designed for easy access for mail carriers and residents alike.",
    "I also consider option E (fence), as it could be nearby, but it\u2019s less likely compared to a street corner since mailboxes are usually placed where they can be easily reached from the road.",
    "Given that a street corner is generally more logical for a mailbox situated between houses, I lean towards D.",
    "Cross-referencing other options confirms there is no more suitable alternative for a mailbox than at the street corner."
