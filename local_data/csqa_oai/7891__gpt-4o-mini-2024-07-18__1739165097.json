  "query": "Question: If I want more light sources while I am awake at night, where should I install them?\n\nChoices:\nA: lamp\nB: sky\nC: house\nD: dig in the garden\nE: candle",
  "steps": [
    "The goal is to have more light sources while I am awake at night.",
    "A lamp (Choice A) is a common source of artificial light and is specifically designed for interior use, making it a practical choice for providing light at night.",
    "The sky (Choice B) does not provide a reliable source of light at night since it is typically dark and depends on celestial bodies like the moon or stars, which are not sufficient to meet the need for additional light sources.",
    "The house (Choice C) includes all areas within it and can accommodate multiple light sources like lamps, ceiling lights, or even string lights, thus offering various options for light at night.",
    "Digging in the garden (Choice D) is unlikely to provide any light sources and may actually inhibit light sources that are already present, such as outdoor lamps.",
    "Candle (Choice E) can be another source of light, though it is limited in brightness and typically poses safety concerns, particularly if left unattended.",
    "Comparing the options, installing light sources in the house (Choice C) maximizes accessibility and variety in types of lighting available.",
    "Therefore, considering effectiveness and safety, the best option is to install more light sources within the house."
