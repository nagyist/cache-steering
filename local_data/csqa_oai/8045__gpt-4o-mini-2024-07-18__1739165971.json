  "steps": [
    "To understand where John is, we need to interpret the phrase \"kept his right hand on the wall.\" This suggests he is in a place where walls are prominent and likely in a complex layout.",
    "Backtracking implies that he is trying to avoid going back to a previous location, which indicates that he may be navigating a maze or complex environment.",
    "The mention of simplicity in keeping from backtracking reinforces that he is using a common strategy employed in narrow passageways or convoluted spaces.",
    "A corner could imply an enclosed space but doesn't necessarily relate to backtracking unless it's a small area; similarly, a classroom or art show does not typically involve the need to navigate walls to prevent backtracking.",
    "Prisons often have cells and corridors but still are more associated with confinement than navigation.",
    "A labyrinth is specifically designed to confuse or challenge navigation, making it the most fitting option since it involves walls and backtracking avoidance.",
    "In a labyrinth, many individuals are advised to keep a hand on the wall to ensure they do not get lost, consistent with John's approach.",
    "Therefore, given the context of walls and the need for navigation without retracing steps, a labyrinth is the most accurate answer."
