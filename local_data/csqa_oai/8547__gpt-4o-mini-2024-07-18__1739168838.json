  "steps": [
    "The question discusses a rubber stamp shaped like a state with a race car that signifies a racing heritage.",
    "To determine the correct answer, I need to identify which state is well-known for its racing heritage, particularly any state that typically connects with cars or racing.",
    "Indiana is famously known for the Indianapolis 500, one of the most renowned auto races in the world, highlighting its strong racing culture.",
    "The other options (desk, Canada, art class, office) do not have a significant connection to racing or a notable racing heritage.",
    "Given the strong association of Indiana with car racing events, it stands out more than the other choices.",
    "I will consider if there are any notable attributes specific to racing for the other choices to ensure that none offer a competing heritage.",
    "Desk and office relate to work environments but lack any racing relevance.",
    "Canada does have motorsports, but it\u2019s not specifically tied to a singular prominent racing heritage like the Indianapolis 500.",
    "Art class does not relate to racing in any way.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all choices and focusing on racing heritage, it is clear that Indiana is the right answer."
