  "query": "Question: What do you receive a new credit card in?\n\nChoices:\nA: wallet\nB: resturant\nC: wallet\nD: envelope\nE: purse",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct answer, first, I need to consider what is commonly associated with receiving a new credit card.",
    "Typically, a new credit card is sent by mail when it is issued, which implies it would be contained in something that aids in its delivery.",
    "Envelopes are commonly used to send documents and cards through the mail, so it is likely that a new credit card would be delivered in an envelope.",
    "While a person might ultimately keep their credit card in a wallet or purse after receiving it, the question specifically asks about what the card is received in, not where it is kept afterward.",
    "Considering the options, A (wallet) and E (purse) refer to keeping the card, while D (envelope) directly relates to how it is received.",
    "Now, I will eliminate options A, B, C, and E because they do not answer the question about the initial reception of the credit card.",
    "This leaves option D (envelope) as the most logical answer for how a new credit card is received."
