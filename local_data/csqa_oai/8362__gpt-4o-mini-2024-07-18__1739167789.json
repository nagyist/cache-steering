  "query": "Question: Where would a bell end a scheduled class?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: boat\nC: school\nD: educational institution\nE: front door",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where a bell would signal the end of a scheduled class.",
    "Bells are commonly associated with the starting and ending of classes in educational settings.",
    "In schools, bells are used to indicate the beginning and end of class periods to manage students' transitions between classes.",
    "A church might have bells, but they signal religious events, not specifically the end of a class.",
    "A boat might have bells, but they are unrelated to class schedules.",
    "While \"educational institution\" could also be a fit, the term is more general and does not specifically relate to the end of a scheduled class.",
    "The phrase \"scheduled class\" most directly connects with the environment of a school, where the bell is a recognized cue for students and teachers.",
    "Given the specificity of the term \"class,\" the best answer is \"school.\""
