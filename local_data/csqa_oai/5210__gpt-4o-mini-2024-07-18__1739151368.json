  "steps": [
    "To determine where supercomputers can commonly be found, I need to consider the nature of supercomputers and their applications. Supercomputers are powerful computing systems used for complex calculations and data processing, typically in scientific research, simulations, and large scale data analyses.",
    "I can eliminate some choices based on their common functions. A library primarily offers books and information resources, not computing hardware like supercomputers.",
    "The post office deals with mail and package delivery, which again does not involve supercomputers. Thus, this option is not relevant to where supercomputers might be found.",
    "A technical store primarily sells consumer electronics and technology products, not large-scale supercomputers, which are specialized pieces of hardware. Therefore, this option can also be eliminated.",
    "Next, I analyze the remaining options: universities and large cities. Universities often conduct research and many have research laboratories that use supercomputers for scientific inquiries, modeling, and analysis.",
    "Large cities may have institutions or organizations that deploy supercomputers for various industries; however, they are not guaranteed to have them specifically housed there. Thus, while plausible, this option is less definitive than the university context.",
    "Given that universities typically have dedicated research departments and facilities that house supercomputers for educational and research purposes, this makes them the most likely place to find supercomputers when compared to the other options.",
    "I am now comfortable concluding that the most appropriate answer to the question is C, as it is the most relevant and specific location for supercomputers."
