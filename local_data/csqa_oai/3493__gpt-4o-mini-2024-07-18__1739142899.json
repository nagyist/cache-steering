  "query": "Question: cats have how many apendages?\n\nChoices:\nA: tail\nB: whiskers\nC: two eyes\nD: four paws\nE: four legs",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"appendages\" means in the context of animals. An appendage is typically a limb or a structure that protrudes from the main body of an animal.",
    "Next, I will identify the possible choices that could be considered appendages for a cat.",
    "Choice A mentions \"tail\", which is indeed an appendage as it protrudes from the cat's body and serves various functions.",
    "Choice B refers to \"whiskers\". While whiskers are important sensory organs for cats, they are not considered appendages in the same way limbs or tails are.",
    "Choice C states \"two eyes\". Eyes are organs used for sight but are not typically categorized as appendages.",
    "Choice D mentions \"four paws\". Paws are indeed appendages since they are limbs used for movement.",
    "Choice E states \"four legs\". Legs are also appendages used for mobility, thus making this choice valid as well.",
    "Now, comparing options D (four paws) and E (four legs), it's essential to point out that four paws are typically synonymous with four legs for cats. Therefore, both choices indicate that cats have multiple appendages, specifically four appendages each.",
    "To summarize, choice A (tail), choice D (four paws), and choice E (four legs) are the valid appendages. I will refine the answer based on the most complete description of appendages."
