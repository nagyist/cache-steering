  "query": "Question: Where do you keep a teakettle?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: countertop\nC: water\nD: hardware department\nE: england",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a teakettle is. A teakettle is designed to hold water and heat it for boiling purposes.",
    "Next, evaluate where one would typically store a teakettle when it is not in use. Common storage locations include cupboards and cabinets in the kitchen.",
    "Consider whether a teakettle would be kept on the countertop when not in use. It is often kept there for easy access during use, but not necessarily as a long-term storage solution.",
    "Look at the other options: 'water' does not make sense as a storage location for a teakettle; 'hardware department' is where one might purchase a teakettle but not where it's kept; and 'England' does not relate to where one would keep a teakettle specifically.",
    "Given the main tasks associated with a teakettle, it can be concluded that it is most likely kept in a cupboard or on the countertop when not in use. However, the best answer for storage is the cupboard.",
    "Thus, after considering all options and eliminating the irrelevant ones, the best choice is Option A: cupboard."
