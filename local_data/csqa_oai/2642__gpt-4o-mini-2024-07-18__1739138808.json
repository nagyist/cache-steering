  "query": "Question: What do a string of words with a proper noun and verb form?\n\nChoices:\nA: english\nB: dictionary\nC: phrase\nD: sentence\nE: language",
  "steps": [
    "A string of words typically forms a coherent unit of meaning in language.",
    "Proper nouns are specific names of people, places, or organizations, and they indicate particular entities.",
    "Verbs are action words that describe what the subject of the sentence is doing.",
    "A combination of a proper noun and a verb usually conveys a complete thought or action regarding the proper noun.",
    "This combination of words that conveys meaning can be referred to as a phrase or a sentence.",
    "A phrase generally refers to a group of words that may not have a subject and a predicate, while a sentence is a complete thought that usually contains a subject and a predicate.",
    "Since the question highlights both a proper noun and a verb, it typically forms a complete unit of meaning, thus constituting a sentence.",
    "In contrast, a phrase can exist without a verb and still be meaningful, but in this context, the inclusion of a verb suggests the intention for a complete thought.",
    "Reviewing the definitions, the most accurate answer to what a string of words with a proper noun and verb forms is a sentence, as it meets the criteria for having both a subject (the proper noun) and action (the verb)."
