  "steps": [
    "I need to understand what is meant by \"what happens to people over time.\" This suggests a natural progression or change that individuals undergo as time passes.",
    "One of the first observations about humans is that they physically change as they age. This is a biological process that occurs universally.",
    "As people age, they go through various life stages such as childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. This is a fundamental aspect of human life.",
    "Considering the choices, A (use money), B (feel cold), C (play games), and D (believe in god) describes behaviors or emotional responses, but not a universal change that occurs over time.",
    "Choice E (become old) specifically refers to the aging process, which is a direct outcome of the passage of time in all individuals.",
    "Since E is a clear and direct answer that encapsulates what happens to people as time progresses, it stands out from the other options.",
    "To validate E, I can reflect on the other choices; none address a universal experience over the span of a lifetime as effectively as the aging process does.",
    "Therefore, after evaluating all the options based on the question posed about what happens to people over time, the logical conclusion is reached."
