  "query": "Question: Because of safety concerns a law was passed, now all cars must have what?\n\nChoices:\nA: windows\nB: trunks\nC: four wheels\nD: seat belts\nE: diesel engines",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a law was passed due to safety concerns, which suggests that the requirement should relate directly to safety measures in vehicles.",
    "Option D, \"seat belts,\" is a key safety feature that has been mandated in many jurisdictions due to its critical role in protecting passengers during accidents.",
    "Option C, \"four wheels,\" while essential for a car to function as a vehicle, is not primarily a safety feature but rather a design standard for cars.",
    "Options A (windows), B (trunks), and E (diesel engines) do not correlate directly with safety measures like seat belts do.",
    "To determine the strongest connection to safety concerns, we focus on mandatory safety features that help reduce injuries during accidents.",
    "Given that seat belts significantly enhance passenger safety by restraining occupants, it aligns well with the law driven by safety concerns.",
    "Thus, it can be concluded that the most relevant option addressing safety in vehicles due to the law is seat belts."
