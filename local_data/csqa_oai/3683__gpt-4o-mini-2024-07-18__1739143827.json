  "query": "Question: The nurse had to grade severity of each wound during the emergency, that way the doctor could treat each what in the best order?\n\nChoices:\nA: battle\nB: injured person\nC: body\nD: food\nE: emergency room",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions grading the severity of each wound, which implies that there are individual wounds that need to be assessed in relation to patients.",
    "The purpose of grading the severity of wounds is to prioritize treatments based on which wounds or injuries need immediate attention compared to others.",
    "The word \"each\" in the question indicates that there might be multiple individuals that the nurse is assessing.",
    "Out of the provided choices, we need to determine which option makes the most sense in the context of treating an emergency situation.",
    "Choice A: \"battle\" does not relate to a medical context or prioritization, so it is unlikely to be the answer.",
    "Choice B: \"injured person\" aligns with the idea of treating individuals based on wound severity, indicating the focus is on patients.",
    "Choice C: \"body\" could be interpreted as needing to treat specific body parts, but it doesn't specify the need for prioritization among individuals.",
    "Choice D: \"food\" is irrelevant in the context of treating wounds or injuries, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Choice E: \"emergency room\" refers to the location but doesn't fit the idea of treating specific wounds or patients in order of severity.",
    "Considering all reasoning, the option \"injured person\" (B) clearly ties back to the context of treating individuals with specific wounds in order of their severity, making it the most relevant answer."
