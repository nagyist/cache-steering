  "steps": [
    "The question states that Billy couldn't pick a side against a friend. This implies that he did not want to choose one side over the other due to loyalty or friendship.",
    "In situations where someone cannot choose between two sides, they often find themselves in a position where they are physically or metaphorically located between the two options.",
    "The choices provided include \"angle,\" \"in between,\" \"front back,\" \"toeside,\" and \"center.\"",
    "\"Angle\" does not specifically refer to a position relative to two sides, so it can be ruled out.",
    "\"Front back\" and \"toeside\" refer to specific orientations or movements, likely in a physical activity like sports, which does not match the context of standing between two choices.",
    "\"Center\" could imply a position among two sides but does not convey the clear idea of indecision as directly as \"in between.\"",
    "The choice \"in between\" clearly indicates a position held by someone who cannot fully commit to one side, reflecting Billy's situation of indecision.",
    "Therefore, out of the options given, the most representative of Billy's inability to pick a side is \"in between.\""
