  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider the context of the question, which asks where a tin is likely to have food in it.",
    "Now, evaluate each option to see if it commonly sells or stores food in tins.",
    "Option A, Pizza Hut, is a restaurant and specifically serves pizza, but typically does not deal in tins of food.",
    "Option B, a hardware store, mostly sells tools and building materials, which do not include food items in tins.",
    "Option C, a grocery store, is specifically designed for selling food and would regularly have food items stored in tins, such as canned vegetables, fruits, sauces, etc.",
    "Option D, an antique store, may sell old tins but they are likely not to contain food currently, as they might be collectible items rather than food items.",
    "Option E, a cupboard, might store food, but it is not a definitive place where tins are typically found; it could also store various non-food items.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only place where one is certain to find food in a tin is a grocery store (Option C)."
