  "query": "Question: Parents have to sign a waiver to let their kids wrestle, the sport involves constant what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sweat\nB: michigan\nC: property damage\nD: strong\nE: physical contact",
  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the context of the question, which involves parents signing a waiver for their kids to participate in wrestling.",
    "Wrestling is a contact sport, typically involving two competitors engaging closely and physically with one another.",
    "This physical engagement can lead to injuries and requires waivers to protect the organization from liability.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the answer choices provided. First, I will consider option A \"sweat\" - while sweat is a byproduct of physical exertion, it is not a primary concern addressed in waivers.",
    "Next, I will evaluate option B \"michigan\" - this does not relate to wrestling or the concept of contact.",
    "Then, I move to option C \"property damage\" - while there may be some incidental property damage in sporting events, it is not the main focus of wrestling waivers.",
    "Next is option D \"strong\" - strength is a characteristic important in wrestling but does not describe the actions or implications that necessitate a waiver.",
    "Finally, I evaluate option E \"physical contact\". This aligns perfectly with the nature of wrestling, as the sport predominantly involves grappling and bodily interaction.",
    "After reviewing all options, it is clear that physical contact is the main reason for requiring a waiver for wrestling."
