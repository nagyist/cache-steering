  "query": "Question: The bat was abducted and absconded to top secret government facilities, where did this happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: office building\nB: new mexico\nC: bridge\nD: belfry\nE: dug out",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the term \"abducted\". This suggests that something or someone was taken away, likely against their will.",
    "Next, \"absconded\" means to leave hurriedly and secretly, typically to avoid detection or arrest. Combining these terms suggests a covert operation.",
    "The phrase \"top secret government facilities\" indicates a location that is likely not widely known and is associated with government activity. This suggests a specific and possibly remote location.",
    "Now, considering the choices provided: A) office building is too commonplace for a top-secret facility. B) New Mexico, specifically the area known for its association with military and government operations (like Area 51), could be a plausible option. C) bridge is an unlikely location for such activities. D) belfry (a place in a church tower) does not fit the description of a government facility. E) dug out implies a natural feature used as shelter but is also too vague.",
    "Focusing on the geographical aspect, New Mexico has historical ties with extraterrestrial phenomena and secret military bases, making it a fitting location for a narrative centered around secrecy and government operations.",
    "Comparing New Mexico with the other options, it stands out as the most reasonable location since the other choices either do not correspond to secretive governmental activity or they are not locations typically connected to such operations.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer based on the reasoning about where such a dramatic event could occur seems to be New Mexico."
