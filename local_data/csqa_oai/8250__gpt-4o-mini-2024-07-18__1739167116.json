  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a location where an old coffee table book can be found.",
    "A coffee table book is typically a large, often hardcover book that is intended to be displayed on a coffee table for casual viewing.",
    "Old coffee table books are often valued for their visual content, art, photography, or literature.",
    "We need to evaluate each option to see which is most commonly associated with old or vintage items.",
    "A: \"house\" - While someone could potentially own an old coffee table book, this is not a location where one would specifically go to find such items.",
    "B: \"university\" - Universities may have collections of old books but generally not a dedicated source for old coffee table books.",
    "C: \"discount store\" - Discount stores usually sell new items and do not typically focus on old or vintage products.",
    "D: \"antique store\" - Antique stores generally specialize in old and vintage items, including books, so it's a strong contender.",
    "E: \"vintage emporium\" - Similar to antique stores, vintage emporiums specifically focus on vintage items, making it another viable option for finding old coffee table books.",
    "Both D and E seem appropriate for finding old coffee table books, but antique stores are more broadly known for a range of older items.",
    "However, \"vintage emporium\" suggests a focus on previously loved items, specifically targeting vintage which may cover a wider variety of coffee table books.",
    "Considering the specificity of collecting old items, \"antique store\" is likely more recognized for old books, while \"vintage emporium\" may specialize more and potentially cover a broader range including coffee table books.",
    "Thus, I conclude that either D or E could be correct, but after considering traditional associations more closely, D: \"antique store\" serves as the most common location people would think of for finding an old coffee table book."
