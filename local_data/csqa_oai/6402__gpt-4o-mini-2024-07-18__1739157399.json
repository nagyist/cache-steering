  "query": "Question: If I were a snake, where would I go tempt people?\n\nChoices:\nA: white house\nB: new mexico\nC: beach\nD: tropical forest\nE: garden of eden",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature of snakes and their habitats. Snakes are often associated with tropical and warm environments.",
    "Evaluate the options provided. The \"beach\" (C) may have some snakes but is not typically known for them specifically.",
    "Look at \"new mexico\" (B) - while it has some snake species, it's not a widely recognized place for snakes to tempt people.",
    "Now, consider \"tropical forest\" (D). This is a common habitat for many snake species and could be a plausible location where they might encounter people.",
    "Next, focus on \"garden of eden\" (E). This is a symbolic biblical reference known primarily for the story of temptation involving a snake.",
    "Since the question asks about tempting people, the \"garden of eden\" is directly linked to the concept of temptation involving a snake.",
    "Despite the other options being places where snakes might live, they do not have the same cultural significance related to temptation as the \"garden of eden.\"",
    "Thus, considering both symbolic and literal interpretations, the best answer aligns with the concept of temptation."
