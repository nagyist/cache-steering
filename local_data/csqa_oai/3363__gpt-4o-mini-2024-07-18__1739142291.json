  "query": "Question: When two people know different things and want to help, what do they do?\n\nChoices:\nA: discuss\nB: burn themselves\nC: teach each other\nD: cross themselves\nE: talk to each other",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves two people who have different knowledge or information and want to assist one another.",
    "The most logical way for two individuals to help each other when they possess different pieces of information is to share that knowledge.",
    "Discussion is a part of this process, but it does not explicitly indicate that they are actively sharing what each person knows.",
    "Burning themselves (choice B) and crossing themselves (choice D) do not relate to a scenario of cooperation or communication; these options are irrelevant to the context.",
    "Teaching each other (choice C) implies a transfer of knowledge, which directly addresses their goal of helping one another by imparting what they know.",
    "Talking to each other (choice E) suggests communication but may not necessarily encompass the active sharing of knowledge or teaching.",
    "Upon reviewing the answers, while discussing and talking are important, the specific act of teaching focuses on the sharing of knowledge, which aligns with the aim of the individuals wanting to help each other.",
    "Therefore, the most appropriate answer, emphasizing the most effective way they would help each other given their different knowledge sets, is to teach one another."
