  "query": "Question: The person was stood up on a date, what was his reaction?\n\nChoices:\nA: cross street\nB: machine part\nC: regret\nD: selling things\nE: feel resentful",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotional context of being stood up on a date. Typically, this situation can lead to feelings of disappointment and being hurt.",
    "The choices given need to be analyzed in relation to the potential feelings one might have after being stood up.",
    "Option A, \"cross street\", does not relate emotionally to being stood up and seems more about a physical action.",
    "Option B, \"machine part\", is entirely unrelated to personal feelings or relationship issues.",
    "Option C, \"regret\", could be a possible reaction, as one might regret the time spent anticipating the date or certain decisions prior to it.",
    "Option D, \"selling things\", is irrelevant in this context as it does not relate to emotional responses and seems misplaced.",
    "Option E, \"feel resentful\", is also a likely emotional reaction. Being stood up can lead to resentment towards the person who canceled, as well as possibly oneself.",
    "Now, to evaluate options C and E: both could feasibly reflect a reaction to being stood up, but \"regret\" often involves reflection on one\u2019s choices rather than on the treatment by others, while \"resentful\" directly addresses the emotional impact of being stood up.",
    "Given the emotional weight of being stood up, feelings of resentment are common, as they reflect direct unhappiness towards the other person for their actions.",
    "Thus, the best possible choice reflecting the reaction to being stood up is to feel resentful."
