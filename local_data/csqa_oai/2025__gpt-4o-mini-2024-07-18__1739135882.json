  "query": "Question: Sam didn't want to join a union, but he had no choice.  He was employed at a union shop. If he didn't want to join, he's have to leave what?\n\nChoices:\nA: province\nB: workplace\nC: construction business\nD: law\nE: club",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand that a \"union shop\" refers to a workplace where the employer agrees to hire union members and the employees are required to join the union after being employed for a certain period.",
    "Sam didn't want to join the union, indicating he prefers not to be a member or is against unions generally.",
    "Given that he is employed at a union shop, he is required to join the union if he wishes to continue working there.",
    "If he does not want to join the union, his only option to avoid joining would be to leave his current employment.",
    "Now, consider the choices provided: he must leave his job since that is the condition of being at a union shop if he refuses to join the union.",
    "The choices present various options, but \"workplace\" is the only choice that directly correlates with the need to stop employment at the union shop.",
    "The other choices (province, construction business, law, club) do not refer to his direct employment situation and are therefore not relevant to his decision.",
    "Thus, if Sam doesn't want to join the union, he has no choice but to leave his \"workplace,\" which is the union shop."
