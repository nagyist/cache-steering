  "query": "Question: He was injured and on disability, what did he need to have to receive government benefits?\n\nChoices:\nA: qualification\nB: competency\nC: potence\nD: competence\nE: information",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that he was injured and on disability, which implies he is seeking government benefits intended for individuals in such situations.",
    "To receive government benefits for disability, individuals typically need to meet specific criteria set by the government, which can include medical evidence of the disability and other requirements.",
    "The option \"qualification\" suggests the need to meet certain standards or criteria to be eligible for benefits, which aligns with the requirements for government support.",
    "The other options, such as \"competency,\" \"potence,\" and \"competence,\" do not directly relate to the eligibility criteria for disability benefits.",
    "\"Competency\" and \"competence\" refer more to one's ability in a task or activity, which is not primarily what is needed for receiving benefits.",
    "\"Potence\" relates to power or effectiveness, which does not apply in the context of qualifying for government aid.",
    "The only option that explicitly aligns with the need to be eligible for benefits is \"qualification,\" as it denotes the necessary criteria that must be met.",
    "I also consider \"information,\" but that is more about the knowledge needed to apply rather than the requirement to actually receive the benefits."
