  "query": "Question: The principal encourage everyone to try hard in school, what did he want them to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: number list\nB: do well\nC: wear shoes\nD: play computer games\nE: hope for peace",
  "steps": [
    "The principal is encouraging everyone, which indicates a desire for improvement or motivation among students.",
    "The phrase \"try hard in school\" suggests that the focus is on academic performance and effort in studies.",
    "Considering the context of a school setting, the principal likely wants students to succeed academically as a result of their hard work.",
    "The options provided include various activities or outcomes. A number list, wearing shoes, playing computer games, and hoping for peace do not relate directly to academic performance.",
    "Among the options, \"do well\" aligns perfectly with the idea of trying hard in school, which implies achieving good grades or performance.",
    "Other options (A, C, D, E) do not reflect the objective of educational encouragement or striving for better performance in an academic environment.",
    "Thus, the most logical inference from the principal's statement is that he wants students to perform well in their studies."
