  "steps": [
    "The question focuses on the likely location of an adult collector's collection of toy cars.",
    "Typically, adult collectors do not keep their collections in toy stores, as that would mean they are still for sale rather than being a personal collection.",
    "A block of flats (B) does not inherently suggest that it would be a designated place for car collections, as it is just a type of housing.",
    "Options D and E refer to a child's bedroom, which would not logically be where an adult collector keeps their toys, as they are specifically for children.",
    "An adult collector is likely to have a personal space or a special room in their own home where they can display and store their collections.",
    "Since the question specifies \"adult collector,\" we can conclude that they would keep their prized possessions in their own living space rather than a child's room or a toy store.",
    "Choosing from the remaining options, \"own home\" is the most logical and appropriate location for an adult collector of toy cars."
