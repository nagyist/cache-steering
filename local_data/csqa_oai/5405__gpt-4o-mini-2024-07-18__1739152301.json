    "Texas is a state that is known for its size and distinct cultural identity within the United States.",
    "Geographically, Texas is situated in the southern region of the United States, bordering several other states.",
    "Texas shares its southern border with Mexico, but this does not define Texas as being located in Mexico.",
    "The term \"texaphyrin\" does not correspond to any known geographical location or recognized entity related to Texas, making it irrelevant.",
    "The term \"southwest\" refers to a region that includes Texas but does not specify its location as a state.",
    "The \"gulf states\" typically refers to states that border the Gulf of Mexico, including Texas, but again does not specify Texas's location directly.",
    "Considering the direct association of Texas as a state of the United States, the correct answer must reflect that.",
    "Out of the available options, choice C explicitly states that Texas is part of the United States.",
    "None of the other options provide a definitive answer regarding where Texas is located.",
    "Thus, after analyzing all options, the most accurate answer is choice C."
