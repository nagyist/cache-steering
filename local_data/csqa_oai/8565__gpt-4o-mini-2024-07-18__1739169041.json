  "query": "Question: Where are peas likely to be freshest?\n\nChoices:\nA: farmer's market\nB: supermarket\nC: freezer\nD: microwave\nE: grocery store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the source of freshness for produce like peas. Freshness is often determined by how recently the produce was harvested.",
    "Next, a farmer's market typically features local farmers who sell products that are likely to have been harvested very recently, resulting in maximum freshness.",
    "In contrast, a supermarket may stock peas that were picked days or even weeks earlier and transported from far away, reducing their freshness.",
    "The freezer option typically presents peas that are frozen at peak freshness, but they are not fresh in the traditional sense; they are preserved.",
    "A microwave is not a place where fresh peas are found, but rather a cooking method for preparing them.",
    "Grocery stores generally offer a wider variety of products, including frozen and canned options, but their fresh produce may not be as fresh as that found in a farmer's market.",
    "Evaluate the overall quality of produce at each option; farmer's markets usually prioritize selling the freshest local produce.",
    "Given that the question is about where peas are likely to be freshest, the benefits of direct sourcing from local farmers at a farmer's market are clear.",
    "Other options like supermarkets, freezers, microwaves, and grocery stores do not match the immediate farm-to-consumer offering found at the farmer's market.",
    "Therefore, based on all the aforementioned reasoning, farmer's markets are the most likely place to find the freshest peas."
