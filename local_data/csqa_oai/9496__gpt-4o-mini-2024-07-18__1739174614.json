  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question: it asks how to find a jellyfish without coming near it, which implies using a method that allows observation from a distance.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided. The options include various methods or locations where a jellyfish might be found or followed.",
    "Look at option A: \"hand.\" This indicates a physical interaction, which contradicts the requirement to avoid coming near the jellyfish.",
    "Now evaluate option B: \"store.\" While jellyfish may be referenced in a store selling aquariums or sea life, it doesn't directly refer to finding a jellyfish in nature and has no relevance to the question's requirement.",
    "Next, consider option C: \"see.\" This means to observe jellyfish from a distance, possibly from a video or a safe vantage point, which fits the requirement of not approaching them directly.",
    "Look into option D: \"mediterranean sea.\" While jellyfish can be found there, it doesn't provide a method for finding them without approaching.",
    "Lastly, evaluate option E: \"zoo.\" Jellyfish can be seen in aquariums at some zoos, but like option D, it may not necessarily allow for observing them without coming close.",
    "Upon reviewing all options, only option C (\"see\") effectively allows for finding a jellyfish without the need to come near it."
