  "query": "Question: Other than water, sugar is the main ingredient in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: candy bar\nB: soda pop\nC: coffee\nD: tea\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the main ingredient in soda pop other than water. Typically, soda contains sugar or sweeteners as one of its primary ingredients, sometimes more than candy bars.",
    "Consider the ingredient list of a candy bar. While sugar is a significant component, candy bars also include chocolate, nuts, and other additives, meaning sugar might not be the main ingredient in comparison.",
    "Evaluate coffee. Sugar can be added to coffee for sweetness, but it is not a main ingredient; instead, coffee is primarily made of brewed coffee beans.",
    "Look at tea. Similar to coffee, sugar is sometimes added to tea, but it is not a primary ingredient in the tea itself.",
    "Assess how each option ranks in terms of sugar content. Out of the options, soda pop often has a very high sugar content, significantly affecting its composition.",
    "Consider cupboard; this option does not fit as it is not a food item and does not relate to an ingredient in the same way.",
    "From the analysis, soda pop stands out because it is designed to be sweetened with high amounts of sugar compared to the other options.",
    "Thus, among the given choices, soda pop has the most relevance to sugar being a primary ingredient after water."
