  "query": "Question: She created music to share how she felt with another, what was her goal?\n\nChoices:\nA: express emotion\nB: quiet mind\nC: beautifull\nD: boredom\nE: irritate",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that she created music with the intention of sharing her feelings with someone else. This suggests that the primary function of her music is to communicate her emotional state.",
    "When creating music, artists often aim to express their innermost thoughts and feelings. Therefore, one of the most common objectives in this context is to express emotion.",
    "The other choices do not align as closely with the purpose of creating music based on emotional sharing. For example, \"quiet mind\" implies a state of calm rather than active sharing, while \"boredom\" and \"irritate\" do not convey a constructive or emotional sharing purpose.",
    "\"Beautiful\" could relate to music, but it does not capture the dimension of emotional sharing as effectively as expressing emotion does.",
    "Thus, the most fitting choice that encapsulates her goal of music creation, which is to share her feelings with another person, would be to express those emotions."
