  "query": "Question: Hammers are made of metal and what other item?\n\nChoices:\nA: softness\nB: plastic\nC: stone\nD: wooden\nE: toolbox",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common materials used to make hammers. Hammers typically have a metal head for durability and strength.",
    "Next, observe the handle of the hammer. Many hammers also have handles made from various materials.",
    "Wood is a traditional and widely used material for hammer handles because it provides a good grip and is shock-absorbent.",
    "Plastic is also a modern alternative used for handles, especially in lighter or more specialized hammers.",
    "Now, let's evaluate whether other answers fit. Stone is generally not used to make hammers in a functional sense for most applications.",
    "Softness does not relate to material but rather describes a characteristic, so it cannot be an appropriate answer.",
    "A toolbox is an item used to store tools, but it is not a component of a hammer.",
    "Among the choices, plastic and wood stand out as suitable alternatives for a hammer's handle alongside the metal head.",
    "Comparing the two materials, wood has a historical precedent and utility in hammer construction while plastic is a more modern development.",
    "Since the question asks for \"what other item\" alongside metal, wood is the most traditional and well-known option alongside metal."
