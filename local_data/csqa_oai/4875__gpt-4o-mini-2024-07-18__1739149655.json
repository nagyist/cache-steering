  "steps": [
    "First, the question states that the snake was found in a cave north of Texas. This indicates that we should consider geographical locations that might be relevant to the state of Texas.",
    "Next, the choices include various locations, some of which are specific geographical areas (like Oklahoma), while others seem unrelated to the current context (like bedroom, basement, and ball stopped).",
    "A tropical forest is generally a warm, lush environment. While it could theoretically house snakes, it is not common for such biomes to exist in the northern part of Texas or directly north of it. Thus, this option seems less likely.",
    "The options \"bedroom\" and \"basement\" imply indoor spaces that are typically found in residential homes and don't align with the natural environment where a snake would be found in a cave.",
    "Now considering the option \"Oklahoma,\" it is a state that is directly north of Texas, implying a geographical relationship that could make it plausible for a snake to have traveled there or be found in a similar environment.",
    "Therefore, the most relevant and reasonable option that correlates with a snake's potential location based on the context provided in the question is Oklahoma, as it is a nearby state and shares ecological features that could be similar."
