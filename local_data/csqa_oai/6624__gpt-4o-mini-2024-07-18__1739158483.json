  "steps": [
    "Identify the key information in the question: Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican representative, is associated with a state that has Lincoln as its capital.",
    "Recall the capitals of the states: Lincoln is known to be the capital of Nebraska.",
    "Look at the question's options to see if Nebraska is included: The choices are A: Nebraska, B: Kansas, C: Colorado, D: Demopublican, E: Demopublican.",
    "Confirm if Jeff Fortenberry is indeed from Nebraska: As of my last knowledge update, Jeff Fortenberry was the representative for Nebraska's 1st congressional district.",
    "Consider the other options to ensure they are not correct: Kansas' capital is Topeka, and Colorado's capital is Denver. Neither of these options match with Lincoln.",
    "Eliminate the options D and E: Demopublican is not a state and does not relate to the context of the question.",
    "Conclude that the only correct answer that satisfies all criteria is Nebraska."
