  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the context of the question, which mentions a place specializing in sports equipment.",
    "The question implies that this place may have a variety of items or services related to sports, possibly beyond just sports equipment.",
    "Let's evaluate the choices provided to determine which could logically fulfill the criteria of having a shop for everything related to sports.",
    "Choice A: school - Schools typically focus on education and may have some sports equipment, but they are not specialized shops.",
    "Choice B: sears - Sears is a department store that historically sold a variety of merchandise, which may include some sports equipment, but it does not specialize only in sports.",
    "Choice C: arena - An arena is a venue for sports events and may have facilities for sports-related activities, but it is not a shop.",
    "Choice D: mall - A mall usually has multiple stores, and it is possible to have specialty shops, including sports equipment shops but does not specialize solely in sports.",
    "Choice E: grocery - A grocery store primarily sells food products and would not be considered as having a focus on sports equipment.",
    "Considering all of the choices, the one that comes closest to specializing in various types of goods or services related to sports is likely D: mall, as it can house different specialty stores, including those for sports equipment."
