  "query": "Question: A person broke up with me, what do I have now?\n\nChoices:\nA: annoyance\nB: hospitalized\nC: schizophrenia\nD: broken heart\nE: stress",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the emotional impact of a breakup. Typically, breakups can lead to a range of emotional responses.",
    "One common reaction to a breakup is experiencing sadness or grief, often referred to as having a \"broken heart.\"",
    "I also need to evaluate the other options: annoyance can arise from a breakup but isn't the primary feeling; being hospitalized is unlikely unless related to a physical issue; schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that isn't caused by a breakup; and stress can occur but is not specific to the breakup.",
    "Among the choices, \"broken heart\" most accurately describes a common feeling after a romantic relationship ends.",
    "Thus, I can eliminate options A (annoyance), B (hospitalized), C (schizophrenia), and E (stress) as they do not directly capture the essence of a breakup's emotional toll.",
    "The remaining option, D (broken heart), specifically refers to the emotional pain and sorrow associated with losing a romantic partner.",
    "Conclusively, since the question pertains to feelings resulting from a breakup, the most fitting answer is that I have a \"broken heart.\""
