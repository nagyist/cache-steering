  "query": "Question: Where are small grapes likely to be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: lunch box\nB: food store\nC: wine country\nD: kitchen\nE: raisins",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the meaning of \"small grapes.\" They often refer to specific types of grapes that can be used in various culinary contexts.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices provided to determine where small grapes are most commonly found or utilized.",
    "Choice A, \"lunch box,\" is unlikely because while grapes can be included in a lunch box, they are usually fresh and not specifically related to small grapes.",
    "Choice B, \"food store,\" is a possibility since grapes can be purchased in a food store, including small varieties.",
    "Choice C, \"wine country,\" is directly associated with grape cultivation. Small grapes can also refer to certain wine grape varieties, which would make this choice highly relevant.",
    "Choice D, \"kitchen,\" is less about where grapes are found in terms of growth or production, but more about where they might be used after being purchased.",
    "Choice E, \"raisins,\" doesn't fit because raisins are dried grapes, and this option is therefore not about where small grapes are found fresh.",
    "I reassess the strongest choice based on the association of small grapes with where they are cultivated. Wine country stands out as a specialized location for grape production.",
    "I weigh this against \"food store.\" While small grapes can indeed be found there, they are more commonly grown in wine country.",
    "Ultimately, wine country is the most logical place for small grapes and their cultivation."
