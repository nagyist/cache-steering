  "query": "Question: where do you buy a pen?\n\nChoices:\nA: briefcase\nB: classroom\nC: backpack\nD: office supply store\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what a pen is: a writing instrument typically used for putting ink on paper.",
    "Next, I assess where writing instruments like pens are commonly sold or found.",
    "Now, I evaluate the options provided: A briefcase is typically used to carry items, not to purchase them.",
    "Then, I consider a classroom; while a pen can be found there, it is not a place to buy one.",
    "Next, I look at a backpack. A backpack can carry pens, but it is also not a place to buy them.",
    "Continuing, I evaluate \u2018office supply store\u2019. This is a retail location specifically designed to sell items like pens and other stationery.",
    "I also consider the option of \u2018pocket\u2019. While a pen can certainly be carried in a pocket, it is not a place from which to purchase a pen.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only place from where you can explicitly buy a pen is the office supply store.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the best answer is D, as it directly identifies a location for purchasing pens."
