  "query": "Question: Sally didn't know morse code, but that didn't stop her from trying to use what device?\n\nChoices:\nA: walkie talkie\nB: telegram\nC: telegraph\nD: organ\nE: motor",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze what a device that could be related to Morse code might be, since the question specifies that Sally was trying to use a device without knowing Morse code.",
    "Next, I will review each of the options provided and see if they have a connection to Morse code.",
    "A walkie-talkie (choice A) is a two-way radio device that doesn't use Morse code; therefore, it is less likely to be the device she was trying to use.",
    "A telegram (choice B) is a message sent over wires but is not a device itself. It often uses Morse code but isn\u2019t something you \u201cuse\u201d directly.",
    "A telegraph (choice C) is a device that operates using Morse code to communicate messages over distances by transmitting electrical signals.",
    "Given that Morse code is essential to the function of the telegraph, it is ironic that Sally would attempt to use it without knowing the code, which supports the idea that the telegraph is the device in question.",
    "An organ (choice D) is a musical instrument and has no relation to Morse code, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "A motor (choice E) is a mechanical device that converts energy into movement, with no connection to Morse code, so it is also not a suitable answer.",
    "Considering all the information and my reasoning, the most logical choice related to using Morse code is the telegraph."
