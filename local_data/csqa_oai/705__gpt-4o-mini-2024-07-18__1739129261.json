  "query": "Question: Stopping being married to one another was a costly task, the lawyers and their what were astronomical?\n\nChoices:\nA: free time\nB: pleasure\nC: get divorced\nD: legal fees\nE: being lonely",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that there were significant costs associated with stopping being married, which suggests a financial aspect related to the legal process.",
    "The phrase \"the lawyers and their what were astronomical\" implies that the second part must also relate to the costs incurred during the divorce process.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"free time\" (A), \"pleasure\" (B), and \"being lonely\" (E) do not relate to financial costs or legal processes.",
    "Option C, \"get divorced,\" does not fit grammatically as it does not parallel with \"lawyers.\"",
    "The choice \"legal fees\" (D) matches the context, as it directly refers to the costs associated with hiring lawyers and the legal process of divorce.",
    "Given that legal fees are a major financial implication when ending a marriage, this option directly correlates with the astronomical expenses mentioned in the sentence."
