  "steps": [
    "Washing hands is a common practice for maintaining cleanliness and preventing the spread of germs and infections.",
    "The question asks about the benefit of maintaining the habit of washing hands after certain activities.",
    "One of the primary benefits of washing hands regularly is the prevention of illness, which relates directly to one's overall health.",
    "Let's analyze the answer choices: \n- A: health - this directly relates to the prevention of illness.\n- B: skin irritation - this is not a benefit of washing hands and could even be a consequence if hands are not dried properly.\n- C: park - this does not relate to the benefits of washing hands.\n- D: become wet - this is an outcome of washing hands but does not reflect a health benefit.\n- E: dry skin - while washing hands can lead to dry skin if done excessively, it is not a goal or benefit of handwashing.",
    "Since the question and choices focus on benefits, \"health\" being the only positive outcome directly tied to washing hands makes it the most logical choice."
