  "query": "Question: Sam didn't have to walk far to get lunch.  There was a deli on the ground floor of his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: shopping center\nC: strip mall\nD: office building\nE: new york city",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sam didn't have to walk far to get lunch, indicating that the deli is conveniently located.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided for locations where a deli might be situated.",
    "Choice A: \"town\" is too broad and does not specify a particular structure where a deli would regularly operate.",
    "Choice B: \"shopping center\" is a plausible option because such centers often have food establishments.",
    "Choice C: \"strip mall\" is similar to a shopping center and often hosts various small businesses including delis.",
    "Choice D: \"office building\" is also a viable option; many office buildings have delis or caf\u00e9s on the ground floor for convenience.",
    "Choice E: \"new york city\" is again too broad and does not identify a specific location.",
    "Now, we need to consider the most likely environment for a deli to be right on the ground floor.",
    "A deli on the ground floor would most likely serve immediate foot traffic, which is common in office buildings or strip malls.",
    "While \"shopping center\" and \"strip mall\" are reasonable, office buildings often have eateries, making D a strong candidate.",
    "To summarize, both strip malls and office buildings are likely candidates, but office buildings are known for having delis that serve the workforce within."
