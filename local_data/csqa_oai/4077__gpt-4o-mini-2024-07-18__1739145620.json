  "query": "Question: What meal do we often have corn on the cob with?\n\nChoices:\nA: breakfast\nB: supermarket\nC: shop\nD: country\nE: dinner",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what corn on the cob typically accompanies. It's commonly served as a side dish in various meals.",
    "Next, corn on the cob is widely eaten during summer barbecues and outdoor gatherings, which are often linked to dinner or lunch meals.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the options presented. Breakfast usually consists of lighter foods, while corn on the cob is not typically associated with this meal.",
    "The choice \"supermarket\" refers to a place rather than a meal, so it cannot be correct.",
    "Similarly, \"shop\" does not correlate with a meal; it indicates a place of commerce.",
    "\"Country\" also does not represent a meal but rather a geographical context.",
    "Since corn on the cob is commonly paired with cooked meats and salads, it is most frequently served during dinner time or at picnics.",
    "Thus, among the choices, \"dinner\" makes the most sense as it fits well with the context of eating corn on the cob.",
    "To finalize, the only meal contextually appropriate with corn on the cob from the given options is dinner."
