  "query": "Question: Sam lives in a ranch house, which is a bit of a sterotype where he lives.  Everyone from out of state thinks he's a cowboy.  Where might he live?\n\nChoices:\nA: west\nB: california\nC: hawaii\nD: texas\nE: montana",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"ranch house\" suggests a style of home commonly associated with the American West. This gives a clue about the geographical area Sam may live in.",
    "The fact that others think Sam is a cowboy reinforces the stereotype often linked with cowboy culture, which is prevalent in the western United States.",
    "Texas is famously known as the home of cowboys and has a strong ranching culture, making it a likely candidate for where Sam might live.",
    "While options like Montana and California also have cowboy imagery and ranches, Texas is often the most closely associated state with the cowboy stereotype due to its historical significance and popular culture.",
    "Considering the options, it is also important to note the reputation of other states. California is more known for its beaches and urban areas rather than the cowboy lifestyle.",
    "Hawaii does not fit the stereotype of a ranching or cowboy lifestyle, making it an unlikely candidate.",
    "Thus, the strongest connection remains with Texas, as it embodies both the ranch house style and the cowboy image that outsiders associate with Sam.",
    "Since we need to finalize a single option that correlates best with the clues given, reevaluating the possibilities confirms that Texas stands out."
