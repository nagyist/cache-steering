  "query": "Question: Where would you find people who work with a round brush?\n\nChoices:\nA: art supplies\nB: ladies bathroom\nC: shower\nD: hair salon\nE: make person sick",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what a \"round brush\" is typically used for. Round brushes are commonly associated with styling hair.",
    "Next, I consider the context in which people would use a round brush. It is most often used for blow-drying and styling hair.",
    "I will analyze the provided choices to find the most logical location for someone using a round brush.",
    "Choice A, \"art supplies,\" is not relevant because round brushes used for artwork typically refer to a different kind of round brush (a paintbrush) than what is used for hair styling.",
    "Choice B, \"ladies bathroom,\" is not appropriate as it is a personal space with no direct connection to the use of round brushes.",
    "Choice C, \"shower,\" is not a location where people would generally use a round brush as it is typically dry styling that requires a round brush, not in a wet environment.",
    "Choice D, \"hair salon,\" aligns perfectly as it is a professional setting specifically designed for hair styling, where round brushes are commonly used by hairstylists.",
    "Choice E, \"make person sick,\" does not relate to the use of a round brush in any context.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most appropriate choice for where one would find people who work with a round brush is D: hair salon."
