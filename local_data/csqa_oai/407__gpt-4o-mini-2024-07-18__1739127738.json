  "query": "Question: Sam was against Allison's decision.  Joe was the opposite.  What was Joe, regarding that decision?\n\nChoices:\nA: being for\nB: away from\nC: combined\nD: for or\nE: conjunction",
  "steps": [
    "The statement establishes that Sam is against Allison's decision, indicating his opposition to it.",
    "Joe is described as being the opposite of Sam in relation to Allison's decision.",
    "If Sam is against the decision, and Joe is the opposite of Sam, Joe must be in favor of the decision.",
    "To be \"for\" a decision means to support it or agree with it, which is what Joe's stance implies.",
    "The multiple-choice options offer different terms that can be associated with Joe's position about the decision.",
    "Option A, \"being for,\" aligns with Joe's supportive stance because he is the opposite of Sam, who is against it.",
    "Analyzing the other option \"B: away from,\" this does not convey Joe's support for the decision.",
    "Option C, \"combined,\" does not apply since it does not reflect either support or opposition.",
    "Option D, \"for or,\" is incomplete and does not properly express Joe's position as supportive.",
    "Lastly, option E, \"conjunction,\" does not relate to Joe's stance either, as it denotes a grammatical term rather than a position on a decision."
