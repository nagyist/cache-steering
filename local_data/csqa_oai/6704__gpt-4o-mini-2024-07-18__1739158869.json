  "query": "Question: All energy on earth comes from the sun.  It arrives in what form?\n\nChoices:\nA: light\nB: lightning\nC: life on earth\nD: sun tan\nE: heat",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct answer, I need to analyze how energy from the sun reaches the Earth.",
    "The primary way that energy from the sun reaches Earth is through radiation, which is mainly in the form of electromagnetic waves.",
    "Among these electromagnetic waves, the most significant component for powering processes on Earth is visible light.",
    "In addition to visible light, sunlight also includes infrared radiation, which is perceived as heat.",
    "Considering the options given, both light and heat are valid forms of energy that come from the sun.",
    "However, the question specifies how energy arrives; therefore, the form that most directly describes how solar energy reaches Earth includes visible light.",
    "While items like \"life on earth\" and \"sun tan\" are effects of the energy from the sun, they are not the direct form in which it arrives.",
    "Lightning (option B) is unrelated to solar energy arrival, as it is a product of atmospheric phenomena.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the most appropriate answer among the choices for how energy from the sun arrives on Earth is light."
