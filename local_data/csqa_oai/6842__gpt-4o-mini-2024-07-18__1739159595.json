  "query": "Question: What do we call a garden that is found in public?\n\nChoices:\nA: fence\nB: back yard\nC: ground\nD: pretty\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a specific term that describes a type of garden located in a public space.",
    "First, I consider the options given: fence, back yard, ground, pretty, and park.",
    "A \"fence\" is a structure used to enclose an area, not a type of garden.",
    "A \"back yard\" refers to a garden or outdoor space at the rear of a private residence, which is not public.",
    "The term \"ground\" is too vague and does not specifically refer to a garden setting.",
    "The word \"pretty\" describes an aesthetic quality but does not define a type of garden.",
    "The option \"park\" refers to a public space that often includes gardens or landscaping where people can enjoy nature and recreation.",
    "Considering all the options, the only term that matches the description of a garden found in public is \"park.\""
