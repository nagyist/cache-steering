  "query": "Question: What kind of box does a fish live in?\n\nChoices:\nA: aquarium\nB: ocean\nC: pond\nD: bay\nE: river",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the kind of box a fish lives in, which suggests a contained space for the fish.",
    "Aquariums are specifically designed to hold fish and create a controlled environment for them, fitting the idea of a \"box.\"",
    "Oceans, ponds, bays, and rivers are all natural bodies of water; they do not refer to a contained space or \"box\" in the same sense as an aquarium.",
    "While all these natural bodies of water can host fish, they lack the defined enclosed structure that an aquarium provides.",
    "The term \"box\" implies something artificial and contained, which aligns with what an aquarium represents.",
    "Other options like pond, bay, and river are also aquatic environments but do not resemble a box.",
    "Even though fishes can inhabit ponds, bays, and rivers, the question's wording leans towards a specific, static enclosure rather than a vast, natural habitat.",
    "Thus, based on the definition and characteristics of what constitutes a 'box,' the best answer remains the aquarium."
