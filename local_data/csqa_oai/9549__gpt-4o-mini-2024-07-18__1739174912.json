  "steps": [
    "We are looking for a location where a person might be standing next to a net.",
    "The term \"net\" is commonly associated with both fishing and sports.",
    "In the context of sports, a net would typically refer to a soccer net, basketball net, or similar.",
    "In the context of fishing, a net would refer to fishing gear used to catch fish.",
    "Option A mentions the ocean, which is a place where fishing nets may be found, but it does not specify a person.",
    "Option B refers to a soccer game, where a person could stand next to a soccer net.",
    "Option C refers to fishing gear, where nets are indeed often included; however, it does not specify a person standing next to a net.",
    "Options D and E both refer to boats (fisherman's boat and fishing boat); typically, people would also use nets on these boats, but again, it does not explicitly state standing next to a net.",
    "Out of the options, option B is the only one that clearly describes a scenario where a person would be standing next to a net (a soccer net).",
    "Thus, the best answer that fits the criteria of a person standing next to a net is option B, referring to a soccer game."
