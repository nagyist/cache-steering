  "query": "Question: What do you feel for a someone when you comfort friend?\n\nChoices:\nA: care\nB: hand shake\nC: money\nD: feeling bad\nE: hug",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the emotions or actions involved when comforting a friend.",
    "When someone is comforting a friend, they typically express care and support.",
    "Option A \"care\" aligns with the emotional support that is intrinsic to comforting someone.",
    "Option B \"hand shake\" is an action, but it does not convey comfort in the emotional sense.",
    "Option C \"money\" does not relate to the emotional or supportive actions typically associated with comforting.",
    "Option D \"feeling bad\" does not accurately capture what one feels when comforting a friend; it instead describes a negative emotion.",
    "Option E \"hug\" is a common physical action of comfort but may not encompass the full emotional aspect implied in the question.",
    "Both \"care\" and \"hug\" are valid, but the initial feeling or intent when comforting a friend is more about showing care.",
    "Since the question asks what you feel, rather than what you do, \"care\" more directly expresses the emotional aspect."
