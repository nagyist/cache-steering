  "query": "Question: Grapes are often grown in what sort of location in order to produce a beverage that impairs the senses when inbibed?\n\nChoices:\nA: rows\nB: bowl of fruit\nC: winery\nD: painting\nE: fruit stand",
  "steps": [
    "Grapes are a key ingredient in the production of wine, which is a beverage that can impair the senses when consumed.",
    "To produce wine, grapes need to be harvested and processed, which typically occurs in a specific type of facility.",
    "A winery is a facility dedicated to the processing, aging, and fermentation of grapes into wine.",
    "The term \"winery\" directly relates to the production of wine, where the grapes are grown, harvested, and transformed into an alcoholic beverage.",
    "Examining the other options: \n- \"rows\" (Option A) refers to a way of planting, not specifically related to the location for beverage production.\n- \"bowl of fruit\" (Option B) refers to a serving context, not a production context.\n- \"painting\" (Option D) has no relevance to grape or wine production.\n- \"fruit stand\" (Option E) is for selling fruit, not for processing grapes into beverages.",
    "The only choice that matches the description of a location where grapes are grown specifically for making a beverage that impairs the senses is a winery."
