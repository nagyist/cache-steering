  "steps": [
    "The question asks what John and Betty did when they were alone together and is based on the context of being in love.",
    "When people are in love and find themselves alone, common romantic activities often include physical affection and expressions of love.",
    "Among the choices given, kissing and dancing are traditional romantic gestures, while proposing is more specific and less likely to occur in the context described.",
    "Singing could be an activity that couples might engage in together, but it does not directly reflect the romantic aspect implied by being in love.",
    "Living life is a vague answer that does not specify any particular activity and does not relate directly to a romantic context.",
    "Considering the traditional romantic behaviors associated with couples in love, kissing stands out as a direct expression of affection.",
    "Dancing, while romantic, is usually accompanied by music and may not be the primary action taken when alone together.",
    "Proposing seems too formal for a general context and would likely not be a casual action when alone; it's not something that happens often without a specific intent.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting activity that couples typically engage in when they are alone together, reflecting their affection and romance, is to kiss."
