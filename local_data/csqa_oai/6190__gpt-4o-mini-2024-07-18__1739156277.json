  "query": "Question: Where can I find a bowl of whipped cream?\n\nChoices:\nA: store\nB: restaurant\nC: cupboard\nD: refrigerator\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify possible locations where I might find a bowl of whipped cream.",
    "Whipped cream is a common topping for desserts and beverages, so it is likely to be found in locations where food is prepared or served.",
    "I can consider the option of a store; they might sell whipped cream, but it\u2019s unlikely to be in a bowl there.",
    "Next, I think about restaurants; they often have whipped cream available as a topping but usually don't serve it in a bowl.",
    "The cupboard could be a possible location if someone has stored prepared whipped cream there, but it typically wouldn\u2019t be a bowl.",
    "The refrigerator is a likely place for prepared whipped cream because people usually keep it there to maintain its freshness.",
    "An apartment might contain a refrigerator and cupboard, but it's not a specific place for finding whipped cream as prepared.",
    "I reassess the refrigerator because it's common for whipped cream to be stored there.",
    "Comparing options, the refrigerator stands out as the most logical answer given that it stores ready-to-use whipped cream.",
    "Thus, out of all the options, I conclude that the refrigerator is the most appropriate place to find a bowl of whipped cream."
