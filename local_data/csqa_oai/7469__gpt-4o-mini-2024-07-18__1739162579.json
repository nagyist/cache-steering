  "query": "Question: His therapist said he had to get out there and begin socialising, it was the only was to start what?\n\nChoices:\nA: conflicts\nB: having fun\nC: jealousy\nD: getting out there\nE: friendships",
  "steps": [
    "The therapist's advice suggests that socializing is a means to an end, implying that there is a specific goal or outcome desired from engaging with others.",
    "The use of \"begin socialising\" indicates the need for interaction and connection with other individuals, which is likely related to positive social outcomes.",
    "Looking at the options, we need to consider what type of outcome socializing typically aims to achieve.",
    "Option A, \"conflicts,\" doesn\u2019t seem like a positive goal to achieve through socializing.",
    "Option B, \"having fun,\" could be a possible outcome of socializing but doesn't directly represent a structured outcome, which is commonly presented by therapists.",
    "Option C, \"jealousy,\" is not a constructive outcome that one would aim for through social interactions.",
    "Option D, \"getting out there,\" is simply a repetition of the directive to socialise and does not represent an end goal.",
    "Option E, \"friendships,\" is a likely outcome of successfully socializing. Building friendships typically requires interaction and is a fundamental purpose of socialization.",
    "Given the context of a therapist\u2019s advice focusing on socializing to achieve a positive relational outcome, \u201cfriendships\u201d aligns well as the most likely objective."
