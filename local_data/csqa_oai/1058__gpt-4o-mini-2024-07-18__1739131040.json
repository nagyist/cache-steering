  "query": "Question: Eating breakfast of garlic might lead to some what?\n\nChoices:\nA: tasty\nB: bad breath\nC: dirty dishes\nD: better day\nE: gain energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common effects of eating garlic. Garlic has a strong flavor and is known for its health benefits.",
    "Next, think about the side effects associated with consuming garlic, particularly in the morning when the stomach is empty. One well-known side effect is bad breath due to the strong odor compounds found in garlic, such as allicin.",
    "Now, analyze the other options. While garlic could make a meal tasty (option A), the potential for bad breath is more directly tied to garlic consumption.",
    "Review option C (dirty dishes). Eating garlic does not inherently lead to dirty dishes; it's about how the food is prepared.",
    "Examine option D (better day). While garlic may have some health benefits, it doesn't directly correlate with having a better day, especially if one suffers from bad breath afterward.",
    "Look at option E (gain energy). While garlic might have health benefits that could positively impact energy levels, it is not the most immediate or direct effect of eating garlic.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most significant and immediate consequence of consuming garlic, especially in a breakfast scenario, is the potential for bad breath."
