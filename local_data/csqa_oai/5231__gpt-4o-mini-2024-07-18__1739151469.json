  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a lawyer is looking for. A lawyer is typically searching for legal rules, regulations, and statutes that govern the practice of law.",
    "Next, we evaluate the choices given. A: football game is unrelated to legal rules and would not provide guidance to a lawyer.",
    "B: hunger games also seems irrelevant, as it is a fictional concept and does not pertain to legal rules in any context.",
    "C: family situation is not a source of legal rules. While family law is a topic a lawyer might deal with, it is not a source for finding governing rules.",
    "D: text book could imply a law textbook, but it is still a broad category and could pertain to many subjects outside of law.",
    "E: lawbook specifically refers to books that contain legal statutes, rules, and regulations. This is the most direct source of governing rules for a lawyer.",
    "By narrowing down the options, it\u2019s clear that E: lawbook is the most appropriate answer, as it directly aligns with what a lawyer would need to refer to for legal guidance."
