  "query": "Question: Where does a person usually plant a rosebush?\n\nChoices:\nA: ballpark\nB: flower bed\nC: park\nD: backyard\nE: outdoors",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a typical location where one would plant a rosebush.",
    "One must consider common gardening areas where flowers, including rosebushes, are usually cultivated.",
    "A \"ballpark\" is primarily a sports venue and not suitable for planting roses.",
    "A \"flower bed\" is specifically designed for planting flowers and is a very common location for rosebushes.",
    "A \"park\" can contain rosebushes, but it is not a specific location an individual would choose for their own rosebush.",
    "A \"backyard\" is also a common place for planting flowers, including rosebushes, particularly for homeowners.",
    "\"Outdoors\" is too broad and general. It encompasses all the previous options but doesn\u2019t specify a typical planting location.",
    "Comparing \"flower bed\" and \"backyard,\" the flower bed is specifically meant for flowers, while the backyard is more general and could refer to a larger area.",
    "Since the question asks for the most typical location, it seems that the \"flower bed\" is the most specific and accurate answer."
