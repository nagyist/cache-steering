  "steps": [
    "If I poke myself with a sharp knitting needle, it typically causes pain and injury to the skin.",
    "When the skin is punctured by a sharp object, it may damage blood vessels.",
    "Damage to blood vessels often leads to blood escaping from the body, which is medically referred to as bleeding.",
    "The other options (A: have fun, B: relaxation, D: cooking, E: carpal tunnel syndrome) do not logically follow from the act of poking oneself with a knitting needle.",
    "The act of poking oneself with a needle is not associated with having fun, relaxing, or cooking; these options do not relate to the consequences of injury.",
    "Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition related to repetitive wrist movements and is not directly induced by a single incident of poking with a needle.",
    "Therefore, the most immediate and logical outcome of this action, considering the nature of the injury, is bleeding."
