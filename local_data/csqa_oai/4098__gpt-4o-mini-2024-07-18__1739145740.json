  "steps": [
    "To determine where glue will stay usable, I need to consider factors that affect the usability of glue, such as exposure to air, temperature, and environmental conditions.",
    "Glue typically dries out or becomes less usable when exposed to air because it can harden as it dries. Therefore, containers that limit air exposure are preferable.",
    "A closed container will help keep glue usable by minimizing air exposure, which is likely the best option for preserving the glue's effectiveness.",
    "An art room may contain glue, but it is not necessarily a suitable environment for keeping it usable since it may not be designed to limit exposure to air.",
    "Being described as \"sticky\" (option C) does not imply usability; it only describes the current state of the glue.",
    "A desk drawer could potentially keep glue usable if it is kept closed; however, it may not provide additional protection against drying out as effectively as a closed container.",
    "A cabinet may provide more protection for glue than a desk drawer, but it may still not be as effective as a specifically designed closed container for adhesives.",
    "Considering all the options, a closed container (option A) is the best choice for ensuring glue remains usable."
