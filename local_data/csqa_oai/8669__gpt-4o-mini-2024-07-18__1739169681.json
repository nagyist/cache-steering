  "steps": [
    "The question asks what gathering of loved ones occurs after a person's final birthday.",
    "Typically, a \"final birthday\" implies that the person is no longer alive, as they have reached the end of their life.",
    "Various events can occur following a person's passing, and family and friends often come together during these times.",
    "A burial is the act of interring the body, but it is not usually characterized as a gathering of loved ones.",
    "A funeral, on the other hand, is a ceremony associated with honoring and remembering the deceased, during which loved ones gather.",
    "The other options, such as \"new age,\" \"die,\" and \"happy,\" do not describe gatherings of loved ones.",
    "Thus, among the choices provided, the event that most directly corresponds to a gathering of loved ones after a final birthday is a funeral."
