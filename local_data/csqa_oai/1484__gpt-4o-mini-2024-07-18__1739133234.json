  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the significance of adding \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" after answering questions.",
    "Using \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" typically signifies respect or deference toward the person being addressed.",
    "The context suggests that the use of these terms is intended to show courtesy.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices one by one:\n- A: irritation - This does not align with the respectful tone.\n- B: correct - While the answer might be correct, it does not relate to the address form used.\n- C: responding - This is a neutral term and does not capture the essence of politeness.\n- D: polite - This directly reflects the respectful nature of using \"sir\" or \"ma'am.\"\n- E: sadness - This is unrelated to the context of respectful address.",
    "Among the options, D (polite) directly indicates the behavior being described in the question.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer to complete the statement is D (polite)."
