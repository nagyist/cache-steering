  "query": "Question: Joe found a man sleeping in a cardboard box that was used to transport boxes of shoes.  Where is the box most likely located?\n\nChoices:\nA: trash\nB: shoe store\nC: moviehall\nD: back alley\nE: storage area",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a cardboard box that has been used for transporting shoes. This indicates that the box is likely associated with a place that sells or distributes shoes.",
    "A shoe store seems like a plausible location where such a cardboard box would be found, considering it's directly related to the items being transported. However, it is less likely that someone would be sleeping in front of a shoe store compared to other locations.",
    "The options include trash, which suggests a place where unwanted items are disposed of. This is a possible location but does not relate directly to the shoe box being used for transport.",
    "The option of a movie hall is also unlikely as it is not a place associated with shoe transport or storage.",
    "A back alley is a potential place where someone might find a cardboard box and where the person might choose to sleep. Back alleys often have discarded items including boxes from various sources, making it plausible.",
    "The storage area could also be a candidate, as it may house boxes, including those used for transporting shoes. However, typically, sleeping in a storage area is not common practice for someone seeking a place to rest outside of a business context.",
    "Comparing all options, the back alley stands out as the most compatible and realistic location considering the circumstances\u2014a sleeping person often finds such areas for shelter.",
    "It is unlikely that Joe would encounter someone sleeping inside a business environment like a shoe store or storage area. Trash does not align with the context of someone seeking shelter.",
    "The back alley seems to tie together the notion of someone homeless or in need of a temporary resting place, correlating with the presence of an empty box typically found in such locations."
