    "The American Civil War was primarily fought from 1861 to 1865.",
    "One of the main issues leading to the Civil War was the institution of slavery.",
    "The conflict arose between the Northern states, which were opposed to slavery, and the Southern states, which wanted to maintain it.",
    "President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, declaring the freedom of all enslaved people in Confederate-held territory.",
    "This proclamation transformed the war into a fight not only for the Union but also for the freedom of enslaved individuals.",
    "The war's conclusion in 1865 ultimately led to the abolition of slavery in the United States.",
    "Evaluating the answer choices, only one option directly relates to the main cause of the Civil War.",
    "\"A\" does not apply, as the civil war was not about prisoners; \"B\" speaks to independence but is not the primary issue; \"C\" and \"D\" do not correlate meaningfully to the context of the war.",
    "\"E\" directly addresses the issue of slavery, making it the correct choice."
