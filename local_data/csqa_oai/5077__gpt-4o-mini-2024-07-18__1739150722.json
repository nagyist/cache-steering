  "query": "Question: Where do you see signs that state a point of view?\n\nChoices:\nA: freeway\nB: demonstration\nC: state park\nD: store\nE: corner of two streets",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify locations where signs can express viewpoints or opinions.",
    "A freeway primarily displays traffic signs and regulations, which do not express a point of view.",
    "Demonstrations typically involve people conveying their views, and signs are often used for this purpose to express opinions or messages.",
    "A state park usually has informational signs about nature, rules, or safety, but not necessarily signs stating a point of view.",
    "Stores may have signs related to promotions or policies, but these are not typically expressions of a point of view either.",
    "The corner of two streets can feature signs such as stop signs or street names, which are also not expressions of a point of view.",
    "Evaluating the choices, the only place where signs explicitly express viewpoints is during demonstrations, where people hold signs to communicate their beliefs.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most valid answer aligns with signs that state a point of view being associated with demonstrations."
