  "query": "Question: Where can you eat fruit on a red bridge?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: engineering school\nC: san francisco\nD: tree\nE: market",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where you can eat fruit on a red bridge, I need to consider locations that are known for red bridges and also places where eating fruit might be feasible.",
    "One of the most famous red bridges in the world is the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. It's plausible for someone to eat fruit while on or near this bridge.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll analyze the other choices to see if they make sense regarding eating fruit on a red bridge.",
    "A refrigerator is an appliance where food is stored. While fruit might be kept there, it doesn\u2019t relate to eating on a red bridge.",
    "An engineering school may have red architectural features, but it\u2019s unlikely a red bridge associated with eating fruit would be found there.",
    "A tree can provide fruit, but it doesn\u2019t constitute a \"red bridge\" or a location to \"eat\" fruit specifically.",
    "A market is a place you can buy fruit, but again, it doesn't pertain to eating fruit on a red bridge.",
    "Based on the reasoning, San Francisco is the only answer that relates directly to both a red bridge (Golden Gate Bridge) and the act of eating fruit."
