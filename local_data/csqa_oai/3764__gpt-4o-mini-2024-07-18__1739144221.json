  "steps": [
    "We need to identify where bald eagles are commonly found in large numbers.",
    "Bald eagles are known to be found near water sources where they can hunt for fish, their primary food source.",
    "Eagle nests can house a breeding pair of eagles and their young, but they usually do not indicate large numbers of eagles in a single place.",
    "The term \"aerie\" refers specifically to a large nest of an eagle, which again suggests a single breeding location rather than a large number.",
    "While parks and protected areas can support various wildlife, including bald eagles, they, too, may not guarantee more than a few eagles at any one time.",
    "Washington State is widely known for its strong population of bald eagles, notably in specific regions, particularly around bodies of water.",
    "Western North America is a habitat region for bald eagles, with many states and areas in that region supporting substantial populations.",
    "Among the options, \"in Washington\" (B) and \"Western North America\" (E) both suggest locations where larger populations are possible.",
    "However, \"Western North America\" encompasses a broader geographic area than just Washington, likely leading to more than a few eagles.",
    "Since the question asks for a place where you could find more than a few bald eagles, \"Western North America\" (E) is the best and broadest choice."
