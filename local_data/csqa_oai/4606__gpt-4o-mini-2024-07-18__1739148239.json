  "query": "Question: Where would you put a marker if you plan to use it soon at the same location?\n\nChoices:\nA: child's backpack\nB: desk\nC: pocket\nD: office supply store\nE: briefcase",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider where I would typically keep a marker if I plan to use it soon. The location should be easily accessible.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices provided. A child's backpack might not be the best choice if I need the marker immediately, as it may not be within reach.",
    "Then I consider a desk. A desk is often associated with work or a study area, where I might need to write or draw, making it a viable option for quick access.",
    "I also examine the possibility of keeping the marker in my pocket. This offers immediate access but it may not be practical to carry a marker in a pocket regularly.",
    "The option of an office supply store would not be appropriate because it implies I would still need to go get the marker, which defeats the purpose of wanting it soon at the same location.",
    "Lastly, I look at the briefcase choice. While it could store the marker, it may not be as easily accessible compared to a desk.",
    "After analyzing all options, I conclude that keeping the marker on a desk provides the most convenient access for immediate use."
