  "query": "Question: What is helping likely to make someone have?\n\nChoices:\nA: enjoyment\nB: better world\nC: good feelings\nD: contentment\nE: feel good about yourself",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general concept of helping others. Helping is typically associated with positive outcomes, both for the helper and the recipient.",
    "Next, think about the immediate emotional responses that helping might inspire in a person. This could include happiness, satisfaction, or positive feelings.",
    "Now, look closely at the choices provided. Option A (enjoyment) implies a state of pleasure, which could be relevant but isn't the strongest direct association with helping.",
    "Option B (better world) reflects a broader social impact of helping rather than a personal feeling, so it is less focused on individual emotional outcomes.",
    "Option C (good feelings) directly relates to the emotional response most people experience after helping someone, suggesting a general state that encompasses several positive emotions.",
    "Next, assess option D (contentment). While contentment is a positive feeling, it may not cover the full spectrum of emotions that might arise from helping someone.",
    "Now, consider option E (feel good about yourself). This is a strong personal emotional response that many experience after helping, but it might not encompass as broad a range of emotions as option C.",
    "Weigh the emotional resonance of all provided options. \"Good feelings\" (C) is an inclusive phrase that can represent a range of positive emotions arising from helping.",
    "Conclude that while both \"feel good about yourself\" and \"good feelings\" apply, \"good feelings\" potentially captures a wider array of emotional responses, making it a more comprehensive choice."
