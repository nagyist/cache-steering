  "query": "Question: I was invited to a party but I'm not a social person, so I decided to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: meeting\nB: stay home\nC: medium\nD: blowing off steam\nE: studying",
  "steps": [
    "The first thing to consider is the context: the individual is not a social person and has received an invitation to a party.",
    "Since the individual identifies as not being social, they are likely uncomfortable in social situations such as parties.",
    "The phrasing \"decided to do what\" suggests that they made a choice to avoid the party.",
    "Among the choices provided, an option that indicates avoiding social situations would align with the individual's nature.",
    "The choice \"stay home\" directly implies choosing not to attend the party, which fits the scenario well.",
    "On the other hand, options like \"meeting,\" \"medium,\" and \"studying\" do not convey the decision to avoid social interaction.",
    "\"D blowing off steam\" generally implies engaging in activities to release stress, which might involve social interactions rather than avoiding them.",
    "Therefore, the most logical choice considering the individual\u2019s character and decision-making process would be to stay home."
