  "query": "Question: What can an injury cause that is messy?\n\nChoices:\nA: cause bleeding\nB: become infected\nC: distress\nD: cause death\nE: hurts",
  "steps": [
    "An injury can lead to various physical manifestations or consequences.",
    "One common outcome of an injury is bleeding, which can indeed be messy.",
    "Infections can also occur as a result of an injury, which may cause further complications and can be messy in a different sense (drainage, pus, etc.).",
    "Distress refers to emotional suffering rather than a physical aspect, although it can be a response to an injury.",
    "In extreme cases, injuries may lead to death, which is a serious consequence but not typically described as \"messy\" in the same sense as bleeding or infection.",
    "Pain from an injury (represented in choice E) is a subjective experience and does not have a physical messiness associated with it.",
    "Bleeding stands out as the most directly messy consequence of an injury due to the visible and often uncontrollable nature of blood loss.",
    "Therefore, in considering the phrase \"messy,\" bleeding is the clearest and most relevant answer."
