    "The question describes a scenario where a couple is considering the end of their marriage and indicates that this seems to be the best option for them.",
    "The use of the phrase \"stopping being married\" implies a formal cessation of the marital relationship rather than casual or emotional alternatives.",
    "Among the choices provided, an action that aligns with the formal cessation of marriage would be 'get divorced' (Choice C).",
    "The other choices such as 'being lonely,' 'argue,' 'legal fees,' and 'pleasure' do not represent an action that directly aligns with the decision to end a marriage.",
    "'Being lonely' (Choice A) would be a potential outcome rather than a decision.",
    "'Argue' (Choice B) implies conflict but does not indicate a resolution or action taken regarding the marriage.",
    "'Legal fees' (Choice D) could be a consequence of getting divorced but does not signify the act of ending the marriage itself.",
    "'Pleasure' (Choice E) is not relevant to the context of ending a marital relationship.",
    "Given this analysis, the most logical action taken by the couple who decided that stopping their marriage was best is to 'get divorced.'"
