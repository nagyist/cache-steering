  "query": "Question: Where might an American weasel live?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: chicken coop\nC: great britain\nD: hen house\nE: in deep sea",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the natural habitat of an American weasel. American weasels, or Mustela frenata, are typically found in a variety of environments across North America.",
    "Next, I consider the geographic location of the options provided. Option A (Michigan) is within North America, where American weasels are commonly found.",
    "Then, I analyze option B (chicken coop). While American weasels might enter a chicken coop to hunt, it's not a natural habitat for them.",
    "For option C (Great Britain), it is important to note that the American weasel is native to North America and is not found in Great Britain.",
    "Next, I assess option D (hen house). Similar to the chicken coop, this may be a place an American weasel might invade for food, but it is not a natural habitat.",
    "Lastly, considering option E (in deep sea), weasels are terrestrial animals and do not inhabit aquatic environments, especially deep sea habitats.",
    "After reviewing these options, the only plausible natural habitat where an American weasel is likely to live is Michigan (option A)."
