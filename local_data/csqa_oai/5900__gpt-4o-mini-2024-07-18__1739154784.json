  "query": "Question: Bobby was looking to be farmland because he wanted to get away from the city. He didn't care where, just so long as it was in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: illinois\nB: countryside\nC: south dakota\nD: michigan\nE: midwest",
  "steps": [
    "Bobby wants to escape the city, which implies he is looking for an area that is less urban and more rural or open in nature.",
    "The term \"farmland\" suggests that Bobby is seeking a place that is primarily agricultural, which is typically found in more rural areas rather than urban settings.",
    "Among the choices, \"countryside\" is a general term that describes rural areas, often characterized by open space and farmland.",
    "The other options (Illinois, South Dakota, Michigan, and Midwest) specify geographic locations, but they do not directly indicate a preference for a rural environment.",
    "The question states that he doesn't care where, so the most appropriate choice aligns with his desire to be in a non-urban environment, which is best represented by \"countryside.\"",
    "Both \"midwest\" and \"countryside\" can relate to rural areas, but \"countryside\" specifically alludes to the type of environment he desires.",
    "Since the question directly asks where Bobby wanted to be, and he expressed the sentiment of wanting to escape the city for a rural lifestyle, \"countryside\" is the best fit.",
    "Analyzing all choices indicates that \"countryside\" perfectly matches Bobby's objective.",
    "Therefore, after examining all considerations, the correct answer is reflected in choice B."
