    "The question mentions a graphic designer who works with digital tiles. This suggests that the work involves creating images or layouts using small pieces of graphics, similar to traditional tile work.",
    "The term \"maps\" usually refers to representations of geographic areas or layouts of spaces. Given the context of tiles, this could imply a visual or artistic representation rather than a physical surface.",
    "Considering the choices provided, \"floor\" (A) and \"roof\" (E) refer mainly to physical structures, which do not fit as well with the idea of maps in the context of graphic design.",
    "\"Computer game\" (B) is relevant because games often use digital graphics and maps, and they can be created using tile-based graphics.",
    "\"Art\" (C) can also be created using tiles, such as mosaics or digital art forms, but does not specifically connote a mapping function as strongly as \u201ccomputer game\u201d might.",
    "\"Song\" (D) does not relate to tiles or maps in any capacity, as it pertains solely to audio and musical composition.",
    "Now, I need to compare \"computer game\" and \"art\". The graphics used in computer games are often comprised of tiles that create maps for gameplay, while art can be more abstract or varied without implying any mapping function.",
    "Given the context, it seems more likely that the question is hinting at a functional use of tiles for navigation or gameplay, rather than an artistic expression solely.",
    "Thus, the graphic designer's work with tiles is most likely referring to the graphics used in a computer game, emphasizing interactivity and mapping."
