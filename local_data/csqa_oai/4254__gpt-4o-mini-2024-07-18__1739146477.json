  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Mary was in motion the whole time. This suggests that she was moving relative to a frame of reference.",
    "Since Mary is in motion, we can consider how an observer (Mary) would perceive others who are not moving with her.",
    "In a scenario where one is moving, the objects or people that are stationary from their perspective would appear to be \"not moving.\"",
    "The choices provided include terms such as \"stopped,\" \"stillness,\" \"standing still,\" \"static,\" and \"being still.\"",
    "All the choices essentially convey that the others are not moving; however, we need to determine which option best fits the context of the question.",
    "The phrase \"looked like everyone else was...\" implies a perception of others' state from Mary's point of view while she is in motion.",
    "The term \"standing still\" is a commonly accepted way to describe someone who appears not to be moving when someone else is moving.",
    "While \"stopped\" and \"static\" could also describe the state of others, \"standing still\" is a more personal and descriptive expression that conveys the visual aspect of their perceived motionlessness.",
    "Next, I analyze whether other options like \"stillness\" and \"being still\" can also fit. However, they seem more abstract compared to \"standing still.\"",
    "Therefore, considering the implications and nuances of the phrasing, \"standing still\" stands out as the most fitting choice."
