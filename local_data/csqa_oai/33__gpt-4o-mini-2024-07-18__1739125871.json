  "query": "Question: What would a camper need to do before he or she can start cooking food?\n\nChoices:\nA: make breakfast\nB: go hiking\nC: pack or bag\nD: light fire\nE: grab a match",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a camper needs to do before cooking food, so I need to identify the essential steps required for cooking.",
    "Cooking food typically involves preparing the cooking equipment and possibly creating a heat source, depending on the method of cooking.",
    "Among the choices given, options like \"make breakfast\" and \"go hiking\" do not directly contribute to the act of cooking.",
    "The choice \"pack or bag\" does not specifically address cooking preparation, although packing could involve gathering food items.",
    "The options \"light fire\" and \"grab a match\" are more relevant since lighting a fire is usually necessary for cooking outdoors.",
    "While \"grab a match\" can be seen as a preparatory step, it is incomplete, as one must also light the fire after grabbing the match.",
    "Thus, \"light fire\" is a more comprehensive choice because it encompasses the act of starting the cooking process.",
    "I've now narrowed it down to either lighting the fire or grabbing a match, but lighting the fire is the step that indicates readiness to cook."
