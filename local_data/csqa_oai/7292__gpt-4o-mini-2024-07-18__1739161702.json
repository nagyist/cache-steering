  "steps": [
    "The situation describes a computer that has stopped working despite John's efforts to fix it.",
    "The phrase \"tried his best\" suggests that John attempted to troubleshoot or repair the issue, but was unsuccessful.",
    "Given that computers can stop functioning for various reasons, it's important to consider the most likely cause based on the context provided.",
    "The choices given are: A (old equipment), B (process information), C (crash), D (become sensible), and E (cast shadow).",
    "Choice A (old equipment): While old equipment can fail, it doesn\u2019t specifically indicate a sudden inability to work like a crash would.",
    "Choice B (process information): This phrase does not logically relate to the computer stopping; rather, it describes what a computer normally does when functioning.",
    "Choice C (crash): A crash is a technical failure often resulting in a computer ceasing to function; this fits well with the description of it \"stopping working.\"",
    "Choice D (become sensible): This option doesn\u2019t pertain to a computer failure and does not make logical sense in this context.",
    "Choice E (cast shadow): This option is irrelevant to the functioning of a computer and is not applicable here.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the most fitting reason for the computer stopping is that it experienced a \"crash.\""
