  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one is likely to find a person called Cinderella, which signals that the context may be fictional rather than real-life.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"space shuttle\" (A) is not a realistic or relevant place for a character named Cinderella.",
    "Next, \"hotel\" (B) could be a possible place for a fictional or real person, but it is not directly connected to Cinderella.",
    "\"Hospital\" (C) is a place where people receive medical attention, not typically associated with a character like Cinderella.",
    "\"Street corner\" (D) suggests a public space, but again, it does not connect to the narrative of Cinderella.",
    "Lastly, \"fairy tale\" (E) directly references the story of Cinderella, indicating that she is a character from that genre.",
    "Given that Cinderella is a well-known character from a fairy tale, \"fairy tale\" is the most appropriate choice."
