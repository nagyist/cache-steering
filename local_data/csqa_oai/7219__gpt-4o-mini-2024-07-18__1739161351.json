  "query": "Question: Sally raked up leaves that had fallen to the ground.  She added them to something.  What did she add them to?\n\nChoices:\nA: trees\nB: ground\nC: forrest\nD: blower\nE: compost pile",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what is typically done with leaves that are raked up. Often, they are collected for disposal or for composting.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the options. \"A: trees\" does not make sense because you cannot add leaves to trees, and \"B: ground\" is too vague.",
    "Looking at \"C: forest,\" while leaves are a natural part of a forest ecosystem, one would not typically add raked leaves to a forest.",
    "The option \"D: blower\" is irrelevant as a blower is a tool used to remove leaves rather than something to which you would add leaves.",
    "The only sensible option remaining is \"E: compost pile.\" Raked leaves are often collected and added to compost piles to break down into nutrient-rich compost.",
    "Considering these points, it is clear that the most appropriate answer for where Sally likely added the raked leaves is a compost pile."
