  "query": "Question: Where would you put an eraser if you are at home and need to go to class?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: desk drawer\nC: schools\nD: under the arm\nE: pencil box",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where you typically keep your school supplies at home.",
    "An eraser is a common school supply that students usually keep in a designated spot for easy access.",
    "One likely location for school supplies at home is the desk drawer where various stationery items are kept.",
    "Another possible location is a pencil box, which is specifically designed to hold pencils, erasers, and other writing tools.",
    "The option labeled as \"schools\" (C) is not a storage location but rather the destination where the eraser would be used.",
    "The \"office supply store\" (A) is not a suitable option as one wouldn't store an eraser there; rather, it is a place to buy supplies.",
    "The option \"under the arm\" (D) is impractical for storing an eraser while preparing to go to class.",
    "Given the two most plausible storage options at home for an eraser\u2014desk drawer (B) and pencil box (E)\u2014further consideration is needed to determine which item is the most appropriate answer.",
    "Typically, a pencil box is used for carrying school supplies, especially if you are preparing to leave for class.",
    "Therefore, the best option to store an eraser for easy access when going to class is in the pencil box (E)."
