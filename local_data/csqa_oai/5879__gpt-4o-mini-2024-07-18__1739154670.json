  "query": "Question: If I lived in a small village outside a city, which general geographic area would this be?\n\nChoices:\nA: africa\nB: countryside\nC: the mountains\nD: south american country\nE: ohio",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the location is a small village outside a city, which implies a rural setting.",
    "The term \"countryside\" typically refers to rural areas that are outside of urban cities, aligning well with the description of living in a village.",
    "Although Africa (Option A) and South American countries (Option D) could contain rural areas, they are too broad and not as specifically connected to the idea of a village immediately outside a city.",
    "The mountains (Option C) could also be rural and could contain villages, but the question does not specifically mention mountains, making it a less general choice.",
    "Ohio (Option E) is a specific location, while the question does not provide context to imply a connection to Ohio specifically.",
    "Therefore, considering all options, \"countryside\" is the most appropriate choice to describe a small village outside a city."
