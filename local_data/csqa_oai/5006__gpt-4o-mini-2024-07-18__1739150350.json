  "query": "Question: John couldn't reach the place he needed to dust.  What couldn't he reach?\n\nChoices:\nA: coffee shop\nB: fridge\nC: table\nD: library\nE: shelf",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the sentence. John was tasked with dusting, which typically involves cleaning surfaces that accumulate dust over time.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided for their likelihood of needing dusting. A coffee shop might require cleaning, but it is a public space and less likely to be mentioned in this context.",
    "The fridge is generally not a place that gets dusted often since it is typically inside a kitchen and often cleaned regularly.",
    "A library is another public space, and while it can have shelves that need dusting, it again feels less personal to John\u2019s situation.",
    "Looking at \"table,\" this is a common item in a household that would need dusting, and \"shelf\" is also a likely candidate, as shelves can collect dust over time.",
    "Now compare the practicality of reaching for either a table or a shelf. If John couldn't reach it, it must be something elevated or perhaps difficult to access.",
    "Tables, while common dusting surfaces, are usually at a height that most people can easily reach.",
    "On the other hand, shelves are often placed higher up and can be challenging to dust without a step stool or ladder, making it reasonable that John may struggle to reach a shelf.",
    "Therefore, given the nature of dusting and what would be difficult to reach, the most fitting choice is a shelf."
