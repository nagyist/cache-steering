    "The question asks about something that is worn on the bridge of the nose, which indicates it should be an item that physically rests on or uses that part of the face.",
    "Analyzing the options provided: \n- A scar is not something you wear; it\u2019s a mark or blemish on the skin.\n- A tunnel is an underground passage and doesn\u2019t relate to being worn on the nose.\n- A transportation system is not a physical item you wear; it refers to methods or infrastructure for travel.\n- Spectacles, or glasses, are designed to sit on the bridge of the nose to help with vision.\n- A stringed instrument is an object played with fingers, and it is certainly not worn on the nose.",
    "Out of the options, the only item that can be worn on the bridge of the nose is spectacles.",
    "To confirm, spectacles are commonly designed to balance on the nose, typically with nose pads resting on the bridge.",
    "None of the other options fit the criteria of being something that can be worn on the bridge of the nose."
