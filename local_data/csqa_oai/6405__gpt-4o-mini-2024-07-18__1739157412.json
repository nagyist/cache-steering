  "steps": [
    "To understand what happens when lovers want to show affection, we need to consider typical affectionate behaviors in romantic relationships.",
    "A common form of physical affection in romantic relationships is kissing, which expresses love and closeness.",
    "Showing disgust towards each other typically indicates conflict or negative feelings, which is contrary to wanting to show affection.",
    "Arguing does not typically correlate with displaying affection; it usually denotes disagreement or conflict.",
    "Parting ways suggests a separation, which also is not aligned with the desire to show affection.",
    "Breaking up would be a definitive end to the relationship, which again is not relevant when expressing affection.",
    "Since the options provided are looking for a behavior that clearly represents affection, we can eliminate all choices except for kissing.",
    "Kissing is widely recognized as a primary way for lovers to physically express their affection towards each other.",
    "Hence, the best representation of how lovers show affection from the given options is to kiss each other."
