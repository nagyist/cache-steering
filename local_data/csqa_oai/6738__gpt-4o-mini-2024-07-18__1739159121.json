  "query": "Question: Mable loved horses.  She'd do what with them every time she visited the farm?\n\nChoices:\nA: clean\nB: play\nC: eat grass\nD: dominated\nE: kept in barn stalls",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Mable loved horses, indicating a positive interaction with them.",
    "I need to consider what kind of activities someone who loves horses might do when visiting them on a farm.",
    "Cleaning horses is a task associated with horse care but may not be the most enjoyable activity that someone loves doing.",
    "Playing with horses is often an endearing and enjoyable activity for someone who loves them, suggesting a positive interaction.",
    "Eating grass is not an activity that a person would do with horses; rather, it\u2019s something horses do.",
    "Dominated implies a negative connotation and suggests control rather than love, which goes against the sentiment expressed in the question.",
    "Keeping them in barn stalls is again a task related to care but does not indicate an interaction that someone who loves horses would engage in during a visit.",
    "Given the choices, playing with horses aligns best with the enjoyment that Mable would have, as it expresses affection and engagement.",
    "Thus, the final answer must reflect the activity that best represents someone who loves horses visiting them at a farm."
