  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"Sean was lying about the body\" suggests that he was involved in a serious situation that could have legal or personal consequences.",
    "Given this context, if he was lying, it is reasonable to believe that he was concerned about the risk of discovery or the consequences of his lie.",
    "The option \"C: being found out\" directly addresses the concern of someone lying; they would be fearful of their deception being uncovered.",
    "While other options could be valid fears, such as A or E, they don't directly connect to the act of lying in the same way as concern over being exposed does.",
    "\"Reward money\" in choice A could imply a positive potential outcome in some situations, but it contrasts with the fear that Sean might experience.",
    "\"Hurt feelings\" in choice B might relate to personal relationships, but Sean's fear seems to stem more from his actions rather than emotional repercussions.",
    "\"Problems\" in option D is vague and doesn't pinpoint a specific fear; while he likely has problems stemming from his dishonesty, it is not as direct as being found out.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that Sean constantly worried about the consequences of his lie, specifically about being discovered."
