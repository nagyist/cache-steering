  "query": "Question: The teacher told the class they would be taking a lot of notes this semester, he recommended buying a what just for this class?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: meeting\nC: notebook\nD: meeting\nE: desk",
  "steps": [
    "Begin by analyzing the context of the question, which involves the teacher recommending something for taking a lot of notes.",
    "Consider what items are commonly associated with taking notes in a classroom setting.",
    "Evaluate each choice: \n- A: school - this does not fit as it is an institution, not a tool for taking notes.\n- B: meeting - this also does not fit, as it is a gathering rather than a tool for note-taking.\n- C: notebook - this is specifically designed for writing notes and would make sense for the recommendation.\n- D: meeting - this is a repeat of option B, and still doesn't fit.\n- E: desk - while a desk is related to a classroom, it does not directly relate to the act of taking notes.",
    "Given the context and the analysis, the most suitable option for note-taking is clearly a notebook.",
    "Cross-reference option C with the context about taking notes in a class, reaffirming that a notebook is an essential tool.",
    "Conclude that the other options do not pertain to the act of taking notes directly."
