  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what a contralto is. A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice that has the lowest vocal range.",
    "Next, consider the context in which contralto voices are commonly heard. They are typically found in opera, classical music, and choirs.",
    "Now let's analyze the choices given.",
    "Choice A, \"fun,\" is vague and does not specifically relate to a musical event.",
    "Choice B, \"choir,\" directly relates to a group that may include contralto voices, but it does not specify an event.",
    "Choice C, \"describe singing voice,\" is not an event but an action, making it irrelevant.",
    "Choice D, \"chorus,\" is also similar to a choir, where contralto voices might sing, yet it still doesn\u2019t represent a specific event.",
    "Choice E, \"concert,\" is an event where different types of music, including performances featuring contralto singers, take place.",
    "Considering all these points, the best option that represents an event where one might enjoy a contralto is a concert, as it encompasses performances featuring various vocalists, including contraltos."
