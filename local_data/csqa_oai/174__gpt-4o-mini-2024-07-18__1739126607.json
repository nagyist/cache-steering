  "query": "Question: Sarah wanted to by a new rug.  Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run?\n\nChoices:\nA: front of door\nB: bedroom\nC: desk\nD: table\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario suggests that Sarah's old rug had ink spilled on it, and she's uncertain how an inkwell got there. This implies that the rug was likely located near something that uses ink frequently.",
    "An inkwell is typically associated with writing instruments, which are commonly found on desks where people write or draw.",
    "Considering the choices provided: \nA: front of door - not a likely place for ink.\nB: bedroom - does not typically contain writing instruments.\nC: desk - a likely candidate since it's often where ink is used.\nD: table - could be used for writing but is less specific than a desk.\nE: living room - usually does not have writing instruments that produce ink stains.",
    "The most logical choice is C (desk) because that is where one would generally expect to find an inkwell, leading to ink possibly spilling onto a rug placed beneath it.",
    "The other choices either do not typically associate with ink or are not specifically designed for writing activities."
