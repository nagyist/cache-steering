  "query": "Question: Bill sits down on a whoopee cushion, what sound does he make when he sits?\n\nChoices:\nA: fall asleep\nB: flatulence\nC: sigh of relief\nD: medium\nE: comfort",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves a whoopee cushion, which is designed to produce a sound mimicking flatulence when someone sits on it.",
    "Considering the function of a whoopee cushion, the primary anticipated sound is a comedic flatulent noise, which is often used for humor.",
    "The other options do not align with what typically occurs when someone sits on a whoopee cushion. For example, \"fall asleep\" suggests a state of rest, while \"sigh of relief\" implies a non-existent tension release unrelated to the sound of a whoopee cushion.",
    "\"Medium\" and \"comfort\" do not represent any sound and are irrelevant in this context because they do not describe a sound at all.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that the sound produced when Bill sits on the whoopee cushion is flatulent in nature."
