  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine where clothes are typically sold.",
    "Retail stores, particularly clothing stores, specialize in selling a variety of clothing items.",
    "Grocery stores primarily sell food and household items, not clothing.",
    "Pharmacies usually offer personal care products and some clothing items, but they are not primarily clothing retailers.",
    "Supermarkets are similar to grocery stores and focus on food and basic household needs, rather than clothing.",
    "Restaurants do not sell clothes; they focus on food and beverages.",
    "Out of the given options, the retail store stands out as the primary location for purchasing clothes.",
    "Clothes acquired in a shopping bag generally suggest a retail purchase, not food or pharmacy items.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice based on the reasoning is \"retail store.\""
