  "steps": [
    "To determine where people who use a puck for a living go at the end of their workday, we need to identify those who use a puck professionally. Typically, this refers to ice hockey players or similar athletes.",
    "Ice hockey players frequently use pucks during their games, which take place in specific venues designed for that sport.",
    "After a hockey game or practice, players often head to a place where they can store their gear and perhaps take a shower or change out of their uniforms. This location is commonly known as the locker room.",
    "The locker room is an essential part of hockey teams and organizations, acting as a space for athletes to prepare before games and decompress after games.",
    "The choices include \"locker room\" which is a direct place players go after their activities are done.",
    "Although \"ice hockey game\" and \"hockey rink\" are closely related to the work they do, they do not directly represent a location to which they go at the end of their workday.",
    "\"Sporting goods store\" and \"desert\" are irrelevant to where the athletes end up after work since they don't typically go to these places after their hockey-related activities.",
    "Thus, we conclude that the most logical answer, considering the context and purpose, is the \"locker room\"."
