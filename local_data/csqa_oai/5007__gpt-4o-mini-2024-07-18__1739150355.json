  "steps": [
    "Sally initially looked where she ate, which implies she checked locations associated with her meals.",
    "She searched in storage, suggesting that the saltshaker might be kept in places where less frequently used items are stored.",
    "Eventually, she found the saltshaker wedged beside a counter, indicating it was in a location associated with her kitchen or dining area.",
    "Since she found it wedged beside a counter, it is likely that this location is within her own kitchen, as counters are typically found there.",
    "Given that she searched various places without success before finding the saltshaker, it's reasonable to conclude her final finding was not in a public place like a restaurant (B).",
    "Locations like the kitchen cupboard (D) and cabinet (E) are also common places for storage, but the specific mention of \"beside a counter\" points directly to the kitchen environment.",
    "The term \"own kitchen\" (A) directly aligns with her finding the saltshaker beside the counter, which suggests it was a personal area rather than a shared or public space.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on her search and final location is that the saltshaker was found in her own kitchen."
