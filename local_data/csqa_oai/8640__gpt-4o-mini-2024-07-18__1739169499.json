  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze each option to determine where a concert hall is typically located.",
    "A stadium is a large venue generally used for sports and large concerts, so it is likely to host a concert hall.",
    "A city has many venues, including potential spaces for concert halls, making it a feasible location.",
    "A commercial building typically hosts businesses and offices, which is not the usual setting for a concert hall.",
    "A theater is designed specifically for performances, including music concerts, making it a likely place for a concert hall.",
    "A university building often has facilities for performances, including concert halls or auditoriums for educational purposes.",
    "Now, comparing the likelihood of finding a concert hall in each location, the commercial building stands out as the least suitable venue.",
    "I will now finalize my decision by reaffirming the reasoning that a concert hall is unlikely to be found in a commercial setting."
