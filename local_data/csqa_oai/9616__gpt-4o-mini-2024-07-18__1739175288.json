  "query": "Question: Where is driftwood usually found in large quantities?\n\nChoices:\nA: sea\nB: ocean\nC: beach\nD: sand\nE: drift",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what driftwood is and where it originates. Driftwood typically consists of fallen or washed-up trees and branches that have been carried by water to shore or into the ocean.",
    "Next, I will think about the locations where driftwood is commonly deposited. Since driftwood is formed from trees, it usually ends up in areas along bodies of water \u2013 primarily in coastal regions.",
    "I will analyze the choices given. The sea and ocean are both large bodies of water, but \"beach\" specifically refers to the area of land found along the edge of the sea or ocean where driftwood often accumulates.",
    "While driftwood can be found in the sea and ocean, it is more commonly seen on beaches where water recedes and leaves pieces of wood behind.",
    "Next, I will eliminate options that are less relevant. \"Sand\" doesn't apply specifically to where driftwood accumulates, nor does \"drift\" in this context, as it is too vague.",
    "Now I will compare the two still-relevant options: \"sea\" and \"beach.\" Although driftwood originates in the sea or ocean, it's typically found in large quantities on beaches where people can see it.",
    "To conclude, I can determine that \"beach\" is directly associated with the accumulation of large quantities of driftwood, as opposed to just being present in the broader sea or ocean."
