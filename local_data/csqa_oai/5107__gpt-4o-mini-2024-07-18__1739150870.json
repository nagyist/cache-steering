  "query": "Question: If you're caught committing murder, an injection can lead to your own what?\n\nChoices:\nA: own death\nB: die\nC: great sorrow\nD: fear\nE: banquet",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to the consequence of being caught committing murder. One common legal outcome for murder is the death penalty.",
    "The term \"injection\" suggests a lethal injection, which is a method used for capital punishment in certain jurisdictions.",
    "Lethal injection is specifically aimed at causing the \"death\" of the individual who is sentenced to death.",
    "The phrasing \"lead to your own what\" indicates that we're looking for a noun that describes the final result of being subjected to this punishment.",
    "Considering the options, 'death' is a direct result of a lethal injection.",
    "The other options (sorrow, fear, banquet, die) do not fit as direct consequences of this scenario.",
    "'Great sorrow' could be a feeling experienced by others, but it does not align with the context of the punishment affecting the individual directly.",
    "'D' (fear) and 'E' (banquet) are unrelated to the consequence of the punishment.",
    "Thus, A is the only answer that logically fits as a consequence of being given a lethal injection following a murder conviction."
