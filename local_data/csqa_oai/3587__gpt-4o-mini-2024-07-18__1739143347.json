  "query": "Question: James goes to church regularly.  He needs to move, but wants to move to a place with a church.  Where, in America, might one expect to find a church?\n\nChoices:\nA: christian community\nB: city\nC: wedding\nD: every town\nE: preast",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James wants to move to a place with a church, indicating that he requires a suitable environment to continue his regular church attendance.",
    "One option is to consider where churches are typically found in America. Churches are commonly located in various types of communities and areas.",
    "Option A, \"christian community,\" may suggest a higher concentration of churches, but it is more specific and not necessarily a ubiquitous choice.",
    "Option B, \"city,\" indicates urban areas where churches can be found, but it may not reflect the presence of churches in all areas of the country.",
    "Option C, \"wedding,\" does not directly relate to the presence of churches, as weddings can take place outside of church settings.",
    "Option D, \"every town,\" suggests that churches can be typically found in towns across America, making it the most inclusive choice.",
    "Option E, \"preast,\" seems to be a typographical error and does not provide a relevant option concerning where churches can be found.",
    "Considering the analysis above, the most accurate and inclusive answer would be that churches are expected to be found in \"every town\" across America."
