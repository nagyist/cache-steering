  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what is meant by a \"protected forest.\" A protected forest is an area designated for conservation, where human activity is limited or regulated to preserve its natural ecology.",
    "Now, let's look at each option provided to see if they commonly contain protected forests.",
    "Option A: temperate zone refers to a climatic zone characterized by mild temperatures. While many temperate zones do have forests, they are not specifically protected areas.",
    "Option B: national park is a protected area designated for conservation, where forests are likely protected. National parks are specifically created to preserve the environment, including forests.",
    "Option C: South Africa is a country that does have protected areas, but it is too broad a term to say all areas in the country are protected forests.",
    "Option D: countryside refers to rural areas, but it doesn\u2019t specify that these areas are protected. Countryside can have forests that aren\u2019t protected.",
    "Option E: the Amazon basin is a region known for its rainforests and biodiversity, but it is not uniformly protected. Parts of it are threatened by deforestation and other activities.",
    "Considering the analysis, option B (national park) stands out as the best choice since national parks are designated specifically to protect forests and other natural environments."
