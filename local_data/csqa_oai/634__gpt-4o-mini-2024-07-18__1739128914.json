  "query": "Question: Where do fish spend the majority of their time?\n\nChoices:\nA: body of water\nB: lake superior\nC: underwater\nD: toilet\nE: aquarium",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what constitutes the majority of time spent by fish in general.",
    "Fish are aquatic animals, meaning they are designed to live in water.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices provided. The majority of the options involve water or aquatic environments.",
    "Choice A, \"body of water,\" is a general term that encompasses various aquatic environments.",
    "Choice B, \"Lake Superior,\" is a specific body of water, but it's not where all fish spend their majority of time, as not all fish inhabit this particular lake.",
    "Choice C, \"underwater,\" is where fish typically thrive, as they are adapted to swim and live below the surface of the water.",
    "Choice D, \"toilet,\" is an inappropriate environment for fish and does not represent their natural habitat.",
    "Choice E, \"aquarium,\" indicates a controlled environment where some fish may live, but it doesn't apply to the majority of fish in the wild.",
    "Comparing these choices, \"underwater\" (Choice C) more accurately describes the natural state for the majority of fish, as they are constantly swimming and living in that environment."
