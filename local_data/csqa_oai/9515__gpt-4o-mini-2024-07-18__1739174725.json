  "query": "Question: What events are typical, expected and not divine?\n\nChoices:\nA: undivine\nB: humdrum\nC: godless\nD: horrible\nE: cursed",
  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the options provided to identify which term most appropriately describes events that are typical or expected, and not divine in nature.",
    "The term \"undivine\" (A) implies something that is not divine, but does not necessarily denote typicality or an expected nature of events.",
    "The term \"humdrum\" (B) indicates dullness or monotony, suggesting that the events are common or typical, which aligns well with the idea of being expected and normal.",
    "The term \"godless\" (C) implies a lack of divine influence, but it does not guarantee that events are typical or commonplace; it merely implies a secular nature.",
    "The term \"horrible\" (D) has a connotation of negativity and does not align with the idea of typical or expected events but rather suggests extreme or undesirable outcomes.",
    "The term \"cursed\" (E) suggests misfortune or bad luck, which is not consistent with the notion of being typical or expected; it implies something unusual or extreme.",
    "From the analysis, \"humdrum\" (B) stands out as it indicates ordinariness and regularity, which we are looking for in the context of typical, expected events that are non-divine.",
    "I will check if any of the other terms could fit better than \"humdrum,\" but none offer the same combination of typicality and being non-divine."
