  "query": "Question: What device with a lens would be used to see distant stars and planets?\n\nChoices:\nA: camera\nB: glasses\nC: microscope\nD: kaleidoscope\nE: telescope",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a device with a lens that is specifically used to see distant stars and planets.",
    "A camera typically captures still images and videos, not specifically designed for viewing distant celestial objects.",
    "Glasses are used to correct vision but do not have the capability to magnify distant astronomical objects.",
    "A microscope is designed for viewing very small objects and details close up, it is not suitable for observing distant stars and planets.",
    "A kaleidoscope provides a visual display of patterns but does not focus on distant celestial bodies.",
    "A telescope is designed specifically for viewing distant objects, including stars and planets, making it the most suitable option.",
    "The primary purpose of a telescope is to use lenses or mirrors to magnify distant objects in the sky.",
    "Since all other options do not fulfill the requirement of viewing distant celestial objects, the only appropriate device is a telescope."
