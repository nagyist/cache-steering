    "The question asks what someone in a skiing accident is likely to have in more than one place.",
    "Option A, frostbite, typically affects extremities like fingers and toes but may not necessarily appear in multiple locations simultaneously.",
    "Option B, broken bones, is common in skiing accidents due to falls and collisions. It's possible for someone to break more than one bone in an accident.",
    "Option C, chapped lips, is generally isolated to the lips and wouldn\u2019t typically occur in multiple places on the body.",
    "Option D, a healthy body, stands in contrast to the scenario of a skiing accident, where injuries would likely be present.",
    "Option E, broken legs, while a common skiing injury, refers specifically to multiple breaks in one area (the legs), rather than injuries in multiple locations.",
    "Comparing all options, broken bones (Option B) can encompass fractures in different parts of the body (e.g., arms, ribs, legs), making it feasible to have them in more than one location.",
    "Since broken bones is the most relevant option that could occur in various places on the body after a skiing accident, this should be determined as the best answer."
