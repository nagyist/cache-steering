  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"The cow was a star\" suggests that the cow is well-known or famous in some context.",
    "We need to determine what context or source would best explain how everyone knew the cow.",
    "Option A: Wisconsin \u2013 while cows are associated with farming in Wisconsin, it doesn't specifically indicate a reason why the cow is a \"star.\"",
    "Option B: Fairy tale \u2013 cows do appear in fairy tales, but it is unclear if this specific cow is known from a particular tale.",
    "Option C: Nebraska \u2013 similar to Wisconsin, Nebraska is also known for its agriculture but doesn't specify the cow's fame source.",
    "Option D: Advertisement \u2013 this option suggests the cow could be a star from marketing or promotional efforts, which aligns with the idea of being widely known.",
    "Option E: Countryside \u2013 while it suggests a rural setting, it again does not elucidate how the cow gained its star status.",
    "Among all the options, 'advertisement' is the most plausible reason for the cow being a star, as advertisements can indeed make animals famous."
