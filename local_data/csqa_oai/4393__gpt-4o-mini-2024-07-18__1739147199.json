  "query": "Question: What happens when applying a heat source to combustible materials?\n\nChoices:\nA: go to jail\nB: consume\nC: burns\nD: damage\nE: warmth",
  "steps": [
    "When heat is applied to combustible materials, the primary expectation is that combustion may occur.",
    "Combustible materials are substances that can ignite and burn in the presence of an adequate heat source.",
    "As the temperature increases, these materials reach their ignition point and can begin to burn.",
    "The process of burning involves a chemical reaction where combustible materials react with oxygen to produce heat and light.",
    "Therefore, the most direct outcome of applying heat to combustible materials is that they will ignite and sustain a flame.",
    "While options like \"consume\" and \"burns\" are both relevant, \"burns\" specifically describes the act of combustion taking place.",
    "The term \"consume\" is more general and can imply the act of being used up but doesn't convey the specific action of burning.",
    "\"D\" (damage) could be a consequence of burning, but it\u2019s not the primary action immediately taken by the combustible material.",
    "\"E\" refers to the warmth produced but does not encapsulate the primary chemical reaction of burning.",
    "Considering all these points, the most fitting and descriptive answer related to the action of combustible materials being heated is \u201cburns.\u201d"
