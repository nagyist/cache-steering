  "query": "Question: Where can a television be stored and hidden?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: living room\nC: bedroom\nD: kitchen\nE: cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that a television is a large electronic item that often requires a dedicated space for storage or placement.",
    "Next, reflect on the environments in which a television is typically found. Common places include living rooms, bedrooms, and sometimes kitchens.",
    "Examine each choice for practical storage or hiding options. An apartment is a general living space, not specifically a storage option.",
    "Consider the living room. While this is a common location for televisions, it is not a place one would store and hide a television.",
    "Next, analyze the bedroom. Televisions may be kept there, but it is still a primary use area and not specifically for hiding.",
    "Now, consider the kitchen. Televisions are not typically stored or hidden here either as it is mainly for cooking and eating purposes.",
    "Finally, evaluate the cabinet option. A cabinet provides an enclosed space that can effectively hide a television from view when not in use.",
    "Thus, the most suitable option for storing and hiding a television is the cabinet since it allows for concealment while also providing storage."
