  "query": "Question: Where is the most likely place for more than one stadium?\n\nChoices:\nA: college town\nB: large city\nC: conducting olympic games\nD: greece\nE: rome",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what type of location typically has multiple stadiums. Large cities often have several stadiums to accommodate different sports and events.",
    "Next, we can think about college towns. While some college towns have stadiums, they usually do not have more than one significant stadium.",
    "Now, let's examine the option of conducting Olympic games. Olympic games often require multiple stadiums for various sports; however, this is a temporary situation and may not indicate a permanent location for more than one stadium.",
    "Evaluating Greece, while it holds historical significance with the ancient Olympics, it does not necessarily imply multiple modern stadiums in a specific location today.",
    "Next, we consider Rome. Rome is a large city that might have multiple sports facilities and stadiums, but again, it may not be as numerous as seen in larger metropolitan areas.",
    "Given that we are looking for a location where more than one stadium is likely, the option \"large city\" stands out as the most general and applicable environment for having numerous stadiums.",
    "We can also quickly eliminate other options: college towns are smaller, Olympic venues are temporary, Greece is more historical, and Rome, while a city, is not as representative as larger global cities.",
    "Therefore, the best choice for a place with more than one stadium is most likely a large city, as these are typically designed to cater to multiple sports teams and events."
