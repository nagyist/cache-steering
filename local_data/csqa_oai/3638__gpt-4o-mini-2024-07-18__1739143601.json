  "query": "Question: Starting a fire is a terrible idea because flames move in what pattern?\n\nChoices:\nA: explosion\nB: unpredictable\nC: disaster\nD: warmth\nE: everywhere",
  "steps": [
    "To understand why starting a fire is considered a terrible idea, we first need to analyze the movement of flames.",
    "Flames typically spread in various directions due to wind, fuel sources, and environmental factors.",
    "The spreading of flames can lead to a rapid and uncontrollable situation.",
    "One way to describe how flames move is that they can be chaotic and non-linear.",
    "This chaotic nature makes it hard to predict exactly where the flames will go next.",
    "Considering the options, A (explosion) does not accurately describe the general movement of flames.",
    "B (unpredictable) suggests that flames do not have a set pattern, which aligns with our observations of how they behave.",
    "C (disaster) is more about the outcome of uncontrolled flames rather than the pattern of their movement.",
    "D (warmth) describes the characteristic of fire but does not denote the movement pattern of flames.",
    "E (everywhere) captures a sense of widespread movement but may not convey the randomness inherent in how flames spread.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all options, the most accurate description of the flame movement pattern leading to the terrible idea of starting a fire is B (unpredictable)."
