  "query": "Question: The country enjoyed a period of peace, it was brought about by a very what time?\n\nChoices:\nA: peacework\nB: war\nC: violent\nD: happened\nE: trying",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence states that \"the country enjoyed a period of peace.\" The word that follows needs to compliment or provide context for this peace.",
    "Next, let's examine the choices available. The word choice must either enhance or explain what brought about peace.",
    "Choice A: \"peacework.\" This term is not widely recognized and does not have a clear relationship with peace in context.",
    "Choice B: \"war.\" This suggests conflict, which typically leads to a lack of peace, thus creating an inconsistency in the sentence.",
    "Choice C: \"violent.\" While this word describes something that can disrupt peace, it needs to be examined in context. It can suggest that the aftermath of violence led to peace.",
    "Choice D: \"happened.\" This word does not add any substantial meaning related to the cause or context of peace.",
    "Choice E: \"trying.\" This does not directly relate to either peace or the cause of peace, making it irrelevant.",
    "Reassessing choice C (\"violent\"), if we interpret the phrase to mean that violence has subsided leading to a period of peace, then it fits contextually.",
    "Reviewing all options, the only one that might explain a period of peace, albeit indirectly, is \"violent,\" in the context of peace following resolution of violence."
