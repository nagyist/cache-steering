  "query": "Question: Where would you usually keep your personal telephone directory?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: building\nC: house\nD: desk\nE: phone booth",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what a personal telephone directory is. It is a collection of contacts and their phone numbers, typically used for personal reference.",
    "Next, I consider where a personal telephone directory is most commonly found or stored. It's meant to be easily accessible for someone to refer to in daily life.",
    "I evaluate the choices provided. An office (Choice A) may contain a directory for work-related contacts, but not usually for personal contacts.",
    "Building (Choice B) is too vague and does not refer to a specific location where one would store personal items.",
    "A house (Choice C) is a place where personal belongings are typically kept, including personal telephone directories.",
    "Next, I think about a desk (Choice D). A desk within a house or an office could also contain a directory, but it is a specific location within a broader setting\u2014i.e., not the main place where such a directory is typically stored.",
    "Finally, a phone booth (Choice E) is an outdated and less common place that is not suitable for keeping personal items like a directory.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the best answer is that a personal telephone directory is most logically stored at home, where personal items are kept."
