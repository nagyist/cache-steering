  "query": "Question: There were all sorts of shapes in the textbook, the geometry teacher explained how to find the area of the surface for each what?\n\nChoices:\nA: turtle\nB: tetrahedron\nC: object\nD: lake\nE: geometry problem",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"shapes\" in a textbook related to geometry. This suggests that we are discussing some geometric concepts.",
    "The teacher is explaining how to find the area of the surface. This terminology is typically associated with three-dimensional shapes.",
    "Among the choices, \"turtle,\" \"tetrahedron,\" \"object,\" \"lake,\" and \"geometry problem,\" the most relevant term for a subject of surface area in geometry is likely to be a geometric shape or object.",
    "The term \"tetrahedron\" refers to a specific geometric shape, which is a type of polyhedron. However, it does not cover all possible shapes in geometry.",
    "\"Object\" is a broader term that can refer to any item, physical or abstract, including shapes studied in geometry.",
    "The term \"lake\" does not relate to geometry in the same way as the other options. It refers to a body of water and not to a geometric concept.",
    "\"Geometry problem\" refers to a mathematical question involving geometry, but it doesn't specifically pertain to the act of finding areas of surfaces of shapes.",
    "Given that the teacher is explaining concepts and the context is about different shapes, \"object\" encompasses all types of geometric shapes that could be studied.",
    "Out of all the choices, \"object\" best fits the context of teaching about surface area for a range of shapes in a geometry class.",
    "Final assessment leads to the conclusion that the answer most aligned with the question is the broad term \"object.\""
