    "Leather jackets are typically clothing items, so they are more likely found in places that sell apparel.",
    "A car seat is not an apparel item, so choice A can be eliminated.",
    "Grocery stores primarily focus on food and household items, not clothing, so choice B is also eliminated.",
    "A stable usually refers to a place for horses and may sell tack or supplies for equestrian activities, but it is not a typical place for buying leather jackets, so choice C can be eliminated.",
    "Department stores commonly offer a wide range of products, including clothing and accessories like leather jackets, so choice D is a strong candidate.",
    "A sex shop primarily sells adult-oriented products and may have limited or no clothing options, making choice E less likely for purchasing leather jackets.",
