  "query": "Question: What is a place where every creature lives?\n\nChoices:\nA: world\nB: zoo\nC: dark place\nD: lake\nE: woods",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the definition of a place where \"every creature\" lives, which implies a place that encompasses all forms of life.",
    "The term \"world\" is broad and generally used to describe the entire planet, where various habitats exist for different creatures.",
    "A \"zoo\" is a specific place where certain animals are kept for public viewing, but it does not encompass all creatures.",
    "A \"dark place\" is vague and does not refer to a specific habitat where creatures live, nor does it imply inclusivity of all creatures.",
    "A \"lake\" is a specific type of habitat that contains aquatic life but doesn\u2019t represent the entirety of creatures on Earth.",
    "\"Woods\" refers to a forested area where many terrestrial creatures might live, but again, this does not cover all types of creatures, especially aquatic or aerial ones.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that generally refers to a place where all kinds of creatures can live is \"world.\""
