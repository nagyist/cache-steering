  "query": "Question: Suzan is fiddling while Johnny, Jerry, and the rest are having some wild fun with not particular rhyme or pattern.  What might they be doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: shuffle\nB: dancing about\nC: troubles\nD: square dancing\nE: discovery",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that Johnny, Jerry, and others are having wild fun, which suggests a lively, energetic activity.",
    "The term \"wild fun\" typically indicates activities that involve movement and enjoyment, rather than something static or calm.",
    "The choices include activities: shuffle, dancing about, square dancing, and discovery, each suggesting different levels of movement and energy.",
    "\"Shuffle\" suggests a form of movement but is less expressive than \"dancing about.\"",
    "\"Dancing about\" implies free, spirited movement usually associated with a carefree atmosphere, which aligns with \"wild fun.\"",
    "\"Square dancing\" is structured and has a specific pattern, which seems contrary to the \"not particular rhyme or pattern\" mentioned in the prompt.",
    "\"Troubles\" does not convey an activity typically associated with fun, and \"discovery\" is more about exploration rather than a social activity.",
    "Given the context of energetic celebration and the lack of structure mentioned, \"dancing about\" is the most fitting choice."
