  "query": "Question: Joe wanted to own a neighborhood barbershop but he had trouble with city zoning laws.  What might the city have required of his shop that was a problem?\n\nChoices:\nA: flush\nB: razor\nC: commercial area\nD: city\nE: water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what zoning laws typically regulate when it comes to establishing a business like a barbershop.",
    "City zoning laws usually require specific types of businesses to be located in designated areas, such as commercial or residential zones.",
    "Since a barbershop is a commercial business, it would generally need to be located in a commercial area.",
    "If Joe's desired location for the barbershop was not in a designated commercial zone, this would be a problem in terms of compliance with zoning laws.",
    "The other options listed (flush, razor, city, water) do not relate to typical zoning requirements or laws.",
    "Thus, the most logical connection between Joe's problem and city requirements is that he may not have been in a designated commercial area for his barbershop."
