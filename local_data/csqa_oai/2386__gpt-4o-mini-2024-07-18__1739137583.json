  "query": "Question: He leaned the beam over the flooded gap to create a makeshift what?\n\nChoices:\nA: warehouse\nB: bridge\nC: metal shop\nD: shop\nE: new construction",
  "steps": [
    "The situation described involves a \"flooded gap,\" suggesting there is some kind of obstacle that needs to be crossed, likely water.",
    "The act of leaning a beam suggests a temporary solution, which is often used in situations where something needs to be crossed or supported.",
    "One common temporary structure used to cross gaps, particularly flooded areas, is a bridge, which can be made with simple materials like beams.",
    "The other options, such as \"warehouse,\" \"metal shop,\" \"shop,\" and \"new construction,\" do not imply crossing a gap nor do they involve using a beam in a makeshift sense.",
    "A warehouse and a store would require a permanent structure, which does not fit the context of \"makeshift.\"",
    "The term \"makeshift\" also indicates that the solution is not intended to last long, further supporting the idea of a temporary bridge.",
    "From the options provided, only \"bridge\" logically fits the description of something that one would create using a beam over a flooded area.",
    "I double-checked to ensure that no other options fit better than \"bridge,\" and none do."
