  "query": "Question: You might grab what to smash a large, frightening bug when you're outdoors?\n\nChoices:\nA: tree\nB: garden\nC: meadow\nD: rock\nE: rug",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the situation: when encountering a large, frightening bug outdoors, one would typically look for something handy to use as a tool or weapon against it.",
    "Next, we can evaluate the options provided: A tree might be too large to grab and use, while a garden and meadow are more locations rather than objects to use against a bug.",
    "The option of a rug is not applicable outdoors, as it usually belongs indoors.",
    "This leaves us with one practical option to consider: a rock. Rocks are often available in outdoor settings and can be easily picked up and used to smash a bug.",
    "Now, let's ensure that, among our options, using a rock is the most logical choice as it fits the criteria of being both effective and readily available outside.",
    "After analyzing all the options and double-checking their feasibility, it becomes clear that a rock is the best option."
