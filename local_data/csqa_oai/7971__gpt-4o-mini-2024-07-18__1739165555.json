  "query": "Question: Where do people keep a rubber for sex?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedside table\nB: drug store\nC: classroom\nD: closet\nE: trash",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which asks about a place where people might keep a rubber, or condom, specifically for sexual activity.",
    "Next, think about common locations where condoms are typically stored for easy access during sexual encounters.",
    "A bedside table is a likely choice because it is a private area where an individual or couple might keep items related to intimacy and sex.",
    "Now evaluate the other options: \n- A drug store is not a storage location but rather a place to purchase condoms. \n- A classroom is completely unrelated to personal items like condoms.\n- A closet could potentially store various items, but it is less convenient for quick access during sex.\n- A trash location is inappropriate; once used, condoms are disposed of but not stored there.",
    "Among the assessed locations, the bedside table remains the most practical and logical option for personal storage of condoms for immediate use."
