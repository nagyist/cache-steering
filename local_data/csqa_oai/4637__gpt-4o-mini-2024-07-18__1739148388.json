  "query": "Question: Where could you find a library that only friends can visit?\n\nChoices:\nA: college\nB: hotel\nC: school\nD: house\nE: downtown",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze what it means for a library to have a restriction that only friends can visit. This implies a personal or informal setting, as opposed to public or institutional libraries.",
    "Looking at each option, I first consider \"A: college.\" College libraries are generally open to students and faculty rather than only friends, making it less likely to fit the description.",
    "Next, I evaluate \"B: hotel.\" While hotels may have libraries or reading rooms, these are typically open to guests and not specifically restricted to friends.",
    "For \"C: school,\" school libraries generally serve all students enrolled at the school, thus they do not restrict access to just friends.",
    "Considering \"D: house,\" if the library in question is a personal library located in someone\u2019s home, it could indeed be restricted to only friends of the homeowner.",
    "Lastly, I examine \"E: downtown.\" While downtown areas might have public libraries, they are accessible to anyone in the community rather than being limited to friends.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only location where a library could realistically be limited to friends is a private setting, like a personal library in someone's \"D: house.\""
