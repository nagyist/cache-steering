  "query": "Question: What could you put a table in if you want the table to be in your house?\n\nChoices:\nA: library\nB: demonstration\nC: corner\nD: football ground\nE: rug",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which is about placing a table in a house.",
    "Next, consider what types of places exist within a house where a table could be placed. Rooms or designated areas come to mind.",
    "Now, evaluate the provided choices against the context of a house:\n- A: library - While possible, it's a specific room that might not be present in every house.\n- B: demonstration - This does not fit as a physical location within a house.\n- C: corner - This is a general term but is applicable as it can refer to any room in the house.\n- D: football ground - This is an outdoor space and not associated with a house.\n- E: rug - This implies a surface but does not indicate a place to put a table in a house.",
    "Given that a corner can be found in any room, it is a more versatile and common option compared to the other choices.",
    "Reassess the other options: Both the library and rug could potentially not apply to every house, and demonstration and football ground are clearly irrelevant.",
    "Since a corner is a logical and common area to place a table in almost any room of a house, it seems to be the best choice."
