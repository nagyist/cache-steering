  "steps": [
    "The question asks for what we have when we reference things we remember.",
    "When we recall information, we typically rely on what we already know or have learned in the past.",
    "The term \"prior knowledge\" refers to the information and understanding we already possess before encountering new information.",
    "Options A (memory cells) and D (brain cells) do not directly relate to the concept of recalling information from our past.",
    "Option B (learning about) indicates a process rather than a state of knowledge we have.",
    "Option E (nerve cells) relates to biological aspects of memory formation but isn't specifically about recall.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer that directly correlates with successfully referencing information from memory is \"prior knowledge.\""
