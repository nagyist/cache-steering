  "steps": [
    "To answer the question accurately, I need to identify the specific body part that lizards are known to be able to regenerate if it is cut off.",
    "Lizards are often recognized for their ability to regrow certain body parts, particularly their tails, after they have been shed or cut off.",
    "While some species of lizards can lose their legs, the most notable and well-studied regeneration capability is for the tail.",
    "I need to review the choices provided: A (bones), B (four legs), C (4 legs), D (backbone), E (tail).",
    "The option \"E: tail\" directly refers to the body part known for its regeneration in lizards.",
    "Options A, B, C, and D do not pertain to the regeneration ability of lizards, as lizards do not regenerate bones, legs (as a rule), or backbones.",
    "Therefore, the clear answer that fits the description of what lizards can regrow if cut off is option E."
