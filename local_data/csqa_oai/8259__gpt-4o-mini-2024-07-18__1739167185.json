  "query": "Question: The child was skipping pebbles in nature, so where was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: playground\nC: parking lot\nD: aquarium\nE: pond",
  "steps": [
    "Start by analyzing the activity of skipping pebbles. This is typically done near water bodies like lakes, rivers, or ponds.",
    "Consider the options provided. A street is unlikely because there are no pebbles to skip, and it's not a natural setting.",
    "Next, the playground usually has equipment for children, and while there may be some natural elements, it's not common for skipping pebbles.",
    "A parking lot also does not provide a natural setting for skipping pebbles, as it is primarily designed for vehicles.",
    "An aquarium is a facility for aquatic life, where one cannot skip pebbles because it's an enclosed environment without natural water bodies.",
    "The only option remaining is a pond. Ponds are natural water bodies where a child could easily find pebbles to skip.",
    "Confirm the reasoning: if the child is engaging in the activity of skipping pebbles, being near a pond makes the most sense.",
    "Check against all options one more time: \n- A street (no skipping),\n- A playground (not typical for this activity),\n- A parking lot (no natural skipping),\n- An aquarium (no skipping),\n- A pond (ideal for skipping pebbles)."
