  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what a jellyfish is. A jellyfish is a marine creature that typically inhabits the ocean.",
    "Next, consider the choices provided. The jellyfish is a creature that is largely found in bodies of water.",
    "The choice \"A: hand\" is not a suitable habitat for jellyfish, as they cannot live on dry land or attach themselves to a human's hand.",
    "The choice \"B: Mediterranean Sea\" is a specific location in the ocean where jellyfish are known to inhabit.",
    "The choice \"C: see\" is not relevant since it is not a physical location but rather a verb indicating vision.",
    "The choice \"D: supermarket\" is not an appropriate habitat for jellyfish, as they do not live in stores designed for grocery shopping.",
    "The choice \"E: store\" is also not a natural habitat for jellyfish, as similar to the supermarket, it is an artificial environment for selling goods.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the only choice that represents a natural habitat for jellyfish is \"B: Mediterranean Sea.\""
