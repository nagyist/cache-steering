  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that \"they installed lights\" in order to \"attract visitors.\" This implies that the lights were installed in a place where visitors are likely to gather or be attracted to.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices provided. Options A (carnival) and E (building) both seem like plausible places for installing lights to attract visitors. A carnival typically has many lights, and buildings often have decorative lighting to appeal to visitors.",
    "Choice B (plane) is unlikely since planes are not typically associated with attracting visitors through installed lights, as their primary purpose is transportation rather than attraction.",
    "Choice C (yacht) could attract visitors with lights, but yachts generally belong to private individuals and do not usually have the same level of visibility as public events or structures.",
    "Choice D (turned at night) does not refer to a location but rather describes a condition or state of being, so it is not relevant to the location of where the lights were installed.",
    "Considering the context of attracting visitors and the aim of the lighting, a carnival (A) would be a venue where lights would play a significant role in drawing attention and visitors, especially during night events.",
    "While a building (E) may also have lights for attraction, it would not be as commonly associated with this purpose in the same way a carnival would be. Therefore, the carnival stands out more in context to the expected atmosphere created with lights.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, A (carnival) remains the best answer as a location specifically designed for visitor attraction using lights."
