  "steps": [
    "Crabs are aquatic animals, and they primarily inhabit marine environments such as oceans and seas.",
    "The phrase \"crawl along the bottom\" suggests that the crabs are moving on the substrate of their habitat, which is typically found in bodies of water.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"bodies of water\" encompasses a wide range of aquatic environments where crabs would naturally be found crawling along the bottom.",
    "The other options:\n- B (fish market) refers to a human environment where fish are sold, not a natural habitat for crabs.\n- C (aquarium) represents a controlled environment but is not the natural habitat for most crabs.\n- D (saltwater) is a type of water but not a specific location where crabs crawl.\n- E (Galapagos) refers to a specific geographic location, which, although it is home to crabs, is not a general habitat.",
    "Given that crabs are found mostly in various types of bodies of water, the most fitting and general answer must be A."
