  "query": "Question: Billy was opening a new Deli. He wanted to open it in a place that gets a lot of traffic.  Where might he open it?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york city\nB: strip mall\nC: shopping center\nD: hamburg\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "The goal is to find a location for Billy's deli that experiences a high level of foot traffic.",
    "New York City is a bustling urban area known for high foot traffic, particularly in certain neighborhoods.",
    "A strip mall typically attracts moderate foot traffic, but it's generally not as busy as some other options.",
    "A shopping center often has a variety of stores and services, leading to higher foot traffic as people visit for multiple purposes.",
    "Hamburg is a city, but the mention is vague compared to New York City; its foot traffic might not be as high as NYC or well-known shopping centers.",
    "An office building can potentially have high foot traffic during working hours, but it may not draw consistent traffic throughout the day as people visit mainly for work purposes unless nearby amenities are present.",
    "Out of the options, New York City (A) and a shopping center (C) are the most likely to have high foot traffic at all times of day.",
    "Comparing A and C, while NYC has broad foot traffic, a shopping center is likely to attract diverse customers specifically looking for shopping and food options.",
    "Thus, a shopping center is likely the most consistent source of foot traffic for a deli, making it an excellent choice for Billy."
