  "steps": [
    "A cannon is a heavy artillery piece designed for launching projectiles over a distance. Therefore, it is most commonly associated with military or defensive structures.",
    "Option A, fort, refers to a fortified building or military stronghold that typically houses weapons, including cannons, for defense purposes.",
    "Option B, pay debts, does not logically relate to the presence of a cannon as it involves financial transactions, not military equipment.",
    "Option C, pirate ship, while it suggests cannons could be found there, is a water-based environment and not on land, which is required by the question.",
    "Option D, battle, is an event where cannons may be used, but it does not specify a location. It is less concrete compared to options that imply a specific physical space.",
    "Option E, war museum, is a place where weapons, including cannons, might be displayed for educational purposes, thus it is a valid option concerning the question.",
    "Comparing the valid options, A (fort) is specifically designed for military purposes and is a traditional land-based location for cannons, whereas E (war museum) is more about display and education but could also contain cannons.",
    "However, the context of \"where you would likely find\" suggests a more active or historical role as opposed to a static display, which reinforces that a fort is primarily designed to hold cannons.",
    "In conclusion, while both A and E are possible answers, the fort stands out as the most likely location for finding a cannon on land due to its purpose and historical significance."
