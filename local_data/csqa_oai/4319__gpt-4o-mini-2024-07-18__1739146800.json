  "query": "Question: A valid contract has to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: signed\nB: revised\nC: rejected\nD: written in blood\nE: written on paper",
  "steps": [
    "A valid contract typically requires mutual agreement between the parties involved.",
    "This agreement is usually represented by an offer and acceptance.",
    "Most contracts are enforceable when they are supported by consideration, which is something of value exchanged.",
    "While many contracts are indeed written documents, verbal contracts can also be valid depending on the jurisdiction and subject matter.",
    "The requirement for a contract to be \"signed\" may apply in certain cases, particularly for contracts that fall under the Statute of Frauds.",
    "Revising a contract means changing its terms, which is not a requirement for a valid contract to exist.",
    "Rejecting a contract means the parties do not accept the terms, which does not support the idea of a valid contract.",
    "The phrase \"written in blood\" is certainly not a standard or legitimate requirement for a valid contract.",
    "Similarly, \"written on paper\" may imply a preference for formalization, but it is not a strict requirement since verbal contracts exist.",
    "Considering the above reasoning, the most valid answer from the choices given that aligns with the basic requirements of a contract is \"signed\" as many legal frameworks necessitate a signature for enforceability."
