  "query": "Question: Sam and June bought loose corn because it was less expensive than what other variety?\n\nChoices:\nA: footloose\nB: bound\nC: packaged\nD: cobbed\nE: compact",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Sam and June bought loose corn, which suggests they are avoiding more expensive options.",
    "I need to identify which variety of corn is typically more expensive than loose corn.",
    "Loose corn refers to corn that is sold without packaging, while packaged corn generally means it is pre-packaged for sale.",
    "Packaged corn often incurs additional costs due to packaging materials and processing, making it less cost-effective compared to loose corn.",
    "The other options such as footloose, bound, cobbed, and compact are not typical varieties or forms of corn that are compared in terms of pricing with loose corn.",
    "Since packaged corn is a standard term associated with a higher price point compared to loose corn, it stands out among the choices.",
    "To verify, I confirm that loose corn is indeed less expensive because it does not include the costs associated with packaging.",
    "Given that 'packaged' directly contrasts with 'loose' in terms of market price, it makes logical sense that this is the correct comparison.",
    "I conclude that the most fitting option from the choices is C, as packaged corn is commonly more expensive than loose corn."
