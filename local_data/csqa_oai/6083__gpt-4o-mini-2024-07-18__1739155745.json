    "First, consider the nature of friendship and what is typically valued in a close friendship.",
    "Friendships often rely on trust and confidentiality, suggesting that one aspect of being a close friend is the ability to keep secrets.",
    "Next, think about the activities friends commonly engage in together, such as going shopping, meeting for lunch, or hanging out.",
    "While these activities may suggest good companionship, they do not inherently reflect the deeper emotional bonds shared by best friends.",
    "Borrowing money might indicate a level of trust, but it does not encompass the primary traits associated with being a best friend.",
