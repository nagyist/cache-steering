  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the sentence. The guests are arriving, and the focus is on preparing cookies, which implies that there is a need for a suitable presentation or serving method.",
    "Next, evaluate each of the answer choices in relation to how cookies might typically be served to guests. A jar might not be appropriate for serving cookies directly; rather, it's more for storage.",
    "The option 'house' does not make sense in the context. It is not a serving method or container for cookies.",
    "Considering 'mouth,' it again does not fit as it is not a serving method; rather, it implies consumption, which is not relevant here.",
    "Examine 'hubcap.' This is an automotive component and does not align with the serving of cookies at a gathering.",
    "The only remaining option is 'plate,' which is a common and practical choice for serving cookies to guests. It allows for easy access and presentation.",
    "Thus, based on the analysis of each choice relative to the context of serving cookies, 'plate' is clearly the most suitable answer."
