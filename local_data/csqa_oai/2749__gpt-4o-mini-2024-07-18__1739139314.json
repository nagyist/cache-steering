  "query": "Question: Debbie noticed that there was a ficus decorating the room while she was getting a perm.  Where was this plant?\n\nChoices:\nA: arboretum\nB: hair salon\nC: family room\nD: flower garden\nE: in the sink",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Debbie was getting a perm, which is a type of hair treatment. This suggests that she was in an establishment related to haircare.",
    "The ficus, which is a type of plant, was observed by Debbie while she was in the context of getting her hair done.",
    "The options provided include different locations: an arboretum, a hair salon, a family room, a flower garden, and inside the sink.",
    "An arboretum is a place where plants are cultivated for display and study, and it's unlikely that Debbie would be getting a perm there.",
    "A flower garden is typically an outdoor space planted with various types of flowers and is also not a reasonable location for a hair perm.",
    "The family room is a common indoor space in a home but does not typically have hair treatments taking place.",
    "The sink is a specific location that does not align with the scenario of getting a perm.",
    "The option that makes the most sense given the context is a hair salon, where both the perm and the ficus can realistically be present.",
    "Based on the analysis of these options, the most logical answer is the hair salon."
