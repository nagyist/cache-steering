  "query": "Question: If I were to suffer from sudden illness I would be within reason to visit where?\n\nChoices:\nA: nursing home\nB: hospital\nC: brain\nD: elderly person\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the phrase \"sudden illness.\" This implies a need for immediate medical attention or evaluation.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. A nursing home primarily provides long-term care for the elderly and may not be equipped to handle sudden illnesses.",
    "Then, consider the option of a hospital. Hospitals are specifically designed to treat medical emergencies and sudden illnesses, making it a reasonable choice.",
    "Next, examine the option \"brain.\" While the brain is important in terms of health, one cannot visit a brain itself; it is an organ and not a place for treatment.",
    "Now, consider the option of visiting an \"elderly person.\" While one could visit an elderly person, this is not relevant to the context of sudden illness.",
    "Finally, look at the option \"building.\" While a hospital is indeed a type of building, this term is too vague and does not specify a medical facility appropriate for sudden illness."
