  "query": "Question: Where would you go if you do not like the way your hair looks?\n\nChoices:\nA: person's head\nB: barber shop\nC: moustache\nD: fur rug\nE: mammals",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the problem: disliking the way your hair looks suggests a need for change or improvement of one\u2019s hairstyle.",
    "Next, consider the options provided. A barber shop is a place where people go specifically to get haircuts or hairstyling.",
    "Evaluate the other choices: A person's head refers to where hair is located, but does not address the need for change.",
    "Assess the choice \"moustache\": it is unrelated to the hair on one\u2019s head, as it refers to facial hair.",
    "Look at the choice \"fur rug\": this is unrelated to human hair and does not pertain to making a hairstyle change.",
    "Examine \"mammals\": while mammals can have various hair types, it does not relate to personal grooming or hairstyling.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most appropriate place to go for changing your hairstyle is a barber shop.",
    "Confirm that the selected option directly addresses the issue of hair dissatisfaction."
