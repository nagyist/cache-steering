  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to find an artisan market?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: village\nC: rural area\nD: buy fresh vegetables\nE: by a lake",
  "steps": [
    "An artisan market is typically characterized by handmade goods and local crafts, which are often promoted in community settings.",
    "Such markets are frequently established in places that encourage local artisans to showcase their work, making towns and villages typical locations.",
    "Towns are often larger and may have more foot traffic, making them a common site for artisan markets that attract shoppers.",
    "Villages, while smaller, may also host artisan markets, particularly in areas looking to promote local art and craft culture.",
    "Rural areas can have artisan markets, but they might not be as common as in specific towns or villages where there's more accessibility.",
    "The option of \"buy fresh vegetables\" does not align with the primary focus of an artisan market, which is more about crafts than food items.",
    "The option \"by a lake\" is specific and does not reflect the common characteristics of locations that host artisan markets.",
    "Considering that both towns and villages fit the profile, and towns are more likely due to their size and gathered population, I narrow it down further.",
    "While rural areas have artisan markets, they are less common compared to towns and villages.",
    "Ultimately, I conclude that artisan markets are most commonly found in towns, making option A a strong candidate. However, villages (B) could also be considered valid."
