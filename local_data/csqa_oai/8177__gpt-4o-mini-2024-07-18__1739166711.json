  "query": "Question: Sam didn't want to do it because he felt that it was nonessential.  But Joe insisted, because he believed that it was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: mandatory\nB: essential\nC: necessary\nD: needed\nE: required",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand Sam's perspective. He views the task as nonessential, indicating that he believes it is not important or urgent.",
    "Next, we look at Joe's position. He insists that the task should be done, suggesting that he sees it as important in some way.",
    "Now, we need to explore the meanings of the choices given: \n- A: mandatory means it is required by rule or law.\n- B: essential means absolutely necessary; extremely important.\n- C: necessary means required to be done, achieved, or present; needed.\n- D: needed implies that something is required because it is essential.\n- E: required also implies something that is obligatory or mandatory.",
    "Given that Joe insists on completing the task, it\u2019s likely that he considers it necessary or important.",
    "The word \"essential\" (B) suggests a high level of importance, similar to \"necessary\" (C), but the singular focus Joe insists upon leans towards \"necessary.\"",
    "\"Required\" (E) and \"mandatory\" (A) imply a stronger obligation than just necessary, but Joe's insistence does not imply law or rule.",
    "The term \"needed\" (D) also aligns closely with what Joe believes, but it feels a bit softer compared to \"necessary.\"",
    "After evaluating the nuances of these words, \"necessary\" (C) fits best as it captures Joe's belief that it is important without implying a strict obligation that might come with the other choices."
