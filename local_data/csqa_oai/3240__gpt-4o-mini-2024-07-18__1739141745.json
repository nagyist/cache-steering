  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is related to helicopter tours and bald eagles.",
    "Understanding that a bald eagle is a bird often associated with open spaces, natural landscapes, and typically found near large bodies of water or specific landmarks.",
    "Consider the options provided to determine which natural landmark would be most suitable for a bald eagle perspective.",
    "Evaluate option A (forrest) - while eagles can be found in forests, they are more commonly associated with larger geographical landmarks.",
    "Evaluate option B (grand canyon) - this is a significant natural landmark and could provide a great visual perspective for a bald eagle because of its size and the cliffs.",
    "Evaluate option C (colorado) - this is a state, not a single natural landmark, though it has many natural landmarks.",
    "Evaluate option D (mountains) - bald eagles are often found in mountainous regions, but \"mountains\" is too vague compared to a specific landmark like the Grand Canyon.",
    "Evaluate option E (u.s) - like option C, this refers to a large area and does not specify a natural landmark.",
    "Based on the evaluation, option B (grand canyon) stands out as the specific natural landmark most closely related to bald eagles in terms of a perceptive view from a helicopter tour."
