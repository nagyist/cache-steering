  "query": "Question: Where might baggage be searched?\n\nChoices:\nA: airports\nB: helicopter\nC: cruise ship\nD: train station\nE: room",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the different locations mentioned in the choices where baggage could potentially be searched.",
    "Airports are known for having strict security measures, including baggage searches for both carry-on and checked luggage. This makes airports a likely location.",
    "Next, I will consider a helicopter. Typically, helicopters do not have the same level of security or baggage check processes as larger airports or train stations.",
    "For cruise ships, while there may be some level of baggage search before boarding, it is not as standardized or thorough as in airports. Therefore, it is less likely than airports.",
    "Now, I will look at train stations. Many train stations do have security checks, and some may involve searching of luggage, especially in areas with high security threats.",
    "Lastly, considering a room, this is an uncommon place for baggage searches to take place in a legal context and would not generally involve official checks compared to the other options.",
    "Based on these evaluations, the most logical and common location for baggage searches is airports, followed by train stations.",
    "I will now summarize the most likely candidates: airplanes (A) and train stations (D). However, among these, airports (A) is more recognized for baggage searches."
