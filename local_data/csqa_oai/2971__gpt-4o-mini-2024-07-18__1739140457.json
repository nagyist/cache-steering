  "steps": [
    "To keep a surprise party a surprise, the primary objective is to maintain confidentiality regarding the event.",
    "A surprise party involves inviting guests and planning activities without the guest of honor knowing about them, which requires discretion.",
    "The most essential action is to keep the party a secret from the person who is being surprised.",
    "Options B (laugh), C (enjoy), D (scare), and E (send flowers) do not directly contribute to keeping the surprise intact.",
    "Laughing, enjoying, or scaring someone can occur during or after the surprise, but they do not help in maintaining the surprise itself.",
    "Sending flowers might be a nice gesture but has no relevance to the element of surprise.",
    "Thus, the only viable choice that directly connects to maintaining the surprise is to keep the secret about the party."
