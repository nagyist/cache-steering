  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where she could go to get a big wooden rod for her art project.",
    "We need to evaluate each option to see if it logically provides a source for a big wooden rod.",
    "Option A: hardware store - This is a well-known store that sells construction materials, including wooden rods. It is a reasonable choice.",
    "Option B: tree stump - A tree stump may contain wood, but it is not typically where one would go to obtain a pre-cut wooden rod. This option seems less practical.",
    "Option C: old clock - While an old clock may have wooden parts, it is not a typical source for a big wooden rod. This option is also not suitable.",
    "Option D: old houses - Old houses may contain wooden elements, but they are not a reliable or straightforward source for obtaining a big wooden rod. This option is somewhat ambiguous.",
    "Option E: broom closet - A broom closet is unlikely to have any substantial wooden materials to provide a big wooden rod. This option is not feasible.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most practical option for obtaining a big wooden rod is the hardware store."
