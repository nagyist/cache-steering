  "query": "Question: Where in your office would you store a highlight that you don't use often?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: case\nC: desk drawer\nD: campus book store\nE: lamp",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a highlight and how frequently it is used. Since the question specifies that it is not used often, it suggests a need for a less accessible storage option.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. An office supply store (A) and a campus book store (D) are places where highlights can be purchased, not stored.",
    "Now, assess the choice of a \"case\" (B). While a case can store highlights, it doesn't specify that it's within the office itself or convenient for storage. It could refer to a storage case that is outside the office.",
    "The option \"lamp\" (E) doesn't logically connect as a storage location for office supplies like a highlight. It's an object that serves a lighting purpose.",
    "This leaves us with \u201cdesk drawer\u201d (C). A desk drawer is a common storage area for office items that are not used regularly, allowing for easy access when needed but keeping it out of immediate sight and organized.",
    "Considering that highlights need to be kept safe and organized but are not used frequently, placing them in a desk drawer fits perfectly as a suitable option.",
    "Lastly, confirming all reasoning points, the desk drawer is indeed a practical choice for the scenario presented in the question."
