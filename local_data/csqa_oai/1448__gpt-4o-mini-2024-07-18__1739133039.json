    "The question asks for a common phrase that suggests a lack of intelligence or capability.",
    "A common expression related to someone perceived as stupid is \"no brains,\" implying a lack of intellect.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, I need to match this expression to one of them.",
    "Choice A: \"names\" does not relate to intelligence; it could refer to identity, but not intelligence.",
    "Choice B: \"dress\" doesn't connect to the idea of intelligence either; it's more about appearance.",
    "Choice C: \"brains\" directly relates to the phrase about someone lacking intelligence. This is very likely to be the correct choice.",
    "Choice D: \"brown hair\" is irrelevant to intelligence; it's merely a physical trait.",
    "Choice E: \"two eyes,\" like the previous choice, is not related to intelligence but rather a physical characteristic.",
