  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a place that usually does not have any pillows.",
    "Let's analyze each option to identify whether it typically contains pillows or not.",
    "Option A: Home - Typically has pillows, especially in bedrooms and living areas.",
    "Option B: Rest area - Often found in public places like bus or train stations, which may not have pillows available for comfort.",
    "Option C: Make seat softer - This is not a place, but an action or description, so it is not relevant here.",
    "Option D: Go to bed - This phrase describes an action rather than a place, so it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Option E: Bedroom - Generally, bedrooms are places where pillows are present, especially on beds.",
    "After considering each option, the rest area (Option B) seems the most fitting, as it is a public location typically lacking pillows."
