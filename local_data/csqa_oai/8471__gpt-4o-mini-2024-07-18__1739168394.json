  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the regular muscles targeted by running, particularly in the context of cardio and heart health.",
    "Running is a physical activity that primarily uses the lower body muscles. It involves various muscle groups.",
    "I consider the choices available: A (thighs), B (legs), C (movement), D (use of muscles), and E (agility).",
    "The term \"legs\" is a more inclusive term that encompasses multiple muscle groups, including the thighs, calves, hamstrings, and quadriceps.",
    "The term \"thighs\" refers specifically to the upper part of the leg and does not encompass the entire leg musculature involved in running.",
    "The options C, D, and E seem unrelated to specific muscle groups, as they refer more to concepts or uses rather than anatomical regions.",
    "Since running predominantly targets the muscles in the legs overall, this leads me to choose option B.",
    "I double-check that no options other than A and B specifically refer to muscle groups involved in running.",
    "As A (thighs) is specific and incomplete while B (legs) is comprehensive and appropriate, I finalize my answer."
