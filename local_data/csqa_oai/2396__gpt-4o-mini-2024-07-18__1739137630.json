  "steps": [
    "First, I will interpret what \"space for some food\" could mean. This suggests a container or area that can hold food.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option to see if it can hold food.",
    "Option A: \"universe\" does not have the capacity to hold food in a conventional sense; it refers more to the vastness of space.",
    "Option B: \"suitcase\" can hold food, but it is primarily used for carrying personal belongings, not explicitly for food storage.",
    "Option C: \"jar\" is designed to hold food, often used for storing items like preserves or snacks. It has a specific function related to food.",
    "Option D: \"stomach\" is an organ that holds food temporarily for digestion but is a part of the biological system, not a container like the others.",
    "Option E: \"box\" is a general term that can hold various items, including food. However, it doesn't have a specific food-related connotation unless specified.",
    "Comparing all options, \"jar\" (Option C) stands out as it is explicitly designed for food storage, while other options either are not containers or do not primarily serve that purpose."
