  "query": "Question: What can a country do when it has jealousy but a person cannot do?\n\nChoices:\nA: hug\nB: wage war\nC: compete\nD: judge\nE: love else",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the meaning of jealousy. Jealousy often involves feelings of insecurity, fear, and envy, typically towards someone else's success or advantages.",
    "Next, we need to identify how jealousy manifests differently in a country compared to an individual. A person might feel jealousy in personal relationships or competition but typically doesn't take actions on a national scale.",
    "A country, on the other hand, may exhibit jealousy in the context of international relations, especially concerning economic power, territorial disputes, or resource control.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices given to determine which action is unique to a country in the context of jealousy.",
    "A: hug - This action is personal and can be done by individuals, so it is not exclusive to a country.",
    "B: wage war - This is an act that a country can engage in, typically viewed as a result of intense rivalry or jealousy towards another country over resources, territory, or influence.",
    "C: compete - Both countries and individuals can compete, hence this is not exclusive to nations.",
    "D: judge - Judging can be a personal or collective act, and is not unique to countries.",
    "E: love else - This is a personal action and does not fit the context of a country's action based on jealousy.",
    "Based on this analysis, the action that clearly distinguishes a country from an individual in the context of jealousy is \"wage war,\" as it is a large-scale action that individuals cannot undertake."
