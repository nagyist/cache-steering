  "query": "Question: THe apiarist bought a new queen, where was the queen bound?\n\nChoices:\nA: england\nB: beehive\nC: farmyard\nD: monarchy\nE: deck of cards",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"apiarist\" refers to someone who keeps bees, particularly honeybees. This suggests that the context involves bees and beekeeping.",
    "The mention of a \"new queen\" specifically relates to bee colonies because in beekeeping, a queen bee is crucial for the colony's reproduction and survival.",
    "Now, I need to consider where a queen bee would be \"bound.\" In the context of beekeeping, a queen bee is typically bound to her hive, where she will lay eggs and oversee the colony.",
    "Looking at the choices provided: \n- A: \"England\" doesn't relate to where a queen bee would be bound; it references a geographical location.\n- B: \"Beehive\" directly connects to where the queen bee resides and performs her duties.\n- C: \"Farmyard\" could loosely relate, but it's too broad; it doesn't specifically denote where the queen bee functions.\n- D: \"Monarchy\" is irrelevant in this context unless discussing a thematic connection to \"queen,\" which is not applicable here.\n- E: \"Deck of cards\" is completely unrelated to the context of beekeeping.",
    "The most fitting connection regarding the place 'bound' for a queen bee is her beehive. The other options do not provide a relevant or accurate association.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing all the options, I can confidently conclude that the queen is bound to the beehive."
