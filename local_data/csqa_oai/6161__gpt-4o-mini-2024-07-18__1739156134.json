  "query": "Question: Where is too much snow likely to cause damage?\n\nChoices:\nA: north pole\nB: trees\nC: surface of earth\nD: roof\nE: ground",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the characteristics of heavy snowfall and its impacts. Too much snow can accumulate and create significant weight.",
    "Next, I analyze the options provided. The north pole, being an icy region, is accustomed to heavy snowfall and might be less impacted compared to other locations.",
    "Then, I consider trees. While heavy snow can cause branches to break, this is relatively localized and involves individual trees rather than widespread damage.",
    "Next, I evaluate the surface of the earth. Snow is common, and while it can impact soil and plants, it generally does not cause direct structural damage.",
    "Now, I turn to roofs. Roofs are structures that are vulnerable to the weight of accumulated snow. Excessive snow can lead to roof collapse if the snow exceeds the design load limits.",
    "I also look at the ground as an option. While ground saturation from melting snow can cause issues, it is less about direct damage from snow accumulation and more about subsequent effects.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it becomes apparent that the most direct and likely point of damage due to heavy snowfall would be roofs, as they are specifically designed to hold a certain amount of weight.",
    "Considering all of the above reasoning, the answer where too much snow is likely to cause damage is clearly related to roofs, as they are prone to collapse under excessive weight."
