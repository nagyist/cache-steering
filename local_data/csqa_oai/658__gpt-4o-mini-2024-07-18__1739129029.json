  "query": "Question: Where above your kitchen sink could you store canned food?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: oven\nC: grocery store\nD: pantry\nE: cellar",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where canned food can be stored above a kitchen sink. This implies we need to focus on storage options that are both accessible and practical for kitchen use.",
    "Option A: cupboard - A cupboard is a common feature above kitchen sinks where dishes, food, and other kitchen items can be stored. This seems like a valid option.",
    "Option B: oven - An oven is not a suitable place to store food, especially canned food, as it is intended for cooking, not storage. Thus, this option can be ruled out.",
    "Option C: grocery store - A grocery store is not a location for storing food above a kitchen sink; it's a place to purchase food items. This option is irrelevant and can be eliminated.",
    "Option D: pantry - A pantry is often a storage area for canned goods and food items, but it is not specifically stated to be above a kitchen sink. It might be near, but not directly above.",
    "Option E: cellar - While a cellar is a storage area for food, it is typically below ground level and wouldn't be positioned above a kitchen sink. This eliminates it as a possible answer.",
    "Upon evaluation, the best and most logical choice, considering the location \"above your kitchen sink,\u201d is a cupboard, since it is functioning as a storage space right above the sink."
