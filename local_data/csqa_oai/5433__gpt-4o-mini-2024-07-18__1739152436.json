  "query": "Question: Bill crossed a boundary in his daily life and transgressed against an important rule of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: delineating political unit\nB: sporting event\nC: society\nD: basketball\nE: basketball",
  "steps": [
    "Bill's action of crossing a boundary suggests that he violated a social norm or rule that is generally expected in day-to-day interactions.",
    "Options A (delineating political unit), B (sporting event), D (basketball), and E (basketball) are more specific scenarios and less likely to encompass a broad spectrum of rules that apply to an individual's daily life.",
    "The term \"transgressed\" indicates that Bill broke a moral or ethical guideline, which is generally associated with societal expectations rather than the other specific contexts listed.",
    "Given that option C (society) is the only answer that refers directly to the larger framework of rules and norms that govern behavior among individuals, it aligns best with the idea of transgression in daily life.",
    "Therefore, while the other options may involve rules, they do not pertain to the broad and general transgressions of societal norms that are typically expected in daily interactions."
