  "query": "Question: Where can you find the most authentic Japanese restaurant?\n\nChoices:\nA: downtown\nB: major city\nC: california\nD: stripmall\nE: tokio",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where Japanese cuisine is most popular and authentic.",
    "Japan, particularly its capital, Tokyo, is known for its rich culinary culture, making it a strong candidate.",
    "While California has a significant Japanese population and many authentic restaurants, it is not Japan itself.",
    "Looking at \"downtown\" or \"major city\" does not specify a location known for authenticity.",
    "\"Stripmall\" might have Japanese restaurants, but these are often less authentic compared to those in Japan.",
    "Tokyo, being the heart of Japan's cuisine, hosts a variety of authentic Japanese restaurants, from traditional to modern styles.",
    "Therefore, options A (downtown) and B (major city) could indicate places in the U.S. that may not guarantee authenticity compared to Japan itself.",
    "California has notable Japanese restaurants, but Tokyo is the ultimate location for the most authentic experience.",
    "Thus, among the given options, \"Tokio\" stands out as the location with genuine, traditional Japanese cuisine."
