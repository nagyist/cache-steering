  "query": "Question: What kind of life is not acknowledged in the secular world?\n\nChoices:\nA: short term\nB: religious\nC: eternal\nD: beyond\nE: frequent",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a kind of life that is not recognized or acknowledged in the secular world.",
    "The secular world typically focuses on tangible, physical experiences rather than spiritual or religious beliefs.",
    "\"Short term\" refers to a duration of life that is commonly acknowledged in daily, secular contexts as it pertains to immediate experiences.",
    "\"Religious\" life is typically recognized in both secular and religious communities, although secularism may critique or disregard some religious aspects.",
    "\"Eternal\" life implies a spiritual or religious belief in life after death or a lasting existence beyond the temporal, which is often not acknowledged in secular viewpoints.",
    "\"Beyond\" is a term that also hints at something transcendent or outside of what is understood or acknowledged in a secular manner, which could relate to eternal but is less specific.",
    "\"Frequent\" refers to the regularity or occurrence of something, and does not inherently imply a life that is acknowledged or unacknowledged.",
    "Upon examining each option, \u201ceternal\u201d life stands out as the concept most often dismissed by secular views, which tend to focus on observable, immediate realities rather than metaphysical beliefs.",
    "Both \"beyond\" and \"eternal\" are related concepts, but \"eternal\" specifically implies an existence that continues indefinitely, aligning closely with religious beliefs absent in a secular context."
