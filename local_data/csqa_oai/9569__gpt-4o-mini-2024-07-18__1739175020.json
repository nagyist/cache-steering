  "query": "Question: What do people do sometimes when they find a good deal?\n\nChoices:\nA: race cars\nB: believe in god\nC: fight each other\nD: fear death\nE: murder each other",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of finding a good deal. Typically, this involves shopping or making a purchase.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided to see how they relate to shopping or finding a good deal.",
    "Choice A (race cars) does not relate to the context of shopping or deals.",
    "Choice B (believe in god) is not related to the act of finding a good deal.",
    "Choice C (fight each other) could potentially relate to competitive situations, but it's not a typical reaction to finding a good deal.",
    "Choice D (fear death) is unrelated to the context of finance or shopping.",
    "Choice E (murder each other) is extreme and does not correlate with normal human behavior in response to a good deal.",
    "Since options A, B, D, and E are unrelated or extreme, they are not plausible.",
    "While choice C speaks to potential competition or conflicts arising from a good deal, it is still unlikely and out of the ordinary reaction to finding a sale.",
    "All considered, it appears none of the choices directly align with typical behavior upon finding a good deal, reflecting a misunderstanding of how people typically react in consumer situations."
