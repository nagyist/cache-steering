  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a country associated with many amphitheatres, implying a historical and cultural significance related to such structures.",
    "Amphitheatres are large, open-air venues where public events, performances, and games were held in ancient times.",
    "Greece is known for its rich history in theater and architecture, particularly in the context of ancient civilization.",
    "The Greeks built numerous amphitheatres that are still viewed as significant archaeological sites today, such as the Theatre of Epidaurus.",
    "While Rome (Italy) is also famous for its amphitheatres (like the Colosseum), the question specifically asks for a \"country\" rather than the broader context of where amphitheatres might be found.",
    "The choice of \"Greece\" (C) fits best since it is often directly linked to the origins of theatre and amphitheatres, specifically in a classical context.",
    "The other choices provided (A: movie house, B: underground, D: park, E: outside) do not pertain to countries or the concept of amphitheatres in the same historical context.",
    "Given the significant relationship between Greece and amphitheatres, it is logical to conclude that Greece is the correct answer in this context."
