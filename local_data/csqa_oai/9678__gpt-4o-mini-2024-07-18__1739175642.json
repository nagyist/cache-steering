  "query": "Question: The king strolled through his back courtyard, where was near?\n\nChoices:\nA: palace\nB: garden\nC: country estate\nD: large house\nE: suburbs",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the meaning of \"back courtyard.\" It implies an outdoor area that is likely adjacent to a main building used for leisure or utility.",
    "Next, a \"courtyard\" is generally associated with residential or larger buildings, such as a palace or a large house, rather than an open area found in the suburbs or a country estate.",
    "Since the king is involved, it's more probable that he is near a place of significance and authority, potentially a palace.",
    "Gardens are often present in courtyards, but given the context of a king, it seems unlikely the emphasis is solely on a garden.",
    "The country estate suggests a larger, more rural area, which seems less relevant given that the term \"back courtyard\" indicates a space immediately adjoining a building.",
    "The suburbs would typically refer to a residential area outside a central city, which doesn't fit with the idea of a king's courtyard.",
    "Comparing options A (palace) and D (large house), a palace is more associated with royalty than a large house, which might belong to a wealthier individual but lacks the royal connotation.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that the king was strolling in an area typical of a royal setting, which further eliminates options C, D, and E.",
    "After thorough consideration, the best answer indicates the location is a palace as it aligns directly with the context of a king."
