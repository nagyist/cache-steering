  "query": "Question: The small dog was something of a homebody, it loved naps on the couch where?\n\nChoices:\nA: big house\nB: dog show\nC: small apartment\nD: limousine\nE: living room",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the small dog enjoys being indoors and prefers a cozy environment for naps.",
    "The phrase \"loved naps on the couch\" suggests a domestic setting commonly found in residential spaces rather than public or unusual places.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choice A: \"big house.\" A big house could certainly have a couch, but it does not strongly convey the idea of being a 'homebody' in a cozy, intimate space.",
    "Next, choice B: \"dog show.\" This is an event where dogs are exhibited, which does not relate to the concept of a homebody, as it's an outside or competitive environment.",
    "For choice C: \"small apartment.\" A small apartment implies a limited and cozy living space, which aligns well with the idea of a homebody and the comfort of napping on a couch.",
    "For choice D: \"limousine.\" This is a luxury vehicle, not a nurturing environment for a homebody dog; it is usually associated with transportation rather than a resting place.",
    "Lastly, option E: \"living room.\" This is a specific part of a home where couches are typically found, making it a strong candidate for where the dog loves to nap.",
    "Considering both C (small apartment) and E (living room), the context of the sentence suggests that while the dog could live in a small apartment, the couch explicitly indicates a living room, the most appropriate and specific location for the mentioned behavior of the dog."
