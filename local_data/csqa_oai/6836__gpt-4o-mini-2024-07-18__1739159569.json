  "query": "Question: A bald eagle flew through the heavens above what conversely named erosion?\n\nChoices:\nA: colorado\nB: hells canyon\nC: sky\nD: south lake tahoe\nE: central idaho",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a \"bald eagle,\" which is often associated with the sky or open spaces, particularly in the context of flight.",
    "The phrase \"conversely named erosion\" suggests looking for a term or name that contrasts with \"sky\" or could signify erosion associated with a natural feature.",
    "\"Hells Canyon\" could refer to a deep gorge or canyon and might be seen as a contrasting term to \"sky,\" as it is below rather than above.",
    "Next, I will analyze the other options in the context of erosion as well:\n- Colorado has the Colorado River which has eroded canyons, but does not contrast significantly with \"sky.\"\n- South Lake Tahoe is more about a lake than erosion.\n- Central Idaho does not directly resonate with erosion in a way that contrasts with \"sky.\"",
    "Given the associations, \"Hells Canyon\" stands out as a geographical feature that embodies deep erosion and can be viewed as contrasting with the concept of flight in the sky.",
    "Therefore, after reviewing the context of erosion and the associations with the bald eagle, the \"conversely named erosion\" that aligns with the question is \"Hells Canyon.\""
