  "query": "Question: The mother was punishing her children, she raised her voice to do what to them?\n\nChoices:\nA: court system\nB: authoritarian\nC: ignore\nD: avoid\nE: yell at",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario presents a mother punishing her children by raising her voice.",
    "Raising one's voice is typically associated with expressing anger or frustration rather than calm communication.",
    "In the context of punishment, raising her voice is intended to assert authority and get the children's attention.",
    "Among the provided choices, \"court system,\" \"authoritarian,\" \"ignore,\" \"avoid,\" and \"yell at\" are all options that need to be considered.",
    "\"Authoritarian\" reflects a style of governance or parenting that is strict, but it does not directly describe what the mother was doing.",
    "\"Ignoring\" does not align with raising her voice; actually, it's the opposite of what she is doing.",
    "\"Avoid\" also does not correlate with raising one's voice, as avoiding a situation is a passive action.",
    "That leaves us with \"yell at\" as a potential candidate since it directly captures the action of raising one's voice in a commanding way.",
    "To confirm, \"yell at\" describes a behavior that fits the notion of punishing and gaining compliance through vocal intensity.",
    "Therefore, the correct choice that represents what the mother was trying to do by raising her voice is \"yell at.\""
