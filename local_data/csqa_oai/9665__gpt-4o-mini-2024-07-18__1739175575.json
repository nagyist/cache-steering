  "query": "Question: If I want to write a proper sentence, what must I make sure it is not?\n\nChoices:\nA: incorrect\nB: incomplete\nC: impolite\nD: inappropriate\nE: prison",
  "steps": [
    "A proper sentence must be grammatically correct to convey a clear meaning.",
    "An incomplete sentence does not express a complete thought or has missing components.",
    "Being impolite refers to the tone and manner of communication, which while important in communication, does not define the grammatical correctness of a sentence.",
    "Inappropriateness relates to the context in which the sentence is used, rather than its grammaticality.",
    "\"Prison\" is irrelevant to the structure or appropriateness of a sentence in grammar.",
    "Thus, we can eliminate options C, D, and E based on their irrelevance to sentence structure.",
    "Between options A and B, both could technically apply to a proper sentence; however, \"incomplete\" directly speaks to the necessity of a proper sentence, while \"incorrect\" could refer to grammatical errors.",
    "The key requirement for a proper sentence is that it must not be incomplete, meaning it fails to convey a complete thought."
