  "query": "Question: How will skin feel after contact with poison ivy?\n\nChoices:\nA: feel lumpy\nB: itches\nC: feel cold\nD: feel pressure\nE: feel clammy",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to recall what poison ivy is and the typical skin reactions it causes upon contact. Poison ivy contains an oil called urushiol, which can trigger allergic reactions in many people.",
    "Second, I consider the common symptoms associated with an allergic reaction to poison ivy. Typically, these reactions can include redness, swelling, and itching.",
    "Third, I analyze the choices provided. Feeling lumpy (A) does not directly correlate with a typical reaction to poison ivy. Itching (B) is a common symptom of poison ivy as the rash develops.",
    "Fourth, feeling cold (C) is not a common symptom associated with poison ivy. Instead, skin might feel warm due to inflammation but not cold.",
    "Fifth, feeling pressure (D) does not relate to the symptoms caused by poison ivy. Pressure sensation is not a hallmark of the rash associated with it.",
    "Sixth, feeling clammy (E) is also not related. Clamminess might occur if one is sweating or anxious, but it is not a direct symptom of poison ivy.",
    "Seventh, I confirm that itching is indeed the most significant and bothersome symptom related to contact with poison ivy.",
    "Eighth, since itching is prevalent in all cases of poison ivy contact, I can conclude that it is the most likely answer."
