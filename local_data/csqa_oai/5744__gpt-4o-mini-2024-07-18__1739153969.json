  "query": "Question: The bookshop specializes in course texts, where is it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: mall\nB: sea shore\nC: shopping center\nD: student union\nE: department store",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine where a bookshop that specializes in course texts is likely to be located.",
    "Considering bookshops that focus on course texts, they would want to be in areas where students frequently visit.",
    "Shopping centers and malls may have a diverse customer base, but they do not specifically cater to students.",
    "A \"student union\" is typically found on college or university campuses and serves as a gathering place for students, making it a strong candidate.",
    "\"Department stores\" generally offer a wide range of products but are not specifically focused on educational materials.",
    "The choice of \"sea shore\" seems irrelevant to the context of a bookshop specializing in course texts.",
    "Comparing the possibilities, a \"shopping center\" could also be a feasible location, as they often host various shops, including bookstores.",
    "However, the most direct location for students looking for course texts would be a place that is specifically structured for their needs.",
    "Given that the student union typically provides resources for students, including materials related to their courses, it is the most likely location for a bookshop focused on course texts.",
    "Therefore, while both the student union and shopping center are plausible, the student union stands out as the most likely option."
