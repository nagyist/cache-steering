  "query": "Question: Where is somewhere you stop to go to the bathroom when on the road?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: rest area\nC: at hotel\nD: friend's house\nE: educational area",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify places where people typically stop when traveling long distances.",
    "Rest stops or rest areas are specifically designed for travelers to take breaks, including using bathroom facilities.",
    "While hotels also have restrooms, they are not usually a stop for bathroom breaks unless someone is staying there overnight.",
    "A school, while it has bathrooms, is not a common place to stop for most travelers on the road.",
    "A friend's house would also be an informal stop and is not a typical choice during long road trips.",
    "An educational area is vague and does not imply a designated bathroom stop for road trips.",
    "Among all the choices, a rest area is expressly built for road travelers and is the most logical answer for a quick bathroom stop.",
    "I\u2019ll compare the other options again to validate the choice. A school, hotel, friend's house, and educational areas are not commonly chosen for quick stops compared to rest areas.",
    "Thus, evaluating all the options confirms that the best answer is the rest area."
