  "query": "Question: Where could you buy an old pie safe with decorative tin?\n\nChoices:\nA: shopping bag\nB: trash\nC: antique store\nD: landfill\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a pie safe is. A pie safe is a type of cupboard used to store pies and other food items, typically with decorative metal screens or panels to allow air circulation while keeping pests away.",
    "Next, consider where old or antique furniture items, such as a pie safe, are typically sold. Antique stores are well-known places for selling vintage or collectible furniture.",
    "Evaluate the other options: \n- A shopping bag is an item used to carry purchases and not a place to buy furniture.\n- A trash can typically contains items that are discarded, not something you would purchase.\n- A landfill is a site for waste disposal, again not a place to buy anything.\n- A cupboard is a type of furniture, but not a location.",
    "Since antique stores specialize in selling old furniture and collectibles, they would very likely have decorative tin pie safes available for purchase.",
    "None of the other options provide a reasonable or logical location where one would find or buy an old pie safe with decorative tin."
