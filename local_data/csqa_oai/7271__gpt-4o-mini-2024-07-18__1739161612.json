  "query": "Question: The rotor was very loud and moved a lot of air, but it was how the what was able to lift straight up?\n\nChoices:\nA: electric motor\nB: jet engine\nC: rotator\nD: train\nE: helicopter",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a rotor that is loud and moves a lot of air. This implies that it involves an aerial device that uses rotor mechanics to generate lift.",
    "Given the options, we need to focus on devices that utilize rotors. Among the choices, \"electric motor\" and \"jet engine\" do not directly relate to the concept of lift through rotors.",
    "\"Train\" is also not applicable as it operates on tracks and does not have rotors that lift it.",
    "This leaves us with \"rotator\" and \"helicopter\". The term \"rotator\" is too vague and not a commonly recognized vehicle or device.",
    "A helicopter specifically uses rotors to create lift, allowing it to rise straight up. This matches the description of the loud rotor moving air to achieve vertical lift.",
    "I can confirm that among all the options, only \"helicopter\" is known for having a loud rotor that facilitates its ability to lift straight up."
