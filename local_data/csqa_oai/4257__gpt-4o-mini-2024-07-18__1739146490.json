  "query": "Question: Where do you get petrol?\n\nChoices:\nA: burn hot\nB: fuel tank\nC: burn hot\nD: car\nE: gas station",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what \"petrol\" is. Petrol is a type of fuel used primarily in internal combustion engines, commonly referred to as gasoline in some countries.",
    "Next, we observe that petrol is not something that can be stored in a vehicle directly, but rather it is stored in a specific location.",
    "We examine the choices given for where one can acquire petrol. Options A (burn hot) and C (burn hot) do not relate to a physical location where petrol can be obtained.",
    "Next, option B (fuel tank) refers to a part of the vehicle that holds petrol, but it does not serve as the source from which petrol is obtained.",
    "Now, looking at option D (car), while a car uses petrol, it is not the location where petrol is retrieved.",
    "Finally, option E (gas station) is a place specifically designed for selling petrol and is where individuals typically go to refuel their vehicles.",
    "Since \"gas station\" is the only option that directly answers the question of where to get petrol, we conclude that this is the correct choice."
