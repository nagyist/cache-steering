  "steps": [
    "To determine where families typically begin, it's essential to analyze the nature of family formation and unity.",
    "A wedding is a traditional event that marks the formal union of two individuals, often leading to the creation of a family.",
    "The dinner table is a place where families often gather, fostering communication and connection, but it does not denote the beginning of a family.",
    "A supermarket is a place for shopping and obtaining food and supplies, but it does not relate to the beginning of familial relationships.",
    "\"Dinner together\" suggests family unity but also doesn't signify the actual beginning of a family unit.",
    "The park can be a place for families to spend time together, but it is not a defining starting point for family formation.",
    "From the above analysis, a wedding stands out as the most significant event that initiates a family structure.",
    "All other options depict moments or places where families can thrive, but they don't singularly represent the formation or beginning of families like a wedding does."
