  "query": "Question: The cows were lost in the city and hated the noise, what did they long for?\n\nChoices:\nA: milk machine\nB: farmyard\nC: countryside\nD: fairgrounds\nE: long horns",
  "steps": [
    "The cows are described as \"lost in the city,\" indicating they are out of their natural environment.",
    "Being in the city suggests that they are experiencing an environment that is very different from their typical habitat.",
    "The phrase \"hated the noise\" implies that the cows are uncomfortable in the city, where there is likely a lot of urban noise.",
    "Cows are typically associated with rural areas, where the environment is quieter and more peaceful compared to a bustling city.",
    "Considering this, the cows would likely long for a setting that is tranquil and familiar to them.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, \"farmyard\" (B) and \"countryside\" (C) are both rural options, while \"fairgrounds\" (D) is associated with a noisy environment, and \"long horns\" (E) is unrelated to their location or comfort.",
    "Among the rural options, the \"countryside\" (C) is broader and may refer to a quieter area outside of the farm, while \"farmyard\" (B) implies a specific type of rural setting.",
    "Cows often prefer open spaces, which are generally more abundant in the countryside compared to a constrained farmyard.",
    "Considering all of this, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the cows long for the quieter, more peaceful \"countryside\" (C)."
