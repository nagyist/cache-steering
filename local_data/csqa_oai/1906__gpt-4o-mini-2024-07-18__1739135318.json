  "steps": [
    "To determine a good place to put a rosebush, we need to consider the growth requirements of rosebushes. They typically prefer full sun, well-drained soil, and sufficient space to grow.",
    "A park (Choice A) could be a suitable location since it often provides space and sunlight, but it depends on the park's specific management policies regarding planting.",
    "Delaware (Choice B) is a location and could potentially have suitable conditions for a rosebush, but it is not a specific area for planting.",
    "A lawn (Choice C) is generally a good place to put a rosebush because it is usually well-maintained and often receives ample sunlight. Lawn areas typically allow for the necessary care and attention.",
    "Choice D (planting) is vague and does not specify a location but rather refers to the act itself.",
    "Washington (Choice E) is also a geographical location, similar to Delaware, and not a specific demonstrable place for planting a rosebush.",
    "Considering the options, the lawn (Choice C) stands out as the most practical and direct answer to the question about where to place a rosebush. It has suitable conditions for growth, and it is a specific area that is commonly used for planting."
