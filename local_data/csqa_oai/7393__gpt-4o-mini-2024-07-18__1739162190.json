  "query": "Question: What do people do when they are in a fight?\n\nChoices:\nA: facing each other\nB: get angry\nC: kiss\nD: gather together\nE: learn from each other",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider what generally happens during a fight. Typically, emotions are heightened, and individuals may confront each other.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices available. The phrase \"facing each other\" suggests a direct confrontation, which is common in a fight.",
    "Then, I analyze the emotional state during a fight. Getting angry is a typical response, as fights often arise from conflict and frustration.",
    "The option \"kiss\" seems out of place in the context of a fight, as kissing implies affection rather than conflict.",
    "\"Gather together\" does not precisely describe the interaction in a fight; typically, people might be more isolated or confrontational.",
    "\"Learn from each other\" appears unlikely during a fight, as the primary focus is generally on confrontation rather than education or understanding.",
    "Comparing the two relevant options, \"facing each other\" directly describes the physical aspect of a fight, while \"get angry\" describes the emotional reaction.",
    "In many cases, both \"facing each other\" and \"get angry\" occur together during a fight, but \"facing each other\" speaks specifically to the fighting context.",
    "Deciding between the two relevant options, I find that \"get angry\" more broadly encapsulates the emotional aspect during conflicts, which is a central part of fights.",
    "Finally, considering the nature of fights, \"get angry\" is the most essential and common behavior in the context of a fight, making it the best answer."
