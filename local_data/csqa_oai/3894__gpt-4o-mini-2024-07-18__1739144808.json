  "query": "Question: Where could I find a paper clip?\n\nChoices:\nA: file cabinet\nB: file folder\nC: hospital\nD: cabinet\nE: desk drawer",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the common places where paper clips are typically stored or found.",
    "Consider an office environment, where paper clips are frequently used. Common locations in an office include desks, cabinets, and filing systems.",
    "Evaluate option A: file cabinet. This is a likely place since paper clips are often used with files within the cabinet.",
    "Next, evaluate option B: file folder. While paper clips can be inside a folder, they are not typically found there unless placed specifically by someone using them.",
    "Now, assess option C: hospital. Although hospitals have office supplies, it is less common for them to be a primary location for finding paper clips.",
    "Next, analyze option D: cabinet. Like file cabinets, this is plausible but too vague without specifying what type of cabinet (e.g., office cabinet, kitchen cabinet).",
    "Finally, consider option E: desk drawer. This is a very common location to find paper clips as they are often stored in desk drawers along with other stationery items.",
    "Among all the options, both A (file cabinet) and E (desk drawer) are highly likely places to find a paper clip, but E (desk drawer) seems the most direct and personal as it is typically where one would individually store stationery."
