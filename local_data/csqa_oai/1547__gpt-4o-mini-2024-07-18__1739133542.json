  "query": "Question: The man needed representation for arbitration, and a professional decided on giving assistance, what are they trying to avoid?\n\nChoices:\nA: death\nB: law suits\nC: out of pocket\nD: feel loved\nE: surgery",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of arbitration. Arbitration is a form of dispute resolution outside of the court system, often used to avoid lengthy legal battles.",
    "Second, recognize that the man is seeking representation for arbitration, which implies he wants to resolve a conflict without escalating it to a court case.",
    "Third, understand that the professional providing assistance aims to facilitate this process efficiently. Their involvement is likely to help avoid the complications that can arise in formal legal proceedings.",
    "Fourth, consider the possible outcomes if arbitration fails or if not done properly, which could lead to escalation and potential lawsuits.",
    "Fifth, evaluate the answer choices provided. \"Death\" is generally unrelated to arbitration, while \"surgery\" and \"feeling loved\" are irrelevant in this context.",
    "Sixth, analyze the options related to legal outcomes. \"Law suits\" clearly pertains to what they are trying to avoid by resolving the matter through arbitration.",
    "Seventh, \"out of pocket\" might relate to financial costs, but it is secondary to the issue of legal disputes arising from unresolved conflicts.",
    "Eighth, finalize that the professional's intent is predominantly to circumvent legal proceedings, which aligns with avoiding lawsuits rather than financial implications alone."
