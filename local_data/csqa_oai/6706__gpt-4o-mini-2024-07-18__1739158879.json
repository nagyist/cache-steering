  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to leave a car in public?\n\nChoices:\nA: race track\nB: parking lot\nC: in the market place\nD: city\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "To determine a good place to leave a car in public, I need to consider locations that are designed for parking vehicles.",
    "A race track is specifically meant for racing and not suitable for public parking, so it is not a good choice.",
    "A parking lot is explicitly designed for parking vehicles and provides a safe and designated area for leaving cars, making it a very suitable choice.",
    "Leaving a car in the marketplace may not be appropriate since marketplaces can have restrictions on parking for customers or may have limited space.",
    "Parking a car in the city can vary; while some areas may have parking zones, others might not be designated for safe vehicle storage.",
    "An auto repair shop may provide parking for vehicles being serviced, but it\u2019s not usually a general parking area for the public.",
    "Given the reasoning, the parking lot stands out as an ideal and appropriate location.",
    "Now I will summarize the analysis: A race track is not appropriate, a parking lot is obviously suitable, the marketplace could have restrictions, city parking can be unclear, and a repair shop isn't designed for public parking.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, the parking lot is the best place to leave a car in public."
