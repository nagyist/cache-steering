  "query": "Question: What is the benefit of ships if there is no bridge available?\n\nChoices:\nA: collide\nB: carry people\nC: cross river\nD: sailors\nE: bottom out",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question regarding the benefits of ships in the absence of a bridge, we first need to understand the primary function of ships.",
    "Ships are primarily used for transporting goods and people across bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans.",
    "Considering the options, we need to evaluate which one highlights a specific benefit of using ships in scenarios where a bridge is not accessible.",
    "Option A, \"collide,\" is not a benefit and suggests something negative that could happen.",
    "Option B, \"carry people,\" offers a potential benefit but does not address the specific situation of lacking a bridge or what would be achieved uniquely by ships in that context.",
    "Option C, \"cross river,\" directly implies a key function of ships: transport over water when land routes (like a bridge) are unavailable.",
    "Option D, \"sailors,\" refers to the individuals operating the ships but does not state a specific benefit of the ships themselves.",
    "Option E, \"bottom out,\" is usually a concern regarding ships rather than a benefit, as it implies running aground or hitting the sea bed, which doesn't suggest any positive outcome.",
    "Based on the analysis, the strongest benefit of ships in the absence of a bridge is the ability to cross a river, as they allow navigation across obstacles without the need for a land bridge."
