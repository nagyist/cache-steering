  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to keep a dish cloth?\n\nChoices:\nA: laundry\nB: kitchen\nC: linen closet\nD: fabric store\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "The first consideration is the primary use of a dish cloth, which is for cleaning dishes and kitchen utensils.",
    "Since dish cloths are mainly used in the kitchen during meal preparations and clean-up, the kitchen seems like a reasonable place to store them.",
    "The laundry is not an ideal place because it is primarily intended for washing clothes and would not provide easy access when needed.",
    "A linen closet typically holds sheets, towels, and other linens, but dish cloths are not usually categorized with these items.",
    "A fabric store is irrelevant as it is a retail space for purchasing fabric and not for storing dish cloths.",
    "The bedroom is also not an appropriate storage location for dish cloths, as it does not relate to food preparation or dish cleaning.",
    "Since the dish cloth is most necessary and used in the kitchen, it should be kept there for convenience and ease of access.",
    "Comparing the best matches among the options, the kitchen stands out as the most practical and logical choice for storing a dish cloth."
