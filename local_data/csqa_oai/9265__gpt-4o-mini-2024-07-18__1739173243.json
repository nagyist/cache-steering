  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to put coffee if it is not needed immediately, implying a storage option rather than immediate consumption.",
    "Choice A suggests a container, which is a general term for any vessel or receptacle that can hold items, including beverages like coffee. This is a plausible option for storing coffee.",
    "Choice B suggests a cryogenic pod, which is not a practical or common method for storing coffee, as it is related to freezing or preserving biological materials rather than beverages.",
    "Choice C suggests a train station. While a train station may have facilities for coffee, it does not provide a suitable option for storage; it's more of a transient location.",
    "Choice D mentions a cup. Though a cup can hold coffee, it is generally used for immediate consumption, not for storage.",
    "Choice E refers to an internet cafe, which might serve coffee but does not provide a dedicated means to store it for later use.",
    "Based on the analysis, the only option that implies proper storage for coffee is a container, as it can keep coffee for later use.",
    "I will now confirm that all other options are less suitable compared to a container for the purpose of storing coffee when it is not needed right away."
