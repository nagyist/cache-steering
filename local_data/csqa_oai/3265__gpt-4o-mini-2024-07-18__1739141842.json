  "query": "Question: What is a kind of literature?\n\nChoices:\nA: newspaper\nB: books and magazines\nC: own home\nD: public library\nE: good homes",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what is meant by \"kind of literature.\" Literature generally refers to written works, especially those considered to have artistic or intellectual value.",
    "Next, I should analyze the given choices to see which ones represent written works.",
    "Choice A, \"newspaper,\" is a form of printed media that contains news articles, which is indeed a type of literature.",
    "Choice B, \"books and magazines,\" represents a broader category of printed literature encompassing both fictional and non-fictional written works, hence it qualifies as literature.",
    "Choice C, \"own home,\" does not represent literature, as it pertains to a physical place rather than written works.",
    "Choice D, \"public library,\" refers to a location where literature (books, magazines) is housed, but itself is not a type of literature.",
    "Choice E, \"good homes,\" relates to places of residence and has no connection to literature.",
    "Since only choices A and B refer to printed works of literature, I conclude that B is the most comprehensive response."
