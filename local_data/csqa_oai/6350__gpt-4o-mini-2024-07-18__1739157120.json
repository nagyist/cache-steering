  "query": "Question: After getting a divorce what does your relationship status change to?\n\nChoices:\nA: children suffer\nB: being single\nC: freedom\nD: default setting\nE: no spouse",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the change in relationship status after a divorce.",
    "Divorce legally ends a marriage, changing a person's marital status.",
    "When a marriage is dissolved through divorce, the individual typically reverts to being single.",
    "The choice \"children suffer\" (A) does not address the person's relationship status.",
    "The choice \"freedom\" (C) may describe a personal feeling, but it does not represent a technical relationship status.",
    "The choice \"default setting\" (D) is vague and not relevant to relationship status.",
    "The choice \"no spouse\" (E) accurately indicates that the individual no longer has a spouse after the divorce.",
    "Reviewing the options, both \"being single\" (B) and \"no spouse\" (E) apply, but \"being single\" is the typical term used to describe someone after being divorced.",
    "Evaluating the concepts of relationship status, \"being single\" is the most direct and commonly understood term post-divorce."
