  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of building a new home, which requires specific materials.",
    "Identify the main materials needed for construction, with wood being a primary choice for framing and structure.",
    "Evaluate the options given in the choices:\n- A: own home - not a place to get materials.\n- B: grocery store - primarily for food, not building materials.\n- C: boat - unrelated to home construction.\n- D: carpet - this is a finished product for flooring, not raw materials.\n- E: lumberyard - a place specifically for purchasing lumber and wood products.",
