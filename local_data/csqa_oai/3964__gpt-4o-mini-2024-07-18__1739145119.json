  "query": "Question: Where are not many people allowed to go?\n\nChoices:\nA: street corner\nB: supermarket\nC: space shuttle\nD: an airport\nE: public place",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the options provided and their typical accessibility to the general public.",
    "The street corner (Option A) and public place (Option E) are areas where many people can usually go without restrictions.",
    "The supermarket (Option B) is also generally accessible to many people, as it is a common shopping venue.",
    "An airport (Option D) does have certain restricted areas, but the general terminals are open to the public, although there may be security checks.",
    "Now I will focus on Option C, the space shuttle. Access to a space shuttle is severely limited to only trained astronauts and personnel associated with the space program.",
    "Given this analysis, it is clear that the space shuttle has the most restrictions on who is allowed to go there compared to the other options.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that Option C is the only location where not many people are allowed to go."
