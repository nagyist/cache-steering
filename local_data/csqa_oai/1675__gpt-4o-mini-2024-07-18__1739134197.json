  "query": "Question: If there is a creature that you cannot see, where is it likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: dark place\nB: world\nC: zoo\nD: in a cage\nE: woods",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the premise that the creature is not visible. This suggests that it may be concealed or located in an area where visibility is limited.",
    "Next, assess the choices. A \"dark place\" (A) naturally correlates with limited visibility and may conceal creatures that are difficult to see.",
    "The next option, \"world\" (B), is very broad and does not specifically imply a lack of visibility. It encompasses all habitats, so it doesn't help pinpoint the creature's location.",
    "Looking at choice \"zoo\" (C), while creatures can be located in a zoo, it is typically a controlled environment where many creatures are visible; therefore, this choice does not align well with the idea of being unable to see the creature.",
    "Considering the option \"in a cage\" (D), similar to the zoo, creatures are often visible in cages, so this choice also does not match well with the premise of being unable to see the creature.",
    "Lastly, evaluating \"woods\" (E), this choice refers to a natural environment where many creatures may be hidden among trees, bushes, or other foliage, making it very plausible for a creature to remain unseen.",
    "Compare the two best options identified: \"dark place\" (A) and \"woods\" (E). Both suggest a location where visibility is compromised, but the \"dark place\" specifically connotes an environment that lacks light, which often makes things invisible.",
    "However, \"woods\" (E) may also be dark but can include areas of light and shadow, providing opportunities to see certain creatures depending on their behavior. Thus, while both seem viable, the \"dark place\" (A) seems to be more direct in addressing the issue of visibility.",
    "Conclude that the best answer, emphasizing a location where a creature would definitely be not visible, is a \"dark place.\""
