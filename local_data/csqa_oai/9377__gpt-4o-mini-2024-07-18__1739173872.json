  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a supportive message from a mother to her child, indicating acceptance of the child's nature or characteristics.",
    "The phrase \"it was okay he was that way\" suggests that the mother is addressing some sort of difference or uniqueness in her child.",
    "The use of \"everyone is\" implies a universal trait that would relate to the idea of acceptance and not conforming to a particular standard.",
    "Examining the choices, \"A: afraid of\" does not fit with a message of acceptance; it seems more negative.",
    "Next, \"B: part old\" and \"C: different\" could both be seen as traits, but \"part old\" does not logically connect with the idea of comfort in being unique.",
    "The choice \"D: good at\" could imply some skill or talent, but again, it doesn\u2019t resonate with the theme of accepting who one is.",
    "Finally, \"C: different\" perfectly aligns with the notion of being unique and provides a message that it is okay to be oneself, which is what the mother appears to be conveying.",
    "Having analyzed the options, \"different\" is the only choice that reflects acceptance and universality in a positive manner."
