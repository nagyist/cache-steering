  "query": "Question: If I wanted to see an apple tree, where would be a good place to go?\n\nChoices:\nA: maryland\nB: oregon\nC: big city\nD: new york\nE: detroit",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the climate and environment where apple trees typically thrive. Apple trees generally grow well in temperate climates with cold winters and warm summers.",
    "Next, I will analyze Maryland. Maryland has a suitable climate for apple trees, with several orchards available for apple picking.",
    "Then, I will examine Oregon. Oregon is known for its agricultural diversity and has significant apple orchards, especially in the Willamette Valley.",
    "Next, I consider \"big city.\" Big cities might have parks or urban gardens, but they are not typically known for having apple trees in significant numbers, especially compared to rural areas.",
    "Next, I analyze New York. New York state has regions, particularly upstate, that are famous for apple orchards, making it a good candidate as well.",
    "Now, I will evaluate Detroit. While there might be some apple trees in the surrounding areas, it is primarily an urban environment which limits the overall presence of orchards compared to other locations.",
    "Comparing the suitable places, Oregon (B) and New York (D) are both strong options. Maryland (A) could work too, but it's less recognized for apples compared to Oregon and New York.",
    "Among these, I need to narrow it down to the best single option. Oregon is particularly famous for its apple production and has a focused agricultural industry around it.",
    "Given that both New York and Oregon have good apple-growing conditions, but Oregon is more renowned for extensive apple production, I conclude Oregon is the best place to see apple trees."
