  "query": "Question: You can buy gum, candy and popcorn before watching what?\n\nChoices:\nA: water fountain\nB: store\nC: sidewalk\nD: hospital\nE: movies",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions buying gum, candy, and popcorn, which are common snacks associated with watching films.",
    "I need to analyze the choices presented and determine which of them are typically related to watching something.",
    "Option A, water fountain, does not match the context as it is not directly related to watching an entertainment medium.",
    "Option B, store, is where you might buy snacks, but it's not a place where you would watch something.",
    "Option C, sidewalk, is a public pathway and does not fit as a place for watching anything.",
    "Option D, hospital, is an institution focused on health care and not on watching movies or shows.",
    "Option E, movies, is directly related to watching films where gum, candy, and popcorn are commonly enjoyed.",
    "Since the nature of the items mentioned (gum, candy, and popcorn) relates clearly to movie-watching, this option stands out.",
    "Thus, the correct answer is the one associated with an activity of watching, which is clearly the movies."
