  "steps": [
    "A reception desk is a place where guests can check in, get information, or seek assistance.",
    "Typically, reception desks are present in locations where people arrive and need to be greeted or assisted.",
    "Hotels are common places where reception desks are found, as they serve as the primary point of contact for guests.",
    "Motels, similar to hotels, also have reception desks, primarily catering to travelers needing lodging.",
    "In office parks, reception desks may exist, but they are often specific to certain buildings or companies rather than a common feature.",
    "The term \"inside\" is too vague without specifying a particular context, as a reception desk could be inside various buildings.",
    "\"Lobby\" is a more specific area of a building where a reception desk is typically located, particularly in hotels and offices.",
    "Out of all the options, \"lobby\" is the most accurate choice since it describes the physical area where reception desks are commonly found.",
    "Considering the context, I conclude that while several options are valid, \"lobby\" is the best answer as it specifically refers to the area where reception desks are most often placed."
