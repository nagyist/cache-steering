  "query": "Question: Water is used as a mirror when designing a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pool\nB: reflecting pool\nC: fish tank\nD: ocean\nE: sewage treatment plant",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question, which asks about the use of water as a mirror in design.",
    "Water can reflect images depending on its surface quality and calmness, which is typically leveraged in certain types of designs.",
    "A pool is primarily for swimming and recreation purposes and usually does not focus on its reflective qualities.",
    "A reflecting pool is specifically designed to create a reflection of surrounding scenery or architecture, making it a prominent candidate.",
    "A fish tank is generally designed for housing fish and aquatic life, with less emphasis on reflection, although water does reflect light.",
    "The ocean, while massive and reflective, is not designed in the same sense as the other options.",
    "A sewage treatment plant also focuses on processing waste and does not utilize water as a mirror.",
    "Comparing all the options, the only one that emphasizes the use of water as a mirror in its design is the reflecting pool.",
    "So, I can conclude that water is notably used as a mirror when designing a reflecting pool."
