  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what a reception area typically represents. It's a place where visitors check in or wait for assistance or services.",
    "Next, I will consider the specific context of needing a key. Keys are usually associated with access to a property or a service.",
    "Among the options, a hotel or motel is most commonly associated with giving out keys to guests.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the other choices. In a hospital, keys are unnecessary for visitors. They usually either have badges for staff or don't need keys at all.",
    "In a law firm, visitors might check in but wouldn't be issued a key since they do not typically deal with property or rooms.",
    "In an office building, while it may have a reception area, keys aren't given to visitors; they usually deal with employee access or office entries.",
    "In a gym, members might check in at a reception, but it wouldn\u2019t involve a key in terms of room access; they might receive RFID cards instead.",
    "Given these considerations, a motel is where one would wait to receive a key for their room, making it the most fitting answer."
