  "steps": [
    "The question states that John cared for Sally, but she could not return his feelings. This indicates a lack of reciprocation in emotions.",
    "Next, it is essential to analyze the choices given, focusing on meanings that relate to not having feelings for someone.",
    "Choice A (\"unfeeling\") suggests a complete absence of feelings. However, it's not specific enough to describe Sally's situation regarding John.",
    "Choice B (\"being mean\") implies negative behavior but does not relate directly to the lack of feelings.",
    "Choice C (\"field\") does not relate at all to feelings, and it seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "Choice D (\"disinterest\") indicates a lack of interest or concern in return for John's feelings, which aligns well with Sally's situation.",
    "Choice E (\"negligence\") suggests a disregard for something. However, it is not specific to the emotional context and also does not directly describe her feelings towards John.",
    "Based on the analysis of the choices, the one that best describes her inability to return his feelings is \"disinterest.\""
