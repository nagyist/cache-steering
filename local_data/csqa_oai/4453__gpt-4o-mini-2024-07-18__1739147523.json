  "steps": [
    "To determine what is absolutely necessary to play a harmonica, we need to consider the function of the instrument and what it requires from a player.",
    "A harmonica is a wind instrument, which typically involves blowing air into it to produce sound.",
    "Given this function, one must have a way to blow air into the harmonica to play it.",
    "Out of all the options provided, we need to identify which is essential for producing sound from a harmonica.",
    "Option A (wings) is unrelated; humans do not need wings to play a harmonica.",
    "Option B (pocket) is not essential either; while a harmonica can be stored in a pocket, it does not contribute to playing it.",
    "Option C (music shop) is not necessary; a person does not need to be in a music shop to play a harmonica once it is acquired.",
    "Option D (blues band) may offer a context for playing but is not necessary for the act of playing the harmonica itself.",
    "Option E (mouth) is crucial because the harmonica is played by using the mouth to blow air into it.",
    "Therefore, the only thing that every human has and is necessary to play a harmonica is a mouth."
