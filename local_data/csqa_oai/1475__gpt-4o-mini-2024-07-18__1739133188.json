  "steps": [
    "The question describes a situation where a person has committed a violent act in a fit of rage.",
    "It is important to consider the emotional and psychological consequences of such violent actions. Typically, the immediate aftermath of killing someone can lead to a range of emotions.",
    "One common emotional response to killing can be guilt or remorse, especially if the act was not premeditated and was driven by rage.",
    "Sadness can also be a response; however, it might not encapsulate the full emotional impact post-violence in this context. Remorse often includes a deep regret and recognition of wrongdoing.",
    "Options A (stomach ache) and E (going to jail) do not directly address emotional responses but rather physical sensations or consequences of actions.",
    "B (retaliation) implies further violence rather than reflecting on the act that has already occurred. It does not directly relate to feelings experienced after the act.",
    "Based on typical psychological responses, C (sadness) and D (remorse) are the most relevant, but remorse is generally a deeper and more common reaction to committing a serious crime such as murder.",
    "Thus, after evaluating the feelings typically associated with such a scenario, the most appropriate emotional response is likely to be remorse."
