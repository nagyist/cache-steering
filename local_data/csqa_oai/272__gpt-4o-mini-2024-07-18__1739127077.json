  "query": "Question: Where would someone likely bring an attache case?\n\nChoices:\nA: overhead compartment\nB: chair\nC: hospital\nD: in shirt\nE: business meeting",
  "steps": [
    "An attache case is typically used for carrying documents, laptops, or other business-related items.",
    "Considering its purpose, it is likely that someone would need to bring it to a place where they require those items, such as a business context.",
    "Looking at the options provided, \"business meeting\" (E) stands out as a relevant setting where one would want to have an attache case to present or manage materials.",
    "The \"overhead compartment\" (A) could be a potential temporary place to store an attache case while traveling, but it is not where you would typically bring it to utilize it.",
    "A \"chair\" (B) does not hold relevance as a destination for carrying an attache case; you wouldn\u2019t bring an attache case to a chair specifically.",
    "A \"hospital\" (C) is not a typical location associated with using an attache case, as it is more business-oriented than healthcare-related.",
    "\"Shirt\" (D) also is not a viable option, as an attache case is too large to fit in a shirt.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most appropriate setting where someone would bring an attache case is to a business meeting (E)."
