  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze what we mean by \"very fresh fruit.\" Fresh fruit is typically harvested directly from its source.",
    "Considering the options, a tree is a natural source where fruit can be found growing. This would likely be very fresh fruit since it's picked directly from the tree.",
    "Now looking at the market, while markets often sell fresh fruit, the freshness can vary. The fruit may have been picked days earlier and then transported to the market.",
    "In contrast, sand, as an option, doesn't relate to fruit at all, and therefore is not a viable choice for fresh fruit.",
    "San Francisco is a city where one might find fresh fruit at local markets or from nearby farms, but again, it depends on how the fruit is transported.",
    "A refrigerator stores fruit but does not provide it fresh; instead, it keeps fruit fresh for a longer time once it's already been picked.",
    "Now we can revisit the viable candidates: tree and market. However, the tree is the source of the fruit, directly giving us the freshest possible option.",
    "Since we need to select only one option that represents the best chance for very fresh fruit, the logical choice is the tree."
