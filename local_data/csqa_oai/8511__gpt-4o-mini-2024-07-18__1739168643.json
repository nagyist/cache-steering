  "query": "Question: The student had difficulties reading, he would furrow his brow while doing what on a line of the book?\n\nChoices:\nA: concentrating\nB: concentration\nC: acquiring knowledge\nD: sleeping\nE: written material",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the student was struggling with reading, which often involves focusing on text.",
    "When someone reads, they typically need to concentrate on the words and their meaning.",
    "The phrase \"furrow his brow\" suggests that the student was experiencing difficulty, which often correlates with concentrating intensely.",
    "Option A, \"concentrating,\" aligns directly with the student's effort to focus while reading.",
    "Option B, \"concentration,\" does not fit as it is not a direct action the student is doing on the line of the book.",
    "Option C, \"acquiring knowledge,\" while related to reading, is more about the purpose of reading rather than what the student is doing on the line.",
    "Option D, \"sleeping,\" does not fit at all since the scenario involves a struggle to read, not a state of rest.",
    "Option E, \"written material,\" describes what the student is reading but does not specify the action or state related to his brow furrowing.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most fitting choice that describes what the student is doing while reading is \"concentrating,\" which corresponds to option A."
