  "query": "Question: Where is a very bad place to find a crab?\n\nChoices:\nA: chesapeake bay\nB: underpants\nC: seychelles\nD: fishing boat\nE: cooking pot",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of crabs and their typical environments. Crabs are aquatic creatures found in various bodies of water.",
    "Next, observe option A: Chesapeake Bay, which is a natural habitat for crabs and would not be a bad place to find one.",
    "Then, look at option C: Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean known for its beaches and marine life, where crabs can also be found.",
    "Option D: fishing boat is also common for crabs to be found, as fishermen often catch them while fishing.",
    "Now review option E: cooking pot. This is where crabs could end up after being cooked, which portrays a negative context for the crab's well-being.",
    "Consider option B: underpants. Finding a crab here would be both unusual and inappropriate, indicating it would not be a safe or appropriate environment.",
    "Compare the reasoning for options B and E. While both are bad places for a crab, underpants imply an uncomfortable and absurd situation for the crab.",
    "Evaluate the context of absurdity vs. harm; a cooking pot may imply harmful intent (cooking), whereas underpants imply an absurd and highly inappropriate placement.",
    "Conclude that while both B and E are bad places for a crab, finding a crab in underpants is likely the worst and most nonsensical scenario."
