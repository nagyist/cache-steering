  "query": "Question: When seeing people play a game and your team is loosing what might you feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: excitement\nB: envy\nC: stress\nD: anxious\nE: entertaining",
  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the emotional responses one might have when witnessing their team losing in a game.",
    "The first reaction could be excitement, which is unlikely since excitement typically relates to positive outcomes or thrilling moments, rather than losing.",
    "Next, I consider envy. Envy could occur if I compare my team to the winning team, but it\u2019s not a universal reaction when one\u2019s team is losing.",
    "Then, I think about stress. Feeling stress could be a common response when one\u2019s team is losing due to the anxiety of potential defeat.",
    "Next, I evaluate the option of feeling anxious. Anxiety is also a plausible response as it can arise from uncertainty and the potential disappointment of losing.",
    "I consider the final option: entertaining. This does not fit well because if my team is losing, I am less likely to find the situation entertaining.",
    "Now I will prioritize the emotional responses. Stress and anxiety seem to be the most reasonable choices, given the context of a losing team.",
    "I need to choose between stress and anxiousness. Stress can build up from the game situation itself, while anxiousness is often tied to specific worries. Both are linked closely, but stress may encompass broader feelings.",
    "I conclude that stress has a more encompassing feeling regarding witnessing a losing team, as it captures a mix of emotional turmoil and pressure."
