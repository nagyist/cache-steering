    "The question asks about a child's reaction to being spiteful of his parents.",

    "Choice B \"succeeded\" does not logically relate to spitefulness; it implies achievement.",
    "Choice C \"grow up\" suggests maturation and does not reflect negative behavior.",
    "Choice D \"ask questions\" implies curiosity and does not connect to spitefulness.",
