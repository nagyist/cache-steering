  "query": "Question: A human is fragile, so you should take care since you only get what?\n\nChoices:\nA: one body\nB: muscles\nC: mouth\nD: two arms\nE: stupidity",
  "steps": [
    "The question emphasizes the fragility of a human being and suggests the need for care. It hints at the limits of human existence.",
    "The phrase \"you only get what\" implies a singular or unique aspect of being human that cannot be replaced or acquired multiple times.",
    "Analyzing the choices: \n- A (one body) makes sense because humans do indeed have only one body that must be cared for.\n- B (muscles) is not singular in nature; people can build muscle over time.\n- C (mouth) is a part of the body, but it is not the most holistic view when considering the entirety of human existence.\n- D (two arms) is again specific and does not encompass the whole person.\n- E (stupidity) does not align with the context of fragility\u2014it's not something inherently tied to the physical existence of a person.",
    "The overarching concept from the question revolves around the importance of caring for the human body, given its fragility.",
    "Among the choices offered, \"one body\" (Choice A) encapsulates the essence of fragility in human beings, implying that one must take care to preserve their bodily health and integrity.",
    "Since A is the only option that directly aligns with the unique and singular aspect of being human, as suggested in the question, it stands out clearly."
