    "The question asks about what typically happens after ending a visit with someone.",
    "Ending a visit usually implies that you are concluding your time together, which generally leads to a departure from the location.",
    "Among the choices, \"walk away\" suggests physically leaving the location where the visit took place.",
    "\"Thank god\" does not logically follow as an action after ending a visit; it is more of an expression of relief or emotion than a physical action.",
    "\"Turn around\" might imply a change of direction, but it does not convey the finality of leaving the visit; it lacks clarity as a decisive action.",
    "\"Work hard\" does not relate to the context of ending a visit; it implies engagement in a task rather than leaving a social situation.",
    "\"Explode\" is a dramatic and unrelated response that does not fit the context of a visit ending.",
    "Considering the context and clarity of actions linked to ending a visit, \"walk away\" is the most appropriate choice."
