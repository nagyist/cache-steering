  "steps": [
    "I start by analyzing each option to determine the places where multiple telephones might be found.",
    "Option A: \"friend's house\" - This typically has only one telephone, although it might have multiple devices. It\u2019s more common to find one central phone.",
    "Option B: \"desktop\" - This usually refers to a computer station and typically does not have a telephone. If it has a phone, it is usually just one.",
    "Option C: \"party\" - At a party, there could be multiple guests with their own phones, but this varies widely. However, there may not be many stationary telephones.",
    "Option D: \"hospital\" - Hospitals often have multiple telephones scattered throughout their premises for communication between departments and staff.",
    "Option E: \"phone booth\" - A phone booth, by definition, contains a single telephone. Hence, generally, only one telephone is found in a phone booth.",
    "Upon evaluating all the options, \"hospital\" stands out as the place where you would consistently find multiple telephones."
