  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context provided: John is usually good at singing, indicating he has the ability and condition to sing under normal circumstances.",
    "Next, analyze the phrase \"But today he couldn't do it.\" This implies that there is a specific reason for his inability to sing on this day that differs from his usual capability.",
    "Look at the choices given to see which reason could realistically prevent someone from singing well.",
    "Choice A: hoarse voice \u2013 This suggests a physical condition that would directly affect the ability to produce sound and sing properly, making it a plausible reason.",
    "Choice B: change in mood \u2013 While mood can affect performance, it doesn't definitively prevent someone from singing. Thus, it's less likely to be the main reason.",
    "Choice C: relaxation \u2013 Relaxation typically facilitates good singing by reducing tension, so it is unlikely to be the cause of inability to sing.",
    "Choice D: feminine voice \u2013 This option seems irrelevant, as anyone can have various vocal qualities, and it doesn't directly relate to the inability to sing.",
    "Choice E: being heard \u2013 While possibly a concern, it doesn\u2019t physically stop someone from singing; it relates more to confidence than capability.",
    "Given these evaluations, A (hoarse voice) stands out as the most logical explanation for John's inability to sing today."
