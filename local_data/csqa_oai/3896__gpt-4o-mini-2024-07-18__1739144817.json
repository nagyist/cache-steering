  "steps": [
    "The question states that the businessman kept a copy of a book beneath all his work.",
    "We need to consider a container where one might keep business-related documents and work items.",
    "A shoe box (A) is typically used to store shoes and would not be practical for work-related materials.",
    "A suitcase (B) is primarily used for travel and not generally for daily work items.",
    "A synagogue (C) is a place of worship and not a storage item for work-related materials, so it's not applicable.",
    "A briefcase (D) is specifically designed for carrying documents, work materials, and personal items related to business.",
    "A backpack (E) could also potentially hold work materials, but it is generally less formal than a briefcase.",
    "Considering the context of a businessman and the nature of the items kept for work, the most logical answer would be briefcase (D).",
    "I will double-check the alternatives: briefccase (D) and backback (E) fit, but a briefcase is more commonly associated with business.",
    "After weighing the options and considering typical usage, I confirm the briefcase is indeed the best answer."
