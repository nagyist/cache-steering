  "query": "Question: The father was sick of his lazy son, what did he encourage in him from there on out?\n\nChoices:\nA: hard work\nB: active\nC: energetic\nD: productive\nE: business",
  "steps": [
    "The father is described as being sick of his lazy son, which indicates that he is frustrated with his son's lack of effort and energy.",
    "Given that the father is dissatisfied with laziness, he would likely encourage traits that counteract that behavior.",
    "\"Hard work\" is a trait that directly opposes laziness and would be a strong encouragement for someone considered to be lazy.",
    "\"Active\" suggests physical engagement, which may relate to being less lazy, but it doesn't fully capture the attitude of diligence or effort in various tasks.",
    "\"Energetic\" implies a degree of liveliness and enthusiasm but does not necessarily require focus or productivity.",
    "\"Productive\" relates closely to achieving results and making efficient use of time, which is also against laziness, but it may not encompass the individual effort itself as much as \"hard work\" would.",
    "\"Business\" refers specifically to commerce or commercial activities; it doesn't relate to the broader idea of personal effort or diligence.",
    "Comparing the options, \"hard work\" seems to be the most fitting encouragement the father could give to instill a sense of effort in his son.",
    "The other options either narrow the focus too much (like \"business\" or \"energetic\") or don't fully encapsulate the idea of effort as effectively as \"hard work.\""
