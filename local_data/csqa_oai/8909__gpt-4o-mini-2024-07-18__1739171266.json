  "steps": [
    "The question states that the saw was not necessary for car repair.",
    "If the saw was unnecessary, it would likely not be included with any standard tools needed for car repair.",
    "The word \"included\" suggests that the saw would not come integrated with something that is essential for car repairs.",
    "To understand what it was not included with, we need to analyze the provided choices: A: tool shed, B: tool box, C: tool kit, D: hardware store, E: toolbox.",
    "A \"tool shed\" typically refers to a storage space rather than a package of tools or an essential toolkit, so it might not directly apply to the context of this question.",
    "A \"tool box\" or \"toolbox\" generally refers to a container for tools, which can include various tools often necessary for repairs.",
    "A \"tool kit\" usually contains a set of tools required for specific tasks and likely should contain only necessary items for the job at hand.",
    "Considering all the contexts, if the saw is unnecessary for car repairs, it makes sense that it wouldn't be part of a \"tool kit\" that is specifically for car repair.",
    "The options \"tool box\" and \"toolkit\" are similar in wording but should conceptually represent the same idea regarding necessary tools, suggesting that the saw would also not be included in a \"tool box.\"",
    "Since option C (\"tool kit\") specifically indicates a set designed for a particular purpose (car repair), it strongly aligns with the idea that the saw wouldn\u2019t be included based on the question premise."
