    "An emotional person typically experiences and expresses their feelings strongly.",
    "The term \"expressive\" commonly describes someone who shows their emotions openly.",
    "\"Excited\" is a more specific emotion and may not describe every emotional state.",
    "\"Drunk\" denotes a state caused by alcohol consumption and is not synonymous with being emotional.",
    "\"Headache\" is a physical condition and does not relate to emotional behaviors.",
    "\"Eat every day\" does not directly describe an emotional tendency or behavior.",
    "Among the options, \"expressive\" most directly correlates with the characteristics of an emotional person.",
    "Choices A, B, C, D, and E must be evaluated against the definition of an emotional person.",
    "Since \"expressive\" (A) captures the essence of exhibiting emotions, it stands as the best fitting choice among the options."
