  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what \"holy\" means. \"Holy\" generally refers to something that is sacred, revered, or associated with God or religion.",
    "Next, let's consider the opposite of \"holy.\" If something is considered \"not holy,\" this often implies that it is secular or lacks sacredness.",
    "Now, we evaluate the choices provided to see which one aligns with the idea of something that lacks holiness.",
    "Choice A, \"halibut,\" is a type of fish and does not relate to the concept of holiness or profane in any significant way.",
    "Choice B, \"damaged,\" refers to something that has been harmed or impaired. While damaged things might be less revered, it's not a direct antonym to holy.",
    "Choice C, \"profane,\" means something that is secular or not sacred, which directly contrasts with the idea of being holy.",
    "Choice D, \"common,\" means ordinary or not special, but it does not necessarily imply that something is lacking holiness.",
    "Choice E, \"pope holy,\" refers to a specific person who is considered holy, which does not help answer the question about what causes something to not be holy.",
    "Given this analysis, the strongest candidate for what causes something to be not holy is \"profane,\" as it denotes a secular or non-religious nature."
