  "steps": [
    "Politicians are typically associated with government-related activities and institutions.",
    "In London, the most significant institution for politicians is the Parliament, which comprises the House of Commons and the House of Lords.",
    "While politicians may be found in various places, such as coffee houses or making speeches, the primary location for their official duties would be Parliament.",
    "\"Washington D.C.\" is not a location in London; it is the capital of the United States. Therefore, option B is irrelevant.",
    "The phrase \"talk nonsense\" does not refer to a specific location and is a dismissive expression rather than a factual answer to where politicians are found.",
    "The term \"government\" can refer to a broader category that includes various levels and branches, but it is less specific than \"Parliament\" when pinpointing where politicians conduct their activities in London.",
    "Given the choices, \"Parliament\" (option E) is the most precise and likely answer to the question regarding the location of politicians in London."
