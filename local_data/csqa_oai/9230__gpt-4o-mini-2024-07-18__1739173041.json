  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequences following proof of someone killing people.",
    "In legal contexts, when someone is proven to have committed murder, they typically face a severe consequence.",
    "The terms \"going to jail\" and \"jailed\" are somewhat informal and do not specifically denote a formal outcome.",
    "\"Feelings of guilt\" is a psychological reaction rather than a legal punishment.",
    "The options include \"punishment,\" which is a broad term and could apply, but it lacks specificity.",
    "\"Prison sentence\" specifically indicates a legal consequence that involves time spent imprisoned, which aligns with the seriousness of murder.",
    "Both \"punishment\" and \"prison sentence\" are possible answers, but \"prison sentence\" provides the clearest and most direct legal implication.",
    "Among the options, \"prison sentence\" is the most definitive consequence for committing murder."
