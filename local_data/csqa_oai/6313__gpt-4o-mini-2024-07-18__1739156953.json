    "The question asks for signs that indicate a person is dying. We need to identify the most relevant choice that describes a physical sign that can occur in dying individuals.",
    "Let's analyze each option. Option A (\"would cease to exist\") is more a philosophical statement rather than a physical sign of dying. It doesn\u2019t indicate a process observable as death approaches.",
    "Option B (\"no longer exist\") also reflects a conclusion rather than a sign that can be observed. It describes the end result of dying instead of an observable phenomenon during the process.",
    "Option C (\"change color\") is vague, but it can refer to changes in skin color, which can be a sign of fading vitality. This could indicate a sign of dying, as skin can take on different hues (like pallor or bluish tones).",
    "Option D (\"born again\") is unrelated to dying. It suggests a rebirth or renewal, which doesn\u2019t apply to the dying process.",
    "Option E (\"change of color\") is similar to option C. It references the observable phenomenon of color change in the skin, which can occur during the dying process.",
    "Considering options C and E both refer to color change, we need to determine the best choice. The wording is similar, but the phrase \"change color\" may sound less formal than \"change of color.\"",
    "In clinical terms, it is more common to discuss observations in terms of \"change of color,\" which might imply a more technical understanding of what happens to a person's appearance as they near death.",
    "Thus, between options C and E, the choice that most accurately describes a sign associated with dying while using precise language is \"change of color.\""
