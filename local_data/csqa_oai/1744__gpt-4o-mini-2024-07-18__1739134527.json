  "steps": [
    "The scenario mentions that John slept on a mat along with other children.",
    "Sleeping usually implies that the person is in a place where they can rest, which usually means a bedroom, dormitory, or similar environment.",
    "Since John is sleeping on a mat with other children, it's reasonable to assume they are in a communal setting designed for sleeping.",
    "The presence of other children sleeping on mats strongly suggests a location intended for rest, likely a school environment due to the grouping of children.",
    "The options provided must be analyzed for the best fit given the context of children sleeping.",
    "\"Bathroom\" and \"doorway\" are unlikely places for sleeping, as they are not designed for rest.",
    "\"Living room\" could have sleeping arrangements but is less likely for multiple children to sleep on mats compared to a school setting.",
    "The option \"school\" suggests an environment like a classroom or sleeping area specifically for children, which fits the scenario described.",
    "While \"sleeping\" (option C) describes the action John is currently doing, it doesn't specify the location.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable answer for where John is located, given that he is sleeping along with other children, would be in a school environment."
