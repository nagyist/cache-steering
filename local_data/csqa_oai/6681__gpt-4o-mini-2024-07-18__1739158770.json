  "query": "Question: What could happen if creating art that not everyone agrees with?\n\nChoices:\nA: upset\nB: controversy\nC: frustration\nD: pleasure\nE: relax",
  "steps": [
    "First, creating art that not everyone agrees with can elicit a range of emotional responses from the audience.",
    "Next, some viewers may feel upset if they disagree with the message or style of the artwork.",
    "Similarly, the disagreement among viewers can lead to controversy, as differing opinions may spark discussions or debates.",
    "In addition, frustration can arise among both artists and viewers when conflicting interpretations of the art occur.",
    "On the other hand, some people may experience pleasure or relaxation when engaging with art, but this is less likely if there is significant disagreement about its content or message.",
    "Considering the options, \"upset,\" \"controversy,\" and \"frustration\" are all potential outcomes of disagreement.",
    "\"Controversy,\" in particular, represents a broader societal reaction, which can encompass upset and frustration but is distinct as a phenomenon.",
    "Therefore, while both \"upset\" and \"frustration\" are valid emotional responses, \"controversy\" captures the essence of the public reaction to divisive art."
