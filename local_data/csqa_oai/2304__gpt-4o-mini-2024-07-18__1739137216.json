  "steps": [
    "The question is about a group in a court that passes a sentence. This involves determining who is responsible for making the final decision about a defendant's punishment after considering the case.",
    "In many legal systems, particularly in the United States, a jury is a group of people sworn to render a verdict in a trial. They listen to the evidence presented and then decide on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.",
    "If the jury finds the defendant guilty, a judge or the jury (in some cases) will impose the sentence. Therefore, it's essential to identify if the answer options depict the correct role of a jury in the context of sentencing.",
    "Looking at the option \"A: sure,\" this does not relate to court terminology or processes.",
    "The option \"B: arrive at conviction\" might imply a process but does not specify a group or whose role it is in passing the sentence.",
    "The option \"C: on jury\" suggests a direct involvement of the jury in the sentencing process, aligning with the context of the question.",
    "Option \"D: judgemental\" seems to be a descriptive term rather than a specific group or entity in a court context.",
    "Lastly, option \"E: mom\" is unrelated to legal terminology and does not make sense in the context of court proceedings.",
    "Comparing the relevant options and the primary role of the jury in passing a sentence, \"C: on jury\" is the most accurate choice as it directly references the group involved in making a decision regarding sentencing."
