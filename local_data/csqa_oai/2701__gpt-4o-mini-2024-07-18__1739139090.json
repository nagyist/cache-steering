  "steps": [
    "We need to identify a common location where people typically wait for lost luggage.",
    "Lost luggage is often associated with air travel, which means it is relevant to airports.",
    "Clinics and doctor's offices are more focused on medical purposes and do not deal with luggage issues.",
    "Hospitals are primarily for medical treatment, not for handling lost luggage.",
    "A mailroom does not pertain to luggage and is usually associated with postal services or internal document distribution.",
    "Given the choices, the most logical location where someone would wait for lost luggage is at an airport.",
    "Airports have specific areas designated for lost luggage inquiries, which makes this an ideal answer.",
    "Evaluating other options again confirms that none of the other choices relates to waiting for lost luggage while traveling.",
    "Thus, the analysis supports that the answer must be the airport where luggage issues are typically resolved."
