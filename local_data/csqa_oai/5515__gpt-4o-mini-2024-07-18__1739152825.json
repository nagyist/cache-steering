  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the term \"green bill.\" In the context of American currency, a green bill typically refers to a U.S. dollar bill, which is green in color.",
    "Next, we should consider where U.S. dollar bills (money) are typically found. Common locations would include banks, wallets, and possibly even locations related to transactions, such as restaurants.",
    "Looking at the choices, a bank (A) is a place where people can withdraw and deposit money, so it would definitely have green bills.",
    "A wallet (B) is a personal item where people keep money, including green bills, making it a valid option as well.",
    "At a restaurant (C), while customers may pay with green bills, the establishment itself is not consistently a source of green bills. However, tips may include cash transactions.",
    "Congress (D) is not relevant because it's a governmental body and does not involve currency in this context.",
    "A mailbox (E) typically holds mail and does not usually contain currency, thus it is not relevant either.",
    "Considering all the locations and the context of where you would find a green bill, both banks and wallets are strong contenders. However, if choosing the most likely specific location to find green bills commonly, a wallet is likely since it directly belongs to a person who would typically carry cash.",
    "In summary, the most direct answer in this list for where one would probably find an already owned green bill would be in a wallet, as it's a common place for personal currency."
