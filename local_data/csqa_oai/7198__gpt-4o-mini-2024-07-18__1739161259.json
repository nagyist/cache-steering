  "query": "Question: Where would a bald eagle land?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: wildlife refuge\nC: open country\nD: on a lake\nE: pine tree",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the habitat preferences of a bald eagle. They typically prefer habitats near large bodies of open water, where they can find their primary food source: fish.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. Canada (A) is a geographical location that could have suitable habitats but does not guarantee a landing spot.",
    "Wildlife refuge (B) often provides a protected area for various species, including bald eagles. This is a viable landing spot since it provides safety and food sources.",
    "Open country (C) generally refers to wider areas without significant elevation or trees and might not be the most suitable option for a bald eagle, as they prefer areas with nearby trees for resting and nesting.",
    "Landing on a lake (D) is possible, but bald eagles usually prefer to perch on a solid structure nearby rather than directly on the water's surface.",
    "Pine trees (E) are often chosen by bald eagles for nesting and perching as they provide elevation, a view of the surrounding area, and protection from predators.",
    "Considering these habitats and preferences, the most appropriate landing location for a bald eagle among the given choices is a pine tree due to its suitability for resting and nesting.",
    "Though wildlife refuge is a close contender, the specific choice of pine tree emphasizes the eagle's nesting and perching habits, making it the best answer."
