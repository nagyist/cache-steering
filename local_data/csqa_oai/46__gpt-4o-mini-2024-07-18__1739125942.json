  "query": "Question: A fox was thirsty searching for water during the drought, where was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: painting\nB: hen house\nC: california\nD: virginia\nE: movie hall",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the fox is searching for water during a drought. This indicates a dry environment where water sources are scarce.",
    "We need to determine which of the answer choices suggests a location that may be impacted by drought and aligns with the idea of a thirsty fox searching for water.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"painting\" does not provide a real-world location, nor does it relate to the fox's search for water.",
    "\"Hen house\" is a structure when typically there wouldn't be a water source for a thirsty fox, and it relates more to where chickens would be rather than a natural water source.",
    "Next, \"movie hall\" is also not an appropriate location for a fox seeking water as it represents an indoor setting with no natural water bodies.",
    "Considering \"california,\" it is known for droughts and can have wilderness areas where a fox might be found seeking water.",
    "Lastly, \"virginia\" may also have natural water sources, but it is not as commonly associated with droughts compared to \"california,\" which is known for its dry climate and frequent droughts.",
    "Therefore, the choice that best fits the scenario of a thirsty fox searching for water during a drought is \"california.\""
