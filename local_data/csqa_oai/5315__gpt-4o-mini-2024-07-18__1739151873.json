  "query": "Question: Sarah didn't want to wait until she was an adult, but she had to in order to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: marry\nB: dress himself\nC: drive train\nD: drive car\nE: ball stopped",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what actions or activities typically require someone to be an adult or meet a certain age requirement.",
    "Marriage often requires legal age restrictions, which can vary by location but generally necessitates someone to be at least a teenager or older, often requiring parental consent for younger individuals.",
    "Driving, whether it's a car or a train, also requires one to reach a certain age, typically 16 for cars in many places, while trains may have different requirements or may be considered a more advanced responsibility.",
    "\"Dressing himself\" is an independent action that doesn\u2019t require one to be an adult, as children can already do this.",
    "\"Ball stopped\" doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of what Sarah is waiting for, as it's not an action requiring adulthood.",
    "Assessing each choice, \"marry\" is the only action that directly relates to the need to wait until adulthood due to legal requirements.",
    "\"Drive train\" and \"drive car\" might imply needing to age for a driving license but don\u2019t strongly imply the urgency of waiting like marriage does.",
    "I recognize that marriage is a significant milestone tied directly to the notion of adulthood, supporting the idea that Sarah's hesitance ties to this requirement.",
    "With the reasoning established, I conclude that the most fitting answer is related to the requirement of being an adult for marriage."
