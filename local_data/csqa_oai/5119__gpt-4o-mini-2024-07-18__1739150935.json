  "steps": [
    "I need to identify what actions typically occur before someone decides to stay in bed.",
    "\"Lay down\" seems like an immediate action one might take right before staying in bed.",
    "\"Bed sores\" refer to a condition that occurs due to prolonged pressure on the skin, not an action to take.",
    "\"Sleep in\" suggests staying in bed longer, but it does not indicate the initial action taken before deciding to stay.",
    "\"Open the curtain\" could be an action to start the day, rather than an action taken when aiming to stay in bed.",
    "I narrow down the options and find that laying down logically precedes planning to stay in bed.",
    "I conclude that the only action that directly relates to preparing for a stay in bed is to \"lay down.\""
