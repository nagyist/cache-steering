  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the purpose of spending time finding information on math equations.",
    "Since math equations are typically used to solve problems, the act of finding information suggests an attempt to understand or acquire knowledge that helps solve those problems.",
    "One possible answer is related to \"solution to problem,\" suggesting a direct connection to resolving mathematical questions.",
    "Another option, \"gaining knowledge,\" indicates a broader understanding of math equations, which is also a reasonable purpose.",
    "The choice \"know how to act\" implies a practical application of what is learned, which may not be the primary intent of finding information on math equations.",
    "\"Understanding of\" highlights the aspect of comprehension, which is necessary for working with math but might not fully capture the intent if it does not lead to application or solutions.",
    "\"Being able to use\" suggests applying learned information practically, which can be an outcome of understanding math equations, but might not be the immediate goal of researching them.",
    "Evaluating the best fit, finding information likely encompasses aiming for comprehension and solution-oriented knowledge. However, the phrasing of \"solution to problem\" aligns closely with the practical goal of applying math.",
    "Considering the range of choices, while gaining knowledge is important, the core goal usually revolves around solving problems using that knowledge."
