  "query": "Question: To deal with sadness many people will do what on their iPhone?\n\nChoices:\nA: cry\nB: listen to music\nC: tragic film\nD: take phone call\nE: get drunk",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what activities people commonly engage in when feeling sad. Many people seek comfort through different means.",
    "Listening to music is a widely accepted method for coping with sadness, as it can uplift mood or resonate with feelings.",
    "Crying is also a natural response to sadness, but it is not an activity that involves using an iPhone directly.",
    "Watching a tragic film could evoke sadness, but it\u2019s not a typical direct response for managing feelings on an iPhone.",
    "Taking a phone call might provide social support, but it is more of a communication action rather than a specific coping mechanism.",
    "Getting drunk is a more extreme response and does not specifically entail using an iPhone.",
    "Among the listed choices, listening to music stands out as a specific and common activity performed on an iPhone for dealing with sadness.",
    "I will now review other choices to confirm they do not fit as well as listening to music for the intent of managing sadness using an iPhone.",
    "Crying does not involve the iPhone, a tragic film is less common for coping compared to personal music choice, phone calls are more about communication and socializing, while getting drunk isn\u2019t typically an iPhone-related activity.",
    "Thus, listening to music on an iPhone is the most direct and relatable action for coping with sadness, confirming it as the best answer."
