  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the typical locations for storing food items, particularly peanut butter.",
    "Peanut butter is a shelf-stable food, meaning it can be stored at room temperature without spoiling quickly.",
    "Common storage locations for peanut butter include cabinets and pantries, as they provide a cool, dry place to store food.",
    "Next, I think about the choices provided: container, supermarket, pantry, sandwich, and jar.",
    "A container (A) and a jar (E) are ways to store peanut butter but not locations. A supermarket (B) is where it's bought, not stored. A sandwich (D) is a way to use peanut butter.",
    "The only option that represents a suitable and practical storage location for peanut butter at home is the pantry (C).",
    "I will now confirm that the pantry is an appropriate storage location for peanut butter compared to the other options discussed.",
    "Having analyzed each choice thoroughly, pantry (C) stands out as the valid answer because it is a designated storage area ideal for such food items."
