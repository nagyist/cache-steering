  "query": "Question: Where do people keep money that is not in their wallet?\n\nChoices:\nA: bank account\nB: outside\nC: art show\nD: casino\nE: race track",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where money might typically be stored outside of a wallet.",
    "A bank account is a common and secure way for people to store their money, making it a likely option.",
    "While options like \"outside\" (B) do not make sense in the context of storing money, they could imply leaving money unattended which is unsafe.",
    "An art show (C) is not a conventional place for storing money, rather it is more of an entertainment or cultural venue.",
    "A casino (D) might be a place where money is used, but typically it does not serve as a storage option.",
    "A race track (E) could involve betting and using money, but similar to a casino, it does not serve as a safe storage location.",
    "Thus far, the only option that offers a means of securely storing money away from a wallet is a bank account (A).",
    "I also need to consider the purpose of each option: bank accounts are set up for the specific purpose of holding and managing funds.",
    "The other choices do not fulfill the criteria of being a secure place to store money."
