  "query": "Question: The hobbit was timid in front of the dragon, but what did he have to be to get the gold?\n\nChoices:\nA: mean\nB: aggressive\nC: bellicose\nD: reckless\nE: dauntless",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a hobbit who was timid in the presence of a dragon, which suggests that the hobbit feels fear or anxiety in a dangerous situation.",
    "To obtain the gold from the dragon, the hobbit would likely need to demonstrate characteristics opposite to being timid.",
    "The options provided describe various traits: mean, aggressive, bellicose, reckless, and dauntless.",
    "\"Mean\" suggests unkindness, which doesn't link to achieving bravery in the face of a dragon.",
    "\"Aggressive\" implies a tendency to attack or confront, which might not be the best approach to deal with a dragon and could lead to danger.",
    "\"Bellicose\" indicates a tendency to fight or start wars, which is a similar connotation to aggressive and may not fit the situation of stealing from a dragon.",
    "\"Reckless\" means acting without thinking of the consequences; while it could lead to getting the gold, it suggests carelessness rather than bravery.",
    "\"Dauntless\" means fearless and undeterred by danger, which fits the necessity for the hobbit to have courage to approach and deal with the dragon.",
    "Considering all options, being \"dauntless\" aligns with the idea of obtaining gold by overcoming fear of the dragon, suggesting a brave character in a perilous situation."
