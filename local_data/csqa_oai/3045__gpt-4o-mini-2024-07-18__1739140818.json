  "query": "Question: Two adults do what before one gives birth to a child?\n\nChoices:\nA: loving couple\nB: act of sex\nC: birth\nD: parents\nE: consent",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the actions taken by two adults before one of them gives birth to a child.",
    "To give birth, there must first be a conception, which typically involves sexual intercourse.",
    "The act of sex between two adults usually leads to the possibility of conception, which is necessary for a pregnancy to occur.",
    "While options A (loving couple), D (parents), and E (consent) describe relationships or conditions surrounding the act, they do not specifically denote an action taken before birth.",
    "Option C (birth) describes the event after the pregnancy but does not represent the actions before it.",
    "Therefore, the most accurate answer that directly represents the action taken by two adults before one gives birth is option B (act of sex)."
