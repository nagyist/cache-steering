  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a location associated with visiting a dentist.",
    "When I think about where dental services are provided, the term most commonly associated is \"dental office.\"",
    "The other options do not represent a location where a dentist practices.",
    "Option A, \"fair,\" does not relate to dental services.",
    "Option B, \"phone book,\" is a resource for finding services or businesses, not a place to visit a dentist.",
    "Option C, \"city,\" is too broad and does not specifically refer to a place where dental services are rendered.",
    "Option E, \"las vegas,\" is a specific city but does not universally answer where one visits a dentist.",
    "Given that the only option that clearly represents a place specifically designated for dental care is \"dental office,\" this must be the correct answer."
