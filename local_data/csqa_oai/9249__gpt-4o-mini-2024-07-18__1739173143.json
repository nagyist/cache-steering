  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"his bare arms were flexing\" indicates that the person's arms are muscular and likely exerting effort.",
    "Carrying wood typically requires a strong grip, implying that his hands must be occupied.",
    "The phrase \"carried the wood\" suggests that he is holding something in his hands.",
    "Since he is gripping an object (the wood), his grasp cannot be empty.",
    "We need to analyze the answer choices to see which one fits best with the scenario of carrying wood.",
    "Choice A: \"covered\" is not relevant since it does not describe the status of his grasp.",
    "Choice B: \"empty\" is contradictory to the action of carrying wood.",
    "Choice C: \"bareword\" does not seem to relate to the question properly and appears to be a nonsensical term in this context.",
    "Choice D: \"full\" suits the context since it suggests that his hands are occupied with wood.",
    "Choice E: \"ample\" may imply sufficient space but does not describe the grasp accurately.",
    "Given the analysis, the best fitting choice for the status of his grasp, considering he is carrying wood, is \"full.\""
