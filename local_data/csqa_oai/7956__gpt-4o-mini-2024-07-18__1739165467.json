  "query": "Question: Why wouldn't someone want to work in an office?\n\nChoices:\nA: blisters\nB: frustration\nC: being paid\nD: making shareholders richer\nE: making money",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of working in an office and the potential reasons why someone might not want to do so.",
    "Analyze each choice one by one to see if they relate to a negative aspect of working in an office environment.",
    "Choice A, \"blisters,\" does not generally relate to office work as it implies physical labor or manual work, which is not typical in an office setting.",
    "Choice B, \"frustration,\" can be a valid reason to dislike working in an office due to common issues like office politics, lack of control, or tedious tasks.",
    "Choice C, \"being paid,\" seems out of context because payment is typically a motivation to work, not a deterrent.",
    "Choice D, \"making shareholders richer,\" suggests a negative sentiment towards working for profit-driven companies. Some people might view it as a reason to avoid working in an office if they feel uncomfortable with the corporate culture.",
    "Choice E, \"making money,\" is generally a positive aspect of working and does not constitute a reason for someone to avoid an office job.",
    "Now, assess which of these reasons could most prominently deter someone from working in an office.",
    "Among the choices, \"frustration\" (B) and \"making shareholders richer\" (D) are the more plausible negative reasons.",
    "However, \"frustration\" (B) encapsulates a broader range of potential office-related grievances that could more generally apply to many individuals, while \"making shareholders richer\" (D) is more specific and may not resonate with all office workers."
