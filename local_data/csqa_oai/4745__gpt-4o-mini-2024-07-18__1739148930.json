  "steps": [
    "Canned goods are typically stored in a place where food items are kept and organized.",
    "A pantry is a specific type of storage space for food, often containing shelves to hold various items including canned goods.",
    "A cupboard can also hold food items, but it is generally understood to refer to a more enclosed storage area that might include dishes or other items.",
    "A shelf is just a flat surface that can hold goods, but it doesn't specify the type of storage area and can be a part of a pantry or cabinet.",
    "A cabinet usually refers to a piece of furniture with doors, which might contain food but can also be for other household items.",
    "A drawer is typically used for smaller items and doesn\u2019t provide a practical solution for storing canned goods that are taller and bulkier.",
    "Considering these definitions, the most appropriate location specifically for canned goods is the pantry because it is explicitly designed for food storage.",
    "The other options like cupboard, shelf, cabinet, and drawer could potentially hold canned goods, but they are not as specific or suitable as a pantry.",
    "Therefore, the best answer that directly corresponds to where canned goods are likely to be stored is the pantry."
