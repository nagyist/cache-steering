  "query": "Question: Joe stood in the balcony and watched the Mardi Gras parade go by.  Where is he most likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: theatre\nB: outside\nC: new orleans\nD: movie house\nE: hotel",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes Joe watching a Mardi Gras parade. Mardi Gras is a famous festival celebrated primarily in New Orleans, which suggests a specific location for the event.",
    "The options provided include various types of venues and locations: a theatre, outside, New Orleans, a movie house, and a hotel.",
    "Since Joe is on a balcony, this indicates that he is in an elevated position, likely to have a good view of the parade passing by. This aligns with being able to watch a public outdoor event.",
    "\"Theatre\" and \"movie house\" both suggest an indoor setting, which would not typically allow for watching a parade. Therefore, these can be ruled out as possible locations.",
    "A \"hotel\" could potentially have balconies, but it would not be specific to the nature of the event, and not all hotels would necessarily be in the area where a parade takes place.",
    "The remaining option is \"outside,\" but this is a general term and does not specify the unique event of the Mardi Gras parade.",
    "Given the context of Mardi Gras, the most likely specific location for the parade, where someone might stand on a balcony to watch, is New Orleans, which is famous for this celebration.",
    "Since New Orleans is the city where Mardi Gras is significantly celebrated and where Joe is likely to be, it stands out as the most appropriate answer."
