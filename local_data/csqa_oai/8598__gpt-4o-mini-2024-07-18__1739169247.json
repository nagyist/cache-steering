  "query": "Question: Where do people go if they are looking for a taxi?\n\nChoices:\nA: apartment\nB: street corner\nC: space shuttle\nD: public place\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where people typically go to find a taxi, we need to consider common locations where taxis are usually available.",
    "Taxis are usually found in public areas rather than private locations; they are designed to transport people from one public location to another.",
    "Among the options, 'apartment' and 'garden' are private or residential areas, which are not typical for finding taxis.",
    "'Space shuttle' is a mode of transportation but does not relate to typical taxi availability on Earth, so it is also not relevant.",
    "'Public place' is a broad term that can include various locations, but it's vague and could encompass ideas that are too general.",
    "The most specific and plausible option for where people look for taxis is 'street corner', as this is a common and well-known location where taxis typically stop to pick up passengers.",
    "Consideration of common practices shows that people often stand at street corners to hail a taxi.",
    "Confirming against all provided options, the 'street corner' stands out as the best answer, as it's specifically where taxis are often flagged down."
