  "query": "Question: Where do students do most of their learning?\n\nChoices:\nA: class room\nB: hallway\nC: library\nD: every aspect of life\nE: kindergarten class",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary environments designed for formal education where students receive instruction from teachers.",
    "The classroom is the most common setting for students to learn directly from educators, with structured lessons and activities.",
    "The hallway is generally used for transitions between classes or for social interaction, not for focused learning.",
    "The library is a place for study and research; however, it often complements classroom learning rather than being the primary source.",
    "Looking at \"every aspect of life,\" it suggests that learning happens informally everywhere, but this is broader than traditional education settings.",
    "\"Kindergarten class\" specifies a learning environment for early education but does not represent all students across all educational levels.",
    "Therefore, while various environments contribute to learning, the classroom is specifically designed for structured learning.",
    "Considering all the evaluations of each choice, the classroom stands out as the primary location where most learning activities occur."
