  "steps": [
    "To determine where many lawns are likely to be found, I will first consider what 'lawns' are and the common places associated with them.",
    "Lawns are usually grassy areas that are often found in residential settings. They require maintenance and care.",
    "I will analyze the options given one by one to see which is most related to the presence of multiple lawns.",
    "Option A (golf course) typically has a large expanse of grass but is not characterized by multiple individual lawns; it's more of a maintained grassy area for a sport.",
    "Option B (front yard) refers to the space in front of a single house, thereby implying a single lawn. While many houses have lawns, it doesn't denote a large number of them collectively.",
    "Option C (suburbia) generally consists of many residential homes, which usually include front and back lawns. Suburban areas are often characterized by grassy yards.",
    "Option D (neighborhood) is similar to suburbia, but it can also encompass urban settings where lawns might not be present.",
    "Option E (Michigan) is a state and, while it may have lawns, it does not generally indicate a location with multiple lawns as it is too broad and varied.",
    "After analyzing the options, 'suburbia' (Option C) stands out as it specifically implies a community containing many houses, therefore many lawns, more so than the other options."
