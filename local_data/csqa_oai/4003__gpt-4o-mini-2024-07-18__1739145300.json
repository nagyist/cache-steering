  "query": "Question: Where is lint unlikely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: rug\nB: laundromat\nC: purse\nD: dryer\nE: pocket",
  "steps": [
    "Lint is typically a collection of small fibers that come off fabrics during washing or drying. It is more likely to accumulate in places where fabrics are handled or processed.",
    "A rug is a textile item, and it can collect lint over time, making it a probable location for lint accumulation.",
    "A laundromat is a place where laundry is done, and since many people wash their clothes there, it would likely have a lot of lint floating around from all the laundries being processed.",
    "A purse is not directly involved in the washing or drying processes. While it may occasionally collect small amounts of lint from being around lint-producing items, it is not a primary source of lint.",
    "A dryer is the primary place where lint is generated, as it removes lint from clothes during the drying cycle. Therefore, a dryer is very likely to have a lot of lint.",
    "A pocket of clothing may accumulate lint as well, especially if it\u2019s a fabric pocket which can collect debris from various fabrics.",
    "After considering all the options, it becomes clearer that the purse has the least likelihood of housing lint, compared to the other options which are directly associated with lint generation and accumulation."
