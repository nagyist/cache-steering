    "Choice C, 'music shop', directly indicates a place where musical instruments, including harmonicas, are sold.",
    "Choice D, 'mouth', does not apply as it refers to the usage of the harmonica rather than a place to find one.",
    "Choice E, 'pocket', may imply that someone can carry a harmonica there, but it does not suggest where to find one for purchase.",
