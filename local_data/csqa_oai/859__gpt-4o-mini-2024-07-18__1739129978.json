  "query": "Question: What happens when people are waiting for something?\n\nChoices:\nA: read book\nB: getting bored\nC: worry\nD: singing\nE: s never comes",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general behavior of people when they are in a state of waiting. People often engage in different activities to occupy their time or fill the void of anticipation.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. Reading a book (A) is a productive activity that some may choose to engage in while waiting, but not everyone does this.",
    "Consider the option \"getting bored\" (B). This is a common reaction to waiting due to a lack of engagement or stimulation. Many people experience boredom when they are forced to wait, suggesting this could be a valid answer.",
    "Next, analyze the option \"worry\" (C). When waiting, particularly for uncertain or important outcomes, it is possible that a person may experience worry. This could fit under the psychological responses people have during waiting.",
    "Evaluate \"singing\" (D). While some individuals might sing to keep themselves entertained, this behavior is less common in general waiting situations compared to the others listed.",
    "Lastly, consider option \"it never comes\" (E). This reflects a negative perspective about the outcome of waiting, but it doesn't encompass the more general experiences people have while waiting.",
    "Compare the more likely experiences: getting bored (B) and worrying (C). Both feelings are relatively common, but worrying can arise from the context of what one is waiting for, while boredom is more universally applicable.",
    "Realize that depending on individual scenarios, one might lean more towards worry or boredom. However, boredom may be the most broadly applicable feeling experienced universally during times of waiting.",
    "Final consideration leads to the understanding that while all of these choices can happen, 'getting bored' tends to be a common feeling that is relatable in many waiting situations."
