    "The question asks for something that can be moved to stop a hinged door from moving.",
    "A hinged door operates on a pivot point, typically involving a pivot attached to the door frame.",
    "The options provided include: A: doorway, B: building, C: jamb, D: pantry, and E: furnace.",
    "The 'doorway' (A) itself cannot be moved without structural changes; hence it isn't a viable option.",
    "The 'building' (B) is a large structure that cannot be moved to stop a door from moving and therefore isn't a suitable answer.",
    "The 'jamb' (C) is the vertical portion of the door frame that the door closes against, and it can be adjusted or replaced to affect the door\u2019s movement; thus it is a strong candidate.",
    "The 'pantry' (D) is a room or space and cannot directly stop a door from moving, so it's not relevant to the question.",
    "The 'furnace' (E) is an appliance that does not directly relate to the door's movement as well and cannot be moved to affect the door.",
    "Among the choices analyzed, the jamb (C) is the only option directly connected to the door's movement that can be adjusted to stop it from moving."
