  "query": "Question: John was in a ship.  It began taking water.  He was worried because the ship might do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sink\nB: glass\nC: fly\nD: ocean\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "The ship is taking on water, which implies that it is in danger of losing buoyancy.",
    "When a ship loses buoyancy due to taking on water, one of the most likely outcomes is that it could sink.",
    "The other options provided do not logically follow from the situation of a ship taking on water.",
    "\"Glass\" (B) does not relate to the context of a ship or water.",
    "\"Fly\" (C) is not an action associated with ships; they do not have the capability to fly.",
    "\"Ocean\" (D) simply refers to a body of water and does not represent any outcome.",
    "\"The surface of the earth\" (E) is not directly relevant either; while it is a location, it doesn't address the immediate concern of a sinking ship.",
    "Based on all the reasoning steps, the only viable answer to what might happen to the ship is that it could sink due to taking on water."
