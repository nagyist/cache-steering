  "query": "Question: If you aren't glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have?\n\nChoices:\nA: depressed\nB: downcast\nC: angry\nD: unhappy\nE: sorrowful",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about an illness that relates to not feeling glad, unhappy, or gloomy. We need to find a term that fits this description.",
    "Firstly, \"depressed\" is commonly used to describe a state of low mood or an illness related to persistent sadness and loss of interest. This could fit the context.",
    "\"Downcast\" is a term that generally means being sad or disheartened. While it signifies low spirits, it is not typically classified as an illness.",
    "\"Angry\" describes a strong emotional response to perceived wrongs or injustice. It does not relate to lacking gladness; instead, it signifies a different emotional state.",
    "\"Unhappy\" is synonymous with sad or not pleased, which describes a feeling rather than an illness. This matches the conditions stated in the question but does not fit as an illness.",
    "\"Sorrowful\" indicates deep sadness or regret, which again suggests an emotional state rather than an illness.",
    "Among the options, \"depressed\" is the only term that signifies a mental health condition characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or lack of pleasure.",
    "None of the other options represent an illness in the same way that \"depressed\" does, as they refer more to emotional states or reactions.",
    "Thus, the answer must be the only choice that represents an illness linked to not feeling glad, which is \"depressed\"."
