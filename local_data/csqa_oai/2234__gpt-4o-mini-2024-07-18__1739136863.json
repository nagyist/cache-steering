  "steps": [
    "The research process typically begins with a question or hypothesis that the researcher seeks to explore or prove.",
    "As the research progresses, data is collected and analyzed to gather evidence related to the hypothesis.",
    "At this stage, researchers may uncover insights and information that contribute to a deeper understanding of the topic.",
    "However, the definitive discovering of truth in a research context happens once the findings have been interpreted and the implications of the research have been understood.",
    "The conclusion of the research allows researchers to summarize their findings and state whether their hypothesis was supported or refuted.",
    "Therefore, the conclusion is where final interpretations and truths drawn from the research are articulated clearly.",
    "It\u2019s critical to differentiate between discovering information and establishing truth; the latter requires comprehensive analysis and validation, often found in the conclusion stage.",
    "Given that the question asks specifically about the part of the research process where truth is discovered, the conclusion is the most fitting answer among the options provided."
