  "query": "Question: If I want to make my cup of water colder, how would I go about it?\n\nChoices:\nA: liquid nitrogen\nB: steam room\nC: tidal waves\nD: ocean\nE: crushed ice",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the options that would effectively lower the temperature of the water.",
    "Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold and could drastically reduce the temperature of the water very quickly.",
    "A steam room, on the other hand, would introduce heat and humidity, which wouldn't help in cooling the water.",
    "Tidal waves are not a practical option for cooling a cup of water. They represent large-scale water movement and would not provide direct cooling.",
    "The ocean is cold, but if I am looking for a method that can be used quickly and conveniently at home, it may not be practical unless I can easily access it.",
    "Crushed ice is a popular method for quickly cooling beverages or water because it can be easily added and mixes well, lowering the temperature effectively.",
    "I can conclude that both liquid nitrogen and crushed ice are viable options, but crushed ice is more accessible for everyday use.",
    "Among the options, crushed ice is the most suitable choice for making a cup of water colder quickly and conveniently compared to other methods."
