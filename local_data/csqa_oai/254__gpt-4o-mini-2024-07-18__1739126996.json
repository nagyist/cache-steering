  "steps": [
    "Consider the context of the question, which asks for a suitable place to obtain a ball.",
    "Analyze choice A: the kitchen typically does not have balls readily available, as it is primarily an area for cooking and food preparation.",
    "Analyze choice B: a child's hand may hold a ball, but it is not a general place where one can get a ball at any time.",
    "Analyze choice C: the street might have balls found outside, but it is not a reliable or safe option for getting a ball.",
    "Analyze choice D: a toy store is specifically designed for selling toys, including balls, making it a likely and good option for obtaining one.",
    "Analyze choice E: a soccer game may have many balls being used, but it may not be a viable option for actually obtaining a ball unless you are part of that game.",
    "Comparing all the options, the toy store stands out as the most logical choice to get a ball, as it is designed for purchasing such items.",
    "Thus, the best answer based on the reasoning is the toy store."
