  "query": "Question: Garry felt like he could eat a whole cow, he didn't care.  Where might he go?\n\nChoices:\nA: barnyard\nB: canada\nC: butcher shop\nD: dairy farm\nE: country side",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"felt like he could eat a whole cow\" suggests that Garry is very hungry or has a strong desire for meat.",
    "A barnyard is typically associated with livestock and farming, but it might not be a place where he can eat directly.",
    "Canada is a country known for its vast landscapes and some beef production, but it doesn't specifically relate to Garry's immediate need to eat.",
    "A butcher shop is a place where meat is sold, and it might be a place he would go if he wanted to acquire meat to satisfy his hunger.",
    "A dairy farm focuses on milk production rather than meat, so it is irrelevant for someone wanting to eat a cow.",
    "The countryside may have farms and livestock, but it doesn't directly provide a way for Garry to eat a cow.",
    "Among the options, the butcher shop is the most direct and logical choice for a person who feels extremely hungry and wants to eat cow meat specifically.",
    "I have analyzed each option based on Garry's feelings and the context provided in the question."
