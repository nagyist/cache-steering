    "To understand why someone might want to stop being married, we need to consider the factors that typically lead to separation or divorce.",
    "Lying can erode trust in a relationship and cause serious emotional damage, which can lead to a desire to end the marriage.",
    "Trouble encompasses many issues, such as financial problems, incompatibility, or repeated conflicts. It is a broad term that accurately reflects many conflicts in a marriage.",
    "Civil authorities usually do not play a direct role in wanting to stop being married; they are more involved in the legal aspects of divorce rather than the emotional reasons behind it.",
    "Lawyers are often necessary for the process of divorce, but the desire to end the marriage does not come from the lawyer. Instead, they help facilitate the process.",
    "Judges also do not influence the desire to stop being married; they merely make rulings on legal matters concerning the divorce.",
    "Analyzing the options, A (lying) and B (trouble) are the most relevant as to the reasons someone might want to stop being married.",
    "Between A and B, \"trouble\" is a more comprehensive term that captures a wider range of issues that could lead to wanting to end the marriage.",
    "Thus, the main answer that encapsulates the primary reasons for wanting to divorce someone would be \"trouble.\""
