  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the two teams were competing all the time\" suggests that there was ongoing competition between them.",
    "In competitive scenarios, the emotional and relational dynamics can vary greatly, but competition typically leads to specific outcomes or feelings.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"accomplishment\" (A) is not a direct emotional or relational outcome of competition, but rather a result that may or may not arise from competing.",
    "The option \"enemies\" (B) may imply hostility, but it does not necessarily fit the context of teams competing, as they could merely be rivals without being disliking each other.",
    "Rivalry (C) specifically refers to a situation where two parties strive to outperform one another, which aligns perfectly with ongoing competition and often develops strong feelings related to that competition.",
    "\"Friendship\" (D) seems unlikely in the context of constant competition, as competing teams are less likely to develop close bonds through rivalry.",
    "The term \"bad blood\" (E) also suggests animosity and hostility, which is a potential outcome but is not definitive of all competitive scenarios.",
    "Considering the nature of competition, \"rivalry\" appears to encapsulate the foundational aspect of two teams competing constantly.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting conclusion for what likely developed between them, based on the context of constant competition, would be rivalry."
