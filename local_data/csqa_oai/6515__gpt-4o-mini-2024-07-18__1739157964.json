  "query": "Question: Simon was meeting Jane that afternoon.  This meant that he needed to be finished with his project by when?\n\nChoices:\nA: evening\nB: before lunch\nC: after\nD: morning\nE: after",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine the timing of Simon's meeting with Jane. Since the meeting is scheduled for the afternoon, it implies that he should complete his project before that time.",
    "Next, if Simon is meeting Jane in the afternoon, he likely needs enough time to prepare and possibly travel to the meeting location, which indicates he should finish his project sometime before the afternoon starts.",
    "The afternoon typically starts around 12 PM to 1 PM, depending on the context. To ensure he finishes his project \"by\" the time of the meeting, he should ideally complete it a bit before this time to accommodate any last-minute preparations.",
    "Therefore, if he needs to meet in the afternoon, finishing \"before lunch\" (which generally means around midday) makes sense because that would give him the time to wrap up and prepare for his meeting with Jane.",
    "Thus, seeing the choices provided, the only option that corresponds with finishing before the afternoon starts is \"before lunch.\""
