  "steps": [
    "The football player is exhausted and having trouble breathing fresh air, which suggests he is struggling to get adequate oxygen.",
    "Wearing a mask in such a situation typically means that it is designed to help improve the quality of the air he is breathing or to filter it in some way.",
    "In many sports, athletes use specialized masks to increase their oxygen intake, which can help with breathing efficiency.",
    "It is important to assess the available choices based on the context of an athlete's need for better breathing assistance.",
    "Choice A (breathing) is vague and does not specifically address what the mask will directly improve.",
    "Choice B (energy) doesn\u2019t directly relate to the player\u2019s immediate action of putting on a mask; while energy is important, it\u2019s not specifically increased by the mask.",
    "Choice C (think more clearly) is not directly relevant to the act of wearing a mask for breathing purposes.",
    "Choice E (feeling refreshed) might be a secondary effect but is not the primary reason for putting on a mask aimed at enhancing air intake.",
    "Choice D (oxygen intake) directly supports the scenario where the football player is trying to alleviate his breathing difficulty by increasing the oxygen levels he is taking in through the mask.",
    "Since the most appropriate and specific benefit of wearing a mask in this context is to enhance oxygen intake, D is the best answer."
