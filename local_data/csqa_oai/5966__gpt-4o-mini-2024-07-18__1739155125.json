  "query": "Question: Most people loved competing, it's a way to show of their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: skill\nB: competition\nC: sportsmanship\nD: opponent\nE: effort",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that competing is a means for people to express something about themselves.",
    "The available choices suggest different aspects of competing. I need to evaluate which choice best fits the context of showing off.",
    "Choice A: \"skill.\" Competing typically allows individuals to showcase their abilities and proficiency in a given area.",
    "Choice B: \"competition.\" This doesn't fit as well, because the act of competing itself is not what is being showcased; it's more about their personal attributes.",
    "Choice C: \"sportsmanship.\" While sportsmanship is important in competition, it may not directly refer to what individuals are showcasing about themselves.",
    "Choice D: \"opponent.\" Showing off an opponent doesn't align with the context of the sentence where the focus is on the individual's expression.",
    "Choice E: \"effort.\" Competing can also demonstrate effort, but this is a more indirect aspect compared to skill.",
    "Comparing the strongest contenders, \"skill\" seems to most directly encapsulate what many individuals aim to showcase when they compete.",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer based on the reasoning is choice A."
