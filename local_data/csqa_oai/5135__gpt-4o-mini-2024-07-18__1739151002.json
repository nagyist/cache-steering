  "query": "Question: Most dentist offices are found in what groups of homes and businesses?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: suburb\nC: city\nD: hospital\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the common locations where dentist offices are typically situated.",
    "Dentist offices are generally found in residential and commercial areas to provide accessibility to patients.",
    "Within cities, dentist offices are commonly located in neighborhoods or business districts rather than being exclusively in one type of location.",
    "Suburbs are also a common setting, offering both residential zones and standalone businesses, including dental practices.",
    "I will consider the answer choices provided: street, suburb, city, hospital, and town.",
    "While \"hospital\" might have dental clinics, it is not a primary characteristic for most dentist offices, which typically operate independently.",
    "Both \"suburb\" and \"city\" are strong candidates since they both provide the needed infrastructure for dental offices to thrive.",
    "Between suburb and city, cities generally have a higher density of dentist offices due to larger populations and more potential patients.",
    "However, many suburbs are also designed to accommodate essential businesses like dental offices.",
    "When looking at the broader context of where most dentist offices are found, the highest concentration is likely in urban areas while also being well-represented in suburban communities.",
    "Ultimately, the question asks for the most common group of homes and businesses, which typically favors the larger urban environments or cities over specific suburbs or towns."
