  "query": "Question: The religious man was explaining that his faith was something that only he could what?\n\nChoices:\nA: dream\nB: light way\nC: belief\nD: trust\nE: experience",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the personal nature of faith and something that is inherently subjective.",
    "The phrase \"only he could\" suggests that the answer should involve an aspect of personal experience or individuality.",
    "Looking at the choices, we need to identify which options strongly relate to personal interpretation and cannot be shared or imposed on others.",
    "Choice A, \"dream,\" while personal, does not directly relate to faith itself, as dreams are more about aspirations.",
    "Choice B, \"light way,\" is not clear in meaning and does not seem to relate directly to faith in any fundamental sense.",
    "Choice C, \"belief,\" is connected to faith but typically can be shared or discussed among others, making it less fitting for something unique to just him.",
    "Choice D, \"trust,\" is a component of faith but does not encapsulate the full essence of a personal belief system.",
    "Choice E, \"experience,\" aligns closely with the idea that one\u2019s faith is shaped by individual experiences and is something deeply personal.",
    "Considering the context of the statement, the most fitting choice is E, as it captures the essence that faith is an individualized experience that cannot be truly understood or felt by anyone else."
