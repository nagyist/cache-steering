  "steps": [
    "A bodybuilder consumes a lot of food primarily to meet their energy and nutritional needs for muscle growth and recovery.",
    "Bodybuilders engage in intense training sessions that require adequate fuel in the form of calories and protein to support muscle repair and growth.",
    "By eating large quantities of food, bodybuilders aim to create a caloric surplus, which is necessary for gaining muscle mass.",
    "While satisfying hunger may be a natural part of eating, the underlying motive for bodybuilders is more focused on achieving specific fitness goals.",
    "Maintaining a balanced nutrient intake is critical, which is why they often include protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats in their diet.",
    "C: satisfy hunger may be partially true, but it does not fully capture the broader goal of their eating habits.",
    "In contrast, E: gain weight directly addresses the outcome of their diet, as they intentionally consume more calories to gain muscle weight.",
    "Option A (pleasant conversation) and D (sounds of digestion) are irrelevant to the motivation for food intake in bodybuilders.",
    "Among the choices, E is the most accurate representation of why bodybuilders eat so much, as their primary goal is to gain weight in the form of muscle mass."
