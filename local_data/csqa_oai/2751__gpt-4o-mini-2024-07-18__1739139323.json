  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the tree wanted to grow more, indicating that it has the potential for growth.",
    "It specifies that the roots stopped spreading, which suggests an obstruction that prevents further development.",
    "The choices provided need to be analyzed in relation to what would cause roots to stop spreading in a garden setting.",
    "Choice A: \"affected by weather\" seems unlikely because while weather can impact growth, it doesn't specifically obstruct roots from spreading.",
    "Choice B: \"wall in\" implies a physical barrier that could prevent the roots from growing outward. This suggests a direct cause for the halting of root spread.",
    "Choice C: \"grow tall\" doesn't correlate with why roots would stop spreading; roots growing tall would not prevent lateral growth.",
    "Choice D: \"burn\" might suggest damage to the roots, but it doesn't explain why spreading would specifically stop.",
    "Choice E: \"hatred\" is irrelevant in this context as it doesn't pertain to physical growth or structural obstructions.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most logical choice is B, as a wall can physically prevent the roots from spreading further."
