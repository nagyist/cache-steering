  "query": "Question: Where would a policeman be most likely to stop a car?\n\nChoices:\nA: the park\nB: police station\nC: front door\nD: roadblock\nE: street",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the function of a policeman stopping a car, which typically involves enforcement of laws and public safety on the road.",
    "Evaluate the choices based on the context in which a police stop is most likely to occur.",
    "Choice A (the park) does not generally align with situations where a car would be stopped, as parks are not common locations for traffic enforcement.",
    "Choice B (police station) is where police officers are based but is not a location where they would actively stop cars.",
    "Choice C (front door) does not apply because a front door is a residential or commercial entry point, not a location for stopping vehicles.",
    "Choice D (roadblock) is a valid choice, as roadblocks are set up specifically for stopping vehicles for various reasons, including safety checks or law enforcement actions.",
    "Choice E (street) is reasonable because police officers often stop cars on the street for traffic violations or checks, but it is not as specific as a roadblock which indicates a formal stopping point.",
    "Compare the likelihood between choice D (roadblock) and choice E (street). A roadblock is a more formal and organized method specifically designed for stopping vehicles.",
    "Conclude that while police could stop a car on a street, a roadblock is more indicative of a specific situation where car stops are expected and organized."
