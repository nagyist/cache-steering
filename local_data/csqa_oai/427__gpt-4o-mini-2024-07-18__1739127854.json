  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the effects of humans being exposed to noises.",
    "Noises are generally understood to refer to sounds, which are vibrations that travel through the air or another medium and can be perceived by the ears.",
    "When humans are exposed to noises, they typically engage their auditory system to process and interpret these sounds.",
    "The answer choices provided involve various actions or outcomes, so we need to identify which one is directly related to the reception of noise.",
    "Choice A: \"pet the dog\" - This is an action that may occur but is not universally linked to being exposed to noise.",
    "Choice B: \"hear sounds\" - This is a direct response to exposure to noise, as hearing is the process that occurs when sound waves reach the ear.",
    "Choice C: \"have sex\" - This is an action that is not directly related to the experience of hearing noise.",
    "Choice D: \"reproduce\" - This action is also not directly tied to the exposure to noise.",
    "Choice E: \"drive cars\" - Although one might hear noise while driving, it is not a reaction specifically linked to exposure to noise itself.",
    "After analyzing the options, it's clear that the most relevant answer to what happens when humans are exposed to noises is \"hear sounds.\""
