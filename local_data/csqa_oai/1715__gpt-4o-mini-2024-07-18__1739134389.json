    "Identify what a constitutional monarchy is: it is a system of government in which a monarch shares power with a constitutionally organized government.",
    "Confirm that a parliamentary democracy is a system where the government is elected by parliament, which represents the electorate.",
    "Understand what a federation is: it refers to a union of partially self-governing provinces or states under a central government.",
    "Consider countries that are known to have a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, and federation simultaneously.",
    "Identify Canada as a country that has a constitutional monarchy (the monarch is the British monarch), a parliamentary democracy (the government is elected by the parliament), and a federation (it has provinces and territories that hold power).",
    "Evaluate the other choices: \n- A: church does not relate to government systems.\n- B: democracy is too general and does not specify the forms mentioned.\n- D: country is too vague and not specific to a system.\n- E: civilization encompasses a wider scope than just governance.",
