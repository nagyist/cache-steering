  "query": "Question: When they discovered horses, what did Native Americans do with the plains landscape?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: dominated\nC: raised on farms\nD: play\nE: eat grass",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the actions of Native Americans in relation to the plains landscape after the discovery of horses.",
    "Historically, when horses were introduced to Native American tribes, it significantly changed their methods of hunting and transportation.",
    "The introduction of horses allowed Native Americans to cover larger distances more quickly and efficiently, impacting their way of life on the plains.",
    "Horses enabled tribes to follow bison herds and other game more effectively, which were vital resources for food and materials.",
    "This greater mobility likely contributed to a more dominant presence in the plains, as they could better stake claim to hunting grounds and resources.",
    "While some options suggest actions that are not directly related to the plains landscape (such as 'play' or 'eat grass'), others focus on impact.",
    "The option \"dominated\" suggests a significant change in their ability to control their environment and resources due to the advantage that horses provided them.",
    "The option \"raised on farms\" does not fit well with the historical context of Native Americans on the plains, who were more nomadic and focused on hunting and gathering.",
    "Choices like \"ocean\" are irrelevant since the plains landscape does not pertain to oceanic environments.",
    "Having analyzed the remaining options, \"dominated\" fits best with historical accounts of how Native Americans utilized horses to enhance their way of life on the plains."
