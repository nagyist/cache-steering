  "query": "Question: Bill picks from an apple tree in southern Michigan, where is he most likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: detroit\nB: maryland\nC: oregon\nD: washington state\nE: indiana",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where Bill is most likely to be, we should first consider the geographical location of southern Michigan.",
    "Southern Michigan is situated in the Midwest region of the United States and is known for its apple orchards, particularly in areas like the fruit belt along the Great Lakes.",
    "Next, let's examine the choices available. We need to identify which locations are geographically closest to southern Michigan and have apple orchards.",
    "The choices include: A) Detroit, which is located within southern Michigan, B) Maryland, which is on the East Coast far from Michigan, C) Oregon, which is on the West Coast, D) Washington state, also on the West Coast, and E) Indiana, which is directly adjacent to southern Michigan.",
    "Since southern Michigan is known for its apple picking, Detroit, being within southern Michigan, is a likely choice.",
    "Indiana also has apple orchards and is neighboring southern Michigan, but it is not in southern Michigan where Bill is picking apples according to the question.",
    "Comparing the likelihood of Bill being in these locations, A) Detroit stands out as the most direct answer as he is already in southern Michigan.",
    "Furthermore, since the question specifies he is picking apples \"in southern Michigan,\" he is most likely in the vicinity of Detroit rather than venturing into Indiana or another state.",
    "In summary, Detroit is the best and most direct answer indicating Bill's location as he picks apples in southern Michigan."
