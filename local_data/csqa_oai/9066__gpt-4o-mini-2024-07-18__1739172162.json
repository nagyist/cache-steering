  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"got up at intermission\" suggests that there was a break in the performance or event they were attending.",
    "Intermissions are commonly associated with performances that include plays, musicals, or films.",
    "Popcorn is typically associated with movie theaters, but it is also sold at some live theater performances.",
    "While \"event\" could be a generic term, it does not specify the type of activity where popcorn and intermissions are standardized.",
    "The term \"school\" does not typically relate to intermissions or the sale of popcorn.",
    "\"New York\" is a location and does not describe an activity or type of performance.",
    "Evaluating the options, \"movies\" (A) and \"theatre\" (C) both seem plausible based on the context of intermissions and popcorn. However, movies are generally the first association with popcorn.",
    "The presence of both options 'movies' and 'theatre' indicates a split where both may apply, but the explicit mention of \"popcorn\" leads to a stronger implication toward films.",
    "Considering common practices, the scenario of popcorn during an intermission particularly aligns with movie presentations.",
    "Weighing all steps and connections made, the most likely activity being watched is a movie."
