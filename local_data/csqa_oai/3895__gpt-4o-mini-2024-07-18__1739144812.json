  "query": "Question: what is the end result of hiring a maid?\n\nChoices:\nA: clean bathroom\nB: cleaning house\nC: an affair\nD: clean room\nE: clean house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary purpose of hiring a maid, which is to have someone help with household tasks.",
    "Next, identify what household tasks a maid typically performs, including cleaning various areas of the home.",
    "One common task a maid performs is cleaning the bathroom, which is often a significant part of household maintenance.",
    "Additionally, a maid generally cleans multiple rooms in a house, contributing to overall house cleanliness.",
    "Evaluate the options provided in the choices: A mentions cleaning the bathroom, B refers to cleaning the house, C suggests an affair (which is unrelated), D states clean room, and E presents clean house.",
    "Given the tasks of a maid, options B and E are both closely related but may indicate broader or different scopes of cleaning.",
    "However, option E (\"clean house\") seems more encompassing as it implies cleaning the entire house rather than just a room or specific area.",
    "Although cleaning the bathroom (A) and cleaning a room (D) are legitimate end results, they are not as comprehensive as cleaning the entire house.",
    "The suggestion of an affair (C) does not logically follow from the act of hiring a maid and should be dismissed."
