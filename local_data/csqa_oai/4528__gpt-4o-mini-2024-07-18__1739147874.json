  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"isolated from the rest of the country\" suggests a location that is somewhat remote or separate from urban areas or regular tourist spots.",
    "A jungle (Choice A) is typically a natural environment with dense vegetation, and although it can be isolated, it generally does not have swimming pools for tourists.",
    "The YMCA (Choice B) is a community organization that often has recreational facilities, including swimming pools, but it is not typically referred to as a tourist destination that would be isolated.",
    "A resort hotel (Choice C) is designed specifically for tourists and often features swimming pools. Such hotels can be positioned in isolated areas to provide a getaway experience.",
    "California (Choice D) is a large state that contains many different environments, including beaches and urban areas. It is not an isolated location itself but rather a place that tourists visit.",
    "A motel (Choice E) generally caters to travelers but may not offer the same level of amenities (like swimming pools) as resort hotels do. Motels are usually found along highways and are not inherently isolated.",
    "Based on the analysis, the choice that best fits the description of having a swimming pool and being isolated from the country is a resort hotel."
