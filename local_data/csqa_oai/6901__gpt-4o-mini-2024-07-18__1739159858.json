  "query": "Question: The jelly was opened and likely to spoil, where should someone put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: away\nB: jar\nC: donuts\nD: peanut butter\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "The jelly has been opened, which means it is exposed to air and bacteria, making it prone to spoilage.",
    "To prolong the life of opened jelly, it's important to store it properly to minimize spoilage.",
    "One common way to store opened jelly is by refrigerating it, as cold temperatures can slow down bacterial growth and spoilage.",
    "Although it may not be ideal to leave jelly unrefrigerated for an extended period, storing it in a sealed jar is beneficial if it has some insulation; however, refrigeration is the most effective method.",
    "The other options, such as donuts and peanut butter, do not provide any protective environment against spoilage for the jelly.",
    "Choosing \"away\" could imply leaving it out, which would increase the chance of it spoiling quickly.",
    "Thus, putting the jelly in the refrigerator would be the best choice to keep it fresh longer."
