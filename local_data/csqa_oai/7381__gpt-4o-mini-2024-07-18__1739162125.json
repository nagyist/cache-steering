  "steps": [
    "Attending church and praying are activities typically associated with religious practices.",
    "These activities are expressions of one's beliefs and are often categorized under the concept of \"religiosity.\"",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"religiosity\" (A) aligns well with the acts of attending church and praying, as they are both integral aspects of practicing religion.",
    "The other options, such as \"peacefulness\" (B) or \"relief\" (C), do not specifically relate to the activities themselves but rather to possible emotional outcomes of those activities.",
    "\"Feeling better\" (D) and \"feel better\" (E) suggest a state of mind that can result from religious activities but does not define them.",
    "Therefore, while attending church and praying might lead to feelings of peacefulness or relief, they fundamentally represent a commitment to religious practice, which is best described as religiosity."
