  "query": "Question: Where do wings symbolize a transition has happened?\n\nChoices:\nA: airplane\nB: heaven\nC: flapping\nD: pilot\nE: detroit",
  "steps": [
    "Wings are often associated with flight and the ability to move from one place to another, which can signify a transition or change.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"heaven\" is commonly referenced in religious or metaphorical contexts where wings symbolize ascension or a transition to a higher state or existence.",
    "The other options like \"airplane,\" \"flapping,\" \"pilot,\" and \"detroit\" do not typically convey a sense of spiritual or metaphorical transition, but rather practical or literal meanings relating to flight.",
    "Specifically, \"heaven\" has strong connotations of the afterlife and moving from the earthly realm, which aligns directly with the idea of a significant life transition.",
    "Airplanes represent transport but lack the deeper symbolic meaning of transition compared to heaven, where wings are often depicted in art and literature to illustrate elevation or change.",
    "The term \"flapping\" refers to the motion of wings, and does not imply any transition; rather, it describes an action that is part of flying.",
    "A \"pilot\" operates an airplane and does not symbolize a transition themselves; they are more of a facilitator of movement.",
    "Lastly, \"Detroit\" is a city and does not connect to the symbolism of wings or transitions in any significant manner.",
    "Through this analysis, \"heaven\" clearly stands out as the option that represents where wings symbolize a transition that has happened."
