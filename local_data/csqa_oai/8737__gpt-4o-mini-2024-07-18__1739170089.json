  "query": "Question: Where would you put a fire extinguisher if you do not have any large doors in your house and your house only has one floor?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: stairwell\nC: house\nD: kitchen\nE: outside",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the house is a single floor and does not have large doors, which indicates the layout of the house is likely compact.",
    "Fire extinguishers should be placed in accessible locations for quick response in case of a fire.",
    "Common locations for fire extinguishers include the kitchen, garage, and other areas where fire hazards may exist.",
    "The kitchen often has appliances that can catch fire, making it a critical area for a fire extinguisher.",
    "The garage can have fire hazards as well, particularly if flammable materials are stored there.",
    "A stairwell is typically for vertical movement, but since the house is one floor, there is no need for a stairwell extinguisher.",
    "Putting a fire extinguisher outside may not be ideal, as it could delay access during an emergency.",
    "Given that the kitchen is often the most common place for a fire to start, placing a fire extinguisher there makes it immediately accessible.",
    "Though the garage is another possible option, it is less favorable than the kitchen due to the higher likelihood of kitchen fires.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all possible choices, it is clear that the optimal location for placing a fire extinguisher in this scenario is the kitchen."
