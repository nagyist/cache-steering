  "query": "Question: Where is likely to have a family owned barber shop?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighborhood\nB: high street\nC: canada\nD: comb\nE: wig store",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the likelihood of finding a family-owned barber shop.",
    "Family-owned businesses tend to thrive in local, community-oriented settings rather than in highly commercialized areas.",
    "Barber shops are typically small businesses that often cater to the local community and its residents.",
    "A \"neighborhood\" is a residential area, which is conducive to family-owned businesses, including barber shops.",
    "The \"high street,\" while business-centric, contains various chain and franchise operations, making it less likely for a family-owned barber shop to operate there.",
    "\"Canada,\" as a country, is too broad and does not specifically denote a local setting; it may contain family-owned barber shops, but it isn't a location itself.",
    "\"Comb\" is an inanimate object entirely unrelated to the presence or likelihood of a shop.",
    "\"Wig store\" is a specialized type of retail establishment that does not serve the primary function of a barber shop.",
    "Comparing \"neighborhood\" and \"high street,\" the neighborhood presents a stronger case for the likelihood of encountering a family-owned barber shop.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most plausible choice for the presence of a family-owned barber shop is \"neighborhood.\""
