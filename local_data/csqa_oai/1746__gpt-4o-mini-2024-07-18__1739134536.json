  "query": "Question: Where is a tin likely to be stored?\n\nChoices:\nA: shopping bag\nB: kitchen\nC: hardware store\nD: grocery store\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to think about what a tin is typically used for. Tins commonly refer to metal containers used for storing food or other items.",
    "Next, I consider where food-related items are usually stored. The kitchen is often a primary location for food storage.",
    "I also think about the grocery store. While tins can be found there, they are generally sold there rather than stored there.",
    "The option of a hardware store is worth considering. However, tins are not typically associated with hardware storage or tools.",
    "A shopping bag could hold a tin temporarily but is not a storage location for tins overall.",
    "I consider the cupboard in the kitchen, which is a specific storage area for food items, including tins.",
    "The kitchen itself is a place where tins are used, but the specific storage location within the kitchen would be the cupboard.",
    "So, out of all the options, the cupboard is the best fit as it implies a place where tins could be stored.",
    "I will analyze the list of options again. The hardware store has tins for sale but does not store them in a typical home environment. The grocery store is not for storage.",
    "Thus, the most logical locations for tins being stored are either the kitchen or specifically in the cupboard. Hence, I select the cupboard as the final answer."
