  "query": "Question: The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?\n\nChoices:\nA: ignore\nB: enforce\nC: authoritarian\nD: yell at\nE: avoid",
  "steps": [
    "The context suggests that the sanctions were negative and affected the school's efforts to improve.",
    "To find the best word that fits, we need a synonym or an appropriate action that describes how the sanctions relate to the school's efforts for change.",
    "Among the choices, \"ignore\" seems to imply that the sanctions negated or disregarded the school's efforts to change.",
    "\"Enforce\" and \"authoritarian\" do not fit well because they imply a strengthening or imposing of regulation rather than a negation or overlooking.",
    "\"Yell at\" and \"avoid\" also do not capture the essence of how the sanctions interact with the school's efforts effectively."
