  "query": "Question: A person, cannot afford their home, they are likely to be experiencing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: schizophrenia\nB: deception\nC: live in poverty\nD: bad feelings\nE: wealth",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the situation where a person cannot afford their home. This situation typically suggests financial difficulties.",
    "Next, we consider what financial difficulties imply. They often lead to economic challenges and can be associated with a lower standard of living.",
    "Now, we evaluate the potential choices. Schizophrenia (A) is a mental health condition and not directly related to the inability to afford a home.",
    "Next, deception (B) implies dishonesty or trickery, which does not correlate with the financial inability to maintain a home.",
    "Then, we look at \"live in poverty\" (C). This directly relates to financial hardship and is a common outcome for those who cannot afford basic living expenses, such as housing.",
    "Considering \u201cbad feelings\u201d (D), while stress or negative emotions might occur due to financial issues, it is not the primary concern regarding affording a home.",
    "Finally, \u201cwealth\u201d (E) clearly stands in contradiction to someone who cannot afford their home, as wealth implies having excess financial resources.",
    "After analyzing all the options based on the context of financial hardship and inability to afford a home, the most logical and relevant choice is \"live in poverty.\""
