  "query": "Question: The tree had thousands of animals living in it, where was it located?\n\nChoices:\nA: back yard\nB: university\nC: rainforest\nD: backyard\nE: sea",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the tree had thousands of animals living in it, which suggests a diverse ecosystem.",
    "A backyard generally does not support such a high number of animals; it's usually a small area with limited biodiversity.",
    "A university might have some trees, but it is not typically known for having thousands of animals living in a single tree.",
    "The term \"rainforest\" refers to a dense and biodiverse area where a multitude of animal species can coexist in trees.",
    "The category \"sea\" does not apply, as it refers to a body of water and not a location for trees.",
    "Comparing \"rainforest\" to the other options, it is the only one that aligns with the idea of a tree supporting thousands of animals.",
    "None of the other options (backyard, university, or sea) present a plausible scenario for such a high density of animal life in a tree.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that the tree was located in a rainforest."
