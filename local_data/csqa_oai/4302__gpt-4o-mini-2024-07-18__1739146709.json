  "query": "Question: Cows outnumber people 4 to 1 in what state north of Kansas?\n\nChoices:\nA: advertisement\nB: nebraska\nC: countryside\nD: fairy tale\nE: iowa",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the context of the question, which mentions a state north of Kansas.",
    "Looking at a map of the United States, we can see the states directly north of Kansas are Nebraska and part of South Dakota.",
    "Next, we focus on the information provided about cow population relative to human population, specifically the ratio of cows to people, which is 4 to 1.",
    "In this context, we recall that Nebraska is known for its agriculture, particularly its cattle ranching, which suggests a higher cow population compared to people.",
    "Iowa, which is also north of Kansas, is known for corn production and has a significant livestock industry, but it doesn't particularly stand out for having cows outnumbering people by that ratio.",
    "Other options like \"advertisement\" and \"fairy tale\" do not refer to states and can be dismissed.",
    "Therefore, out of the states north of Kansas, Nebraska is the most likely candidate for having a high cow population outnumbering humans, fitting the ratio of 4 to 1.",
    "Lastly, I confirm that Nebraska is indeed well-known for its cattle farming, supporting the idea that cows would likely outnumber people there significantly."
