  "steps": [
    "The question states that the woman spent a lot of time drinking alcohol, which implies she might face health risks associated with alcohol consumption.",
    "Doctors often advise individuals who consume excessive alcohol to avoid activities or situations that could exacerbate health problems related to alcohol.",
    "One potential risk of heavy alcohol consumption is an increased likelihood of issues with pregnancy, including potential harm to a fetus if pregnancy occurs while the woman is still drinking heavily.",
    "The other options (A, B, C, and E) do not directly align with common medical advice regarding alcohol consumption except D, which is specific to pregnancy.",
    "Licking the floor (A) is not a common concern related to alcohol consumption, while frequent urination (B) could be a symptom but is typically not something to avoid.",
    "Throwing up (C) might happen when someone drinks too much, but it's not a specific advice from doctors on what to avoid in relation to drinking alcohol over time.",
    "Toxicity (E) relates to alcohol but doesn't specify an action that the woman should avoid; it's more of a consequence of drinking.",
    "Given these considerations, the most pertinent advice from doctors regarding her drinking habits would likely relate to pregnancy."
