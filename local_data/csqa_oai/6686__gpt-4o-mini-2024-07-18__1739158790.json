  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze what it means to eat the skin of something and which of the options suggest something that is healthy to eat the skin of.",
    "The choices are A (good health), B (fruit), C (body), D (people), E (none).",
    "Eating the skin of good health (A) doesn't make literal sense. Health is not a physical object that has a skin.",
    "Next, if I consider eating the skin of fruit (B), many fruits are actually healthy to eat with their skin on, such as apples, pears, and grapes.",
    "For choice C (body), it is not healthy to eat skin from a body; this is not a typical or acceptable practice.",
    "Choice D (people) is also incorrect as it implies cannibalism, which is not healthy or safe.",
    "The only option that relates to a healthy practice involving skin is B (fruit).",
    "I can conclude that eating the skin of certain fruits is generally considered healthy due to the nutrients and fiber they provide.",
    "Since A, C, D, and E do not present a valid or healthy context for eating skin, my logical choice stands as B."
