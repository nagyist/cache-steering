    "To determine where to place a rosebush indoors, I first consider the options.",
    "A pot is a practical solution for keeping plants indoors, allowing for mobility and proper maintenance.",

    "A front lawn is an outdoor space and not suitable for keeping an indoor plant like a rosebush.",
    "A formal garden typically refers to an outdoor setting, not a space for indoor plants.",
