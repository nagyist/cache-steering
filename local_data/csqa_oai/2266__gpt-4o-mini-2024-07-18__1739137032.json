  "query": "Question: How does a bishop move from one place to another?\n\nChoices:\nA: chess game\nB: church\nC: in a car\nD: queen\nE: cathedral",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the movement of a bishop, which may refer to either a chess piece or a religious leader in a church context.",
    "If considering a chess game, the bishop moves diagonally across the board, covering any number of squares within that line, as long as there are no pieces obstructing its path.",
    "If considering a religious context, a bishop typically moves from one church or parish to another, possibly using various means of transportation (e.g., walking, driving).",
    "The answer choices include a mix of chess-related terms (A, D) and different contexts or places (B, C, E).",
    "Choice A refers explicitly to a chess game, which relates directly to how a bishop piece moves.",
    "Choice B refers to a church, which is a place where a bishop operates but does not describe the movement method.",
    "Choice C (in a car) could apply to a bishop in a church context, but it does not relate to the chess definition.",
    "Choice D refers to a queen, which is another chess piece but does not answer how a bishop moves.",
    "Choice E (cathedral) is a specific place relevant to a bishop but does not describe its movement.",
    "Given that the question likely pertains to the movement of the chess piece based on the options provided, choice A is the most fitting response."
