  "query": "Question: Where does someone with a signature rubber stamp work?\n\nChoices:\nA: made\nB: office\nC: craft store\nD: indiana\nE: art class",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a signature rubber stamp is typically used for. It\u2019s often used in professional settings to endorse documents, sign letters, and other official paperwork.",
    "Next, identify where these activities commonly occur. A workplace where documents need to be signed, such as an office, is a likely place.",
    "Examine the other options. While a craft store (C) could sell rubber stamps, it's not a typical workplace for someone who uses a signature rubber stamp for official purposes.",
    "Look at the remaining options: \"made\" (A) does not represent a place, \"indiana\" (D) is a location rather than a workplace, and \"art class\" (E) may involve creativity but is not specifically aligned with the use of a signature stamp.",
    "Based on the reasoning so far, the most logical answer is that someone using a signature rubber stamp would be working in an office."
