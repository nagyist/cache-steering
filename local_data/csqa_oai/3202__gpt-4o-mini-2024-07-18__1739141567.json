    "The phrase \"at the slightest hint of traffic\" suggests that even a small amount of congestion is enough to trigger a strong emotional response.",

    "The word \"impatience\" accurately captures the frustration and annoyance that often arise during traffic situations.",
    "Other options can be analyzed: \n- A: promotion does not fit the context as it relates to career advancement rather than driving.\n- B: pressure may apply in some sense, but it's less specific to the feeling invoked by traffic.\n- C: busy might describe the situation but not the emotional response.\n- D: getting there seems vague and does not convey a specific feeling associated with traffic.",
