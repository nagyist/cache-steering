  "query": "Question: Where is a city hall building likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: urban area\nB: town\nC: rooms\nD: area\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a city hall is generally used for: it is a government building that houses the administrative offices of a city or town.",
    "Next, consider where government buildings are typically located. City halls are usually found in designated areas of cities or towns rather than in rural locations or unrelated buildings.",
    "Evaluate the choices given: A (urban area) and B (town) both refer to locations where a city hall would logically be situated, while C (rooms), D (area), and E (office) are not specific locations but rather describe types of spaces or functions.",
    "Compare the two viable options: A (urban area) is broader and includes places with higher population density; B (town) refers to smaller municipalities that typically have their own city halls.",
    "Consider the context of \"city hall.\" While urban areas can encompass many cities, town refers more directly to the smaller entities that can also have city halls.",
    "Determine if city halls are usually found in both urban areas and towns. They are, but towns may have a more direct connection to their own city hall.",
    "Analyze if the location can be narrowed down: while A might seem correct, B is more specific because it directly refers to towns, which definitely have city halls.",
    "Decide which option represents a more definitive answer: A might include larger cities with city halls, yet many towns have them as well.",
    "Recognize that although both A and B could be correct, towns are specific locations that definitely feature city halls.",
    "Conclude by selecting the answer that most directly corresponds to the location of a city hall."
