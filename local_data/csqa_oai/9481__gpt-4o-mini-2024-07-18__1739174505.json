    "The question asks about the role of a helper monkey in the home of a disabled person.",
    "Helper monkeys are trained animals that assist individuals with disabilities by performing various tasks.",
    "The tasks may include retrieving items, opening doors, turning off lights, or helping with mobility.",
    "Now, I need to analyze the answer choices to find one that aligns with what a helper monkey does.",
    "Choice A, \"treetops,\" does not relate to the duties of a helper monkey in a home context.",
    "Choice B, \"works,\" suggests an action that aligns with the helper monkey's role but is too vague.",
    "Choice C, \"disturb,\" is contrary to the purpose of helper monkeys, which is to assist, not to cause disturbance.",
    "Choice D, \"nigeria,\" and choice E, \"south american country,\" are irrelevant as they address geographical locations rather than the role of helper monkeys.",
    "After eliminating the irrelevant options and considering the context of a helper monkey assisting a disabled person, the most fitting choice remains \"works\" because it indicates that the monkey is functioning in a supportive capacity."
