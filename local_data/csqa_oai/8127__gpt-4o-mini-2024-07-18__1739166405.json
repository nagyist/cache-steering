  "query": "Question: Where could a restaurant be located that would allow someone to sleep there?\n\nChoices:\nA: cafeteria\nB: building\nC: at hotel\nD: business sector\nE: yellow pages",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the options provided and their suitability for a restaurant where one could also sleep.",
    "The first option, A: cafeteria, typically refers to a place where people eat, and does not generally allow for sleeping arrangements.",
    "The second option, B: building, is very broad and does not specify what type of building it is; it could include many facilities, but sleeping isn't guaranteed.",
    "Next, I analyze option C: at hotel. Hotels often have restaurants within them, and guests can sleep in their rooms, which directly aligns with the question.",
    "Moving to option D: business sector, while this may denote areas where various businesses are located, it does not specifically indicate that sleeping is available, especially in a restaurant context.",
    "Lastly, option E: yellow pages refers to a directory and not to a physical location, so it\u2019s irrelevant when considering a place to sleep.",
    "Among all the options, option C: at hotel, clearly provides a location that meets the criteria for both a restaurant and a sleeping area."
