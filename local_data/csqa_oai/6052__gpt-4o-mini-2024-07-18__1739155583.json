  "query": "Question: Where would a violinist stand on a platform?\n\nChoices:\nA: train\nB: museum\nC: concert hall\nD: arena\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what activities a violinist typically engages in. A violinist performs music, often as part of an orchestral or solo performance.",
    "Next, think about where performances usually take place. Common venues for musical performances include concert halls, theaters, and arenas.",
    "Evaluate each choice against the context of a violin performance. \nChoice A (train) is not a typical performance venue. \nChoice B (museum) could host events but is not primarily focused on music performances.\nChoice D (arena) is large and could host music events, but it is more associated with sports and large concerts than classical performances.\nChoice E (building) is very vague and could refer to any type of structure but does not specifically indicate a performance venue.",
    "Consider the most appropriate venue for a violinist. Concert halls are specifically designed for music performances, providing the necessary acoustics and atmosphere for such events.",
    "The only choice that strongly aligns with the context of a violinist standing on a platform while performing in a suitable venue is Choice C: concert hall."
