  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the context in the question: Sam expected his savings to grow, which indicates he anticipated an increase in his amount of money.",
    "Next, we analyze the phrase \"instead his savings only did what?\" This highlights that the outcome was contrary to his expectations.",
    "We explore the choices given: A (shrink), B (explode), C (diminish), D (get smaller), E (stagnant).",
    "Choice A (shrink) suggests a reduction in size, which aligns with the notion of growth not occurring.",
    "Choice B (explode) does not fit the context because it implies a dramatic increase, which is the opposite of what we want.",
    "Choice C (diminish) means to decrease gradually, again reflecting a negative change from the expected growth.",
    "Choice D (get smaller) indicates a similar reduction and also matches the original expectation of growth not materializing.",
    "Choice E (stagnant) suggests that the money did not grow nor decrease, implying no change at all.",
    "Among the choices, both A (shrink) and C (diminish) suggest a decrease in savings. However, C (diminish) captures the intended meaning of gradual reduction.",
    "We also note that choices A (shrink) and D (get smaller) are closely related to C (diminish) but do not capture the nuance of gradual reduction as well as C does."
