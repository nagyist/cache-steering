  "query": "Question: John runs a small corner shop.   If you were walking on a sidewalk near it, where would you look for it?\n\nChoices:\nA: england\nB: street corner\nC: minnesota\nD: arizona\nE: iowa",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the location of John's small corner shop and specifies a general area for potential observation.",
    "Since it is a \"corner shop,\" it is likely to be situated at a street corner. This supports option B, as street corners are typical locations for shops.",
    "Next, the other options (A, C, D, E) represent states or countries that do not specifically relate to the type of shop or its location. They do not directly answer where a sidewalk near a corner shop would be found.",
    "Option A (England) is a general geographical location, but it doesn't specify a street corner or indicate proximity to a corner shop specifically.",
    "Options C (Minnesota), D (Arizona), and E (Iowa) are also geographical locations that could house corner shops, but they still don't specify where a street corner related to a shop might be found.",
    "The most specific and relevant answer regarding where to look for John\u2019s small corner shop is on the street corner itself (option B)."
