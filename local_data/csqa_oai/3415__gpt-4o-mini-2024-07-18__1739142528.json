  "query": "Question: If you spend time doing what you will need a rest?\n\nChoices:\nA: pay debts\nB: wakefulness\nC: resthold\nD: active\nE: in motion",
  "steps": [
    "We need to analyze what activities typically require rest afterward. The question mentions \"spend time doing,\" which implies engaging in some sort of sustained activity.",
    "Option A, \"pay debts,\" does not involve physical or mental strain that would necessitate rest. It's more of a financial activity.",
    "Option B, \"wakefulness,\" suggests being awake and alert, but does not inherently imply an activity that would cause fatigue. It may require rest, but it doesn't directly correlate with an activity.",
    "Option C, \"resthold,\" is not a commonly recognized phrase in English and does not directly relate to any activity that would lead to a need for rest. It seems more conceptual or nonsensical in this context.",
    "Option D, \"active,\" implies being engaged in physical or mental activities. This often leads to a need for rest because sustaining an active state usually requires energy expenditure.",
    "Option E, \"in motion,\" suggests being engaged in an activity that involves movement, which also typically can lead to fatigue and a need for rest, similar to being active.",
    "Between options D and E, both suggest engaging in activities that could require rest, but \"active\" encompasses a broader range of activities, including both physical and possibly mental endeavors.",
    "Therefore, while both D and E are plausible, \"active\" is the more general and encompassing term for any sustained effort that would likely lead to fatigue."
