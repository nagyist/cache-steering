    "Democrats often emphasize the importance of accessibility to education, advocating for free or affordable education options.",
    "Next, we analyze the provided answer choices to see which one aligns most closely with the Democrats' focus on education.",
    "Choice A, \"fun,\" while potentially relevant in terms of educational engagement, does not capture a primary goal of the Democratic platform.",
