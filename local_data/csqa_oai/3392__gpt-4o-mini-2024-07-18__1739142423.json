    "Consider the context of the question, which specifies that the person is not a man. This may imply a preference that is stereotypically associated with women.",
    "The question asks where to put change if it is to be used soon. This suggests a location that is easily accessible.",
    "Evaluate each option based on accessibility and cultural norms regarding where individuals typically keep change.",
    "Option A: wardrobe is typically not a place for change; it is for clothing storage.",
    "Option B: jar is a common place for saving change, but it is not as accessible for immediate use.",
    "Option C: pocket provides quick access to change but might not be the safest or most practical for carrying larger amounts.",
    "Option D: purse is traditionally associated with women and is designed to carry money and small items, making it a convenient choice for carrying change.",
    "Option E: backseat of car is not a practical place for keeping change, particularly if you need it soon.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most suitable option that combines accessibility and consideration of gender norms is D (purse)."
