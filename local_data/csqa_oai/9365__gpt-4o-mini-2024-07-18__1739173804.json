  "query": "Question: She like her job at the reception desk, but didn't like her long commute, what did she likely live far away from?\n\nChoices:\nA: motel\nB: lunch restaurant\nC: office park\nD: lobby\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that she enjoys her job at the reception desk, which implies that the job is likely in a specific location, normally associated with a business environment.",
    "The fact that she doesn't like her long commute suggests that her residence is far from her place of employment. This indicates that the location of her job is a significant distance from where she lives.",
    "Looking at the options provided, we need to consider where a reception desk job would realistically take place. A reception desk is commonly found in business environments.",
    "The options include a motel, lunch restaurant, office park, lobby, and building. While all these locations might have a reception desk, some are more typical for offices.",
    "A motel would typically not have someone working at a reception desk in the same way an office would; moreover, people usually stay at motels rather than commute long distances to work from them.",
    "A lunch restaurant might have a reception desk, but it is less conventional for full-time roles compared to an office environment, especially for a job at a reception desk.",
    "A lobby, though it may have reception duties, is not a standalone location like an office where a job would be held long-term.",
    "A building is vague; many types of buildings exist and it does not specify a business environment.",
    "An office park, however, is specifically designed for businesses and would likely house several reception desk jobs within multiple office buildings.",
    "Given all of this reasoning, she likely lived far away from the office park where her job was located."
