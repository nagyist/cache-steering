    "Horses are large animals that require a lot of physical activity and exercise to stay healthy.",
    "As animals engage in exercise, they also have specific needs that must be met for their overall well-being.",
    "One of the critical needs for all animals, including horses, is hydration. They need to drink water regularly, especially after exertion.",
    "Additionally, horses have nutritional needs, including the need for food, which can incorporate items like carrots, but this is part of their overall diet.",
    "In financial terms, horses can be used for various work tasks, such as pulling wagons, but this is not directly related to their need for exercise.",
    "The option suggesting that horses \"go away\" does not relate to their needs as animals that exercise; it seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "Among the given options, drinking water is crucial for all animals after exercises, such as running or engaging in physical activity.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that the most immediate necessity for a horse after exercise is hydration."
