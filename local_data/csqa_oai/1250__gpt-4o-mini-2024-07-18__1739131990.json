  "query": "Question: What will happen after answering questions incorrectly?\n\nChoices:\nA: children will learn\nB: correct\nC: embarassment\nD: teaching\nE: better grade",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what typically happens when someone answers questions incorrectly.",
    "When a child answers questions incorrectly, it can lead to various outcomes depending on the context of the learning experience.",
    "One possible outcome is that children may feel embarrassed when they realize they have answered incorrectly in front of peers or authority figures.",
    "Another outcome could be that they learn from their mistakes, as incorrect answers can provide opportunities for correction and understanding.",
    "However, the question specifically asks what will happen after answering questions incorrectly, not the potential for learning.",
    "Since embarrassment is a common immediate emotional response to making mistakes, especially in a public setting, it seems plausible.",
    "On the other hand, I should analyze the remaining options to ensure they are less direct outcomes of answering questions incorrectly.",
    "While options like 'children will learn' and 'teaching' are positive and indicate growth, they do not directly happen following an incorrect answer without context of further feedback.",
    "Moreover, the options of 'correct' and 'better grade' are unlikely immediate responses to mistakes, as they imply a rectification process that occurs afterward.",
    "After considering all possible outcomes and their connections to answering questions incorrectly, I conclude that the most immediate response is embarrassment."
