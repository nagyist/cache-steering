  "steps": [
    "Identify the nature of the question, which asks about the location of all planets.",
    "Consider the various choices provided: universe, outer space, sky, milky way, orbit.",
    "Evaluate \"universe\": This is a broad term encompassing everything, including all planets, stars, galaxies, etc. However, it is very general.",
    "Evaluate \"outer space\": This describes the vast expanse beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where planets reside, but it is also quite broad.",
    "Evaluate \"sky\": This term generally refers to the atmosphere or the apparent dome above the Earth, which doesn\u2019t accurately represent the location of all planets.",
    "Evaluate \"milky way\": This refers specifically to our galaxy, which contains many stars and planets, including ours, but not all planets in the universe.",
    "Evaluate \"orbit\": This term describes the specific paths that planets take around a star (like our solar system\u2019s planets around the Sun), but it doesn\u2019t address the broader location of all planets.",
    "Looking at the choices, the most inclusive options are \"universe\" and \"outer space\", but \"universe\" is the most comprehensive.",
    "Since the question asks where all planets are located in the broadest sense, \"universe\" encompasses all other potential locations provided."
