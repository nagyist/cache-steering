  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one could put knives if planning to bring them outside.",
    "First, I need to consider if the item must be portable and suitable for outdoor use.",
    "A purse typically carries personal items, but it may not be the safest or most practical option for knives due to the risk of injury.",
    "A backpack is designed for transport and can securely hold items like knives, making it a likely option.",
    "A drawer is not practical as it is usually stationary and wouldn't help in bringing the knives outside.",
    "A sporting goods store is a place to buy knives but is not relevant for transporting them outside.",
    "The kitchen, while it holds knives, is not practical for bringing them outside either.",
    "Between the options of purse, backpack, drawer, sporting goods store, and kitchen, the backpack stands out as the best choice."
