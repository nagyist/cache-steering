  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the terrain on which a gazelle needs to run and jump.",
    "Gazelles are known for their agility and speed, typically inhabiting open and spacious areas.",
    "Wildlife refuges can be varied environments, not necessarily an open terrain.",
    "Open fields generally provide the kind of terrain suitable for running and jumping, as they are clear of obstacles.",
    "The term \"steppe\" refers to a large area of flat unforested grassland, which also allows for running and jumping.",
    "The option \"encyclopedia\" is irrelevant as it does not pertain to a physical terrain.",
    "\"Field\" can refer to similar terrain as \"open field\" but is more ambiguous without additional context.",
    "Considering the type of terrain where gazelles thrive, both \"open field\" and \"steppe\" are valid options.",
    "However, \"steppe\" is more specific and accurately describes a natural habitat often inhabited by gazelles.",
    "Since an open field can sometimes denote cultivated land and is less specific compared to \"steppe,\" I will select \"steppe.\""
