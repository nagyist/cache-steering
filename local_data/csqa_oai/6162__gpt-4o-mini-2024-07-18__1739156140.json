  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question: \"What do birds have that can fall off?\" This implies that the answer should be something that is not permanently attached to the bird and can detach under certain circumstances.",
    "Next, I'll consider the options provided and assess whether they can fall off.",
    "Option A suggests \"two wings.\" While wings are significant parts of a bird's anatomy, they do not typically fall off. Wings are integral to flying and are not meant to detach.",
    "Option B states \"feathers.\" Feathers are not permanent; they can molt and fall off as part of a bird's natural lifecycle. During molting, birds lose feathers, which matches the criteria of something that can fall off.",
    "Option C mentions \"beak.\" The beak is a hard structure composed of keratin and does not typically fall off unless there's an injury. It\u2019s less likely to be the answer since it is a permanent part of a bird.",
    "Option D offers \"two legs.\" Similar to wings, legs are crucial for a bird\u2019s mobility and don't detach; thus they do not fit the criteria of the question.",
    "Option E includes \"keeping in zoo.\" This choice refers to a condition or action about the bird rather than a physical part of the bird. As such, it does not fit the question.",
    "After reviewing all the options, it's evident that \"feathers\" (Option B) is the only anatomical feature of birds that can naturally fall off."
