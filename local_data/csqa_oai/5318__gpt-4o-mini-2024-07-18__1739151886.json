  "query": "Question: John didn't like committing perjury.  It made him feel what emotion?\n\nChoices:\nA: penalty\nB: arrest\nC: shame\nD: tension\nE: go to jail",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what perjury means. Perjury is the act of lying or making false statements under oath, which is a serious offense in legal contexts.",
    "Next, we should think about the emotional implications of committing perjury. Given that it involves dishonesty, one might expect that an individual would feel negative emotions about it.",
    "Now, let's analyze the answer choices. The first choice, A: penalty, refers to a consequence rather than an emotion. It cannot be correct.",
    "The second choice, B: arrest, also refers to a potential consequence of committing perjury but is not an emotion, so it is not correct either.",
    "Next, we look at choice C: shame. Shame is a powerful emotion related to guilt or feeling dishonored, which aligns with the context of committing perjury.",
    "Then, we evaluate choice D: tension. While tension may arise from the situation of committing perjury, it doesn\u2019t directly express an emotional state specific to the act itself, as much as shame does.",
    "Finally, the last option, E: go to jail, again references a consequence rather than an emotional state, so it is not suitable either.",
    "Based on this analysis, the emotion that John would likely feel for committing perjury, which is linked closely to feelings of guilt and dishonor, is best captured by choice C: shame."
