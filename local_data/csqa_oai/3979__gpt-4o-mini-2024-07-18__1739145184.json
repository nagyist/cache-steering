  "query": "Question: What is a large group of human beings?\n\nChoices:\nA: an infestation\nB: civilisation\nC: homes\nD: graveyard\nE: spacecraft",
  "steps": [
    "We need to define what constitutes a \"large group of human beings.\"",
    "An \"infestation\" typically refers to an unwanted or harmful presence of something, often insects or pests, and does not apply to humans.",
    "\"Civilisation\" refers to an advanced stage of human social development and organization, often with cultural and political structures, and it can encompass large groups of people.",
    "\"Homes\" refer to places where individuals or families live and do not represent a group of human beings as a whole.",
    "A \"graveyard\" is a place where the dead are buried and does not consist of living human beings.",
    "\"Spacecraft\" are vehicles designed for travel or operation in outer space and do not contain groups of human beings in the context of being a large group.",
    "Considering the definitions, the only option that accurately represents a large group of human beings is \"civilisation.\"",
    "Therefore, I will confirm that \"civilisation\" is the best fit based on our evaluation of the options."
