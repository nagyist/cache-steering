  "query": "Question: Where does a plane go when it has reached its destination?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: eat\nC: sky\nD: runway\nE: fall",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the location of a plane when it has completed its journey or reached its destination.",
    "Planes travel through the air, but this does not accurately represent where they go upon arrival.",
    "The option \"eat\" seems unrelated to the travel context of a plane and does not make sense as a destination.",
    "The term \"sky\" refers to the atmosphere above ground level but does not represent a physical destination for a plane.",
    "The \"runway\" is where planes land and take off, serving as a physical location related to their landing process.",
    "Considering the context of the question, \"runway\" is indeed the area a plane moves to when it reaches its destination on the ground.",
    "\"Fall\" implies a negative consequence of an inability to fly, rather than a destination for a plane.",
    "Therefore, among the choices given, \"runway\" best fits as the destination when the plane has landed."
