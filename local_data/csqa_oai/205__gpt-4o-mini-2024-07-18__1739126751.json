  "query": "Question: He was in a cabin in the woods, through the window he saw a fox where?\n\nChoices:\nA: indiana\nB: england\nC: outside\nD: on the wall\nE: picture",
  "steps": [
    "The person is in a cabin located in the woods, which implies a natural setting.",
    "Seeing a fox through the window means that the fox is present in the environment outside the cabin.",
    "The options provided include specific locations (Indiana, England) and objects or places (outside, on the wall, picture).",
    "Since the question focuses on the visibility of the fox through the window, the relevant aspect is its location relative to where the person is observing.",
    "The most logical inference is that the fox is outside the cabin as it can be seen through the window.",
    "The option \"outside\" directly correlates with the concept of seeing a fox through a window, reinforcing that the fox is indeed in the outdoor space.",
    "Options like \"on the wall\" and \"picture\" imply a stationary or depicted representation rather than an actual animal, which is less likely given the context of seeing a real fox.",
    "Given the fondness for natural wildlife like a fox being seen in the woods, attributing its location to \"outside\" is not only reasonable but also aligns with the situation described.",
    "The final answer should pinpoint the location of the fox as it relates to the observer's view through the window."
