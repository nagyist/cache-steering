  "steps": [
    "The question asks about something that has \"metal wings.\" This phrase suggests a literal or figurative reference to an object that can fly or is associated with flight and has wings made of metal.",
    "Looking at the choices, I can eliminate \"Detroit\" (A) and \"airport\" (B) because they are places and do not possess wings.",
    "Next, I analyze \"heaven\" (C). While the idea of heaven might be associated with fantastical imagery, it does not have wings, especially not metal wings.",
    "The choice \"birds\" (D) refers to living creatures that do have wings, but they are not made of metal. Therefore, this choice does not fit the criteria.",
    "The last choice is \"airplane\" (E). Airplanes are machines designed for flight and have wings, which are typically made of metal for structural strength and durability.",
    "I have determined that the only option that matches the description of having \"metal wings\" is the airplane."
