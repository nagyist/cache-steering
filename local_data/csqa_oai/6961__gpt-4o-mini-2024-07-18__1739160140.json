  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what types of places typically contain many maps.",
    "An amusement park may have maps to guide visitors, but it is unlikely to have a large number of maps.",
    "Drawing could involve creating maps, but it is not a place where maps are stored in abundance.",
    "An atlas is a collection of maps, so it is likely to contain a lot of maps in one book.",
    "A backpack might contain a map or two, but it is not a location where many maps are systematically organized or stored.",
    "A classroom may have maps for educational purposes, but typically those would not be as numerous as in an atlas.",
    "Comparing all options, an atlas clearly stands out as the place designed specifically to hold many maps.",
    "So, I conclude that an atlas is the most appropriate answer for a place where you are likely to find a lot of maps."
