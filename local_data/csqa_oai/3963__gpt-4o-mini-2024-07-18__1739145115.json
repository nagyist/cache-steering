  "query": "Question: Something that people do when they are sneezing a lot and have a runny nose?\n\nChoices:\nA: inhale\nB: blow nose\nC: close eyes\nD: cover face\nE: spray",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the symptoms mentioned: sneezing a lot and having a runny nose. These symptoms often indicate that a person is experiencing some form of nasal congestion or allergies.",
    "A common reaction to a runny nose is to remove the excess mucus, which aligns with blowing the nose.",
    "Inhaling (Choice A) doesn't directly address the sneezing or runny nose; it's more a passive action and doesn't alleviate the symptoms.",
    "Closing eyes (Choice C) might occur temporarily during sneezing, but it doesn't specifically respond to a runny nose.",
    "Covering the face (Choice D) could occur during sneezing, but it does not necessarily deal with the runny nose issue.",
    "Spraying (Choice E) could relate to nasal sprays, but it's not a common immediate action that people take when they are sneezing and have a runny nose.",
    "Given that blowing the nose actively removes mucus, it directly addresses the symptoms mentioned.",
    "Reviewing other choices, none of them effectively tackles both the sneezing and the runny nose as well as blowing the nose does.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate action in response to the symptoms is to blow the nose."
