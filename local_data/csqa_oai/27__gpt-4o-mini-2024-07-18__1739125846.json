  "query": "Question: Too many people want exotic snakes.  The demand is driving what to carry them?\n\nChoices:\nA: ditch\nB: shop\nC: north america\nD: pet shops\nE: outdoors",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the statement which mentions that \"too many people want exotic snakes\" indicating that there is high demand for them.",
    "Next, I recognize that high demand usually drives the market to cater to that demand by providing the relevant supply.",
    "I examine the choices given to identify which is the most likely outcome of increased demand.",
    "Choice A, \"ditch,\" does not seem applicable as it does not relate to the demand for exotic snakes.",
    "Choice B, \"shop,\" is vague and does not specifically address any particular type of shop relevant to exotic snakes.",
    "Choice C, \"north america,\" is a geographical location but does not directly relate to the supply requirement stemming from demand.",
    "Choice D, \"pet shops,\" stands out as a relevant option because pet shops are typically the places where exotic snakes would be sold to meet the demand.",
    "Choice E, \"outdoors,\" also does not seem to fit because it implies a location rather than addressing where these snakes would be available for purchase.",
    "Upon evaluating all the choices, it is clear that the demand for exotic snakes most directly drives the availability of such snakes in pet shops."
