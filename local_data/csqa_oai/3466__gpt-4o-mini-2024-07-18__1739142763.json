  "query": "Question: Where is plumbing likely to be clogged by food?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: wall\nC: kitchen\nD: oil refineries\nE: water park",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the locations listed in the choices and their typical functions. The bathroom is primarily for personal hygiene, the wall is not a location but a structural element, the kitchen is where food is prepared, oil refineries process oil, and water parks are recreational facilities.",
    "Consider where food is most likely to enter plumbing systems. In a residential setting, food waste typically goes down sinks, particularly in the kitchen, where dishwashing occurs.",
    "Eliminate options that are less likely to have food debris. The bathroom generally contains waste but not food; walls do not accommodate plumbing for food; oil refineries are industrial locations focused on oil processing, and water parks deal with water recreation, not food waste.",
    "The primary plumbing issue related to food would occur at the hard line of disposal, frequently encountered in the kitchen, where sink blockages due to food scraps are common.",
    "Review the connection of food and plumbing. The kitchen has garbage disposals and sinks where food scraps can easily clog the drainage.",
    "Assess each option again systematically: \n- Bathroom: not food-related.\n- Wall: irrelevant as it does not imply a functional plumbing area.\n- Kitchen: directly involved with food waste.\n- Oil refineries: not a residential plumbing scenario; irrelevant.\n- Water park: not commonly associated with food waste plumbing issues.",
    "Determine which location is most directly associated with food debris causing clogs. The kitchen is clearly the only choice where food scraps are likely to cause plumbing issues."
