  "query": "Question: John walked up to the reception desk and rang a bell.  He waited for five minutes and told the reception person that he had a reservation. Where might he be?\n\nChoices:\nA: lobby\nB: office park\nC: at hotel\nD: large office\nE: real estate office",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes John walking up to a reception desk, which is typically found in places that serve customers or guests.",
    "John rings a bell and waits for a response, suggesting that he is in a place where service personnel are expected to assist guests, which is characteristic of a hotel or similar establishment.",
    "He mentions having a reservation, which indicates that he is expecting to check into a place that offers overnight accommodation or a scheduled appointment.",
    "Considering the context, hotels are common locations where guests have reservations and interact with reception staff, as opposed to office settings.",
    "The other options\u2014such as office parks, large offices, or real estate offices\u2014do not typically involve the use of a reception desk in the same manner as hotels do, especially with regards to having a reservation.",
    "Additionally, a lobby more generally refers to the entrance area of various buildings, whereas the context suggests that John is specifically at a place where he has a prior booking.",
    "Therefore, while a lobby could be a part of various establishments, the key distinction lies in the nature of the reservation that John is mentioning.",
    "In conclusion, the most fitting answer based on his action of ringing a bell and indicating he has a reservation is that he is at a hotel."
