  "query": "Question: What is killing likely to lead to for legal purposes?\n\nChoices:\nA: guilty conscience\nB: criminal trial\nC: pleasure\nD: retribution\nE: a fun day out",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the legal implications of killing someone.",
    "In legal terms, committing an act of killing is often associated with serious offenses such as murder or manslaughter.",
    "When someone is charged with killing, it typically results in legal proceedings to determine their culpability.",
    "One of the possible legal outcomes of killing is that it can lead to a criminal trial where the accused has to defend themselves against the charges.",
    "While a guilty conscience (Option A) is a psychological response rather than a legal consequence, and pleasure (Option C) and a fun day out (Option E) do not relate at all to the legal context of killing, the concept of retribution (Option D) typically refers to a societal response rather than a direct legal process.",
    "Given the focus on legal consequences, Option B: criminal trial is the most fitting and direct answer to the question."
