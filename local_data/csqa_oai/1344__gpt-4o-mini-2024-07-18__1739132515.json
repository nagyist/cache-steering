  "query": "Question: What is a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine?\n\nChoices:\nA: mini mall\nB: shop\nC: grocery store\nD: pharmacy\nE: drugstore",
  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the options provided in the context of the question, which requires a place that sells suntan lotion but does not sell food or medicine.",
    "Starting with option A, a mini mall typically contains various types of shops, including food vendors and potentially pharmacies. Thus, a mini mall would not fit the requirement since it likely sells food.",
    "Option B, a shop, is too general and could include various types of merchandise, including food or medicine, hence does not specifically satisfy our criteria.",
    "For option C, a grocery store primarily sells food items and may occasionally carry suntan lotion, but it does not align with the restriction against selling food. This option is not suitable.",
    "Looking at option D, a pharmacy predominantly sells medicine and health-related products. While it might also sell suntan lotion, it definitely sells medicine, disqualifying it from our requirements.",
    "Now examining option E, a drugstore is similar to a pharmacy, offering medicine and health-related products. Like the pharmacy, it would not comply with the restriction against medicine.",
    "After analyzing all options, none fit the criteria of selling suntan lotion exclusively without also selling food or medicine. However, if we consider that some 'shops' may focus on non-food, non-medicine products like beauty supplies or sun care products, the term 'shop' could potentially fit.",
    "Therefore, since option B (a shop) can encompass a retailer that specializes solely in beauty products, including suntan lotion without food or medicine, this could be the best fit."
