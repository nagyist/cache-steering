    "Identify the key elements in the question. The song is famous, and it is specifically about a girl with notable eyes.",
    "Consider the common associations and themes in famous songs about girls, specifically regarding eye colors. Some songs focus on specific eye colors or emotional expressions.",
    "Recall popular songs that mention girls and their eyes. One notable song is \"Brown Eyed Girl\" by Van Morrison.",
    "Based on the song \u201cBrown Eyed Girl,\u201d the lyrics would indicate that the color of the girl\u2019s eyes is brown.",
    "Review the options provided: A: sad, B: green, C: tear up, D: brown, E: blue. Only \"brown\" corresponds with the known song.",
    "Consider other options. \"Blue\" might reference \"Brown Eyed Girl\" where the color is incorrect, and sad or tear up are feelings, not colors.",
    "Verify there are no songs that are predominantly about green or sad eyes that are as widely recognized as those that are blue or brown.",
    "Conclude that \"brown\" eyes are the most fitting answer, given the recognition of songs and their themes."
