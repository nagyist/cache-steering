  "query": "Question: When you spend time contemplating ideas what will you get?\n\nChoices:\nA: relaxation\nB: revelations\nC: action\nD: understanding\nE: broke",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the act of contemplating ideas, which often involves deep thought and reflection.",
    "Next, think about the potential outcomes of such contemplation. One might gain insights or clarity from this process.",
    "Evaluating option A, \"relaxation,\" while contemplation may lead to relaxation for some, it's not a guaranteed outcome for everyone engaged in deep thought.",
    "Looking at option B, \"revelations,\" this aligns closely with the benefits of contemplation \u2014 breakthroughs in understanding or new ideas are common.",
    "Considering option C, \"action,\" while contemplation can lead to decisions for action, the action itself isn't a direct product of contemplation, but rather a potential next step.",
    "Next is option D, \"understanding.\" This is a likely product of contemplation, as gaining a deeper comprehension of ideas typically results from reflective thought.",
    "Lastly, for option E, \"broke,\" this option seems unrelated to the act of contemplation in the context of ideas.",
    "Now, weigh the most relevant outcomes of contemplating ideas. Both \"revelations\" and \"understanding\" are strong contenders.",
    "However, the term \"revelations\" suggests a significant realization that can lead to understanding, which is a broader concept."
