  "steps": [
    "To determine where a bird is likely to feel free, we need to consider environments that allow for flight and natural behaviors.",
    "The forest (Choice A) may provide a habitat with trees for perching, but it is somewhat enclosed, which may not feel completely free for a bird.",
    "The ocean (Choice B) is primarily a water body, and while some birds do fly above it, it does not provide a space for birds to freely fly and perch.",
    "A roof (Choice C) could offer some elevation, but it is still a man-made structure that might restrict a bird's movements compared to natural environments.",
    "A nest (Choice D) is a confined space where birds raise their young; it is not a place where birds feel free since they are typically protective and limited in movement when in the nest.",
    "The sky (Choice E) represents open space with no physical boundaries, allowing birds to soar freely without obstacles.",
    "Comparing all the options, the sky is the most unrestricted environment and allows for maximal freedom of movement and flight for birds."
