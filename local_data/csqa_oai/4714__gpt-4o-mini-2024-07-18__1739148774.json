  "query": "Question: To learn something new, what is something an adult can take?\n\nChoices:\nA: college class\nB: library\nC: school\nD: classroom\nE: university",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what options are available to an adult who wants to learn something new.",
    "The choices given are: college class, library, school, classroom, and university.",
    "I will consider the purpose of each option for learning: \n- A \"college class\" is specifically designed for learning and appeals to adults.\n- A \"library\" is a resource for books and materials but is not a structured learning environment.\n- A \"school\" typically refers to institutions for children, so it may not be directly relevant for adults.\n- A \"classroom\" is a physical space for teaching but does not itself represent a learning program.\n- A \"university\" offers programs and courses aimed at adult learners but is often more general than a specific class.",
    "Since the question emphasizes something that can directly lead to learning, a \"college class\" stands out because it is specifically designed for adult education.",
    "While \"university\" is also an option and contains multiple classes, it does not directly answer the question of what an adult can take specifically to learn.",
    "Therefore, among the options, \"college class\" is the most direct and appropriate choice for what an adult can take to learn something new."
