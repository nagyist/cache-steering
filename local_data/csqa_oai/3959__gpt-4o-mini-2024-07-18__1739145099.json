  "steps": [
    "To determine how someone might get injured when driving a car, we should focus on actions and events that typically lead to injuries in driving scenarios.",
    "Choices A (\"getting somewhere\") and B (\"go somewhere\") are actions related to the purpose of driving, but they do not directly involve potential injuries.",
    "Choice C (\"stoplight\") refers to a traffic control device, which could contribute to an accident if not obeyed, but it is not a direct cause of injury.",
    "Choice D (\"car crash\") directly involves a scenario where injuries can occur. Car crashes are a well-known and common risk associated with driving.",
    "Choice E (\"pollution\") is a consequence of driving but does not directly result in injuries while driving.",
    "Thus, the most relevant choice regarding how someone might get injured when driving is the car crash scenario."
