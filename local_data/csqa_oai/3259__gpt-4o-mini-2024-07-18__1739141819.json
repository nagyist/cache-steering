  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to put a letter to pay a bill from home.",
    "To pay a bill, I would typically write a check or include cash in a letter.",
    "Once I have my letter ready, I need to send it out.",
    "I know that mail needs to be put in a designated place for pickup.",
    "A mailbox is specifically designed for outgoing mail and is commonly used for sending letters.",
    "An envelope is something used to contain the letter, but it is not a destination for sending it.",
    "A document folder is used for organizing paperwork and is not related to sending mail.",
    "The post office is a place where mail is processed, but it's not where I would put my letter directly\u2014it\u2019s the destination after it leaves my mailbox.",
    "A desk is also irrelevant to where I would send a letter. It\u2019s a place to work, not a method of mailing.",
    "Based on reasoning, the most appropriate answer is a mailbox where the letter can be deposited for sending."
