  "steps": [
    "I need to assess what type of celebrations typically require bar service.",
    "Weddings are known for having receptions where food and drink, including bars, are a central aspect of the celebration.",
    "Entertainment events such as concerts or theater performances might have bars, but they are not celebrations in the same way weddings are.",
    "Hotels provide services including bars, but they are not celebrations themselves.",
    "Trains do not typically include bar service as part of any celebration.",
    "Pool parties often have drinks, but they may not always include formal bar service.",
    "I can conclude that weddings, in particular, are a special type of celebration where bar service plays a significant role.",
    "Now I compare the remaining options for confirmation: entertainment might include drinks, but it isn\u2019t geared toward bar service like weddings.",
    "Thus, the strongest candidate for a celebration heavily involving bar service is indeed a wedding."
