  "query": "Question: What should a student do if they want to learn how to build a bridge?\n\nChoices:\nA: dance\nB: talk\nC: study engineering\nD: play piano\nE: answer question",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine what skills and knowledge are needed to build a bridge. This typically involves understanding structural design, materials, and engineering principles.",
    "Consider the options provided. 'Dance' does not relate to bridge building and would not provide relevant skills.",
    "'Talk' may involve communication skills but does not directly contribute to the practical knowledge needed for construction.",
    "'Play piano' is an artistic skill that is unrelated to the technical requirements of bridge construction.",
    "'Answer question' is a broad statement and does not represent a specific action or skill related to building a bridge.",
    "'Study engineering' specifically covers numerous essential skills and knowledge relevant to understanding how to design, analyze, and construct bridges.",
    "Evaluate if studying engineering would provide the foundations necessary to achieve the goal of building a bridge.",
    "Indeed, engineering encompasses various disciplines, including civil engineering, which is directly applicable to bridge construction.",
    "After reviewing all options, 'study engineering' is the most relevant choice for someone who wants to learn how to build a bridge."
