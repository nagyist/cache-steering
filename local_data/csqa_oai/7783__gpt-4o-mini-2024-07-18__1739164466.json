  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the question regarding where lawyers often lease spaces.",
    "Lawyers typically need physical spaces to conduct their business and represent their clients effectively.",
    "Option A, \"courtroom,\" is not applicable as courtrooms are public spaces where legal proceedings occur, not leased by lawyers.",
    "Option B, \"sign documents,\" refers to an action lawyers perform rather than a physical place they lease.",
    "Option C, \"apartments,\" does not pertain to the professional aspect of lawyers; they are not typically leased for work purposes.",
    "Option D, \"work,\" is vague and does not specify a physical location or type of space that lawyers lease.",
    "Option E, \"office building,\" is a common choice for lawyers as they generally lease office spaces within buildings to conduct their practice.",
    "Considering all these options, it is clear that the most logical place for lawyers to lease is an office building."
