  "steps": [
    "The question suggests that there is a specific preference that people have when it comes to pets.",
    "By analyzing the options, I can determine which one is most likely to relate to a personal preference for pets.",
    "Options A, B, C, and E do not relate to the idea of pets or animals but rather focus on general actions or subjects.",
    "Option D mentions \"own animal,\" which connects directly to pet ownership. People usually have a preference for the pets they own compared to other animals.",
    "I can also consider that while someone may like many types of pets, their own pet typically holds a special place in their heart.",
    "The phrase \"always prefer their own animal\" suggests a strong bond and preference for their personal pet, reinforcing the idea that ownership leads to a stronger affinity.",
    "Thus, among the options, \"own animal\" is the most fitting choice as it highlights a person's direct connection to their pets.",
    "This confirms that D is the answer that best completes the sentence provided in the question."
