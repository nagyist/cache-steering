  "query": "Question: A sailor has to do a lot of prep work before the ship can leave, but what is the first step he must take?\n\nChoices:\nA: leave dock\nB: coming home\nC: row boat\nD: sail boat\nE: board ship",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the first step a sailor must take before the ship can leave. We need to consider the logical sequence of actions that would be involved in preparing for the departure.",
    "Leaving the dock (Choice A) implies that the sailor has already completed all necessary preparations, so it cannot be the first step.",
    "Coming home (Choice B) doesn't pertain to preparations for a departure, so it is not relevant in this context.",
    "Rowing a boat (Choice C) may be necessary if the sailor is required to reach the ship that is at anchor or if they need to maneuver smaller boats, but it doesn\u2019t make sense as a first preparatory step for departing on the main ship.",
    "Sail boat (Choice D) does not indicate an action but rather refers to the type of boat, making it irrelevant as a preparatory step.",
    "Boarding the ship (Choice E) is typically the first action a sailor would take to prepare the ship for leaving. One must board before undertaking any necessary preparations or checks necessary to depart.",
    "Since boarding the ship is essential for the sailor to begin any preparations, and it logically comes before any other action, it is the most reasonable first step."
