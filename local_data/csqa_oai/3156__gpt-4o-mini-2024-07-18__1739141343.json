  "query": "Question: What would you experience if a friend robs you after cashing in chips at a casino?\n\nChoices:\nA: betrayal\nB: resentment\nC: depressed\nD: leave\nE: profit",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the action of a friend robbing you. This indicates a betrayal of trust, which is significant in any relationship.",
    "Next, think about the emotional impact of being robbed by a friend. Feelings of betrayal often lead to deep emotional distress.",
    "Now, analyze the choice of \"resentment.\" While resentment could occur, it generally follows betrayal, indicating longer-lasting feelings rather than immediate reactions.",
    "Consider the option \"depressed.\" Being robbed, especially by someone you trust, could lead to feelings of depression, but it's one of many possible emotional responses.",
    "The choice \"leave\" suggests a potential action taken in response to this scenario, but it does not encapsulate the immediate emotional response.",
    "The option \"profit\" is illogical in this context as being robbed means you would lose something rather than gain.",
    "Reviewing the strongest emotional response, the feelings of betrayal are often immediate and deeply felt when trust is broken.",
    "After weighing all options, \"betrayal\" seems to be the most direct and profound response to such an act."
