  "query": "Question: Where would works be on the wall?\n\nChoices:\nA: house or other building\nB: art show\nC: prison\nD: classroom\nE: labyrinth",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what type of works could be on a wall. Works can refer to artwork, posters, or educational materials.",
    "Next, evaluate choice A: a house or other building. While it's possible to have artworks or decor on walls, it\u2019s generally personal and varies by owner.",
    "Now consider choice B: an art show. Art shows are specifically designed to showcase artwork on walls, making this a strong candidate.",
    "Next, analyze choice C: prison. Prisons typically have few decorations or artwork on walls, which might not be a common feature.",
    "Now look at choice D: classroom. Classrooms often contain educational posters and materials on the walls, so this is a viable option.",
    "Lastly, evaluate choice E: labyrinth. A labyrinth is more of a structure than a space for displaying works, making it unlikely for works to be there.",
    "Comparing the strong candidates, both an art show (B) and a classroom (D) fit the idea of having works on walls. However, an art show focuses entirely on works displayed, enhancing its suitability.",
    "Consider the context of 'works' more broadly and assess if either setting (the classroom or art show) is more appropriate overall. An art show has a focus specifically on displaying works."
