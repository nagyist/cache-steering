    "The question asks where a drug dealer convicted of a felony is likely to go.",
    "A felony conviction usually entails a serious legal consequence, often resulting in incarceration.",
    "The options include prison, nightclub, jail, selling drugs, and street corner.",
    "Prison is a common outcome for felony convictions, especially for drug-related offenses.",
    "Jail could also be a possibility, but typically jail is for shorter terms and less severe offenses compared to prison.",
    "Nightclubs and selling drugs or being on the street corner do not fit with the consequences of being convicted of a felony.",
    "Since drug dealing is a felony, the more likely outcome would be serving time in prison.",
    "Therefore, from the choices available, the most appropriate answer would be A: prison."
