  "query": "Question: If you owned a single heifer, where might you keep her most of the time.\n\nChoices:\nA: dairy barn\nB: corral\nC: cattle show\nD: milk\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a heifer is. A heifer is a young female cattle that has not yet had a calf.",
    "Next, think about the most common environments for keeping a heifer. A dairy barn is specifically designed for the housing of dairy cattle.",
    "Evaluate the option of a corral. A corral is an enclosed area for livestock but may not provide shelter or facilities for long-term housing.",
    "Consider the cattle show option. A cattle show is a temporary event for showcasing animals, which is unlikely to be a daily or long-term living arrangement.",
    "Checking the option \"milk,\" it is an activity rather than a place and wouldn't apply as a location for keeping a heifer.",
    "Now examine \"countryside.\" While heifers may be found in open countryside, this is often not specifically a place of keeping, unlike a barn.",
    "Among the options, the most appropriate and practical place for keeping a heifer most of the time would be a dairy barn, as it provides shelter, feeding, and care appropriate for a dairy animal.",
    "Double-checking all responses against the criteria of an effective living environment for a heifer, it's clear that most farms with dairy production utilize barns for housing their livestock."
