  "query": "Question: Sarah drank from a water fountain, like many before her.  Where might she be?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: garden\nC: public place\nD: home\nE: rome",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes Sarah drinking from a water fountain, which is a common feature in various environments.",
    "I need to identify where water fountains are typically found. Common locations include parks, cities, and public spaces.",
    "Since \"home\" typically does not have a water fountain, we can rule out option D.",
    "Option E, \"rome,\" is too specific and does not generally apply as it might not be considered in all contexts of public fountains.",
    "Choices A (\"city\") and B (\"garden\") are possibilities, but they are more restrictive compared to \"public place.\"",
    "A public place encompasses a wide range of locations where many people gather, including cities, parks, and other community areas, all of which might have water fountains.",
    "Since the term \"public place\" is broader than the other options, it is the most fitting answer for the context of Sarah drinking from a water fountain."
