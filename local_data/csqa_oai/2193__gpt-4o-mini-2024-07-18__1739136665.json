  "query": "Question: Where does a potato become softer?\n\nChoices:\nA: optical device\nB: garden patch\nC: blender\nD: pantry\nE: vegetable stew",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider where a potato would undergo a process that softens it.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options provided one by one to see if they imply a softening process for a potato.",
    "Option A, optical device, is not relevant, as it doesn't involve food preparation or cooking.",
    "Option B, garden patch, implies growing potatoes, but it does not involve softening them.",
    "Option C, blender, could soften a potato if it is cooked first and then blended, but a raw potato would not soften in a blender without heat.",
    "Option D, pantry, is where potatoes are stored, but does not involve any cooking or preparation to soften them.",
    "Option E, vegetable stew, involves cooking potatoes with other ingredients, which would definitely soften the potatoes through the cooking process.",
    "Since option E is the only choice that directly involves a process (cooking in a stew) that will soften the potatoes, it is the most suitable answer."
