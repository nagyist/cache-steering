  "query": "Question: What is it called when horses move quickly in one direction?\n\nChoices:\nA: canter\nB: trot\nC: eat oats\nD: herd\nE: drink water",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the action that describes horses moving quickly in one direction.",
    "Next, we review the options provided: A (canter), B (trot), C (eat oats), D (herd), and E (drink water).",
    "Option C (eat oats) is not an action related to moving; it refers to feeding.",
    "Option E (drink water) also does not describe movement; it refers to hydration.",
    "Option D (herd) may refer to horses gathering together but does not specifically indicate quick movement in one direction.",
    "Now, we focus on the remaining options: A (canter) and B (trot).",
    "A canter is a controlled, faster pace but is generally considered quicker than a trot.",
    "A trot is a two-beat gait that is faster than walking but slower than a canter.",
    "Since the question specifically mentions moving quickly, the canter would fit this description best.",
    "Thus, based on the definitions and comparison of the terms, the most appropriate choice for horses moving quickly in one direction is A (canter)."
