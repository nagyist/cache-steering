  "query": "Question: How is someone who loves their TV likely to feel about their remote?\n\nChoices:\nA: attached\nB: nostalgic\nC: companionable\nD: likely\nE: close",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the relationship between a person who loves their TV and their remote. The remote is a tool used to operate the TV.",
    "Next, think about the emotional connection someone might feel toward something that enhances their enjoyment of a favorite activity, like watching television.",
    "It's likely that if someone spends a lot of time watching TV, they have developed a routine with their remote and it has become part of that experience.",
    "Consider the implications of the word \"attached.\u201d This suggests a strong emotional bond, which might apply pretty well, as the remote is necessary for interacting with the TV.",
    "Now, examine the other options: \n- \"nostalgic\" pertains to memories or longing for the past, which might not apply directly to the remote itself.\n- \"companionable\" implies friendship or companionship; however, a remote isn't typically viewed this way.\n- \"likely\" is a vague descriptor and doesn't convey any specific emotion.\n- \"close\" has similar implications as \"attached,\" suggesting familiarity, but it\u2019s not as strong in terms of emotional connection.",
    "Among the choices, \"attached\" stands out as the most fitting because it suggests a deep relationship with the remote due to its role in the viewing experience.",
    "Thus, the person who loves their TV is most likely to feel \"attached\" to their remote because it is essential to enjoying that love."
