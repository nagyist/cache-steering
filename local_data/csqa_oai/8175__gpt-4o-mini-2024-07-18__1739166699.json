  "query": "Question: Where would i likely find shirts with my favorite team's logo on it?\n\nChoices:\nA: worn by people\nB: sporting goods store\nC: in closet\nD: suitcase\nE: closet",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the options provided and the context of finding shirts with a team's logo.",
    "A shirt with a team's logo is typically a product that can be purchased, rather than something that is in a personal item like a suitcase or closet.",
    "Evaluate option A: \"worn by people\" - this does not indicate a specific location where such shirts can be found, but rather describes their use.",
    "Option C (\"in closet\") and E (\"closet\") suggests personal storage, which could contain shirts but are not definitive sources for finding them.",
    "Option D (\"suitcase\") suggests that you are storing a shirt, which does not directly lead to finding one.",
    "Option B (\"sporting goods store\") is a location specifically designed for selling sports-related equipment, including team merchandise.",
    "Since we are looking for a location where shirts with logos can be readily found, option B stands out as a direct source.",
    "Compare the likelihood of finding shirts directly available for purchase at the sporting goods store versus personal storage locations.",
    "The sporting goods store is not only dedicated to such merchandise but also has a higher turnover and stock than any individual's closet or suitcase.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer to where one would find shirts with their favorite team's logo is in a sporting goods store."
