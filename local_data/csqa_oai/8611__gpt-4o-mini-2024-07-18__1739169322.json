  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the context of traveling on a cruise. Cruises typically provide opportunities for social interactions due to the contained environment and shared activities among passengers.",
    "Next, consider what \"experience what more quickly\" might refer to. This suggests something positive gained from being in close proximity to others, likely social in nature.",
    "Review the choices provided. \"Getting somewhere\" (A) is a general statement about travel but does not connect well with social experiences. \"Motion sickness\" (B), \"disorientation\" (D), and \"bad food\" (E) are negative experiences and do not relate to social proximity or positive experiences.",
    "With elimination, focus on \"meeting new people\" (C). This choice aligns with the idea of being socially interactive and gaining enriching experiences through sharing moments with others on the cruise.",
    "Confirm that \"meeting new people\" is a direct benefit related to social proximity, enhancing the travel experience through new interactions."
