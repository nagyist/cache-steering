  "query": "Question: If you are starting a fire on purpose and are caught what will happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: death\nB: burns\nC: warmth\nD: go to jail\nE: get a reward",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the act of starting a fire on purpose, which can be interpreted as arson.",
    "Arson is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions, especially if it endangers lives or property.",
    "If a person is caught starting a fire intentionally, the legal consequences can vary depending on the severity of the situation and local laws.",
    "Potential legal consequences include being arrested and charged with a crime.",
    "In many cases, particularly if the fire causes damage or poses a risk to others, the offender is likely to face jail time.",
    "Options related to physical harm (like burns) or rewards do not correctly reflect the legal ramifications of the action.",
    "\"Death\" is an extreme consequence and not the immediate legal result of being caught starting a fire.",
    "Given these considerations, the most logical outcome listed among the choices is going to jail as a direct penalty for committing arson."
