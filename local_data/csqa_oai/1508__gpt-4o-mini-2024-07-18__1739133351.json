  "query": "Question: What can you do while driving to work that involves sound but does not require you to move your mouth?\n\nChoices:\nA: anger\nB: listen to radio\nC: speed\nD: sing\nE: statue",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the question, which is asking for an activity related to sound that does not require moving my mouth while driving to work.",
    "Next, I will consider each of the provided choices one by one.",
    "Choice A: \"anger\" does not relate to sound in a way that is an active engagement; instead, it describes an emotional state. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the question.",
    "Choice B: \"listen to radio\" is indeed an activity involving sound and does not require moving my mouth. This choice seems valid so far.",
    "Choice C: \"speed\" does not involve sound at all; it refers to the act of driving quickly and is unrelated to sound. This choice is eliminated.",
    "Choice D: \"sing\" involves making sound by using my voice and definitely requires moving my mouth. Hence, it does not fit the criteria.",
    "Choice E: \"statue\" refers to a physical object and does not involve sound, so it can be eliminated as well.",
    "At this point, I have narrowed down the choices. The only option involving sound without requiring mouth movement is \"listen to radio\".",
    "Now I will verify that \"listen to radio\" is indeed the only option that fits the criteria provided by the question.",
    "I can confidently conclude that out of all the choices, the only suitable option is \"listen to radio\"."
