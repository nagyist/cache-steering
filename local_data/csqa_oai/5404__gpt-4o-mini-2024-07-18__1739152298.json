  "query": "Question: Where would you be unable to read a newspaper?\n\nChoices:\nA: porch\nB: school\nC: jail\nD: rug\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the meaning of each option. The question is asking for a location where you would be unable to read a newspaper.",
    "Option A: porch - A porch is usually an outdoor area connected to a house where people can relax. It is likely that you could read a newspaper there.",
    "Option B: school - While you might have limited time and access, schools typically allow students to read newspapers, especially in designated areas or during breaks.",
    "Option C: jail - In a jail, access to newspapers is often restricted or controlled. Many prisons limit media exposure for various security reasons.",
    "Option D: rug - A rug is typically a piece of fabric on the floor and does not refer to a location where one would be or not be able to read. Thus, reading on a rug could still occur if one were situated there.",
    "Option E: library - Libraries are places designed for reading and studying, and you would certainly be able to read a newspaper there.",
    "Now, comparing the locations: the only place that clearly restricts access to newspapers in a significant way is jail.",
    "Since the question specifically asks for a location where one would be unable to read a newspaper, jail is the most fitting response."
