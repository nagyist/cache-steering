  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"He was contemplating a choice\" suggests that he is engaged in a decision-making process.",
    "The context of the question implies that the contemplation is about what he will do the following day.",
    "Among the choices provided, we need to identify which one relates most to the act of contemplation about future actions.",
    "Choices A (relaxing) and B (relaxation) imply a state of being rather than a decision.",
    "Choice C (headache) does not relate to the act of contemplating or making choices; it is a negative feeling.",
    "Choice E (action) suggests doing something, but it is not specific enough to represent a choice.",
    "Choice D (deciding) directly relates to the process of making choices or coming to a conclusion.",
    "Since he is contemplating his options, it indicates he has not yet made a decision but is actively engaging in the process of deciding.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer regarding what he was doing the following day is 'deciding.'"
