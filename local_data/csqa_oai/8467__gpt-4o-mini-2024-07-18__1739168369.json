  "query": "Question: If people are informed of an imminent war, what do they do next?\n\nChoices:\nA: believe in god\nB: worship idols\nC: hope for peace\nD: form opinions\nE: buy tanks",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the context of people being informed of an imminent war. Such news typically evokes a range of emotional and cognitive responses.",
    "People generally desire to avoid conflict and seek safety during times of potential war, which suggests they might hope for a resolution or peace.",
    "The response of hoping for peace is aligned with a natural human inclination to wish for the better outcome in a dire situation.",
    "Next, we evaluate the other options: \"believe in god\" and \"worship idols\" are more associated with spiritual or religious reactions and not direct responses to war news.",
    "\"Form opinions\" might happen, but it is more about discussion and contemplation than a direct action or emotion tied specifically to the imminent threat of war.",
    "\"Buy tanks,\" while extreme, is impractical for the average person, suggesting it would only be a response from a military or government perspective rather than civilians informed of the war.",
    "Given the emotional and social context of war, people\u2019s primary wish would likely focus on desiring peace amidst uncertainty.",
    "Looking at all the options critically, \u201chope for peace\u201d stands out as the most instinctive and human response when faced with the prospect of war."
