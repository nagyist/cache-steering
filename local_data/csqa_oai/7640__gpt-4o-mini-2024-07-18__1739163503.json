  "steps": [
    "To determine the least aggressive way to show anger, I need to analyze each option in terms of aggression and emotional expression.",
    "Option A, writing a letter, is often considered a method of expressing feelings without direct confrontation. It allows for reflection and can be a calm way to communicate anger.",
    "Option B, releasing energy, could involve physical activities like exercising, which can help to dissipate anger but might be perceived as aggressive if it involves intense actions.",
    "Option C, passing sentence, typically refers to a judicial context and does not directly relate to expressing personal anger in a non-aggressive manner.",
    "Option D, punching, is a clear expression of anger and is overtly aggressive, as it involves physical violence.",
    "Option E, breaking a leg, implies an act of self-harm or aggression toward oneself, which is not a constructive method to deal with anger and is greatly harmful.",
    "Comparing option A (write letter) with the others, writing a letter stands out as the least aggressive option, as it involves no physical confrontation and allows for thoughtful expression.",
    "Considering all options, I reaffirm that writing a letter is the least aggressive way to express anger because it channels emotions into a constructive format rather than a destructive or harmful one."
