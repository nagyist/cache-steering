  "query": "Question: Danny sealed the box and wrote the address on it. Then he took it where?\n\nChoices:\nA: warehouse\nB: closet\nC: post office\nD: street\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Danny sealed a box and wrote an address on it. This implies that the box is likely intended for sending or delivering something.",
    "To understand where he would take the box, we consider the significance of writing an address. An address is typically associated with a delivery location.",
    "Among the options provided, we need to think about places where a box with an address would typically be taken for delivery.",
    "A post office (option C) is the primary location for sending parcels and letters. This aligns with the action of sealing a box and addressing it.",
    "The other options do not fit as well as the post office:\n- A warehouse (A) is more of a storage facility and not a destination for sending mail.\n- A closet (B) is a storage area typically inside a home, which does not make sense for a sealed and addressed box.\n- A street (D) is more of a location rather than a destination for a box.\n- A garage (E) is also typically a storage area and not a place for sending items.",
    "Considering all these points, the most logical and fitting place for Danny to take the box after sealing it and writing the address is the post office."
