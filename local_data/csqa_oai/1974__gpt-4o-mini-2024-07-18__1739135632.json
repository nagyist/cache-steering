  "query": "Question: When you're getting drunk and stumbling what might you be feeling?\n\nChoices:\nA: stumbling\nB: nausea\nC: fights\nD: death\nE: your head hit the ground",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the effects of alcohol consumption on the body and mind. When someone is getting drunk, they often experience a loss of coordination, which can lead to stumbling.",
    "However, stumbling itself is a physical symptom rather than an emotional or mental feeling. So, I should look for feelings that occur with drunkenness.",
    "A common feeling associated with drunk states is nausea, especially if someone has overindulged. This is frequently reported as a feeling that accompanies intoxication.",
    "Next, I will examine the other options. \"Fights\" can indeed occur when people are drunk but is more of a behavioral outcome rather than a feeling.",
    "The option \"death\" sounds extreme and while it may be a concern, it's less about feeling in the moment and more about a dangerous consequence of excessive drinking.",
    "The phrase \"your head hit the ground\" refers to a physical event following stumbling, which doesn't correspond to a feeling per se.",
    "Now narrowing down the feelings, nausea stands out as a recognizable and common sensation when getting drunk.",
    "I will double-check if there are any strong arguments for any of the other choices being a feeling. \"Stumbling\" can be a physical action but is not a feeling; \"fights\" and \"death\" do not align with immediate feelings caused by intoxication, nor does \"your head hit the ground\".",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer that directly relates to what someone might feel while getting drunk and stumbling is nausea."
