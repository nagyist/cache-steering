  "steps": [
    "To determine the form of alcohol made from grapes, I will consider the typical alcoholic beverages derived from different fruits and ingredients.",
    "I know that wine is specifically made from fermented grapes. This is a well-established fact in the context of alcoholic beverages.",
    "Next, I will analyze the other options: \n- A distillery is a facility used to produce alcohol, but it does not refer to a specific type of alcoholic beverage.\n- Beer is made primarily from grains like barley, not grapes.\n- Cider is made from fermented apple juice, not grapes.\n- Plane does not refer to an alcoholic beverage at all.",
    "Since wine is the only beverage listed that is made specifically from grapes, I can confidently conclude that this is the correct answer."
