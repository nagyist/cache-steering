  "steps": [
    "Billy left due to a conflict situation, indicating he was likely uncomfortable with the environment he was in.",
    "The phrase \"because his parents were fighting\" implies that the fighting was occurring in a specific location.",
    "The most logical location for a child experiencing their parents' conflict would be their home, where such an argument is likely to take place.",
    "Now, I will review the answer choices to determine which one means \"where\" in this context.",
    "Choice A (\"home team\") does not apply as it refers to sports, not a location in relation to his parents.",
    "Choice B (\"present\") is unrelated to a physical location; it refers to time or an item.",
    "Choice C (\"at home\") directly identifies the location where Billy experienced the conflict, making it the most relevant choice.",
    "Choice D (\"come back\") implies an action and not a location, so it does not fit the context of where he didn't want to stay.",
    "Choice E (\"charming\") is an adjective and does not indicate any location, thus irrelevant to the question.",
    "Having analyzed all answer choices, it is clear that choice C (\"at home\") aligns perfectly with the context of the situation."
