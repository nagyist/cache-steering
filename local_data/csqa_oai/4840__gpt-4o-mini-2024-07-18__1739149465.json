  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that the person has seen a koala in a zoo, which is an artificial environment that allows people to view animals they might not see in the wild.",
    "The phrasing \"looking forward to finding one\" suggests the person is interested in seeing a koala in its natural habitat rather than in a controlled environment.",
    "Generally, koalas are native to Australia and are commonly found in the Australian bush or outback, where they live in eucalyptus trees.",
    "The option \"A: australian outback\" directly relates to the natural habitat of koalas, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Option \"B: bamboo grove\" is not suitable as koalas do not eat bamboo; they primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves.",
    "Option \"C: wilderness\" could also refer to a natural habitat, but it is less specific than \"australian outback.\"",
    "Option \"D: island\" does not align with the typical habitat of koalas, as they are not typically found on islands unless specifically introduced.",
    "Option \"E: child's book\" does not represent a physical place where one can find a koala; therefore, it is irrelevant.",
    "Comparing options A and C, \"A: australian outback\" is the most precise and relevant choice since it specifically indicates where koalas can be naturally found."
