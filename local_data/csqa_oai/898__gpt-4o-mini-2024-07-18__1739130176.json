  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"student\" who is sitting in front of a number of black and white keys. This suggests an activity associated with music or musical instruments, as black and white keys are commonly found on pianos and keyboards.",
    "Among the choices given, option C (\"play piano\") explicitly refers to an activity that directly involves the use of black and white keys. This aligns with the context of a piano.",
    "Option A (\"talk\"), option B (\"read book\"), option D (\"study book\"), and option E (\"study engineering\") do not relate to the scenario of being in front of musical keys. They pertain to different activities that do not involve the piano.",
    "Since the student's immediate environment suggests a focus on music, and the only relevant option that matches this cognitive and physical setup is option C, I will conclude that the student is about to engage in playing a piano."
