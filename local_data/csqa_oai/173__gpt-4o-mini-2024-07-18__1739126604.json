  "query": "Question: Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home?\n\nChoices:\nA: family room\nB: tropical forest\nC: flower garden\nD: movie theater\nE: hair salon",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the characteristics of a ficus plant, which generally prefers an indoor environment with indirect sunlight rather than being outside in a garden or a tropical forest.",
    "Evaluate the options given: a family room is a common place to have houseplants, implying a more homely and natural setting.",
    "Compare the other options: a tropical forest is not part of Joe\u2019s home; a flower garden is also outdoors; a movie theater typically does not have plants; and a hair salon usually doesn't feature plants prominently.",
    "Since the family room fits well as a place for indoor plants and aims to create a cozy atmosphere, it stands out among the options.",
    "Reconfirm that the family room is a standard choice for placing ornamental plants which enhance the home\u2019s decor.",
    "Eliminate the other options based on the fact that they do not align with a residential indoor setting suitable for a ficus.",
    "Consider the feelings or impressions one might want to evoke in a family room, such as warmth, nature, and tranquility.",
    "Decide that Joe would reasonably consider a family room as a suitable place for his ficus to thrive and contribute positively to his living space."
