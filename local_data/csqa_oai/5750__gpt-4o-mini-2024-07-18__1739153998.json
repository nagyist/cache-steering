  "query": "Question: James installed his new curtains to keep the light from shinning on his television.  Where is James probably hanging his curtains?\n\nChoices:\nA: show\nB: grocery store\nC: department store\nD: house\nE: theater",
  "steps": [
    "The context of the question mentions James installing curtains, which is typically an action done in a domestic or personal setting rather than a commercial one.",
    "The goal of the curtains is to block light from shining on his television, implying that the installation is in a location where a television is present, which is usually a living room or a bedroom.",
    "The options given include places that either do not relate to personal settings (like a grocery store and a theater) or do not typically involve hanging curtains (like a show or a department store).",
    "A grocery store is not relevant since it is a commercial space focused on selling food and household goods, and it wouldn't typically have a television that requires curtains.",
    "A department store primarily sells goods and may have displays but does not generally involve residential activities like installing curtains for personal use.",
    "The show option suggests an entertainment venue which again wouldn\u2019t involve a personal setting or specific curtain installation for private viewing.",
    "The theater option is about performances and isn't relevant because the curtains in question are for personal use, not part of a performance setup.",
    "Given that James is trying to block light while watching television, it indicates the installation is done in his own home, thus making \u201chouse\u201d the most logical setting.",
    "Therefore, from the provided choices, \u201chouse\u201d fits best with the installation of personal curtains for blocking light."
