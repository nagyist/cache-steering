  "steps": [
    "To determine a great place to display a flower on a table, we need to consider options that are intended for displaying flowers.",
    "A vase is specifically designed to hold flowers and would be the most appropriate option for displaying them on a table.",
    "A shelf is typically used for storing or displaying items but is not meant for displaying flowers specifically on a table.",
    "A park is an outdoor space and does not pertain to a table environment.",
    "A garden is also an outdoor space and not suitable for displaying a flower on a table.",
    "A windowsill can be a place for plants and flowers, but it is not specifically a table.",
    "Among all the options evaluated, only the vase serves the purpose of holding flowers on a table effectively.",
    "Therefore, the most suitable and appropriate choice is a vase for displaying a flower on a table."
