  "query": "Question: The government decided it was time to allow companies to do the practice they once what?\n\nChoices:\nA: deny\nB: permitted\nC: forbid\nD: reject\nE: prohibit",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the context of the question, which involves a government decision about what companies can or cannot do. The phrase \"allow companies to do the practice they once\" suggests that the government is reversing a previous stance.",
    "Next, we can analyze the choices given. The word \"deny\" (A) implies that the government will not allow something, which doesn't fit the context of allowing practices. \"Permitted\" (B) sounds positive but does not align precisely with the idea of reversing or allowing after a prohibition.",
    "Now, considering \"forbid\" (C), it directly implies that there was a prior restriction placed on companies. If the government is now allowing something they once forbade, this choice fits well with the context.",
    "Looking at \"reject\" (D), it implies negating or dismissing something, which is not what the question suggests since it mentions allowing as opposed to rejecting.",
    "Finally, \"prohibit\" (E) also indicates a previous restriction that is now being lifted. However, \"forbid\" is a stronger match and aligns more clearly with the phrase \"allow companies to do\" since it connotes an outright ban that is being revoked.",
    "From the above reasoning, we conclude that the previous practice in question was likely something the government \u201cforbade\u201d companies from doing, and now it has decided to allow it. Thus, the best match for what the government is allowing companies to do again is \"forbid.\""
