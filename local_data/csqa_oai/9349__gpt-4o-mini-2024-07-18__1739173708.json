  "query": "Question: There's an obvious prerequisite to being able to watch film, and that is to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: open eyes\nB: go to movies\nC: have eyes\nD: wear glasses\nE: have netflix",
  "steps": [
    "To watch a film, one must have the ability to see the visual content on the screen.",
    "Having eyes or a similar sensory mechanism is necessary for the act of seeing.",
    "The option \"have eyes\" directly addresses the requirement for vision.",
    "The option \"open eyes\" implies having eyes but suggests a different state (eyes being open) rather than the prerequisite itself.",
    "Going to movies (option B) or having Netflix (option E) are all scenarios where one can watch films, but they're not prerequisites.",
    "Wearing glasses (option D) may assist in seeing better but isn't necessary for the basic capability of watching a film.",
    "Given that having the physical organs necessary for sight (eyes) is the fundamental prerequisite, the most accurate answer focuses on the possession of the eyes themselves."
