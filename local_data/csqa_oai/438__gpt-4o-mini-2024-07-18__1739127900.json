  "query": "Question: The farmer chose plants he could make bird feed from and use of again the next year, he only planted what?\n\nChoices:\nA: raise corn\nB: seed plants\nC: grow plants\nD: seed crops\nE: farm land",
  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a farmer who is selective about the plants he chooses to grow, focusing on those that can be used for bird feed and can be replanted the following year.",
    "To understand the right choice, I need to consider what types of plants could both serve as bird feed and have the potential to be replanted or grown again in the next year.",
    "\"Raise corn\" implies that the farmer is planting corn, which is edible and serves as bird feed, but corn is typically an annual plant that does not grow back without replanting seeds.",
    "\"Seed plants\" is a vague option that doesn\u2019t specify the type of plants and does not directly imply bird feed.",
    "\"Grow plants\" is similarly vague; it indicates cultivating plants but doesn\u2019t give specific information regarding their usage or type.",
    "\"Seed crops\" suggests that the farmer is planting crops that can produce seed for future planting. This fits the farmer's intention of reusability and bird feed.",
    "\"Farm land\" does not make sense in the context of what the farmer is planting; it refers to land rather than a specific type of plant or crop.",
    "Comparing the options, \"seed crops\" stands out as it encapsulates both the idea of planting for future use and includes the concept of producing seeds that can serve as bird feed.",
    "After eliminating other choices that do not fulfill both criteria of usage as bird feed and replanting, \"seed crops\" is the best answer."
