  "query": "Question: If a soldier is directed by someone with a higher status what do they have to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: die in battle\nB: coming home\nC: shoot enemy\nD: storm buildings\nE: follow orders",
  "steps": [
    "First, it is important to understand that soldiers operate within a hierarchy, where orders come from superiors.",
    "Next, the term \"higher status\" refers to a ranking officer or someone in command, indicating authority over the soldier.",
    "The primary duty of a soldier is to obey lawful orders given by their superiors. This is a fundamental aspect of military discipline.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the options provided.",
    "Option A, \"die in battle,\" is not a requirement or directive that can be issued; it is a potential outcome of military service.",
    "Option B, \"coming home,\" is not something that would be directed by a superior but an eventual conclusion to service or deployment.",
    "Option C, \"shoot enemy,\" while it could be a specific order, does not universally apply to every situation a soldier might face.",
    "Option D, \"storm buildings,\" suggests a type of operation but is again not a general directive that applies to all soldiers at all times.",
    "Option E, \"follow orders,\" directly aligns with the military principle of hierarchical structure and the requirement for soldiers to act on commands from their superiors.",
    "Since \"follow orders\" encapsulates the primary responsibility of a soldier when directed by a superior, it stands out as the most accurate choice."
