  "query": "Question: Where were there recently a lot of closing sales?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery store\nB: furniture store\nC: department store\nD: k mart\nE: clothing store",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where there were recently a lot of closing sales, I need to consider which types of stores have been known to have closing sales frequently.",
    "Grocery stores typically do not have closing sales as they are essential businesses that tend to remain open.",
    "Furniture stores sometimes have closing sales, but their business model is usually stable, and they do not frequently close unless there are significant issues.",
    "Department stores have faced a lot of closures in recent years due to competition from online retailers and changes in consumer behavior, making them a strong candidate for having closing sales.",
    "K Mart is also well-known for having many closures and has had significant downtrends in the past, so it could also be a contender for recent closing sales.",
    "Clothing stores can sometimes have closing sales, especially if they are part of a larger chain that is downsizing or closing locations.",
    "However, K Mart specifically has had a lot of locations close, more so than typical clothing stores or furniture stores.",
    "I should compare specifically which has the most news about recent closing sales. Department stores, like J.C. Penney and Macy's, have had many closures, but K Mart has been a notable example in recent news.",
    "Given that both department stores and K Mart have faced closures, I need to weigh which one typically sees broader news coverage of their closing sales.",
    "In conclusion, both department stores and K Mart have included closing sales, but K Mart stands out in terms of the sheer number of closings that have been reported."
