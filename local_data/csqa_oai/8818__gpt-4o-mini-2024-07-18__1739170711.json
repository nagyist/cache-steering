  "query": "Question: What includes both a person and a jellyfish?\n\nChoices:\nA: humanity\nB: headache\nC: nature\nD: natural world\nE: society",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the common factor between a person and a jellyfish. Both exist in the biological realm.",
    "Next, consider how a person is categorized. A person is a member of the species Homo sapiens and is part of the animal kingdom.",
    "Evaluate what a jellyfish is. A jellyfish belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, and it is also an animal.",
    "Now, think about the broader categories that can contain both organisms. Both a person and a jellyfish can be classified under the concept of life forms in the biological sciences.",
    "Consider the options provided. \"Humanity\" pertains to the human species only, while \"headache\" relates to a symptom rather than a biological category.",
    "Look at the term \"nature.\" It refers to the natural world and encompasses all living organisms, including both jellyfish and humans.",
    "Evaluate \"natural world.\" This implies the physical world and all life within it, making it similarly inclusive of both persons and jellyfish.",
    "Examine the term \"society.\" This refers specifically to organized human groups and does not include jellyfish.",
    "Thus, both \"nature\" and \"natural world\" could theoretically apply, but \"natural world\" seems more comprehensive in its clarity about all biological entities it includes.",
    "Finally, confirm that both terms refer to a broader ecological/biological context, implying that the correct answer must encompass both humans and jellyfish in their entirety."
