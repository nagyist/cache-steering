  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where a cat is likely to be found while wandering outside.",
    "Cats are commonly found in residential areas, as these locations typically have sufficient food sources and shelter.",
    "Choices A (floor), C (bed), D (comfortable position), and E (family room) suggest indoor locations, which do not make sense given the context of the cat wandering outside.",
    "Among the options, B (residential area) is the only one that aligns with outdoor behavior.",
    "Cats are often attracted to areas where humans live, hence they are frequently found roaming around residential neighborhoods.",
    "Given that wandering indicates movement outside, it\u2019s more accurate to say a cat would be found in an area where it can explore, like a residential area.",
    "I will double-check the possible distractions of outdoor areas: parks, streets, backyards, etc., all of which are typically part of a residential area.",
    "The context of cats also implies they might venture onto private property but remain within the confines of a residential space.",
    "None of the other choices effectively capture the likely scenario of a cat wandering outside, reinforcing that B is correct."
