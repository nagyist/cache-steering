  "steps": [
    "I need to identify a phrase or term that implies someone isn't skilled or proficient in their work.",
    "I will evaluate each choice to see which one carries the connotation of inadequacy in a clever or subtle way.",
    "Choice A, \"clumsy,\" suggests awkwardness but may not directly relate to overall skill in a broad sense.",
    "Choice B, \"dull,\" implies a lack of sharpness, either mentally or in terms of talent, but is generally used more to describe ideas or personality rather than skill specifically.",
    "Choice C, \"stupid,\" is a harsh term that implies a lack of intelligence; it\u2019s not clever or subtle.",
    "Choice D, \"dummy,\" is derogatory and also lacks cleverness; it directly attacks intelligence rather than proficiency.",
    "Choice E, \"ineffectual,\" means not producing the desired effect or being inadequate to cope with a task, which cleverly implies a lack of ability without being overtly offensive.",
    "Among the choices, \"ineffectual\" stands out as the most clever way to describe someone who isn\u2019t good at what they do, as it is not directly insulting and conveys a sense of lack of effectiveness."
