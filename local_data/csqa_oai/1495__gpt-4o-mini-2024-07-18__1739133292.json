  "steps": [
    "To determine the key to happiness, we need to identify what an individual should do more than in order to achieve greater happiness in life.",
    "The term \"existing\" refers to merely living life without actively engaging in personal growth or fulfillment.",
    "Doing more than just \"existing\" implies taking active steps towards enriching one\u2019s life and finding deeper meaning and satisfaction.",
    "Looking at the other options like \"happiness,\" it seems counterintuitive to do more than happiness itself, as happiness is often the goal.",
    "\"Early death\" is also not a relevant comparison, as it doesn't correlate directly with an active pursuit of a fulfilling life.",
    "\"Acquiring knowledge\" could be seen as an aspect that contributes to happiness, but it is more about the journey and application of that knowledge rather than just the acquisition itself.",
    "\"Being idle\" suggests inaction, and doing more than being idle would imply engaging actively in productive or meaningful activities.",
    "Upon reviewing, the most fitting answer aligns with the idea that to achieve happiness, one needs to engage more than just simply existing in life.",
    "Therefore, the answer to the question is \"existing,\" as doing more than just existing suggests a proactive approach to living meaningfully."
