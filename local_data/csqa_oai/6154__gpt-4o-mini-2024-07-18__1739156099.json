  "steps": [
    "To determine what you hear when someone is talking, I need to identify the characteristic sound produced during speech.",
    "When a person talks, they produce sound waves that can primarily be categorized as their voice.",
    "While the tongue is involved in the articulation and formation of sounds, it is not the sound itself that you hear.",
    "The options being provided include some that are related (like voice and speech) and some that are not directly related (like being alive and brain).",
    "Voice typically refers to the sound produced by humans when they speak, which encompasses all the vocal qualities combined.",
    "Speech refers to the systematic way of conveying ideas using voice, but it can sometimes imply a more structured format rather than the immediate sound itself.",
    "Given that \"voice\" is a more direct answer to what you hear when someone talks, I can narrow my focus to the most fitting options.",
    "I will compare the two closely related choices: voice and speech.",
    "Since \"voice\" specifically refers to the sound, while \"speech\" might refer to the content or structure of what is being said, \"voice\" is the better choice here.",
    "Thus, the correct and most direct choice is \"voice.\""
