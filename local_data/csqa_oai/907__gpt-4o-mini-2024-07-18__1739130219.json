  "query": "Question: The man tried to run, but he could not. He could that he could only move by doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stand\nB: go quickly\nC: walking\nD: stand still\nE: walk slowly",
  "steps": [
    "The man attempted to run but found he could not. This implies there is a limitation preventing him from running.",
    "The options provided range from standing to different types of walking, suggesting he can move in some capacity despite his inability to run.",
    "\"Stand\" implies no movement at all, which contradicts the idea that he can move at all.",
    "\"Go quickly\" suggests another form of running, which is again something the man cannot do.",
    "\"Walking\" may be a feasible option, as it is a form of movement that is generally slower than running yet still allows mobility.",
    "\"Stand still\" similarly denotes no movement, ruling this option out as well.",
    "\"Walk slowly\" implies a form of movement that is not as fast as running, but perhaps still allows for some level of mobility.",
    "Comparing \"walking\" and \"walking slowly,\" the question asks how he can move if not running, suggesting a possibility of just walking instead of a slow variant.",
    "Therefore, since \"walking\" encapsulates a basic form of movement that he can achieve without the inability to run, it seems to be the most appropriate answer."
