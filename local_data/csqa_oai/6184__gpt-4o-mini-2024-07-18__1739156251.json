  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define the term \"east.\" In this context, \"east\" refers to a cardinal direction on a compass.",
    "Next, we consider what it means for a person to not be from the east. This means they must belong to another cardinal direction\u2014either north, south, or west.",
    "The choices given include various terms that can denote directions relative to east. We need to analyze each option in relation to \"not from the east.\"",
    "Choice A is \"north.\" A person from the north is certainly not from the east.",
    "Choice B is \"westerly.\" This suggests a direction toward the west, which is also not from the east.",
    "Choice C is \"eastside.\" This indicates a location that is on the eastern side, which means it is directly associated with the east, contradicting the requirement of not being from the east.",
    "Choice D is \"westward.\" This suggests a direction towards the west, which indicates that a person moving or located that way would not be from the east.",
    "Choice E is \"western.\" This is an adjective that refers to the west, implying a person from the western part of a region, thus indicating a direction away from east.",
    "Now, we compare our valid options. Choice A (north), Choice B (westerly), Choice D (westward), and Choice E (western) all indicate directions that are not east. However, we need a term that is distinctively associated with the opposite of east.",
    "The terms 'west', 'westerly', and 'western' all imply a connection to the west, which is the primary opposition to the east, while 'north' simply indicates another cardinal direction not directly opposite to east.",
    "Considering that \u2018westward\u2019 (D) and \u2018western\u2019 (E) both explicitly relate to the west, D (westward), particularly connotes movement toward the west, while E (western) refers to a characteristic associated with the west."
