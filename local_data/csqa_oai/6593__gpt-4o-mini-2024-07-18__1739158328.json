  "steps": [
    "The question states that John was an idealist, which implies he had high moral standards and wanted to make a positive impact.",
    "John gave away internet-ready computers, which indicates a desire to provide access to technology.",
    "The natural assumption is that by giving away computers, John's intention was to support others in gaining access to the internet and technology.",
    "From the choices provided, we need to identify which aligns best with the idea of helping others.",
    "Choice A states \"help people,\" which directly correlates with the act of giving away computers for a beneficial purpose.",
    "Choice B (working), Choice C (networked), Choice D (cost money), and Choice E (crash) do not seem to relate directly to the intention behind giving away computers.",
    "Since helping people is a common outcome associated with the distribution of resources such as computers, this reinforces that Choice A is the best answer.",
    "There are no other choices that provide a clearer motivation for John\u2019s actions than helping others in need."
