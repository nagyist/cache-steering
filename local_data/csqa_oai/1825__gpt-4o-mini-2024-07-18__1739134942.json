  "query": "Question: Attempting to light a wet match is likely to result in what?\n\nChoices:\nA: make fire\nB: rain\nC: combustion\nD: illumination\nE: frustration",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves a wet match, which is known to be less effective at igniting a fire due to moisture.",
    "Considering the properties of a match, if it is wet, the chemicals intended to produce combustion are not effectively activated.",
    "Typically, when a match is struck, the friction creates enough heat to ignite the chemicals on the match head.",
    "If the match is wet, this process is hindered, making it difficult to create the necessary heat for combustion.",
    "Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is unlikely to produce fire, which is the primary function of a match.",
    "Reflecting on the choices, \"make fire\" (A) is impossible with a wet match, and \"combustion\" (C) also assumes fire is produced, which it won't be in this case.",
    "Between the remaining options, \"illumination\" (D) generally relates to light produced either by flame or electrical sources, neither of which will successfully occur with a wet match.",
    "The realistic outcome of trying to light a wet match is that it leads to a situation of frustration due to the failure of lighting it.",
    "Consequently, out of all the options, \"frustration\" (E) is the most fitting result when one cannot achieve something expected, such as lighting a match."
