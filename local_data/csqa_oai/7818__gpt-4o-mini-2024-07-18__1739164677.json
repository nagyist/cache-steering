  "query": "Question: Where can humans have a cup of coffee or a sandwich?\n\nChoices:\nA: movies\nB: idaho\nC: university\nD: cafe\nE: universe",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of each choice and its relation to having coffee or a sandwich.",
    "The term \"movies\" (A) does not typically imply a place where one would eat, though some theaters may serve snacks. However, it's not a standard location for such items.",
    "Idaho (B) is a state, and while you can find cafes or restaurants there, it's too broad and not a specific location for coffee or sandwiches.",
    "University (C) can refer to a location where students may have access to cafes or dining facilities where they can enjoy coffee or sandwiches. It is a possible answer, but more specific than a general term.",
    "Cafe (D) directly refers to a type of establishment known specifically for serving coffee and light meals such as sandwiches. This is a very precise match for the question.",
    "Universe (E) is an expansive concept and does not relate to a specific place where one might enjoy coffee or sandwiches.",
    "While both \"university\" and \"cafe\" involve places where coffee and sandwiches could be found, \"cafe\" is the most focused and relevant answer.",
    "Now, determine which option is the best fit among the choices based on how directly they relate to the question of having coffee or a sandwich."
