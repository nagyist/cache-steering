  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the question: \"The toothbrush was given to the man for free.\" This implies that the toothbrush is a promotional item or a gift, not something that he purchased.",
    "Next, let\u2019s evaluate each option. A dentist office typically gives toothbrushes as part of oral care initiatives, and they often provide them for free to patients after an appointment.",
    "The bedroom does not seem logical for receiving a free toothbrush, as it is a personal space rather than a place where such an item is usually given.",
    "A supermarket might have promotional items, but getting a toothbrush for free is less common in this setting compared to a dentist office.",
    "A drug store is also a possibility since they sometimes offer free samples or promotions, but the focus here is often on products available for purchase.",
    "Grocery stores might have similar promotions, but like supermarkets, it\u2019s less common for them to give away a toothbrush for free without a specific promotion.",
    "Given that we are looking for the most likely context in which a toothbrush would be given for free, the dentist office stands out due to their direct relation to dental hygiene.",
    "Considering all the options, the most reasonable answer, which fits the context of receiving a toothbrush for free, is the dentist office."
