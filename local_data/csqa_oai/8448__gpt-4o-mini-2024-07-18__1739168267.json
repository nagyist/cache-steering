    "The question indicates that the robbers have a specific target beyond what the tellers directly possess, hinting at a larger cache of money.",
    "Among the choices provided, I need to identify where one would typically find a significant amount of cash within a bank.",
    "Options A (art show), C (pocket), D (water fountain) do not seem like plausible locations for a large sum of cash in a banking context.",
    "Option B (manager's desk) may contain money, but it is likely not the main target in a robbery scenario.",
    "Option E (bank vault) is a critical area of protection within a bank and would logically contain the largest amount of money the robbers would want.",
    "The bank vault is designed to store substantial amounts of money securely, making it the prime objective for robbers.",
    "Considering all reasoning, the \"big load of money\" sought after by the robbers would most definitely be in the bank vault."
