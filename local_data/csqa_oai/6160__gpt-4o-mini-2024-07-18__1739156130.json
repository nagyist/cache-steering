    "The question specifies that an action is moving someone toward a predetermined goal. This indicates a positive progression or advancement in a particular direction.",
    "We can analyze the choices to see which one aligns with the idea of advancing toward a goal.",
    "Choice A (make trouble) does not fit because making trouble usually indicates a negative action that does not advance toward a goal.",
    "Choice B (take time) could be related, but it does not inherently imply movement toward a goal.",
    "Choice C (make progress) clearly aligns with the idea of moving toward a goal, as making progress means to advance or improve toward a specific aim.",
    "Choice D (make haste) suggests acting quickly, which could be relevant, but does not explicitly imply movement toward a predetermined goal.",
    "Choice E (gone to sleep) indicates inactivity, which contradicts the idea of advancing toward any goal.",
    "After evaluating all the options, choice C (make progress) best encapsulates the description of moving toward a predetermined goal."
