  "query": "Question: what is another word for getting drunk?\n\nChoices:\nA: intoxication\nB: blazed\nC: vomiting\nD: hangover\nE: being sick",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the meaning of \"getting drunk.\" It refers to the state of having consumed alcohol to the point of impaired judgment or physical coordination.",
    "Examine each option to determine if it relates directly to the state of being drunk.",
    "Evaluate option A, \"intoxication.\" This is a term commonly used to describe the state of being affected by alcohol or drugs, which aligns closely with getting drunk.",
    "Next, assess option B, \"blazed.\" This term is mainly associated with being under the influence of marijuana, not alcohol, and thus does not match the required meaning.",
    "Consider option C, \"vomiting.\" This is a consequence that can occur after excessive drinking, but does not directly mean getting drunk.",
    "Look at option D, \"hangover.\" A hangover is a condition that often follows getting drunk, but it is not synonymous with being drunk itself.",
    "Finally, review option E, \"being sick.\" Like vomiting, this can be a result of excessive drinking but does not mean getting drunk.",
    "Since only option A directly relates to the concept of getting drunk, it must be the correct answer."
