    "The question discusses what happens when procreation does not go as expected.",
    "In cases where procreation goes awry, it could refer to multiple births or unexpected outcomes.",
    "The available choices include possibilities associated with various outcomes of procreation.",
    "Option A (population increase) is a general statement and does not specifically address an issue arising from procreation going awry.",
    "Option B (added responsibilities) is a consequence of having children, but it doesn't directly relate to the idea of an unexpected event in procreation.",
    "Option C (quintuplets) specifies a situation where five babies are born at once, which would certainly fit the description of procreation going awry.",
    "Option D (multiples) also describes a situation of having more than one baby, which aligns well with the misfortune implied by \"procreating goes awry\".",
    "Option E (large family) indicates a general size of family, and does not pinpoint the unexpected nature of the situation.",
    "Both \"quintuplets\" and \"multiples\" fit well, but \"quintuplets\" is a more specific instance of multiple births.",
    "In terms of the phrasing \"goes awry,\" \"quintuplets\" seems to identify a more extreme outcome while \"multiples\" could apply to a broader range of situations."
