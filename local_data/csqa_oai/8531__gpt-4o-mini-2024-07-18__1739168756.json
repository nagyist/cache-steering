  "query": "Question: What do people with a lot of money do?\n\nChoices:\nA: shake hands\nB: pay bills\nC: work hard\nD: talk to each other\nE: own property",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what individuals with significant financial resources typically engage in regarding their wealth.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: A (shake hands) and D (talk to each other) suggest social interactions that are not directly related to money management.",
    "Consider B (pay bills) - while it's true rich people pay bills, this is a basic necessity and not a distinctive action they perform with a lot of money.",
    "Next, assess C (work hard). Many wealthy individuals do put in considerable effort to maintain and grow their wealth, but not all work hard in the traditional sense.",
    "Now, analyze E (own property). Wealthy individuals often invest in property as a way to grow their assets and secure investments.",
    "Determine which option captures a common behavior specifically associated with wealth. Owning property (E) is a significant and common action among wealthy people.",
    "Compare the remaining options: while working hard (C) is valid, it isn't universally true for all wealthy individuals, as some inherit wealth.",
    "Conclude that owning property not only represents financial capability but also identifies a strategic way to manage wealth."
