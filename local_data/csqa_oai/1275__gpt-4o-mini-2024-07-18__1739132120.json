  "query": "Question: James used an axe and a saw to chop wood, shape it, and make a shelter.  He kept adding wood to it, building it bigger and bigger, until it became a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shelterbelt\nB: tree\nC: house\nD: home\nE: bus stop",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James is using tools to chop and shape wood as part of building a structure.",
    "The phrase \"make a shelter\" indicates he is creating a space for protection or living.",
    "He continues to add wood, suggesting that the structure is being expanded or developed.",
    "The term \"bigger and bigger\" implies that the structure is growing, and since he started with a shelter, it is likely to be something more substantial.",
    "We need to consider what kind of outcome is possible from the context of building with wood and expanding a shelter.",
    "Evaluating the options, a \"shelterbelt\" (A) refers to a row of trees or shrubs and does not fit the context.",
    "A \"tree\" (B) is not a structure that can be built and also doesn't fit with the context.",
    "A \"house\" (C) is a building for human habitation, which aligns with the idea of expanding a shelter for living purposes.",
    "A \"home\" (D) is a place of residence as well, but it is more abstract than a physical structure.",
    "The option \"bus stop\" (E) is unrelated to the activity of building shelter from wood.",
    "Given the description of what James has been doing, the most logical conclusion is that he has built a house, a synonym for a larger permanent shelter."
