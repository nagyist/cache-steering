  "query": "Question: The showroom had  variety of automobiles, where was this showroom located?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: car dealership\nC: bathroom\nD: appliance store\nE: vegas",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a showroom that had a variety of automobiles.",
    "The term \"showroom\" typically refers to a space where products, particularly vehicles, are displayed for customers to view and potentially purchase.",
    "Given that the products in this showroom are automobiles, it is likely that this space is specifically intended for displaying cars.",
    "Now, looking at the options: \n- A city could have a showroom, but it is a general term.\n- B car dealership aligns well since it is a type of showroom specifically for vehicles.\n- C bathroom does not logically relate to automobiles.\n- D appliance store also does not fit as it deals with household appliances rather than automobiles.\n- E Vegas is a location, but it is not specific enough to directly relate to the showroom in question.",
    "Since a car dealership is explicitly designed to showcase automobiles, it fits perfectly as the location of the showroom mentioned in the question.",
    "Thus, the best answer out of the provided choices, which directly relates to the concept of a showroom for automobiles, is B: car dealership."
