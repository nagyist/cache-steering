  "query": "Question: If a person loses their balance while on roller skating and can't recover what happened to them?\n\nChoices:\nA: injury\nB: falling down\nC: injuries\nD: hit people\nE: move fast",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a person losing their balance while roller skating, which suggests that they are at risk of falling.",
    "When someone loses balance while roller skating and cannot recover, it is highly likely that they will fall down.",
    "Falling down can indeed lead to injuries, but the immediate action described is the act of falling itself.",
    "The other choices involve outcomes or actions that may or may not occur as a result of falling. For instance, \"injury\" refers to the consequences, and \"hit people\" refers to the impact on others, which isn't guaranteed.",
    "\"Move fast\" does not logically connect to the scenario of losing balance while skating; if anything, losing balance typically means slowing down or coming to a stop.",
    "Therefore, focusing on the immediate result of losing balance, the most straightforward answer to what happened is that the person fell down."
