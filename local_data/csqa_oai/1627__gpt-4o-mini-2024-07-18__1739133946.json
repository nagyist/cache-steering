  "query": "Question: People often describe what as a giant wall of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: backpack\nB: allen key\nC: snowball\nD: ocean\nE: tsunami",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the phrase \"giant wall of water\" and think about what natural phenomena might match this description.",
    "The ocean is large and contains vast amounts of water, but it is not typically referred to specifically as a \"giant wall of water.\"",
    "A tsunami is often described as a giant wall of water because it is a large and powerful wave that can surge inland, resembling a towering wall.",
    "Backpacks and allen keys are both small objects and do not fit the description of water at all.",
    "A snowball is made of snow, which is a form of water, but it is not large enough to be considered a giant wall.",
    "Given that \"tsunami\" is the best fit for the description of a giant wall of water due to its size and nature, I can eliminate the other options.",
    "Now I check if there are any other candidates: ocean could lean towards the right answer, but it doesn\u2019t fit the \"giant wall\" part of the description as clearly as tsunami does.",
    "The term \u201cwave\u201d is synonymous with \u201ctsunami,\u201d which aligns perfectly with the description provided in the question.",
    "I conclude that the clear answer fitting the description of \"giant wall of water\" is indeed a tsunami."
