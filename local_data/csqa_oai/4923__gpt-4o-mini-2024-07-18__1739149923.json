  "query": "Question: What common area do most people keep a sofabed in?\n\nChoices:\nA: one room apartment\nB: livingroom\nC: spare room\nD: sitting room\nE: in a bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a sofabed is typically used for. A sofabed is a piece of furniture that can serve as both a sofa and a bed, providing versatility for various living situations.",
    "Next, think about where people most commonly host guests or have activities that involve sitting and sleeping. This will help narrow down the possible locations for a sofabed.",
    "Evaluate each option:\n- A one room apartment often has multifunctional furniture, including sofabeds, but that is a more specific scenario and less common overall.\n- A living room is typically a social hub where people spend time with guests, making it a likely area for a sofabed.\n- A spare room could also include a sofabed for accommodating guests but is less likely to be a common area of the house.\n- A sitting room is similar to the living room but might be less used in modern homes, so it seems less likely.\n- A bathroom is impractical and not a common area for a sofabed.",
    "Considering the social aspect, a living room serves as the main area where general gatherings and hospitality take place, and having a sofabed there would allow people to comfortably accommodate overnight guests.",
    "Next, assess the likelihood of each room being used in typical homes. The living room is more frequently used than spare rooms, especially since not all homes have spare rooms.",
    "The purpose of having a sofabed aligns closely with the usage of a living room\u2014offering a space for day-to-day activity that can convert to sleeping space when necessary.",
    "Conclude that the living room stands out as the most common area for people to keep a sofabed due to its multifunctional nature and its role in hosting."
