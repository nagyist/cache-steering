  "query": "Question: If friends comment on the condition of your living space what should you do?\n\nChoices:\nA: socialize\nB: go somewhere\nC: go to the store\nD: clean room\nE: going out at night",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to identify the underlying reason why friends are commenting on the condition of my living space. They might be expressing concern or perhaps they are simply making an observation about it.",
    "Next, I should consider how I feel about their comments. If I feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, it may indicate that there is a need for me to address the situation.",
    "I need to determine what actions I can take in response to these comments. Socializing or going out may provide a temporary distraction, but it wouldn't solve the underlying issue.",
    "Going somewhere might be a way to avoid the issue entirely, but I should focus on a more constructive response instead.",
    "Going to the store could imply purchasing items to improve the living space, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily address cleaning or organizing the space itself.",
    "Cleaning the room (option D) directly addresses the concern and shows that I am taking action based on the feedback from my friends.",
    "Going out at night is also a distraction and doesn't resolve the comments about the condition of my living space.",
    "Therefore, after weighing the options, I see that the most appropriate response to friends commenting on my living space is to clean my room."
