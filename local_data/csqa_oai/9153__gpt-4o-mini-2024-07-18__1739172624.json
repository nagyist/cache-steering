  "query": "Question: When you clean clothes what do you need to put in the washer?\n\nChoices:\nA: soap\nB: take off\nC: sort\nD: read labels\nE: use water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what is necessary for cleaning clothes in a washing machine.",
    "Typically, when washing clothes, soap is a crucial ingredient that helps to remove dirt and stains from the fabric.",
    "Sorting clothes primarily refers to organizing them by color or fabric type, which is important but not a required item to put in the washer.",
    "Taking off clothes is a preparatory step before washing, but it doesn't directly relate to what goes into the washer.",
    "Reading labels is important for care instructions but does not involve adding something to the washer itself.",
    "Water is essential for the washing process, but it is usually already present in the washer from a hose connection, so it is not something you manually put in.",
    "Given this reasoning, soap is indeed the primary item that must be added when putting clothes into the washer for cleaning.",
    "So far, the only option that directly fits the criteria of what needs to be put in the washer is soap, which aligns with option A."
