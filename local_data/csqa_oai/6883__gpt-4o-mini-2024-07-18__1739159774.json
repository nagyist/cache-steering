  "steps": [
    "To determine which store is likely to have a non-functioning train due to electricity loss, we should consider what kind of \"trains\" would be present in each of the options.",
    "A train station would typically have trains that are quite large and operate on tracks. It seems unlikely that electricity loss would make them non-functioning because they are not dependent on local electricity supply, but rather on their own power systems.",
    "A church generally would not have any trains, so we can eliminate this option since it does not meet the criteria at all.",
    "A basement may have various things, but usually, it is not associated with trains. It could theoretically have toys or models related to trains, but not typically a functioning or non-functioning train in the sense we're considering.",
    "A rest area is also not likely to have a train installation at all. It is more commonly associated with providing a place for people to take a break while traveling, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "A toy store, however, is likely to have toy trains, possibly electric ones that could become non-functional if the electricity is lost. This fits perfectly with the criteria of having a train that could stop functioning due to a loss of electricity.",
    "Comparing all of the options, the toy store stands out as the most plausible choice for having a non-functioning train due to electricity loss."
