  "query": "Question: Why would someone be likely to avoid kissing?\n\nChoices:\nA: arousal\nB: shortness of breath\nC: herpes\nD: strong feelings\nE: confusion",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the question, which asks why someone might avoid kissing. We need to identify factors that could lead to this avoidance.",
    "Look at option A: arousal. While arousal can be a reason someone might be hesitant to kiss due to personal feelings, it does not directly explain avoidance.",
    "Now consider option B: shortness of breath. This condition might occur during kissing, but it's not a common reason for someone to avoid kissing.",
    "Evaluate option C: herpes. Herpes is a viral infection that can be transmitted through kissing. A person aware of having herpes would likely avoid kissing to prevent transmission.",
    "Next, consider option D: strong feelings. While strong feelings may cause hesitation or reluctance to kiss, they do not inherently lead to avoidance.",
    "Now look at option E: confusion. While confusion about feelings might make someone hesitant about a kiss, it doesn\u2019t directly correlate with actively avoiding it.",
    "Among the options, herpes stands out as a concrete health reason to avoid kissing, compared to the other options that are more emotional or situational.",
    "Conclude by confirming that avoiding kissing due to a health concern like herpes is a strong and logical reason."
