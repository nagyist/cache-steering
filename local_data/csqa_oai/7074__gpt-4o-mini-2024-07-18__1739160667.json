  "query": "Question: If a person exercised heavily yesterday, what are the likely to do first when they awake?\n\nChoices:\nA: sleep more\nB: stretch\nC: put on eyeglasses\nD: yawn\nE: sneezing",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the likely first action of a person who exercised heavily the previous day when they wake up.",
    "After exercising heavily, a person may feel tired due to physical exertion and recovery needs.",
    "When waking up tired, the body's immediate instinct might be to rest more or stay in a low-energy state for a moment.",
    "Sleep is not a possible action once they are awake, but the act of wanting to sleep more suggests a need for additional rest.",
    "Stretching tends to be a common morning routine, especially after exercising, to relieve stiffness and promote circulation.",
    "Putting on eyeglasses may be a normal routine for some, but it is not directly linked to the aftermath of exercising heavily.",
    "Yawning is a common response when waking up as it can occur due to tiredness or the body's need for more oxygen.",
    "Sneezing is typically an involuntary reflex not directly connected to the fatigue from exercise or morning awakening.",
    "Considering all of these factors, stretching or yawning are likely actions upon waking after heavy exercise, but stretching is more specifically linked to physical recovery and routine following exercise.",
    "However, given the context of needing to wake the body up after a heavy workout, yawning could also be very likely, as it signifies waking up and rejuvenating the body.",
    "Between stretching and yawning, stretching is generally more intentional and common after exercise, while yawning can happen before anyone gets out of bed."
