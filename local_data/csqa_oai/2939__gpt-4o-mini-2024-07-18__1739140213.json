  "query": "Question: A continent is a large area of land, but the globe is mostly covered by an what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: australia\nC: asia\nD: continent\nE: island",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to what primarily covers the globe, implying a broader geographical feature rather than a specific landmass.",
    "The term \"ocean\" is typically associated with large bodies of water, which are prevalent on Earth.",
    "Given that oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface, it is reasonable to consider it as the major component surrounding continents.",
    "Options B (Australia) and C (Asia) are both continents, thus not covering the majority of the globe, only representing specific landmasses.",
    "Option D (continent) does not accurately describe what the globe is mostly covered by since it references a type of landmass rather than the predominant feature.",
    "Option E (island) refers to smaller landmasses and does not encompass the vast proportion of the Earth's surface.",
    "After evaluating the choices, only option A (ocean) aligns with the description of a major feature that covers the globe."
