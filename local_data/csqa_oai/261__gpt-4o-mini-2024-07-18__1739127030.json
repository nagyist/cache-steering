  "steps": [
    "The question asks for outcomes of driving a car that do not involve pain.",
    "Choices A (automobile accidents), B (backache), and E (car crash) all relate to harmful or painful events, meaning they should be eliminated.",
    "Choice C (eye strain) can occur from focusing on the road for long periods but may not be categorized as significant pain, although it can be uncomfortable.",
    "Choice D (getting tired) occurs naturally from driving, as it is common to feel fatigue from the act itself, but it does not necessarily involve pain.",
    "Now, we will determine which of the remaining options, C or D, best fit the criteria of not involving pain.",
    "Eye strain from focusing on the road can be bothersome and may lead to discomfort but is often not perceived as pain. However, tiredness generally falls outside the classification of pain and is a common but non-harmful response to driving.",
    "Since both C and D do not involve pain, but D (getting tired) is a direct consequence of engaging in the activity of driving without any discomfort, it becomes the stronger candidate.",
    "Ultimately, while both C and D can be argued, getting tired is a universal result of long periods of driving, while eye strain may fluctuate in severity and can still be perceived as discomfort. Thus getting tired is more fitting as a non-painful outcome."
