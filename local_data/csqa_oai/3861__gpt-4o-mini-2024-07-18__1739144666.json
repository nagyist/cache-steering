  "query": "Question: Where are there more than 1 trillion planets like earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: god's creation\nB: ball stopped\nC: gravity\nD: milky way\nE: universe",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to identify the possible locations where more than 1 trillion Earth-like planets might exist.",
    "The question suggests a comparison either within a certain region of space or on a broader cosmic scale.",
    "Choice A refers to \"god's creation,\" which is not a quantifiable location.",
    "Choice B mentions \"ball stopped,\" which does not relate to planets or locations in space context.",
    "Choice C states \"gravity,\" which is a fundamental force and does not refer to a location for planets.",
    "Choice D refers to the \"Milky Way,\" our galaxy, which has an estimated number of planets but it is significantly less than 1 trillion.",
    "Choice E mentions the \"universe,\" which contains all known galaxies, including potentially candidates for more than 1 trillion planets.",
    "Given current astronomical discoveries, it's estimated that on average, there are likely more planets than stars in the universe, hinting at the presence of a vast number of Earth-like planets.",
    "Thus, the universe as a whole is a far more plausible location for having over 1 trillion Earth-like planets compared to the Milky Way or any other specific locale."
