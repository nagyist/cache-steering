  "steps": [
    "To determine the best place to look at zebras, I need to consider places where animals are typically kept or displayed.",
    "Zoos are specifically designed to house and display animals from various species, including zebras, for public viewing.",
    "Museums usually display historical artifacts, art, or science exhibits but do not typically have live animals like zebras.",
    "Hospitals are places for medical care and do not feature live animals for viewing.",
    "A desk is a piece of furniture and does not relate to animal viewing at all.",
    "The opera is a performance venue for theatrical works and music, and does not include live animals, particularly zebras.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only choice that makes sense for viewing zebras is the zoo."
