    "Coffee beans come from coffee plants, mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions.",
    "In North America, the most significant country that is known for coffee production is Mexico.",
    "Coffee is cultivated in certain regions of Mexico, particularly in states like Veracruz, Puebla, and Chiapas.",
    "Other options in the choices, like \"desk,\" \"office,\" \"coffee shop,\" and \"kitchen office,\" are not countries and do not relate to coffee bean production.",
