  "query": "Question: A european red fox roams in the wild, what side of the earth is it likely on?\n\nChoices:\nA: england\nB: undergrowth\nC: northern hemisphere\nD: nantucket\nE: outer space",
  "steps": [
    "The European red fox is a species native to Europe, which implies it is found in regions associated with that continent.",
    "Geographically, Europe is located in the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth.",
    "The term \"undergrowth\" (choice B) refers to vegetation in a forest or wooded area, not a location or hemisphere.",
    "\"Nantucket\" (choice D) is an island off the coast of Massachusetts, which is not specific to Europe but is in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "\"Outer space\" (choice E) is not a valid geographical location where a terrestrial animal like a red fox would be found.",
    "Considering the above points, the European red fox is primarily found in natural habitats within Europe, which is entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Thus, the correct choice specifying where the European red fox roams would be related to the hemisphere it is located in."
