  "query": "Question: What would a sick person do to recover?\n\nChoices:\nA: take medicine\nB: throw up\nC: exercise\nD: battle cancer\nE: get better",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a sick person would do to recover. Recovery implies a return to a state of health.",
    "Taking medicine is a common action for a sick person, as medications can aid in recovery from various illnesses.",
    "Throwing up is generally a symptom of illness rather than a recovery action, so it does not contribute to getting better.",
    "Exercising is generally beneficial for health but may not be advisable when someone is sick, depending on the illness.",
    "Battling cancer indicates a specific health struggle but does not represent a generic action towards recovery.",
    "\"Getting better\" is a state rather than an action, so it doesn\u2019t fit the prompt of what a sick person would actively do.",
    "Since options B, C, D, and E do not directly align with actionable steps that foster recovery, I focus on option A.",
    "Option A (take medicine) is a widely acknowledged action that sick people undertake to facilitate recovery."
