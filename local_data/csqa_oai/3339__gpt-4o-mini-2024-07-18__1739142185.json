  "query": "Question: A great singers voice is going to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: loud\nB: beautiful\nC: sound\nD: george michael\nE: commmunicating",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options provided. A great singer is often associated with their vocal qualities. We should consider what is typically valued in a singer's voice.",
    "Next, let's evaluate option A: \"loud.\" While volume can be a characteristic of a singer's voice, being loud does not necessarily imply greatness in singing.",
    "Now, let's consider option B: \"beautiful.\" Many would argue that a great singer's voice is beautiful, as it often conveys emotion and captivates the audience.",
    "Next, we look at option C: \"sound.\" While this is related to the voice, it is too vague and does not specifically capture what makes a voice great.",
    "Now, let's examine option D: \"george michael.\" While he is a legendary singer, this option is not a characteristic of a great singer's voice.",
    "Finally, consider option E: \"communicating.\" A great singer's voice does communicate emotion and messages effectively, which is a key aspect of their talent.",
    "After evaluating all the options, \"beautiful\" (option B) stands out as it directly describes an essential quality of a great singer's voice.",
    "However, both \"beautiful\" and \"communicating\" have strong arguments. Yet, \"beautiful\" is more directly related to the admiration a great singer's voice receives."
