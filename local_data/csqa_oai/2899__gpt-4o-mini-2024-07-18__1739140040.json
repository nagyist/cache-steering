  "steps": [
    "To determine what a person can do to appear authoritative, I first need to understand what authority looks like in body language and demeanor.",
    "Research indicates that body posture plays a significant role in how a person is perceived. Standing erect or tall is often associated with confidence and authority.",
    "Next, I consider the other options. Washing dishes does not convey any authoritative presence; it is a common household task.",
    "Catching a cold is related to health and does not connect to behaviors or actions that communicate authority.",
    "Bowing to people generally conveys deference rather than authority. It is a submissive gesture.",
    "Waiting patiently does not necessarily communicate authority; it could suggest passiveness or lack of action.",
    "Among all the options, standing erect is widely recognized as a way to project strength, confidence, and authority.",
    "Conclusively, I analyze that the best choice regarding appearing authoritative is indeed to maintain good posture, which is encapsulated in option A."
