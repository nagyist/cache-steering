  "query": "Question: The teacher told the choir that they might faint and fall if they locked their knees while what?\n\nChoices:\nA: getting hurt\nB: ocean\nC: stand up\nD: standing\nE: summer",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the correct choice, I need to understand the context of the statement made by the teacher regarding locking knees and the potential consequences.",
    "Locking knees typically refers to a posture that can reduce blood flow and lead to fainting, especially when the body is held in a static position for too long.",
    "Considering the context of a choir, it is likely that the choir members stand for extended periods while singing.",
    "Given the options provided, I should look for a choice that implies a position that requires standing for a period of time during which locking knees may occur.",
    "Option A, \"getting hurt,\" does not logically connect to the action of locking knees.",
    "Option B, \"ocean,\" is unrelated to the context of standing still and is irrelevant.",
    "Option C, \"stand up,\" refers to an action but doesn't directly relate to the state of being while locking knees.",
    "Option D, \"standing,\" is the most appropriate term since it relates directly to the action of keeping a standing posture, where locking knees may be a risk.",
    "Option E, \"summer,\" is unrelated to the locking of knees or the standing posture.",
    "Therefore, the choice that most clearly fits the context of the teacher's warning about locking knees is option D."
