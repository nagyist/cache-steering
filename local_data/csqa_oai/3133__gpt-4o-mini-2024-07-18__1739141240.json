  "steps": [
    "To determine the common cause of injury, I will first analyze each option provided.",
    "Option A, \"accident,\" is a broad term that encompasses various situations, including slips, trips, falls, and collisions, which can lead to injuries. Accidents are among the most common causes of injuries.",
    "Option B, \"theatre,\" typically refers to a place where performances take place. While injuries can occur in theatres, such instances would generally not be considered common in the same way that accidents are.",
    "Option C, \"doctor's office,\" is a place primarily focused on health and medical care. It is unlikely to be a common cause of injury; rather, it is where injuries are treated or diagnosed.",
    "Option D, \"hockey game,\" refers to a specific sport where injuries can occur due to the physical nature of the game. However, while injuries are indeed common in hockey, they represent a specific context rather than a general cause.",
    "Option E, \"living thing,\" is very broad and could refer to animals, plants, or humans. While living things can cause injuries (e.g., bites, stings), it is not as direct a cause as an accident.",
    "After analyzing all options, \"accident\" (Option A) is the most common cause of injury as it references a wide range of situations that lead to injuries."
