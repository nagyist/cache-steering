  "query": "Question: He spent all summer in his room playing video games, because of this it wasn't surprising for Mother to find a stack of dirty dishes in her what?\n\nChoices:\nA: son's room\nB: party\nC: dishwasher\nD: restaurant kitchen\nE: shoes",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the subject spent all summer in his room, suggesting a context related to prolonged isolation in a personal space.",
    "The phrase \"stack of dirty dishes\" implies that the dishes were likely located in close proximity to where the person was spending most of their time.",
    "Among the answer choices, both \"son's room\" and \"dishwasher\" could be associated with the scenario, as the room could contain dirty dishes and the dishwasher is a place for cleaning them.",
    "However, \"dishwasher\" typically implies that the dirty dishes would have been placed there for cleaning, rather than being stacked elsewhere when someone has been neglecting them.",
    "The mention of \"Mother\" finding the dirty dishes suggests a domestic context, where a parent would check the child's room for cleanliness.",
    "\"Party\" and \"restaurant kitchen\" are not consistent with the scenario because they involve different settings that do not directly relate to the mother's personal discovery.",
    "\"Shoes\" makes little sense as a location for dirty dishes and doesn't fit within the context of the behavior described (playing video games).",
    "Given that the strongest fit for where a mother would find a stack of dirty dishes after her son has been isolated in his room is in \"son's room\"."
