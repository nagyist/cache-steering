  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you can store your tent and keep it on your person, which implies it needs to be portable.",
    "Option A, \"sleep in while camping,\" does not align with the idea of storing a tent; instead, it refers to using the tent for sleeping.",
    "Option B, \"camp ground,\" is a location where you might pitch a tent but doesn\u2019t offer a means to store it on your person.",
    "Option C, \"woods,\" refers to a natural location where you can set up a tent but does not imply you can keep it on your person.",
    "Option D, \"bag,\" is a general term that could refer to carrying items, but it lacks specificity regarding the size and type of bag.",
    "Option E, \"backpack,\" suggests a specific type of bag that is designed to be worn on the back and is suitable for transporting various gear, including a tent if it's small enough.",
    "Comparing the options, a \"backpack\" (E) is the most appropriate choice for storing and carrying a tent on your person, as it is designed to be portable and can secure items effectively.",
    "I double-check that other options either do not involve carrying or do not specifically address the concept of keeping it on your person."
