  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of human nerves and where they are found in relation to living beings.",
    "Human nerves are specifically a part of the human physiology, meaning they are found in the human body.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"B: person's body\" directly references the location of human nerves.",
    "Option \"A: possum\" refers to a different animal, which does not answer the question about human nerves.",
    "Option \"C: animal\" is too broad since it includes a wide variety of species and does not specifically address human nerves.",
    "Option \"D: organism\" is also too broad and not specific to humans, as all living things are organisms.",
    "Option \"E: fingertips\" specifies a part of the human body where nerves are indeed present, but it is not as comprehensive as the entire body.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"B: person's body\" clearly provides the most accurate answer."
