  "query": "Question: George liked hunting foxes.  Where might he go to do so?\n\nChoices:\nA: hen house\nB: painting\nC: virginia\nD: california\nE: lion's den",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that George's interest is in hunting foxes, which means he should go to places where foxes are commonly found and where hunting is allowed.",
    "Next, I will consider the options provided: A: hen house, B: painting, C: virginia, D: california, E: lion's den.",
    "I can eliminate A (hen house) as it is not a natural habitat for foxes and is more associated with chickens.",
    "B (painting) doesn't provide a location for hunting but rather refers to an art activity.",
    "Now I will evaluate C (virginia) and D (california). Both places are known for their wildlife and hunting opportunities.",
    "Regarding C (virginia), it's known for fox hunting, particularly with hounds, and has a rich tradition in that area.",
    "For D (california), while there are foxes, the hunting culture may not be as strong or traditional as it is in Virginia, where there are designated hunting seasons and events specifically for fox hunting.",
    "Thus, Virginia has a more established connection to the activity of fox hunting compared to California.",
    "Lastly, I assess E (lion's den). This is not suitable for fox hunting as it refers to a dangerous environment primarily associated with lions, not foxes."
