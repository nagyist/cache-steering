  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which asks where people eat together at work.",
    "Consider the different choices provided and think about whether they are typical settings found in a workplace.",
    "Choice A: \"house\" implies a residential setting, which is not relevant to a work context.",
    "Choice B: \"formal dining room\" might exist in some workplaces, but it is not a common or general setting for eating at work.",
    "Choice C: \"cafeteria\" is a common place in many workplaces where employees gather to eat together.",
    "Choice D: \"conference room\" typically is used for meetings, but might also be used for meals occasionally, but not as a standard eating place.",
    "Choice E: \"doing jigsaw puzzles on\" is an unclear expression and doesn't make sense in the context of eating.",
    "Now, consider which option most directly answers the question of where eating occurs in a workplace setting.",
    "The cafeteria is designed for group meals at work, making it the most logical choice."
