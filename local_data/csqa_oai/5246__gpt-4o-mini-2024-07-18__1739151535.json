  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the location of a lamp in relation to the walls meeting, which typically refers to a corner of a room.",
    "Among the provided choices, I need to identify which one suggests a location that fits the description of a corner.",
    "Choice A, \"office,\" does not specify a corner and is a general area.",
    "Choice B, \"corner,\" specifically indicates the area where two walls meet, matching the requirement.",
    "Choice C, \"desktop,\" refers to a surface where a lamp might be placed, but it does not relate to the walls meeting.",
    "Choice D, \"corner of garden,\" describes an outdoor location, which is not relevant for placing a lamp in a room.",
    "Choice E, \"bedroom,\" again indicates a type of room without specifying the placement of the lamp in relation to the walls meeting.",
    "Based on my reasoning, the correct answer is the location where the lamp can be placed at the junction of two walls, which is indicated by option B."
