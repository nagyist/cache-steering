  "query": "Question: Where could you see a single bee?\n\nChoices:\nA: soft drink\nB: swarm\nC: countryside\nD: apiary\nE: united states",
  "steps": [
    "A single bee can be seen outside, rather than indoors.",
    "Soft drink (choice A) typically does not relate to bees directly; bees may be attracted to sugary drinks but are not found inside them.",
    "A swarm (choice B) refers to a large number of bees, which contradicts the idea of seeing just a single bee.",
    "The countryside (choice C) is a natural environment where one might encounter solitary bees, such as bumblebees or solitary bee species.",
    "An apiary (choice D) is a place where beehives are kept, which is more likely to contain many bees rather than just a single bee.",
    "The United States (choice E) is a location and does not specifically indicate where one would encounter a single bee.",
    "From the analysis, the countryside clearly allows for the visibility of a single bee in its natural habitat."
