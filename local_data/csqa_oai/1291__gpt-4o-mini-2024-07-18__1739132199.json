  "query": "Question: Where is refuse stored for a long time?\n\nChoices:\nA: incinerator\nB: wastebasket\nC: waste basket\nD: dump\nE: garbage can",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the term \"refuse,\" which refers to waste or garbage.",
    "Next, we need to identify where waste or garbage is typically stored for a prolonged period.",
    "An incinerator is used for burning waste, so it\u2019s not a storage solution for a long time.",
    "A wastebasket generally holds small amounts of waste and is not intended for long-term storage.",
    "Similarly, a garbage can is often used for temporary storage before waste is collected, but it is typically emptied frequently.",
    "In contrast, a dump (or landfill) is designed for long-term storage of waste, where it is disposed of and left for extended periods.",
    "While the term \u201cdump\u201d is specific to landfills, it clearly indicates a place where refuse is stored long-term compared to the other options.",
    "Now, I can analyze the options: A (incinerator) is out; B (wastebasket) is for small waste; C (waste basket) is the same as a wastebasket; D (dump) indicates long-term storage; E (garbage can) is for short-term use.",
    "Based on this reasoning, \"dump\" is the best answer as it specifically refers to a location for long-term refuse storage."
