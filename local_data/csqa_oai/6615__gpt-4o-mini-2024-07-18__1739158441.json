  "query": "Question: The child had never seen a jellyfish in real life, he had only seen them in a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pacific ocean\nB: shore\nC: tank\nD: movie\nE: sea",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the child had never seen a jellyfish in real life, which implies that he has only encountered them in other formats, suggesting a lack of direct experience.",
    "The choices given are locations or mediums where one might see jellyfish: A) Pacific Ocean, B) Shore, C) Tank, D) Movie, and E) Sea.",
    "Let's analyze each option:\n- A (Pacific Ocean) implies a direct encounter in nature, which contradicts the premise of never having seen one in real life.",
    "- B (Shore) also suggests a direct encounter with jellyfish, and thus does not fit either.",
    "- C (Tank) refers to a controlled environment, such as an aquarium, where jellyfish can be viewed but does not represent a \"real life\" experience in the wild.",
    "- D (Movie) indicates that he might have seen jellyfish as part of a film or animation, which fits the context of having a visual experience without real-life interaction.",
    "- E (Sea) is similar to options A and B, indicating a natural environment where one would typically see jellyfish, which also contradicts the premise.",
    "Considering all the options, a \"movie\" (D) is a plausible format where someone could see jellyfish without having a real-life experience with them, while \"tank\" (C) would still count as a place you could see them in a controlled setting.",
    "However, the term \"movie\" suggests a more representational or fictional experience, which directly aligns with the child's claim of not having seen jellyfish in a real-life situation.",
    "Thus, after ruling out options that imply real-life encounters and considering the definition of being \"never seen\" in reality, the best answer is \"movie.\""
