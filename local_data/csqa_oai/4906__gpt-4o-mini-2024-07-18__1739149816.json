  "query": "Question: Where can you find a tennis court for non professionals?\n\nChoices:\nA: athletic club\nB: country club\nC: recreational center\nD: college campus\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify locations that generally offer tennis courts available to the public and specifically those who are non-professional players.",
    "Athletic clubs typically cater to a range of skill levels but may emphasize competitive play and training. However, they often have facilities open to members or the public, which could include non-professionals.",
    "Country clubs are generally more exclusive, often requiring membership and focusing on a wealthier clientele, which might limit access for casual, non-professional players.",
    "Recreational centers are designed to serve the community, offering various sports facilities, including tennis courts, which are likely available for non-professionals to use.",
    "College campuses might have tennis courts available; however, they are primarily for student use and may not be accessible to the general public or non-professionals.",
    "Zoos do not typically feature tennis courts as they are centers for animal exhibits and education, not sports facilities.",
    "Now, evaluating the options based on accessibility for non-professionals: athletic clubs offer access but may focus on competition, country clubs are too exclusive, recreational centers are explicitly open to all, college campuses limit access, and zoos are irrelevant.",
    "Thus, recreational centers are the most logical choice for finding tennis courts accessible to non-professional players in general."
