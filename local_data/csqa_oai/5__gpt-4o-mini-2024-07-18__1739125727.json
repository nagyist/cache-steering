  "steps": [
    "Identify the purpose of each item listed in the choices.",
    "A \"radio shack\" refers to a type of electronic equipment store, not a specific home entertainment device, so it doesn\u2019t require cable.",
    "A \"substation\" is related to electrical distribution and not home entertainment, so it doesn't require cable either.",
    "A \"cabinet\" may store electronic equipment but does not itself require cable.",
    "A \"television\" is a primary home entertainment device that typically requires cable for signal transmission in order to receive channels and watch programs.",
    "A \"desk\" is a piece of furniture and has no direct connection to home entertainment equipment requiring cable.",
    "Among the given choices, the only item that is actively involved in home entertainment and requires cable for functionality is the television.",
    "Confirm if other options can contradict; none do since the other items do not pertain to requiring cable for operation in a home entertainment context."
