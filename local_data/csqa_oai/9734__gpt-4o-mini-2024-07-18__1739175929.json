  "query": "Question: What type of homes are likely to have an attic?\n\nChoices:\nA: victorian house\nB: own home\nC: older houses\nD: boxes\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what type of homes typically include an attic space. An attic is usually a space found directly under the roof of a building and is often used for storage.",
    "Next, I will consider the characteristics of the choices given. \nChoice A: Victorian houses are known for having ornate architecture and often have attics.",
    "Choice B refers to \"own home,\" which is vague and does not specifically indicate an architectural style or age. It could mean any type of home.",
    "Choice C specifies \"older houses.\" Older homes generally are more likely to have attics since attics were a common design feature in many historical styles.",
    "Choice D, \"boxes,\" doesn't logically fit since boxes are not homes and do not have attics.",
    "Choice E, \"apartment,\" is typically a unit within a larger building. Most apartments do not include attics; instead, they may have shared storage facilities or none at all.",
    "Considering all the choices, the strongest candidates for having an attic are Victorian houses and older houses. However, older houses broadly encompass many styles and are more likely to include attics than newer constructions.",
    "Between choices A and C, while Victorian houses do have attics, \"older houses\" is more general and includes a wider variety of architectural styles that include attics.",
    "Thus, the option that best fits my conclusion is \"older houses.\""
