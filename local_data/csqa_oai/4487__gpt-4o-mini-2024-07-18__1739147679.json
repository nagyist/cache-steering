  "query": "Question: A birthday celebrates when a person reaches a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: funeral\nB: new age\nC: die\nD: happy\nE: obesity",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the significance of a birthday. A birthday typically marks a significant event in a person's life.",
    "A birthday is celebrated each year to recognize the anniversary of a person's birth.",
    "When someone has a birthday, they are considered to be a year older than the previous year.",
    "The phrase \"reaches a new age\" is relevant because each birthday signifies entering a new age or age group.",
    "The choices include options that do not logically connect to the concept of a birthday, such as \"funeral,\" \"die,\" \"happy,\" and \"obesity.\"",
    "\"Funeral\" (A) represents the end of life, which is the opposite of celebrating a birthday.",
    "\"Die\" (C) also represents the end of life and is not related to celebrating a birthday.",
    "\"Happy\" (D) does not specifically address what a birthday celebrates but rather is an emotion associated with it.",
    "\"Obesity\" (E) is unrelated to birthdays since birthdays signify age rather than physical health or weight.",
    "Given the choice \"new age\" (B) directly relates to the concept of celebrating a birthday, this is the most accurate answer."
