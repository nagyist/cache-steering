  "steps": [
    "The question asks for what a dance is a great way to do. This indicates we're looking for an activity or expression that is typically associated with dancing.",
    "Choice A (\"was happy\") is not relevant because it is in the past tense and does not relate to the act of dancing as an activity.",
    "Choice B (\"like dancing\") doesn't fit well as it suggests a preference rather than an action that can be expressed through dance.",
    "Choice C (\"express yourself\") directly aligns with the purpose of dance, which is often used as a medium for personal expression and creativity.",
    "Choice D (\"am happy\") is a state of being and does not convey an action related to the practice of dancing.",
    "Choice E (\"use the bathroom\") is completely unrelated to the context of dancing.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, Choice C strongly captures the essence of what a dance is used for, which is about expression."
