  "query": "Question: Whether it's livestock or produce a farmer does what?\n\nChoices:\nA: produce food\nB: raise crops\nC: can produce\nD: grow corn\nE: plant seeds",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand the general activities that farmers engage in. Farmers typically involve themselves in either livestock management or crop production.",
    "Next, the question is broad and encompasses various farming activities. We need to identify what is fundamental to what a farmer does.",
    "Choice A states \"produce food.\" This is a comprehensive statement that applies to both livestock (meat, dairy) and crops (fruits, vegetables, grains).",
    "Choice B states \"raise crops.\" While farmers do raise crops, this is a specific subset of what they might do, and does not include livestock.",
    "Choice C states \"can produce.\" This phrase is vague and does not clearly define what is being produced, making it less relevant in the context of the question.",
    "Choice D states \"grow corn,\" which again is too specific and only represents one type of crop.",
    "Choice E states \"plant seeds.\" While this is a key activity, it is only one part of a broader set of tasks performed by farmers and does not encompass livestock.",
    "After considering all options, choice A, \"produce food,\" encapsulates what farmers do, whether through raising livestock or growing various crops."
