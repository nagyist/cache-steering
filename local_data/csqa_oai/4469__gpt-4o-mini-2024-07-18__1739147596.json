  "query": "Question: Mice live many places, but what is their native habitat?\n\nChoices:\nA: attic\nB: laboratory\nC: loft\nD: town\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the natural environment where mice are typically found in the wild.",
    "Mice are primarily wild animals that thrive in various habitats, including forests, fields, and other natural settings.",
    "Next, I should analyze the options provided in the question and see which ones align with natural habitats.",
    "Choices A (attic), B (laboratory), and C (loft) are types of human-made environments or structures where mice may occasionally be found but are not their native habitats.",
    "Choice D (town) refers to urban areas where mice can live, but it does not represent a natural habitat.",
    "Now, I will consider choice E (countryside), which includes fields, farms, and natural areas, aligning closely with where mice typically thrive in their native settings.",
    "Given that countryside environments provide the type of habitat that supports the natural behavior and lifestyle of mice, it seems like the most fitting choice.",
    "Finally, I confirm that the best answer for the native habitat of mice among the options provided is indeed E (countryside)."
