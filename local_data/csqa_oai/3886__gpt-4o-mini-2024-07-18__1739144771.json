  "query": "Question: After suffering a bad injury, where will a person get taken?\n\nChoices:\nA: hockey game\nB: home\nC: hospital\nD: emergency room\nE: doctor's office",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a person who has suffered a bad injury.",
    "Generally, a bad injury requires medical attention.",
    "The most suitable place for immediate medical attention after a significant injury is the hospital.",
    "An emergency room, which is part of a hospital, is specifically designed for treating urgent injuries.",
    "A doctor's office is typically for less urgent care and for scheduled appointments, not immediate injury treatment.",
    "While a person could initially be taken to an emergency room, ultimately they may be admitted to a hospital for further care.",
    "The options include both \"hospital\" and \"emergency room,\" but the most direct answer for treatment after a bad injury is the hospital.",
    "Given the context of the question, it is important to determine if \"emergency room\" is a more fitting answer since it directly addresses the immediate treatment need.",
    "However, since \"hospital\" encompasses the whole facility including the emergency room and is often the general term referenced in medical contexts, I will lean toward \"hospital.\"",
    "Assuming that both the hospital and emergency room are viable options, I will check for the best fit based on immediate medical care required after a \"bad injury.\""
