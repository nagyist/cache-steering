  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that clean linen is important in John's workplace, which suggests an environment that requires hygiene and regular changing of linens.",
    "Option A (hospital) would require clean linen for patient care, as hospitals need to maintain strict cleanliness standards to prevent infection.",
    "Option B (daycare) also requires clean linens, such as bedding for naps, but may not emphasize it as strongly as a hospital or a hotel.",
    "Option C (dresser drawers) does not relate to a workplace as it refers to furniture used to store clothing and linens.",
    "Option D (hotel) certainly requires clean linen since hotels provide bedding and towels that must be changed frequently for guests.",
    "Option E (cabinet) also does not relate to a workplace; it refers to furniture for storage, similar to option C.",
    "Comparing options A (hospital) and D (hotel), both are reasonable workplaces for requiring clean linen.",
    "However, hospitals tend to have higher cleanliness standards and more frequent linen changes compared to hotels, where clean linens are also important but not as critical as in healthcare settings.",
    "Considering the balance between necessity and context, while both options are possible, the hospital (A) stands out for the highest relevance of clean linen due to its critical nature in patient care."
