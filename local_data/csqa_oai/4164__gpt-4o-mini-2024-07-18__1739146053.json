  "query": "Question: What delta state is known for bbq?\n\nChoices:\nA: louisiana\nB: grill\nC: backyard\nD: restaurant\nE: ribs",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what is commonly associated with barbecue in terms of culture and regional specialties.",
    "The question asks specifically about \"delta state,\" which refers to a geographical area, so I should think about states in the Mississippi Delta region that are known for barbecue.",
    "Louisiana is one of the states in the Mississippi Delta region and is famous for its unique cuisine, which often includes barbecue styles and flavors.",
    "I should also consider the other choices: \"grill,\" \"backyard,\" \"restaurant,\" and \"ribs.\"",
    "While \"grill\" and \"backyard\" are related to barbecue, they do not refer to a state. \"Restaurant\" is a place where barbecue can be served but not a specific delta state.",
    "\u201cRibs\u201d can be a food item associated with barbecue but again does not refer to a state.",
    "Thus, from the options provided, \"louisiana\" is the only answer that correctly identifies a delta state specifically known for barbecue."
