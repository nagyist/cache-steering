  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a synonym or a suitable word to complete the phrase \"Using addictive drugs is a bad ____.\"",
    "We need to analyze the choices to find one that fits logically and grammatically in the context of the phrase.",
    "Choice A: \"choice\" - This suggests that using addictive drugs is not a good option or decision, which aligns with common perspectives on drug use.",
    "Choice B: \"luck\" - This does not make sense as it does not relate to the context of using drugs. Drugs aren't typically associated with luck.",
    "Choice C: \"worthy\" - This implies that using addictive drugs has some merit, which contradicts the inherent negative connotation of \"bad.\"",
    "Choice D: \"excellent\" - This is clearly the opposite of bad, making it an improper fit.",
    "Choice E: \"upright\" - This typically refers to morality or ethical behavior, which again does not fit well with the idea of drugs being \"bad.\"",
    "After evaluating the choices, \"choice\" fits best within the context of the statement, reinforcing the negative perspective on using addictive drugs."
