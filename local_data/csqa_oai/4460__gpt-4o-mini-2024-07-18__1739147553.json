  "query": "Question: If you're still in love and end up stopping being married to your partner, what emotion are you likely to experience?\n\nChoices:\nA: wrong\nB: pleasure\nC: encouragement\nD: depression\nE: relief",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the situation where you are still in love but have ended a marriage. This indicates a conflict between emotional attachment and the reality of the separation.",
    "Next, contemplate the feelings associated with love. Love often entails a desire for connection and commitment, both of which are usually disrupted in a breakup.",
    "Now, think about how someone might feel after a breakup when they are still in love. Despite ending the relationship, there can be a sense of loss and longing for what once was.",
    "Additionally, consider the emotional aftermath of a marriage ending. Common feelings include sadness, grief, and sometimes hopelessness, especially if the love remains strong.",
    "Evaluate each answer choice in light of these considerations. \"Wrong\" seems unrelated; \"pleasure\" contradicts the feelings associated with love and loss; \"encouragement\" does not fit with the context of a breakup; \"relief\" could be a feeling for some, but generally, it is not predominant for someone still in love.",
    "Focus particularly on the answer choice that aligns with enduring love during separation. \"Depression\" is common for those who feel still attached but also face the pain of separation.",
    "Therefore, the culmination of these feelings of sadness, longing, and emotional strife points strongly towards a negative emotional state.",
    "Finally, summarize the reasoning. Given that the emotional experience is heavily associated with grief and heartbreak when still in love but divorced, \"depression\" is the most appropriate choice."
