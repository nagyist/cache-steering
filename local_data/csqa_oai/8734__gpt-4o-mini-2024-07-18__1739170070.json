  "query": "Question: The office needed lights, so where were they installed?\n\nChoices:\nA: they were installed outside.\nB: building\nC: carnival\nD: heat table\nE: plane",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the context of the question. The phrase \"The office needed lights,\" suggests that the lights were required for functionality or to illuminate a workspace.",
    "Next, we consider the term \"office.\" Typically, an office refers to a place where business or professional work is conducted, often inside a building.",
    "Now, we analyze the options given. The choices include locations: outside, building, carnival, heat table, and plane.",
    "Choice A, \"they were installed outside,\" seems less likely, as offices usually don't need their primary lighting installed outside.",
    "Choice B, \"building,\" is a plausible option since offices are located within buildings, and it's common to install lights there.",
    "Choice C, \"carnival,\" is unlikely as it does not relate to a typical office environment.",
    "Choice D, \"heat table,\" does not relate to lights and thus seems irrelevant in this context.",
    "Choice E, \"plane,\" is also not a suitable location for office lights since planes are not typical workspaces like an office.",
    "After evaluating all the choices, the most logical place for the lights to be installed, given that they were for the office, is within the building where the office is located."
