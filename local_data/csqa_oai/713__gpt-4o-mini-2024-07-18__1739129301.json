  "query": "Question: A school is most likely to be located in what sort of zone?\n\nChoices:\nA: residential neighborhood\nB: community\nC: building\nD: prague\nE: every city",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand what a school is and its primary purpose. Schools are educational institutions where students receive instruction.",
    "Next, we can consider where schools are typically located. They often need to be accessible to students and their families, which commonly means being situated in areas where people live.",
    "Residential neighborhoods are areas primarily composed of housing where families reside. This makes them a likely location for schools because children living nearby can easily walk or commute to school.",
    "Now, let's look at the other choices. A community could encompass a residential area but is broader and less specific; schools may not be located in all communities.",
    "The choice \"building\" is too general. A school itself is a type of building. Hence, it wouldn't be accurate to say a school is located in a \"building\" since schools are buildings.",
    "The choice \"Prague\" is a specific city which does not universally apply to all schools, as schools can be located in various cities and not just one.",
    "The choice \"every city\" suggests an idea that schools exist in all cities, which is partially true but does not pinpoint a specific type of zone.",
    "Evaluating all options again, the best choice that consistently applies to where schools are likely found is \"residential neighborhood\" since this aligns with the need for school accessibility for students."
