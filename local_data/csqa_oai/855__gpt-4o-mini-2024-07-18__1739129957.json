  "query": "Question: Rumors of roving bands of monsters killing people could lead to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: panic\nB: getting in trouble\nC: mass hysteria\nD: go to prison\nE: murder",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question, which revolves around reactions to rumors about monsters harming people.",
    "Next, I should consider the types of responses people might have to such alarming rumors. Panic is often a common immediate response to fears for safety.",
    "Also, I should think about whether rumors of this nature could lead to mass hysteria, where a larger group may overreact emotionally and irrationally.",
    "I will eliminate options that don\u2019t fit the context of an emotional reaction to a rumor. For example, \"getting in trouble\" and \"go to prison\" are more unrelated to the emotional response but rather to legal consequences.",
    "\"Murder\" is also less directly relevant as it's more about a specific action rather than a reaction to fear.",
    "Now, looking at the remaining options: \"panic\" and \"mass hysteria.\" Both are possible responses, but \"mass hysteria\" indicates a more widespread emotional reaction, while \"panic\" indicates an immediate personal reaction.",
    "I need to determine which of these options is likely to occur from the context of widespread rumors. Mass hysteria often accompanies rumors that trigger collective fears.",
    "In situations of perceived danger from non-specific threats (like monsters), people often react en masse, leading to a phenomenon known as mass hysteria.",
    "Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the rumors would most likely lead to mass hysteria rather than just individual panic."
