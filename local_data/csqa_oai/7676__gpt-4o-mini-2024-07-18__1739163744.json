    "The word \"bears\" indicates that the situation involves wildlife, which can sometimes be unpredictable.",
    "Considering the context of bears, the concerns usually revolve around them being a hazard to humans.",

    "Choice C, \"precarious,\" does not fit as it describes a state of uncertainty rather than a quality of the bears themselves.",
