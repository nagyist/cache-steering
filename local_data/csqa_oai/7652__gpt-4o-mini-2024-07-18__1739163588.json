  "steps": [
    "The sentence discusses the emotional burden carried by the man after committing murder. This burden suggests a feeling of guilt or remorse.",
    "The phrase \"he swore he could still hear the man's heart beating\" indicates a psychological effect linked to guilt or a troubled conscience following an act of violence.",
    "Looking at the options, \"great sorrow\" (A) could fit, but it doesn't directly relate to the act of murder as strongly as conscience would.",
    "\"A stethoscope\" (B) is an irrelevant item in this context and does not relate to emotions or feelings.",
    "\"Find God\" (D) suggests a search for redemption but does not directly connect to the immediate emotional burden the man feels.",
    "\"Go to jail\" (E) refers to a consequence of the act but doesn't capture the internal struggle or emotional toll expressed.",
    "The most fitting choice that captures the essence of feeling haunted by one's actions is \"guilty conscience\" (C), as it aligns perfectly with the notion of feeling the weight of one's crime deeply."
