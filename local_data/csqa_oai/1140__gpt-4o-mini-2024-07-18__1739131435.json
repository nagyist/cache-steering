  "query": "Question: If I am a spectator at a trade show, what am I likely watching?\n\nChoices:\nA: sporting event\nB: racing\nC: demonstration\nD: show\nE: watch event",
  "steps": [
    "As a spectator, I would be attending an event where I can observe something happening.",
    "A trade show typically showcases products or services from various exhibitors to attract potential customers and partners.",
    "I can rule out \"A: sporting event\" and \"B: racing\" as these are not typically featured at a trade show.",
    "The term \"demonstration\" refers to a display or presentation intended to show how a product or service works, which is common at trade shows.",
    "The word \"show\" is too vague; while it can apply to a trade show, it does not specifically indicate what I would be observing.",
    "\"Watch event\" is also vague and redundant as it conveys the act of observing but does not specify what I am watching at a trade show.",
    "Based on the context of a trade show, the most appropriate and specific term is \"demonstration,\" as this directly relates to what is typically presented at such an event.",
    "Considering all the choices, I conclude that the primary activity a spectator would likely be watching at a trade show is a demonstration of products or services."
