  "query": "Question: Where do movies often depict a subway station?\n\nChoices:\nA: capital city\nB: new york\nC: toronto\nD: london\nE: big city",
  "steps": [
    "Movies frequently depict urban environments, particularly settings that are associated with public transportation. Subway stations are commonly found in larger metropolitan areas.",
    "New York City is famous for its subway system, which is one of the largest and most recognizable in the world. Many films are set in New York and feature its subway stations prominently.",
    "Toronto does have a subway system, but it is less frequently highlighted in popular films compared to New York's subway. Therefore, it might not be as strong of a candidate.",
    "London also has a well-known subway system (the Tube), and many films are set in London that might depict its subway stations. However, it does not typically receive the same level of representation in movies as NYC.",
    "The term \"big city\" is too vague, as it applies to many urban areas around the world that could be depicted in movies, not just specific ones like New York, Toronto, or London.",
    "Based on the popularity of New York as a film setting and the iconic status of its subway stations in cinema, it stands out as a primary location for subway station depictions.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, I will focus on New York as the most common depiction for subway stations in movies."
