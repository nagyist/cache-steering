  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the effects of consuming too many alcoholic drinks.",
    "Drinking excessively often results in a hangover, which can include various symptoms.",
    "Common symptoms of a hangover include dehydration, which can lead to headaches.",
    "Nausea is also a common symptom, but it is not the only one and is more variable.",
    "Intimacy is unrelated to the physical symptoms caused by excessive drinking.",
    "The option \"drinking\" does not describe a type of pain; it is simply the act of consuming alcohol.",
    "Riots do not directly result from individual experiences with hangovers but are related to social situations and behaviors.",
    "Based on the context of the question, headaches are a well-documented and frequent consequence of overindulgence in alcohol.",
    "I analyze the choices again to ensure clear understanding and verify which symptoms are most commonly discussed in relation to hangovers.",
    "Final verification of symptoms points strongly towards headaches as a stereotypical outcome of a night of heavy drinking."
