  "query": "Question: Before getting the refined mineral you begin with collecting and mining the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: earth\nB: multivitamin\nC: mineral\nD: ore\nE: dietary concerns",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the initial stage in the process of obtaining refined minerals.",
    "It is important to understand what is typically collected or mined before refining minerals.",
    "Refined minerals generally come from raw materials that contain those minerals.",
    "Common sources of raw materials for minerals include ores, which are naturally occurring solid materials from which a metal or valuable mineral can be extracted.",
    "The term \"ore\" specifically refers to a naturally occurring solid material that contains minerals in sufficient quantities to make it economically viable to extract them.",
    "Options A (earth), B (multivitamin), C (mineral), and E (dietary concerns) do not accurately represent the raw material collected for refining minerals.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer should relate to mining minerals directly, which would be \"ore.\""
