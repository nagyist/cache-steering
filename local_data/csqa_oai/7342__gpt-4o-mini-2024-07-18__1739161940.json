  "query": "Question: Where would you find a head that does not move?\n\nChoices:\nA: submarine\nB: human body\nC: morgue\nD: movie theater\nE: hat shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze each choice to understand where a head that does not move might be found.",
    "Choice A: submarine - A submarine is a vehicle used underwater, and there are no heads that do not move associated with it.",
    "Choice B: human body - Human heads are attached to bodies; they can move unless they're incapacitated, so this option does not fit.",
    "Choice C: morgue - A morgue is a place where deceased individuals are kept. The heads of the deceased do not move.",
    "Choice D: movie theater - While there may be heads present, they belong to audience members who are alive and can move, making this option unsuitable.",
    "Choice E: hat shop - A hat shop features hats on display or on people's heads, but again, the heads are attached to living people and can move.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the only place where a head does not move is in the morgue."
