  "steps": [
    "Sarah couldn't stand living without an air conditioner, which indicates that she is in a situation where the heat is likely intense.",
    "It is specified that it is summer, which typically means higher temperatures.",
    "The absence of an air conditioner likely indicates that she finds the heat unbearable, suggesting she is in a very warm environment.",
    "Among the choices, \"the sun\" (A) is overly broad and not a location; it is impossible for someone to live \"in\" the sun.",
    "\"Texas\" (B) is known for its hot summers, so it's a plausible location for someone who finds heat intolerable.",
    "\"Hard\" (C) is not a location and doesn't contribute to the context.",
    "\"A car\" (D) may have air conditioning, but it is not explicitly mentioned that Sarah is in one, and a car would likely not sustain someone long-term without air conditioning.",
    "\"Office building\" (E) could have air conditioning, but the context doesn't specify her location as being inside one.",
    "Among the relevant options, Texas stands out as a locale where one would certainly consider needing air conditioning during summer.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the best answer implying she was in a location where air conditioning is essential due to the heat is Texas."
