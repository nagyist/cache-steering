  "query": "Question: How do people show appreciation after they enjoy a show?\n\nChoices:\nA: jump\nB: clap\nC: smile\nD: feel happy\nE: watch television",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of showing appreciation after attending a show. Common forms of appreciation often involve non-verbal and verbal cues.",
    "Next, think about what actions are typical in social settings after a performance, such as plays, concerts, or other entertainment forms.",
    "Clapping is a widely recognized and traditional way to express appreciation and is often encouraged by performers and presenters.",
    "Smiling can indicate enjoyment but is usually a more personal or individual response rather than a communal one. It may not be as explicit as clapping.",
    "Feeling happy is an emotional state that follows enjoyment, but it does not constitute an action of appreciation in the way clapping does.",
    "Jumping may express excitement but is not a common means of showing appreciation in many cultural contexts related to performances.",
    "Watching television does not relate directly to showing appreciation after a live show, as it involves a different form of entertainment altogether.",
    "Given these considerations, the most fitting response that explicitly indicates appreciation after enjoying a show is clapping."
