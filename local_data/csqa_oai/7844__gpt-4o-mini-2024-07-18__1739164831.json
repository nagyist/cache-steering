  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the size of a school cafeteria, implying we should look for a descriptor of physical dimensions or capacity.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, they consist of a mix of school types and room descriptions.",
    "Choice A (high school) is a type of school but does not describe a size.",
    "Choice B (all kinds of schools) is also a descriptor of school types, not size.",
    "Choice C (large room) describes a potential size for a cafeteria but is generalized and does not specify a type of school.",
    "Choice D (polytechnic) refers to a specific type of educational institution without indicating size.",
    "Choice E (hall room) could imply a large space but is not as precise as \"large room.\"",
    "Among the options, \"large room\" (Choice C) is the most descriptive term that addresses the general physical size associated with cafeterias.",
    "None of the other choices provide clarity on the size of a cafeteria as effectively as \"large room.\"",
    "Therefore, based on the logical reasoning of sizes and types, the best choice is C."
