  "steps": [
    "The context of the question involves an old man who is bedridden and the role of a nurse in caring for him.",
    "Bedridden patients often face various complications if they remain in the same position for long periods, including skin issues.",
    "One significant concern for bedridden patients is the development of bed sores, also known as pressure ulcers.",
    "The nurse's job would include repositioning the patient to prevent such complications.",
    "The other answer choices do not directly relate to the primary medical concern associated with staying in bed for extended periods.",
    "\"Missing out\" and \"comfort\" do not pertain to a physical health concern the nurse addresses by moving the patient.",
    "\"Nervous\" is also not a relevant medical issue related to physical immobility.",
    "The focus of nursing care for bedridden patients is primarily to prevent physical health problems, particularly skin integrity issues.",
    "Thus, the correct answer must be related to the prevention of bed sores."
