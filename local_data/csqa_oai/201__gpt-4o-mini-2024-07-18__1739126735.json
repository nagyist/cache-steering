  "query": "Question: What place of work might you find a hairpin?\n\nChoices:\nA: hair salon\nB: hair of woman\nC: barber shop\nD: pincushion\nE: woman's hair",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature and function of a hairpin, which is generally used for securing hair in place.",
    "Evaluate where hairpins are commonly used. They are often found in settings related to hairstyling.",
    "Examine each of the choices provided.",
    "A hair salon is a place where hairstyling occurs, making it a likely place for hairpins to be found.",
    "A barber shop primarily caters to men's haircuts, and hairpins may not be commonly used there.",
    "The option \"hair of woman\" is too vague and does not specifically indicate a place of work.",
    "A pincushion is used for holding pins and needles, not hairpins, and is not a place of work.",
    "The option \"woman's hair\" again does not indicate any employment setting.",
    "Thus, the strongest candidates for a place of work where hairpins clearly belong are a hair salon and potentially a barber shop.",
    "Among the options, the most appropriate place for a hairpin is in a hair salon."
