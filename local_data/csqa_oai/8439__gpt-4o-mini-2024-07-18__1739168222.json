  "query": "Question: Where would you find a pot that is being used by someone?\n\nChoices:\nA: toilet\nB: porch\nC: greenhouse\nD: cupboard\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a \"pot\" generally refers to. In this context, it is likely a cooking pot or plant pot.",
    "If we consider a cooking pot, we should look for environments where food is being prepared. A restaurant stands out as a place where pots are commonly used in cooking.",
    "A toilet does not typically use pots for any cooking-related activities, so it is unlikely that a pot is being used there.",
    "A porch is usually an outdoor area attached to a house and does not seem relevant for cooking or planting in pots.",
    "In a greenhouse, pots are used primarily for planting and growing plants, but the question specifies someone is using the pot.",
    "While pots are definitely found in a greenhouse, it's more common for them to be actively used or found in cooking settings such as a restaurant.",
    "A cupboard is more of a storage area rather than a place where someone actively uses a pot.",
    "Considering all options, the context indicates that the most likely place where someone would be actively using a pot is in a restaurant.",
    "Thus, after analyzing all choices and their contexts, restaurant (E) is the best answer since it clearly indicates a location where pots are regularly in use for cooking."
