  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the context of Sarah riding a horse and the sensations that can be associated with that activity.",
    "The question mentions that Sarah is experiencing pain in her legs due to riding horses, which suggests a physical discomfort or muscle-related issue.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided to see which ones relate to a physical sensation due to riding a horse.",
    "Option A, \"bouncing,\" could relate to the movement of riding but not necessarily imply pain directly.",
    "Option B, \"shaky,\" also relates to the physical action but does not seem directly linked to leg pain.",
    "Option C, \"fear,\" does not pertain to a physical sensation and is emotional rather than physical pain.",
    "Option D, \"movement,\" describes the act of riding but does not indicate discomfort specifically.",
    "Option E, \"stiffness,\" directly refers to a sensation of tightness or discomfort in the muscles and could logically be linked to pain in the legs from riding.",
    "Given the above analysis, the sensation most aligned with Sarah's experience of leg pain is \"stiffness.\""
