  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one typically keeps a credit card.",
    "A purse (option A) is a common place for people, especially women, to store their credit cards along with cash and personal items.",
    "An envelope (option B) is not a typical place to keep a credit card as it is usually used for mailing documents or keeping loose papers together.",
    "A restaurant (option C) is a location where a credit card may be used, but it is not a storage place for keeping the card.",
    "A wakket (option D) seems to be a typographical error or a misinterpretation of \"pocket,\" which could hold a credit card, but it's not a standard or specific place for storage.",
    "A wallet (option E) is the most common, organized, and secure place specifically designed for keeping credit cards along with identification and cash.",
    "Comparing all the options, the wallet is the most logical and conventional place for storing a credit card.",
    "Thus, upon evaluating all the options, the best answer would be the wallet."
