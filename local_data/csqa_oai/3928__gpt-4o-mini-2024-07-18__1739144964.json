    "The question asks how a song can emotionally connect with people.",
    "Songs are typically auditory experiences, meaning they are heard rather than seen or smelled.",
    "Among the options provided, \"hearing\" is the most direct association with experiencing a song.",
    "Options related to sight (\"seeing\" and \"sight\") do not pertain to songs since songs are not visual forms of art.",
    "The options \"smelling\" and \"sniff\" also do not relate to songs at all, as they refer to olfactory senses.",
    "Therefore, since a song is experienced primarily through sound, the correct answer should involve hearing.",
    "The only choice that directly correlates to how one experiences a song is \"hearing.\"",
    "Thus, the answer must be B, as it stands for \"hearing.\""
