  "query": "Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: internet cafe\nC: starbucks\nD: cup\nE: supermarket",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of being thirsty and the action of putting coffee somewhere.",
    "Next, evaluate what 'putting' coffee means in this scenario. It generally refers to setting coffee down after it has been made or purchased.",
    "Look at the options provided. 'Container' could refer to any holding vessel, but it\u2019s vague and could imply many different things.",
    "'Internet cafe' and 'supermarket' are places where coffee might be found, but they aren't suitable for actually putting coffee where it would be consumed.",
    "'Starbucks' is a coffee shop where coffee can be purchased, but it doesn't fit the idea of putting coffee down for consumption.",
    "Finally, consider 'cup,' which is specifically designed to hold coffee and would be the typical receptacle for drinking coffee.",
    "Evaluating all options, the 'cup' is the most relevant and direct answer to where you would put coffee if you are thirsty."
