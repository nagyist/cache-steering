  "query": "Question: Where do almost all humans live?\n\nChoices:\nA: china\nB: on planet earth\nC: train wreck\nD: homes\nE: dress shop",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where almost all humans live, we first need to understand the context of human habitation.",
    "Humans inhabit various locations, including countries, cities, and specific buildings.",
    "Let's analyze the provided options: \n- Option A is \"China,\" which is a country with a large population, but it does not account for all humans.\n- Option B is \"on planet earth,\" which encompasses all human habitats globally.\n- Option C is \"train wreck,\" which is not a typical living space for humans.\n- Option D is \"homes,\" which does represent where individuals live but is still limited to single dwelling units.\n- Option E is \"dress shop,\" which is not a common living space.",
    "Now, focusing on options B and D: while \"homes\" refers to where people live, \"on planet earth\" is more encompassing and includes all the habitats people reside in.",
    "Comparing the candidates further, option B (\"on planet earth\") is universal and therefore includes every type of dwelling and location humans may occupy, while option D is too specific.",
    "Thus, the best answer that includes all humans and their habitats is option B."
