    "The act of bringing up personal issues, especially regarding marriage, typically reflects vulnerability, and can lead to discomfort for both the speaker and the listeners.",
    "Friends may not always know how to respond to marital problems, which can create a sense of awkwardness or discomfort in the conversation.",
    "The audience\u2019s reaction may vary, but they might feel worried or anxious because they care about their friend\u2019s well-being.",
    "Furthermore, friends may fear saying the wrong thing, which can add to the overall discomfort of the situation.",
    "If the person sharing their marital issues is seeking support, they might feel exposed, increasing their discomfort.",
    "Additionally, discussing sensitive topics like marital issues can shift the mood of the conversation, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere among friends.",
