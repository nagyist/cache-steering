  "query": "Question: The shopping center was empty and needed tenants, who did they solicit?\n\nChoices:\nA: people\nB: most peculiar places\nC: stores\nD: mall\nE: suburbs",
  "steps": [
    "The shopping center is a physical space that typically houses various businesses or stores.",
    "To fill the empty shopping center, it would make sense to solicit businesses that are relevant to that setting.",
    "Amongst the choices given, \"stores\" (choice C) specifically refers to the types of tenants that would fit the environment of a shopping center.",
    "Choice A, \"people\", is too vague and does not specify what type of people, thus it does not directly answer the question of who they would solicit for tenants.",
    "Choice B, \"most peculiar places\", is nonsensical in this context as it does not pertain to typical tenants one would wish to find in a shopping center.",
    "Choice D, \"mall\", does not make sense as it refers to a type of shopping center rather than a category of tenant.",
    "Choice E, \"suburbs\", similarly does not refer to specific tenants and thus is not relevant to the solicitation of tenants for the shopping center.",
    "Based on the analysis, soliciting \"stores\" is the most logical option for filling the vacant shopping center."
