  "steps": [
    "Washing hands is a crucial hygiene practice to remove dirt, germs, and prevent illness.",
    "The process typically starts with wetting the hands under clean running water.",
    "After wetting, the next logical step is to use soap to create a lather that helps lift dirt and germs.",
    "Rinsing follows the use of soap to wash away the lather along with the dirt and germs.",
    "Thinking (option A) is not a physical action related to washing hands, but rather a mental process.",
    "Irritation (option B) does not relate to the steps in handwashing but could refer to discomfort.",
    "Drying (option D) is a step that follows rinsing, but it is not the step immediately after wetting.",
    "Cleaning hands after an autopsy (option E) is a specific scenario that is irrelevant to general handwashing procedure.",
    "The only option that directly follows wetting the hands is using soap (option C)."
