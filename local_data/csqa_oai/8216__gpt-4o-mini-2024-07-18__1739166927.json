  "query": "Question: The people wanted to do a demonstration, where did they decide to do it?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: public place\nC: demolition\nD: space shuttle\nE: roadblock",
  "steps": [
    "The context of a demonstration typically involves gathering people in a visible location where they can express their views.",
    "A supermarket is primarily a commercial venue and not commonly associated with demonstrations, which generally aim for public visibility.",
    "A public place allows for maximum visibility and engagement from passersby, making it a suitable choice for a demonstration.",
    "Demolition refers to the act of tearing down structures and does not relate to a place for a demonstration.",
    "A space shuttle is a vehicle for space travel and is not a location suitable for a demonstration.",
    "A roadblock suggests a disruption to traffic or movement and might be a tactic used during a demonstration, but it implies a specific action rather than a chosen location.",
    "Given the goals of a demonstration, the most logical choice would be a public space where many people can gather and share their message.",
    "Now, I will analyze the choices: \n- Supermarket: unlikely.\n- Public place: appropriate.\n- Demolition: unrelated.\n- Space shuttle: irrelevant.\n- Roadblock: a tactic, not a place.",
    "Thus, the choice \"public place\" stands out as the most fitting location for the demonstration."
