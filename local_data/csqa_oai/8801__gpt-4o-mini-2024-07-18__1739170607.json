  "query": "Question: Where would a court be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: gymnasium\nC: inside\nD: public building\nE: palace",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a court is. A court is a place where legal matters are adjudicated.",
    "Next, reflect on the typical locations where courts are found. They are generally situated in urban areas.",
    "Analyze the choices provided. A court would typically not be found in a gymnasium, as that is a facility for sports and physical activities.",
    "Consider the option \"inside.\" While a court is indeed indoors, this answer is too vague and doesn't specify a location type.",
    "Examine the choice of \"public building.\" Courts are indeed public entities and are commonly housed in designated buildings such as courthouses.",
    "Look at the choice \"palace.\" Although a palace is a type of building, it is usually associated with royalty and not with the judicial system.",
    "Now, since \u201cpublic building\u201d aligns well with the concept of a court being an official and accessible place for legal proceedings, it stands out as the most suitable choice.",
    "The option \"city\" refers to a geographical area rather than a specific type of building, making it less appropriate than \"public building.\"",
    "Having explored all options, it's clear that the best answer is the one that specifies the type of location where a court is fundamentally situated."
