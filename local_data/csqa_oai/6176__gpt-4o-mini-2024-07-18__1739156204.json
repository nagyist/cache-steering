  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to analyze what is typically experienced when visiting a museum.",
    "Visiting a museum generally involves observing and appreciating various artifacts, which can include art pieces, historical items, or scientific exhibits.",
    "The act of seeing these artifacts is a primary reason people go to museums, as they can view items of historical or cultural significance.",
    "Education is also a key aspect of museums, as they often contain informational plaques, guides, and tours that explain the significance of what is displayed.",
    "While some visitors may experience distractions, such as crying babies, this is not something that always happens during a museum visit.",
    "Similarly, boredom is subjective and while some people may find museums uninteresting, many others find them engaging and informative.",
    "The sense of peace can also be subjective and may vary between individuals, but is not universally experienced by everyone during a visit.",
    "Given the context and common experiences in museums, the only option that consistently occurs is seeing artifacts.",
    "So, the final answer should reflect the universally experienced aspect of visiting a museum."
