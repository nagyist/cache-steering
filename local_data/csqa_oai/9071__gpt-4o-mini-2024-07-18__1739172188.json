  "query": "Question: Where do you live if there are a lot of mailboxes in the foyer?\n\nChoices:\nA: spacious house\nB: mansion\nC: building\nD: apartment\nE: townhouse",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the presence of many mailboxes in a foyer. This suggests that many residents access the same entry point.",
    "Next, I think about the types of living arrangements that commonly have a shared foyer with multiple mailboxes.",
    "A spacious house typically has its own mailbox and would not require a foyer with many mailboxes.",
    "Similarly, a mansion, while it could have multiple rooms, usually functions more as a singular large dwelling rather than shared residences.",
    "A townhouse may have a shared mailbox situation, but it's generally more about individual units that are part of a row or block rather than a foyer with many mailboxes.",
    "An apartment building often contains multiple units accessed through a common foyer, and it definitely would include many mailboxes.",
    "Additionally, I can eliminate \"building\" as a general answer since it doesn't specify the type of residences it contains.",
    "I have identified that the situation described is most characteristic of an apartment, which relates to a shared living environment with a foyer filled with mailboxes.",
    "Now I can finalize that the best answer is D, since it specifically indicates a residential type that fits the description given."
