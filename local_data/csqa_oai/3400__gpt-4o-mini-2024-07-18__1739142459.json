  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the question to determine what is being asked. The question asks for the type of plant that is the tallest found on Earth.",
    "Next, I will consider the options provided: A: tree, B: orbit, C: pressure, D: space, E: solar system.",
    "Now, I will eliminate the choices that are not types of plants. Options B (orbit), C (pressure), D (space), and E (solar system) are not types of plants at all.",
    "This leaves me with only option A: tree. Trees are indeed a type of plant and are known for being the tallest plants on Earth.",
    "I will confirm that trees are the tallest type of plant. The tallest known tree species is the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), reaching heights of over 350 feet.",
    "Since none of the other options could possibly be correct, I will affirm that option A is the only viable answer concerning the tallest plants on Earth."
