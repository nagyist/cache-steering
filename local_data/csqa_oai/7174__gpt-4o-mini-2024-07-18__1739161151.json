  "query": "Question: Laddie owned a dentist office.  It was the only dentist office in the area.  Where might Laddie live?\n\nChoices:\nA: dental office\nB: town\nC: main street\nD: patient\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "Laddie owns a dentist office, which implies that he is likely to be situated in the vicinity of that office for operational purposes.",
    "Since this is the only dentist office in the area, it indicates that Laddie\u2019s residence is more likely to be within a reasonable distance from that office.",
    "Looking at the provided options, \"A: dental office\" is not a suitable residence but rather the place he owns.",
    "The option \"B: town\" suggests a broader area where Laddie could live, and it is common for business owners to reside within the same town as their business.",
    "\"Main street\" (option C) could also be a viable location for Laddie\u2019s residence if there's residential zoning nearby, but it is less definitive compared to option B.",
    "\"Patient\" (option D) does not fit as it refers to someone receiving treatment rather than a potential residence.",
    "\"Office building\" (option E) is also not a reasonable residence for Laddie as it is likely to be a commercial property, not a living space.",
    "Considering the commonality of business owners living in the same town as their business, and the lack of options that definitively suggest a residence, option B is the most appropriate."
