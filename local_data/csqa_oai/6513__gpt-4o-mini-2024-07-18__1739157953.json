  "steps": [
    "The question states that the man was bad at getting a job due to his poor references, indicating that he may lack a good reputation in the eyes of potential employers.",
    "To improve job prospects, the man would need to enhance the perception others have of him, which is tied to his references.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, I need to identify which one relates to improving reputation or the quality of references.",
    "Choice A \"famous\" is not directly linked to references; being famous does not necessarily improve job references.",
    "Choice B \"sufficient\" does not directly relate to references or reputation; it generally refers to adequacy or enough of something.",
    "Choice C \"benevolent\" implies kindness or goodwill, but this does not directly address the issue of job references.",
    "Choice D \"reputable\" pertains to having a good reputation, which directly relates to improving one\u2019s job references.",
    "Choice E \"first class\" suggests high quality but does not specifically address references or reputation in a direct way.",
    "Since the context of the question focuses on how to improve job acquisition through better references, \"reputable\" is the most appropriate choice."
