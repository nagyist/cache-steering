  "query": "Question: Where must one wear a white shoe?\n\nChoices:\nA: wedding\nB: tennis\nC: closet\nD: left foot\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one must wear a white shoe, so I need to consider settings or occasions related to wearing shoes.",
    "Option A states \"wedding.\" It is common to wear white shoes at weddings, especially for the bride or as part of a formal outfit.",
    "Option B states \"tennis.\" While white shoes are often associated with tennis, they are not specifically required.",
    "Option C states \"closet.\" This option does not pertain to wearing shoes; it refers to storage.",
    "Option D states \"left foot.\" Wearing shoes is a requirement for feet, but specifying the left foot does not constitute a meaningful answer regarding a \"place\" where one wears a white shoe.",
    "Option E states \"house.\" Shoes can be worn at home, but there is no specific requirement or association with white shoes in this setting.",
    "Comparing the options, the strongest association is with \"wedding\" where white shoes are traditionally worn by brides.",
    "The other options either do not require white shoes specifically or do not involve wearing them in a meaningful context.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable answer given the context is option A."
