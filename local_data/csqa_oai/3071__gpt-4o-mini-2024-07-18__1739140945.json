  "query": "Question: Where might be an odd place to put a washing machine?\n\nChoices:\nA: laundromat\nB: wash clothes\nC: cellar\nD: house\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the provided options and their typical associations with washing machines.",
    "A laundromat (option A) is a common place where washing machines are found, so it is not an odd place.",
    "\"Wash clothes\" (option B) is an activity and not a physical location, thus irrelevant to the question about placement.",
    "A cellar (option C) is less common for placing a washing machine compared to a garage or a house but can still accommodate one.",
    "A house (option D) is a standard location for a washing machine, making it not an odd place.",
    "A garage (option E) is also a common location where people might place a washing machine, especially for utility purposes.",
    "Among the options, the cellar stands out as less conventional compared to a house, garage, or laundromat.",
    "Since a cellar is not often designated for laundry appliances, it can be considered odd to place a washing machine there.",
    "Thus, the odd place to put a washing machine is most likely a cellar."
