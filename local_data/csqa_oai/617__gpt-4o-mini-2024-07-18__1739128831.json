  "query": "Question: The child really wanted to teach his grandpa to read, he thought it was wrong that he had spent his whole life what?\n\nChoices:\nA: ignore\nB: write\nC: learn new things\nD: illiterate\nE: having fun",
  "steps": [
    "The context mentions the child's desire to teach his grandpa to read, indicating that he perceives a deficiency in his grandpa\u2019s skills or knowledge.",
    "The phrase \"spent his whole life\" suggests a long duration during which the grandpa may not have engaged in learning, particularly in reading.",
    "Since the child wants to teach reading, the issue revolves around the grandpa's lack of literacy. Therefore, being \"illiterate\" aligns closely with the need for improvement in reading skills.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"illiterate\" (D) stands out, as it directly addresses the concern of lacking the ability to read, which the child finds problematic.",
    "Neither \"ignore\" (A) nor \"having fun\" (E) captures the essence of the grandfather's situation regarding reading skills.",
    "\"Write\" (B) is not relevant either, as the child is focused on teaching reading, not writing.",
    "\"Learn new things\" (C) could apply, but it is too broad and does not specifically address the core issue of reading.",
    "As a result, \"illiterate\" (D) is the most appropriate answer, as it directly reflects the challenge the grandpa faces and what the child wants to address."
