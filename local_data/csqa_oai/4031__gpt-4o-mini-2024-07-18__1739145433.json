  "query": "Question: The therapist told him he had to communicate his problems, he said to just be willing to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: write in code\nB: listen\nC: send email\nD: talk to people\nE: talk with people",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the therapist advised the individual to communicate his problems, which implies that the therapist is encouraging some form of expression or connection with others.",
    "The individual responded to the therapist's advice by mentioning something he would be willing to do in order to communicate his problems.",
    "Looking at the choices, we note that some responses suggest forms of communication (D and E both mention talking) while others are less directly related.",
    "Choices A (write in code) and C (send email) imply more indirect forms of communication, but may not align with the therapist's emphasis on communication.",
    "Choices D (talk to people) and E (talk with people) appear very similar and both indicate a willingness to engage in direct conversation.",
    "Since the question doesn't specify a preference for formality or informality in communication, both D and E could work; however, \"talk with people\" (E) suggests a more personal and engaging interaction compared to \"talk to people\" (D).",
    "Typically, in therapeutic contexts, communication involves sharing personal feelings and thoughts, which could suggest a preference for openness inherent in \"talk with people.\"",
    "Visually examining the grammatical structure, \"talk with people\" is grammatically complete and implies companionship or mutual exchange, which could resonate with the therapeutic context.",
    "Conclusively, \"talk with people\" (E) aligns closely with the required communication that is encouraged in therapy settings."
