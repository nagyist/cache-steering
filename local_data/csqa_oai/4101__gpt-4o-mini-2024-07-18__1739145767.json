  "query": "Question: Where would a marmot feel most confined?\n\nChoices:\nA: wood pile\nB: petting zoo\nC: wilderness\nD: northern hemisphere\nE: mountainous area",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what a marmot is and where it typically lives. Marmots are burrowing rodents that naturally inhabit mountainous areas and preference the wilderness where they have space to roam freely and dig burrows.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided in relation to physical confinement. A wood pile would have a lot of space, but it's not a typical habitat, so it might not be considered a confined space specifically for a marmot.",
    "A petting zoo, being an enclosed environment with limited space and human contact, could make a marmot feel confined as it's not a natural habitat and restricts its movement.",
    "When considering the wilderness, which is often vast and open, the marmot would not feel confined in this space as it is designed for their natural behavior.",
    "Looking at the northern hemisphere, it\u2019s a geographic region and does not inherently imply confinement or freedom, depending on the living conditions present there.",
    "A mountainous area is typically where marmots thrive, with plenty of space to move around, much like in the wilderness; thus, they wouldn't feel confined here either.",
    "Comparing the petting zoo with the other options, it becomes clearer that this environment is likely to restrict the freedom of a marmot due to enclosures and human interaction.",
    "Since the question is about where a marmot feels most confined, the petting zoo stands out as it is the only option that typically limits the animal's movement significantly.",
    "Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that a marmot would feel most confined in a petting zoo, which is designed to be a contained space for animals."
