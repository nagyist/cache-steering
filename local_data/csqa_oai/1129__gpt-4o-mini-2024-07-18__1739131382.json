  "query": "Question: If there is a source of light behind a tree what would expect to happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: provide shelter\nB: cast shadow\nC: branch out\nD: block wind\nE: fall down",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the scenario where a source of light is positioned behind a tree.",
    "A source of light, such as the sun, can create a distinct interaction between the light and the tree.",
    "The tree will obstruct the light in a certain area, causing a lack of light on the side facing away from the light source.",
    "This obstruction of light creates a shadow on the ground or any surface behind the tree.",
    "I should evaluate the choices to see if they align with the effect of having light behind the tree.",
    "Option A \"provide shelter\" seems to refer more to protection from rain or elements rather than dealing with light.",
    "Option B \"cast shadow\" corresponds precisely with the presence of light and an object (the tree) blocking it, which would create a shadow.",
    "Option C \"branch out\" does not relate to the scenario of light and trees in this context.",
    "Option D \"block wind\" again does not pertain directly to the concept of light; it refers more to physical protection from the wind.",
    "Option E \"fall down\" is unrelated to the light and shadow interaction; it's more about stability of the tree.",
    "After evaluating all options, the only one that directly results from the light being positioned behind the tree is \"cast shadow.\""
