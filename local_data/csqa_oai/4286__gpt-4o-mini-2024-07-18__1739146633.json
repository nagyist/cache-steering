  "query": "Question: Simon put crayon pictures on the wall of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: labyrinth\nC: zoo\nD: art show\nE: prison",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context in which crayon pictures would typically be put on a wall. Crayon pictures are often associated with children and creativity.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the choices given. A classroom is a place where children often create art, so it makes sense for Simon to put crayon pictures on the wall there.",
    "A labyrinth is typically a complicated maze rather than a place where art would be displayed, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "A zoo primarily features animals, and while there could be activities for children, it doesn\u2019t directly relate to Simon's action of putting crayon pictures on a wall.",
    "An art show might feature various forms of art, including crayon pictures, but it is usually a formal event rather than a typical place for displaying children's art.",
    "A prison would not be a suitable or relevant place for crayon pictures, as the environment is typically associated with restrictions and seriousness, not children\u2019s art.",
    "Given the analysis, the classroom stands out as the most logical context for Simon to display crayon pictures, which align with children's activities.",
    "I will double-check the suitability of each option against the primary activity (putting crayon pictures on a wall) and reaffirm that the classroom is specifically designed for such purposes.",
    "I can conclude that the options other than classroom do not fit well with the context, further confirming that option A is the best fit."
