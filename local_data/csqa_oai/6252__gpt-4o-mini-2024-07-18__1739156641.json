  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of a telephone, which is primarily used for communication.",
    "Next, think about the typical places where a telephone would be used and stored.",
    "A hospital (choice A) might use telephones, but it isn't a personal space to typically place a newly purchased phone.",
    "A party (choice B) is a temporary social gathering, not a lasting place to put the telephone.",
    "A desktop (choice C) is a common and practical location for personal phones, especially after purchase, as it's where many people use their computers and other devices.",
    "A hotel (choice D) could have telephones, but it is not a space where you would typically store your own telephone after buying it unless you\u2019re staying there temporarily.",
    "Wires (choice E) are necessary for telephones in some instances, but they do not serve as a location to put a telephone.",
    "After evaluating all the options, it becomes clear that putting a telephone on a desktop (choice C) is the most logical choice."
