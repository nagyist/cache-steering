  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location of an apple tree in relation to Nelson Mandela's grave site.",
    "Nelson Mandela is buried in Qunu, South Africa.",
    "To determine the answer, we need to consider where an apple tree might be located in connection to his grave in Qunu.",
    "The options provided include abstract concepts (A, B, D, E) and a specific location (C).",
    "Since apple trees are typically found in orchards or agricultural areas, it is reasonable to think about South Africa as a potential location for them.",
    "The only geographic option provided in the choices is C: South Africa.",
    "The term \"fields\" could imply areas where apple trees might grow, but it does not specify a location relevant to Mandela's grave.",
    "After evaluating the options, it is clear that apple trees could indeed exist in the country where Mandela is buried, making C the most viable answer.",
    "Other options do not logically fit the context of locating something in proximity to a grave site; they are either vague or unrelated."
