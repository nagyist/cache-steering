  "steps": [
    "To determine where people are likely to be joyous, I need to consider environments that typically foster happiness and celebration.",
    "A convention is often more focused on business, networking, or specific interests rather than joy, so it may not be the best choice for a joyous atmosphere.",
    "A supermarket is primarily a place for shopping and might evoke feelings of stress or impatience rather than joy, especially during busy times.",
    "A theater can evoke joy through performances and entertainment; however, that joy is usually tied to the specific event rather than a general atmosphere.",
    "A wedding is generally a significant celebration where people gather to celebrate love and union, leading to widespread joy and happiness.",
    "A church can be a place of joy, particularly in the context of worship and community, but it may also have a more solemn or spiritual atmosphere at times.",
    "Evaluating all options, a wedding stands out as a clear and universal setting for joy, as it specifically celebrates an important life event with family and friends.",
    "While a theater and church can also bring joy, the context of a wedding is typically associated with the highest levels of happiness due to its celebratory nature."
