  "query": "Question: The forward comes before an essay, what comes at the end of it?\n\nChoices:\nA: last word\nB: afterword\nC: epilogue\nD: conclusion\nE: page numbers",
  "steps": [
    "An essay typically includes various components in a specific order; the forward is usually an introductory section, while we need to identify what comes at the end.",
    "The common sections at the end of an essay include a conclusion, references, or additional commentary, such as an epilogue or afterword.",
    "A conclusion summarizes the main points of the essay and often provides closure to the arguments presented.",
    "An epilogue, on the other hand, may provide additional information or reflections about the topic after the main content has ended, though it's not as commonly used in standard essays.",
    "An afterword is similar to an epilogue but usually consists of the author's remarks at the end of the work, rather than focusing on content summarization.",
    "Given the traditional structure of an essay, the most standard component that appears at the end is the conclusion, as it neatly wraps up the essay.",
    "Comparing our options: \"B: afterword\" and \"C: epilogue\" may suggest additional content but are not standard endings for an essay in a comprehensive academic context.",
    "Thus, analyzing closely, \"D: conclusion\" directly aligns with the expected structure of an essay.",
    "Determining from the question, the forward indeed precedes the main body, and from established conventions, a conclusion is expected at the end, confirming my reasoning."
