    "The question asks for an object that is better than a paper clip for holding paperwork together specifically in a hospital desk drawer.",
    "A paper clip functions well for holding a few sheets together but might not be ideal for larger stacks of paperwork.",
    "Let's analyze the options: \nA: A file folder is designed to hold multiple sheets of paper securely and keep them organized.",
    "B: A staple can bind sheets together effectively; however, it can make it difficult to remove or reorder papers without damage.",
    "C: A desk drawer is a storage solution but does not serve as a mechanism to hold paperwork together.",
    "D: A plastic holder can be used to group papers together and allows for easy access and removal.",
    "E: The term \"hospital\" is not relevant as it refers to a place rather than an item.",
    "Comparing the remaining options: \n- A file folder is versatile and can keep documents organized while being easy to access.\n- A staple is effective but has limitations on reusability.\n- A plastic holder provides easy access but might not be as durable as a file folder.",
    "Overall, a file folder seems to provide the best combination of organization, ease of use, and functionality for holding paperwork together in a hospital setting."
