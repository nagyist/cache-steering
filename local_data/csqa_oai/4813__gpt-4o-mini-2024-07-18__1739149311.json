  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a liquid, so I can eliminate options that are not liquids.",
    "Options B (door), D (supermarket), and E (cabinet) are not liquids.",
    "This leaves me with options A (juice) as the only potential liquid.",
    "I know that juice is indeed a liquid that can be stored in large containers.",
    "To verify, I recall that juice is typically found in large cartons or jugs for storage and distribution.",
    "Since the question specifies that it can be kept in a large container, and I have established that juice can be stored this way, it is a valid answer."
