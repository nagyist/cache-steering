  "steps": [
    "The question asks where you could find plumbing that could help you if you are thirsty. This implies we need to find a location related to water access, as thirst is associated with needing water.",
    "Let's analyze the options one by one to see which one provides access to water.",
    "Option A: \"show\" does not seem relevant, as it doesn\u2019t deal with plumbing or access to water.",
    "Option B: \"oil refineries\" is also unrelated because they deal with oil, not with providing drinking water.",
    "Option C: \"bathroom\" may have plumbing, but it generally does not provide a source of drinking water easily accessible for thirst.",
    "Option D: \"hardware store\" is primarily a place to buy tools and supplies for repairs, though it may have plumbing supplies, it doesn\u2019t directly offer drinking water.",
    "Option E: \"water fountain\" is a direct source of water and is designed specifically for drinking.",
    "Since the goal is to find a place that provides access to water when thirsty, and the \"water fountain\" is explicitly built for that purpose, it stands out as the best option.",
    "The other options do not provide a direct source of drinking water, and thus are less appropriate for meeting the need suggested in the question."
