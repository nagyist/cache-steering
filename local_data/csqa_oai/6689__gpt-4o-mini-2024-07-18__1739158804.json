    "First, I need to interpret the question, which asks about how to carry a pencil in a shirt.",
    "The options provided are A: cup, B: desk drawer, C: desktop, D: pocket, and E: university.",
    "Next, I evaluate each option to see if it relates to carrying a pencil in a shirt.",
    "Option A (cup) is not a place on a shirt and doesn't relate to carrying a pencil.",
    "Option B (desk drawer) is also not a part of a shirt.",
    "Option C (desktop) refers to a flat surface and is not relevant to a shirt.",
    "Option D (pocket) makes sense because a pocket is a common feature of shirts designed to carry items like pencils.",
    "Option E (university) does not relate to wearing a shirt or carrying a pencil.",
    "Now that I have evaluated all options, option D clearly stands out as it directly answers the question."
