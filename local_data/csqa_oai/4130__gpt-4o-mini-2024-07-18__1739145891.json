  "query": "Question: She was taken aback by his real personality, what were other past boyfriends like to her?\n\nChoices:\nA: a figment of her imagination\nB: fictitious\nC: artificial\nD: fiction\nE: imaginary",
  "steps": [
    "First, the phrase \"taken aback by his real personality\" suggests that the woman had previous expectations or experiences with boyfriends that did not match up to this new boyfriend's true self.",
    "Considering the choices, they all imply some form of being unreal or not genuine.",
    "Choice A, \"a figment of her imagination,\" implies that her past boyfriends were never real at all, which is unlikely to be the intent of the sentence.",
    "Choice B, \"fictitious,\" similarly suggests that the boyfriends were also not real, which doesn't align with her memory of having past relationships.",
    "Choice C, \"artificial,\" implies that her past boyfriends may have seemed real but were lacking in authenticity or depth, which aligns with her feelings of being taken aback.",
    "Choice D, \"fiction,\" suggests that her past relationships were stories rather than reality, which again does not match the notion of having had real experiences.",
    "Choice E, \"imaginary,\" similarly suggests that her past boyfriends were not real at all, which is also unlikely given that she's comparing them to her current experience.",
    "Among the options, \"artificial\" (C) best captures the idea that her past boyfriends may have seemed real but did not genuinely reflect their true selves, leading her to be surprised by the authenticity of her current boyfriend."
