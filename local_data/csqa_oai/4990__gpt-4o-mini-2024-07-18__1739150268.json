  "query": "Question: The business man had a big meeting that day, but his small child had gotten marker all over his fancy leather what?\n\nChoices:\nA: drawer\nB: desk\nC: briefcase\nD: medium\nE: office supply store",
  "steps": [
    "The business man is preparing for an important meeting, which suggests he has a briefcase to hold important documents or materials.",
    "A child getting marker all over something suggests it is an item the father would care about and use in a formal setting.",
    "A \"fancy leather\" item indicates a product that shows professionalism and importance, which aligns with items like a briefcase or possibly a leather notebook.",
    "Although a leather drawer or desk could be possible, the phrasing of the question points more towards a personal item the business man carries, rather than furniture in his office.",
    "The choices available include \"briefcase,\" which is specifically made for carrying documents.",
    "The other choices, \"drawer\" and \"desk,\" are less likely to be carried or covered in marker by a child\u2014these are static items in an office.",
    "The option \"medium\" is vague and irrelevant in this context, while \"office supply store\" does not fit the situation of a single item being marked up.",
    "Given the context and the connection to the business man and the importance of the meeting likely correlating with the need for a briefcase, this is the most logical choice.",
    "Thus, \"briefcase\" is the best fit for being both a leather item and something a business man would possess."
