  "query": "Question: What would you put in a container?\n\nChoices:\nA: food\nB: cargo ship\nC: refrigerator\nD: closet garage\nE: port",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what you would put in a container, suggesting various items or locations where something can be stored or contained.",
    "Analyzing the options: \nA: food - This is something that can definitely be put into a container for storage or transport.",
    "B: cargo ship - A cargo ship is a mode of transportation and not something that can be put into a container.",
    "C: refrigerator - A refrigerator is an appliance that holds items but is not itself a container that you put things in; it can hold food and beverages but isn't used in the same context as the question.",
    "D: closet garage - Similar to the refrigerator, this refers to a space for storage, but isn't a container in which to place other items.",
    "E: port - A port is a geographic location used for docking ships, also not something to put contents in.",
    "Based on the analysis, option A (food) is the only answer that directly pertains to something you would place into a container."
