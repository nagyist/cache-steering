  "query": "Question: Where is a master control likely to be in a technology company?\n\nChoices:\nA: main office\nB: center\nC: beach\nD: manufacturing plant\nE: basement",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a master control typically refers to in a technology company. It often manages operations or systems and could indicate a central location for oversight.",
    "Next, considering the options, I see that \"main office\" (A) is a plausible location for management and control systems, as it usually houses administrative and decision-making functions.",
    "Then, I evaluate \"center\" (B), but it's vague. It could refer to a central operations center, which could be relevant, but it's less specific than \"main office.\"",
    "After that, looking at \"beach\" (C), it doesn\u2019t fit logically, as a beach does not align with any function associated with master control in a tech context.",
    "Next, I consider \"manufacturing plant\" (D). While it could have some level of control systems, it is usually focused on production processes rather than overall technological control.",
    "I also analyze \"basement\" (E). Typically, basements are not associated with strategic controls or management in a tech company. They're often used for storage or utilities.",
    "Now, having compared all options, \"main office\" stands out as the most appropriate and likely location for a master control within a technology company.",
    "Finally, I double-check if any other option might work better. \"Manufacturing plant\" and \"center\" are functional locations but focus on different operational aspects and do not specifically denote \"master control\"."
