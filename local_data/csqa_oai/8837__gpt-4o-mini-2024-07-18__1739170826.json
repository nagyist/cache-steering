  "query": "Question: What state has a county called columbia and is the furthest in the direction that the sun sets?\n\nChoices:\nA: tennessee\nB: missouri\nC: washington\nD: canada\nE: south carolina",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where the Columbia Counties are located. Columbia County exists in several states, including Tennessee, Missouri, Washington, and South Carolina.",
    "Next, I will check the location of Columbia County in each state. Columbia County, Tennessee is in the western part of the state; Columbia County, Missouri is near the central-west; Columbia County, Washington is in the southeast part of the state; and Columbia County, South Carolina is in the central part of the state.",
    "It's important to determine which of these counties is located the furthest west, as the question asks for the direction where the sun sets (i.e., west). Washington generally has further west locations compared to the other states mentioned due to its geographical positioning.",
    "Between the Columbia Counties I've looked at, Columbia County, Washington, is indeed located further west than the other Columbia Counties found in Tennessee, Missouri, and South Carolina.",
    "Now, I will verify again if there's a Columbia County in Canada that's relevant to this question. Canada has its own provinces, and while there may be regions referring to Columbia, no specific \"Columbia County\" in the same context is in Canada.",
    "Based on my findings, Columbia County in Washington is in the farthest west position of all options considered.",
    "Thus, having validated the counties and location relevance, the answer to which state has a Columbia County that's the furthest in the direction that the sun sets is Washington."
