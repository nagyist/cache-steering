  "query": "Question: A divider is used to create cubicles in what space?\n\nChoices:\nA: notebook\nB: kitchen\nC: office suite\nD: living room\nE: math class",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what a divider is typically used for. A divider is a structure that separates spaces or creates boundaries.",
    "Next, we note where dividers are commonly found. They are often used in offices to create individual workspaces or cubicles.",
    "Now, let's examine each option to see which is most relevant to the use of dividers.",
    "Option A, \"notebook,\" is not a space where dividers are used. A notebook is a flat item and does not require partitioning.",
    "Option B, \"kitchen,\" could have dividers in terms of layout, but it is not a common application compared to the office setting.",
    "Option C, \"office suite,\" is specifically designed with the intention of creating separate work areas using dividers or cubicles, making it the most fitting option.",
    "Option D, \"living room,\" may have furniture to separate spaces, but it's not typical to use dividers as a primary method to create cubicles in this context.",
    "Option E, \"math class,\" might use partitions for students to work independently, but this is less applicable than an office suite where dividers are standard.",
    "After evaluating all options, it's clear that option C closely aligns with the purpose of a divider in creating cubicles."
