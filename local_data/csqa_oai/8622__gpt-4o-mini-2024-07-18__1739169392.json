  "steps": [
    "The question states that the shark is feeling cold, which implies that it is in an environment that is not warm or comfortable for it.",
    "The provided choices include various locations or environments where sharks might be found, some of which are warmer than others.",
    "Option A, \"ocean,\" is too broad and does not specifically indicate a warmer environment.",
    "Option B, \"tropical waters,\" specifically refers to warmer regions of the ocean, which would be more suitable for a shark seeking warmth.",
    "Option C, \"sea world,\" typically refers to an aquarium setting, which might not be a natural choice for a shark looking for a warmer environment.",
    "Option D, \"tomales bay,\" is a specific geographic location, but it is not known for being warm and may not provide the warmth the shark seeks.",
    "Option E, \"great oceans,\" is again broad and does not specify warmer waters.",
    "Given the information, searching for \"tropical waters\" (Option B) appears to be the most logical choice for a shark trying to warm up."
