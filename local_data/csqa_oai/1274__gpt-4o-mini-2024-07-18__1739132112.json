  "query": "Question: The child wanted his cereal bowl and knew he could reach it, where would he find it?\n\nChoices:\nA: breakfast food\nB: china shop\nC: kitchen cabinet\nD: refrigerator\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider where cereal is typically stored in a house.",
    "Cereals are commonly found in the kitchen, specifically in places designated for food storage.",
    "Next, we evaluate the provided options to identify which of them are related to the storage of cereal.",
    "Option A (breakfast food) is too general and does not specify where to find a cereal bowl.",
    "Option B (china shop) does not relate to the home environment where the child would find a cereal bowl.",
    "Option C (kitchen cabinet) is a common place where dishes, including cereal bowls, are stored.",
    "Option D (refrigerator) is unlikely since a cereal bowl is not typically stored there.",
    "Finally, option E (cupboard) is also a plausible place for cereal bowls but can be considered synonymous with a kitchen cabinet in common use.",
    "Since both kitchen cabinet and cupboard are potential storage places, we can note that kitchen cabinets are usually designated for dishes and bowls specifically, whereas cupboards may have a broader use.",
    "If we need to select the most direct answer based on typical nomenclature, option C (kitchen cabinet) explicitly relates to the child accessing a cereal bowl without ambiguity."
