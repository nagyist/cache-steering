  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a spouse might do upon waking up early.",
    "The choices provided are actions that involve either going to bed or waking up.",
    "Choice A (go to bed early) does not relate to what a spouse would do after waking up early; rather, it speaks to a prior action.",
    "Choice B (go sleep early) also refers to a past action and doesn't fit the context.",
    "Choice D (get to bed early) is similar to A and B; it pertains to going to bed, which again is a past action and isn't relevant to just waking up early.",
    "Choice E (wake up) is simply a restatement of the scenario and does not depict an action taken after waking up early.",
    "Choice C (ask spouse to wake) indicates an action that a spouse might take after waking up early, which involves interaction and is relevant to the scenario.",
    "Upon evaluating all the choices, choice C makes the most sense in the context of the question."
