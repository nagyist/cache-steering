  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the context of the question, which mentions that Frankie found a bone in her \"good.\" There seems to be a typographical error here, and it probably meant to say \"garden\" or something similar related to where a bone might be found.",
    "Next, we consider what types of bones could typically be found in a garden. A bone could belong to a variety of animals or could be related to human remains.",
    "Looking at the options provided, the choices are familial (A: father), anatomical (B: arm), animal (C: cow), a place (D: museum), and human-related (E: human body).",
    "The option A (father) is not a type of bone. Option B (arm) refers to a human limb but it doesn\u2019t match well with the idea of finding a bone in a garden. Option D (museum) also does not relate to finding a bone.",
    "I am left with options C (cow) and E (human body). Animals often leave bones in gardens, especially if it is likely that they may have inhabited the area, or perhaps the bone is part of a burial site or other related context for human remains.",
    "Considering everyday occurrences, it makes more sense for Frankie to have found an animal bone in her garden, as opposed to the possibility of it being a human bone, which is less common and may imply a more serious context.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer regarding a bone typically found in such a setting, the wild or nature, would be related to livestock or wildlife more than to humans.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the bone most likely belonged to a cow since they are commonly found in rural areas or gardens where animals might roam."
