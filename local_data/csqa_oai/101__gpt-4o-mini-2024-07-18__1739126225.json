  "query": "Question: At the end of your meal what will a waiter do?\n\nChoices:\nA: serve food\nB: eat\nC: set table\nD: serve meal\nE: present bill",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what a waiter does at the end of a meal, we should consider the common practices in a dining setting.",
    "Typically, the conclusion of a meal is marked by customers finishing their food and preparing to leave the table.",
    "At this point, the waiter\u2019s role shifts to clearing the table and managing the payment process.",
    "The options presented include serving food, eating, setting the table, serving the meal, and presenting the bill.",
    "Serving food (A) and serving the meal (D) are actions that occur at the beginning or during the meal, not at the conclusion.",
    "Eating (B) is not an action that a waiter would take, as their role is to serve customers, not to partake in the meal.",
    "Setting the table (C) usually happens before the meal rather than at the end, so it\u2019s unlikely to be the correct answer.",
    "Presenting the bill (E) is a common practice right after the meal is finished, indicating it's time for the customers to pay and leave.",
    "Thus, the action that most accurately represents what a waiter does at the end of a meal is to present the bill."
