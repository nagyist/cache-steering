  "query": "Question: What might happen to an outfit that cleaning clothes would be useless?\n\nChoices:\nA: clean clothes\nB: wrinkles\nC: sanitation\nD: ruined\nE: bleached",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what could occur to an outfit if cleaning clothes is deemed useless.",
    "If cleaning clothes is useless, it implies that the clothes cannot be restored to a clean state.",
    "Without the ability to clean, dirt, stains, and odors would accumulate on the outfit over time.",
    "Accumulated dirt and stains would likely lead to the outfit appearing unkempt or undesirable.",
    "Wrinkles could develop if the material is not properly maintained, but that is not a direct result of being unable to clean it.",
    "The term \"sanitation\" suggests cleanliness and the absence of germs, which contradicts the idea of the clothes being unable to be cleaned.",
    "If the clothes cannot be cleaned, there is a strong likelihood that they would become ruined due to the inability to address spills, stains, and general wear over time.",
    "Bleaching typically would require cleaning to achieve a desired effect, which would not be possible if cleaning is useless.",
    "Given these considerations, \"ruined\" is the most relevant consequence based on the inability to clean the outfit."
