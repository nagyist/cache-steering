  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that John runs a corner shop in an area known for its Vikings. This suggests a cultural or historical connection to the Vikings.",
    "The region most commonly associated with Vikings in the United States is Minnesota, which has a significant population of individuals with Scandinavian heritage and is often referred to as a place embracing its Viking roots.",
    "The other choices do not have a direct connection to Vikings. California (A) is not known for Vikings; England (B) is historically related but is not within the American Midwest; \"street corner\" (C) and \"corner of two streets\" (D) refer to physical locations rather than regional identities.",
    "Given these deductions, the only option that fits both the geographic and cultural context of the question is Minnesota (E)."
