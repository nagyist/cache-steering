  "query": "Question: What is a sheep called during its first year of life?\n\nChoices:\nA: baby\nB: ram\nC: wolf\nD: done\nE: lamb",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying what a young sheep is referred to during its first year of life.",
    "Know that male sheep are called rams, but this term typically applies to mature sheep rather than the young.",
    "Consider the term \"lamb,\" which is commonly used to refer to a sheep during its early life stage.",
    "Assess the other options: \"baby\" is a generic term that could apply but is not specific to sheep; \"wolf\" is unrelated; \"done\" does not refer to any animal in this context.",
    "Since the question specifically asks about the first year, confirm that \"lamb\" is the recognized term for a young sheep until it reaches maturity.",
    "Check available resources or veterinary texts to validate that \"lamb\" is indeed the correct term for a sheep in its first year of life.",
    "Having analyzed all choices, it is clear that the best option is \"lamb.\""
