  "query": "Question: Sarah loved birds, but when they flew overhead she was covered with what?\n\nChoices:\nA: roof\nB: sky\nC: grieve\nD: poop\nE: molt",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the context of the question. Sarah loved birds, which suggests she enjoys observing them.",
    "Next, I consider what happens when birds fly overhead. They might create some kind of environmental impact.",
    "I evaluate the answer choices one by one. Option A (roof) doesn\u2019t relate to what birds would do to her personally.",
    "Option B (sky) is irrelevant as it describes a space rather than something that could cover her.",
    "Option C (grieve) might pertain to some emotional context, but it doesn't align with the physical act of birds flying overhead.",
    "Option D (poop) is a known occurrence when birds are present in the sky, as they can sometimes relieve themselves while flying.",
    "Option E (molt) refers to the process where birds lose old feathers, which is not applicable to being covered by something while they are flying overhead.",
    "Of the choices analyzed, D (poop) clearly makes sense because it is a humorous and common scenario when birds fly, which could lead to someone being covered in it.",
    "I cross-check none of the other answers provide a logical response to the context of the question compared to option D."
