  "query": "Question: If a phoneless person needs to make a call from a public phone, where might they find one?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: desktop\nC: neighbor's house\nD: movie theater\nE: rest area",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine locations where a public phone could typically be found.",
    "Public phones are generally installed in locations that see a lot of foot traffic or where people may need to make calls unexpectedly.",
    "Let's evaluate each option based on the likelihood of finding a public phone.",
    "A: An office usually has phones for internal use but may not have public phones available for public use.",
    "B: A desktop refers to a setup for personal computers and is not related to public phones at all.",
    "C: A neighbor's house might have a phone, but it would not be a public phone; it's private property.",
    "D: A movie theater might have a phone for employees, but it\u2019s unlikely to have a public phone accessible to everyone.",
    "E: A rest area on highways or public parks often contains public phones for travelers to use, making it a viable option.",
    "After evaluating all options, option E seems to be the best choice as it aligns with the common locations for public phones."
