  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the situation. Johnny's goal is to get money from his brother.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided to determine which aligns with Johnny's intention to get money.",
    "Option A (employment) does not suggest a direct method for getting money from his brother.",
    "Option B (do work) could imply he is performing a task, but it does not specifically indicate that he is getting money from his brother.",
    "Option C (threaten) might imply a confrontation, but it does not suggest a friendly or positive approach to getting money.",
    "Option D (work for) implies a job or responsibility, which might not directly indicate that he aims to only get money from his brother.",
