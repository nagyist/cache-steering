  "query": "Question: Where can you find a bar before traveling a long distance?\n\nChoices:\nA: las vegas\nB: public house\nC: airport\nD: restaurant\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the location before a long-distance travel scenario. Typically, this would be at transportation hubs, primarily airports or train stations.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided in relation to travel. Options like \"airport\" and \"public house\" are commonly found before travel.",
    "Think about where travelers usually relax before embarking on a journey. Airports often have bars available for passengers to unwind.",
    "Check the other options: \"las vegas,\" while a city associated with entertainment, is not a place you would find a bar specifically before traveling.",
    "Next, consider \"public house\" as it is a bar or tavern, but it may not be directly linked to a specific point of travel.",
    "Evaluate \"restaurant\" \u2013 while some restaurants have bars, they are not typically associated with travel as much as airports.",
    "Finally, \"michigan\" is a state and does not specifically imply a location where a bar can be found before traveling.",
    "Conclusion: The most logical place where one can consistently find a bar before embarking on a long-distance journey is at an airport."
