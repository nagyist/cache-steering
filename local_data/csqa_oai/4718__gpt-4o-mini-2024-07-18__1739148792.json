  "query": "Question: Where could you see a mammoth that is not real?\n\nChoices:\nA: stone age\nB: ice age\nC: ancient history\nD: museum of natural history\nE: storybook",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what is meant by seeing a mammoth that is not real. This typically implies a representation rather than a living specimen.",
    "Next, I evaluate the options provided. The stone age and ice age refer to specific periods in history during which mammoths existed; however, these are historical epochs and do not represent non-real instances of mammoths.",
    "Ancient history, similarly to the previous two, pertains to the time period associated with known historical events and does not indicate a fictional representation of mammoths.",
    "A museum of natural history would be a place where one can see the skeletal remains or reconstructions of mammoths. While the specimens themselves are real, the context of their presentation may allow for artistic interpretations but they are still grounded in reality.",
    "In contrast, a storybook is a medium that allows for fictional or imaginative depictions, where mammoths may be portrayed in non-literal, magical, or child-friendly contexts, which means they can \"exist\" without being real.",
    "Therefore, among the given options, the storybook is the only scenario that allows for a non-real depiction of a mammoth.",
    "I can conclude that while I can see representations of mammoths in the museum, they are still based on real specimens. In a storybook, the depiction of a mammoth is purely fictional and does not correspond to a real creature."
