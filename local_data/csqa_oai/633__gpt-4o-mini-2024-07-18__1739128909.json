  "steps": [
    "The question specifies a location in the home where one would store birth control pills near toothpaste.",
    "Toothpaste is commonly stored in the bathroom, which suggests that the storage location for birth control pills should also be in the bathroom.",
    "The most appropriate place in the bathroom for storing birth control pills is the medicine cabinet.",
    "Other options, such as a chemist's shop or drug store, are not suitable because they do not reside in the home.",
    "The kitchen is generally not a place where one would store personal medications like birth control pills, and the bedroom is also less practical compared to the bathroom.",
    "Therefore, the best answer aligns with where toothpaste is typically stored, which is the medicine cabinet, making it a logical choice for storing birth control pills as well."
