  "query": "Question: Brother Mike escaped the collapsed mine.  Ever since, he was afraid of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: be imprisoned\nB: captured\nC: stay in\nD: being caught\nE: being trapped",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes Brother Mike escaping a collapsed mine, which implies he experienced a situation of being trapped underground or confined.",
    "Given this context, it's logical to conclude that the primary fear resulting from such a traumatic experience would be related to entrapment.",
    "The keywords in the answer choices to focus on are all related to some form of confinement or capture.",
    "Choice A (\"be imprisoned\") suggests a legal or punitive confinement, which may not align with the emotional trauma of escaping a mine.",
    "Choice B (\"captured\") implies being taken by someone, which doesn\u2019t directly relate to the fear of physical confinement.",
    "Choice C (\"stay in\") is vague and does not specifically address a fear related to the traumatic experience of being trapped.",
    "Choice D (\"being caught\") suggests a fear of being apprehended, which again doesn't align closely with the context of being trapped in a mine.",
    "Choice E (\"being trapped\") directly addresses the fear of confinement or being unable to escape, which is fundamental to the traumatic experience of a collapse.",
    "Based on this analysis, the choice that effectively captures Brother Mike's fear post-escape from the mine is being trapped, as it reflects his ordeal and the resulting anxiety it would instill."
