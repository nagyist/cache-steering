  "query": "Question: What is someone looking for in a new mattress when returning one that had lots of rigidity?\n\nChoices:\nA: ductility\nB: empity\nC: softness\nD: flexibility\nE: malleability",
  "steps": [
    "The person is returning a mattress that had \"lots of rigidity,\" which implies that it was very firm and possibly uncomfortable. They are likely looking for a different type of mattress that offers a contrasting feel.",
    "The term \"rigidity\" suggests that the mattress was not very yielding or adaptable to pressure, meaning it lacked softness. The individual is likely seeking a mattress that will provide more comfort and ease while lying on it.",
    "Evaluating the options provided, we can see that \"softness\" is most directly related to the opposite quality of rigidity. A soft mattress would contour more to the body than a rigid one.",
    "\"Ductility\" and \"malleability\" are terms that refer to the ability of materials to deform under stress. While these terms imply flexibility in a material sense, they do not specifically address the comfort level of a mattress.",
    "\"Flexibility\" can also refer to the ability of a mattress to bend or accommodate weight without breaking, but it still does not directly imply a soft surface that would be desirable for comfort.",
    "\"Empity\" is not a relevant term in this context and seems to be a typographical error or non-word, so it can be disregarded.",
    "Comparing \"softness\" and \"flexibility,\" the term \"softness\" is more focused on the surface feel of the mattress, which is likely what the individual is seeking to replace their rigid mattress with.",
    "Given that the main purpose of returning the mattress was due to its uncomfortable rigidity, the final conclusion is that the person is looking for a mattress that offers softness for better comfort."
