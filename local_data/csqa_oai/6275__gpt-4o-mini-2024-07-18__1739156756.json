  "query": "Question: What happens when snow on a mountain becomes heavy?\n\nChoices:\nA: build really neat fort\nB: avalanches\nC: shovelling\nD: eat cake\nE: blizzard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens to snow when it accumulates heavily on a mountain. Heavy snow can increase pressure and destabilize the snowpack.",
    "Next, analyze how snow stability is affected. An unstable snowpack can slide down the mountain slope, which leads to a potential avalanche.",
    "Now, consider the other options in the context of heavy snow. Building a fort (A) is a possible activity, but it is not a consequence of heavy snow.",
    "Next, shovelling (C) could be a lot of work, but it is more relevant in urban areas or residential places rather than directly relevant to heavy snow on a mountain.",
    "Eating cake (D) is entirely unrelated to heavy snow; it's an activity that doesn't directly connect to mountain conditions.",
    "Finally, a blizzard (E) refers to a severe snowstorm but is not a direct result of heavy snow accumulating on a mountain.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most direct and relevant consequence of heavy snow on a mountain is the risk of avalanches (B)."
