  "query": "Question: Despite this name out front you will also find beer and wine where too?\n\nChoices:\nA: liquor store\nB: texas\nC: art show\nD: basement\nE: spaghetti sauce",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which revolves around the presence of beer and wine.",
    "Evaluate the options provided to see if they are places or items where beer and wine might typically be found.",
    "Consider option A: \"liquor store\" - liquor stores typically carry beer and wine, making this a viable choice.",
    "Next, consider option B: \"texas\" - while Texas has places that sell beer and wine, it is not a specific location for the purchase of beer and wine.",
    "Then, evaluate option C: \"art show\" - art shows are not typically associated with beer and wine being available, so this is not likely.",
    "Now look at option D: \"basement\" - a basement is a physical space but does not directly imply a location that sells or has beer and wine available for the general public.",
    "Lastly, assess option E: \"spaghetti sauce\" - this is a food item, not a location for beer and wine, hence not applicable.",
    "The most appropriate answer, based on the reasoning, is clearly option A: \"liquor store\" as it directly relates to the question about beer and wine being found."
