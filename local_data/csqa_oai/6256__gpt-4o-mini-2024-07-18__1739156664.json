  "query": "Question: If you're very religious and end up stopping being married to your spouse, what may you think of your decision?\n\nChoices:\nA: depression\nB: grief\nC: happy\nD: relief\nE: wrong",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the emotional implications of ending a marriage for someone who is very religious. Marriage is often viewed in many religions as a sacred bond, and ending it can lead to feelings of conflict with one's beliefs.",
    "Next, analyze how such an individual might feel in relation to their faith after the decision to separate. They may experience inner turmoil if they believe that divorce contradicts their religious values.",
    "Then, consider the possibility of feeling depressed. It's common to feel a sense of loss or sadness after the end of a significant relationship, especially one that is esteemed in religious contexts.",
    "Additionally, grief is also a strong possibility as it is a natural response to losing a partner, and it can manifest alongside feelings of sadness and mourning for the relationship.",
    "Now, evaluate the option of feeling happy. While some might find freedom in their decision, it's likely that a very religious person would struggle to reconcile feelings of happiness with a choice they perceive as wrong.",
    "Next, consider the feeling of relief. There might be scenarios where if the marriage was strained or unhappy, the individual could feel relief post-separation. Yet, this might be less likely given their religious convictions.",
    "Examine the option of feeling wrong. Given the context of being very religious, the decision to end a marriage could be interpreted as a failure or a wrong choice, creating guilt or remorse.",
    "Weigh the emotional complexities. The most probable emotions are likely a blend of grief, depression, and a sense of being wrong, given the cultural and personal implications of divorce in many religious practices.",
    "Finally, based on the most probable feelings of a very religious person who has ended a marriage, the option that encapsulates the conflicted feelings about the decision is likely to be \"wrong.\""
