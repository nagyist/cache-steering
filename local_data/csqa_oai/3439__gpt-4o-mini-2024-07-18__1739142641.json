  "query": "Question: James thought that the desk was built with solidity, but when he rapped on it he could hear what?\n\nChoices:\nA: openness\nB: instability\nC: hollowness\nD: strange sounds\nE: weakness",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what it means to think that a desk was built with solidity. This suggests that James expected the desk to feel sturdy and well-constructed.",
    "Next, when James rapped on the desk, he was likely looking for a confirmation of that solidity through a firm sound.",
    "The sound produced when rapping on a solid object would generally be a dull, muted thump if the desk is indeed solid.",
    "However, if he could hear something different, that would imply that there is an issue with the expected solidity.",
    "The choices provided include various options that could describe unexpected sounds or qualities of the desk.",
    "\u201cOpenness\u201d (A) suggests a lack of structure, but it doesn't directly refer to sound. \u201cInstability\u201d (B) implies movement or wobbly feelings, which again isn\u2019t directly audible.",
    "\u201cStrange sounds\u201d (D) is vague and doesn't specifically describe the nature of what he might hear indicative of a solid versus a hollow object.",
    "\u201cWeakness\u201d (E) suggests a lack of strength but doesn't point towards a specific type of sound either.",
    "\u201cHollowness\u201d (C) implies a specific sound\u2014when there is a hollow object, rapping on it would produce a resonant or echoing sound which is different from that of a solid object.",
    "Thus, since James thought the desk was solid but could hear something when he rapped on it, \u201chollowness\u201d (C) is the most appropriate answer as it describes the unexpected sound indicating a lack of solidity."
