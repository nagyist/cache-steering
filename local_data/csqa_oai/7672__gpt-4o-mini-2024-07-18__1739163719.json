  "query": "Question: The bathroom was dirty and messy.  It was cleaned every day, but it was always full of water and pee by morning.  Where is the bathroom located?\n\nChoices:\nA: school\nB: at hotel\nC: neighbor's house\nD: college\nE: flat",
  "steps": [
    "The bathroom is described as dirty and messy, which suggests it is frequently used by a number of people.",
    "It is mentioned that the bathroom is cleaned every day, indicating a high level of usage that necessitates daily cleaning.",
    "The presence of water and pee suggests a communal or shared bathroom scenario rather than a private one.",
    "Schools typically have communal restrooms that are cleaned regularly but can get messy quickly due to high traffic.",
    "Hotels also have bathrooms that can be messy, but they are usually cleaned more thoroughly and often have fewer people using them at any given time.",
    "A neighbor's house could have a messy bathroom, but it\u2019s less likely to be consistently dirty unless multiple people are using it.",
    "Colleges often have shared dorm bathrooms that can be messy due to many students living there, and they usually have routine cleaning.",
    "Flats can have shared bathrooms as well, but that would depend on the living arrangement and how many people are living there.",
    "Considering the options, a school bathroom is often very busy, leading to the conditions described, as do college bathrooms, but the image of consistent messiness aligns better with a school due to the age and habits of students.",
    "I will analyze the options closely: given that the bathroom is always full of water and pee, I conclude the environment around it is youthful and transient, pointing actually toward the context of a school."
