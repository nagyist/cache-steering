  "steps": [
    "The phrase mentions that the truth had weighed on him his whole life, indicating a burden or something that caused distress.",
    "The term \"finally discovering\" suggests that this truth was recently uncovered, implying a sense of liberation or release.",
    "Given the context, a feeling associated with the end of a long struggle or anxiety would likely be the outcome of discovering the truth.",
    "Looking through the options, \"relief\" (A) aligns with the idea of alleviating a burden that has caused him distress.",
    "\"Satisfaction\" (B) could also be a possible feeling, but it does not capture the nuance of lifting a long-held burden as effectively as \"relief.\"",
    "\"Hurt\" (C) does not fit well, as discovering truth generally would not be considered inherently hurtful; instead, it implies healing.",
    "\"Happiness\" (D) might seem plausible, but the phrase emphasizes the struggle rather than pure joy upon discovery.",
    "\"Conclusion\" (E) refers more to a finality but does not convey an emotional response to that finality.",
    "After evaluating the emotional responses tied to the discovery, \"relief\" seems to be the most appropriate choice as it captures both the burdensome nature of the past and the lightness of finally knowing the truth."
