  "query": "Question: what happens to a company when it is bankrupt?\n\nChoices:\nA: liquidated\nB: own resources\nC: branch out\nD: commit crime\nE: game over",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"bankrupt\" generally refers to a legal status for a person or entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors.",
    "When a company files for bankruptcy, it seeks relief from some or all of its debts, often through a court process.",
    "One common outcome of bankruptcy is that the company's assets are assessed to pay off creditors, which often leads to liquidation.",
    "Liquidation entails selling off the company's resources and assets to pay debts, effectively ending its operations.",
    "Alternative outcomes could involve restructuring the company in a way that allows it to continue operating, but these are less common.",
    "The option \"own resources\" does not describe what typically happens during bankruptcy; it seems unrelated.",
    "\"Branch out\" implies expanding business operations, which is not a typical response to bankruptcy.",
    "\"Commit crime\" is a moral judgment rather than a direct consequence of bankruptcy, which generally concerns financial restructuring.",
    "\"Game over\" might convey the end of the company's business, but it is vague and not a formal term used in bankruptcy proceedings.",
    "After evaluating the choices in the context of bankruptcy, the most relevant outcome is liquidation."
