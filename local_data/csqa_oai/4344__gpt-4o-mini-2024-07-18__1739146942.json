  "query": "Question: In what room would you expect to find the sugar?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: container\nC: kitchen\nD: bedroom\nE: neighbor's house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the common places where sugar is typically stored in a household.",
    "Sugar is a food item, and food items are usually found in locations associated with cooking or food preparation.",
    "Analyze the options provided. A cupboard is a specific storage space usually found in kitchens or pantries, often used for food items.",
    "A container could refer to any kind of storage unit, but it is too vague without context regarding the room.",
    "A kitchen is a dedicated space for food preparation and cooking, where you would most likely expect to find sugar.",
    "A bedroom is not a logical location for food items like sugar, as it is primarily meant for sleeping and personal belongings.",
    "A neighbor's house could potentially have sugar, but that location does not pertain to the direct question about where sugar would be found in general.",
    "Considering the nature of sugar and typical household layout, the best answer will center around where food items are regularly stored.",
    "Between the cupboard and kitchen, the kitchen represents the overall area where food, including sugar, is used and accessed frequently.",
    "Thus, upon evaluating all options, the kitchen is the most likely place to find sugar."
