  "query": "Question: They had so much fun that afternoon that it seemed like it had become what in a blink of the eye?\n\nChoices:\nA: before noon\nB: morning\nC: christmas\nD: before lunch\nE: evening",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies a situation where time feels like it has passed very quickly during a fun afternoon.",
    "We need to identify an option that is related to the concept of time passing quickly.",
    "Options A (before noon) and D (before lunch) both imply earlier times in the day, which contrasts with the concept of an afternoon.",
    "Option B (morning) also represents an earlier segment of the day, same as A and D.",
    "Option C (Christmas) is a specific day rather than a time of day, and while it might evoke a sense of joy, it doesn't fit well with the concept of time passing quickly during an afternoon.",
    "Option E (evening) suggests a later time in the day following afternoon, making it a suitable candidate for feeling like time has slipped away quickly.",
    "Comparing evening to other options, only evening logically fits as something an afternoon might feel like passing into suddenly, as this aligns with the typical flow of time.",
    "Since option E is the only one that suggests a transition from fun in the afternoon to a later time, it is the best choice."
