  "query": "Question: what other species have blood other than humans?\n\nChoices:\nA: vampires\nB: person\nC: soccer game\nD: capillaries\nE: animals",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify species that have blood aside from humans. Humans are classified as animals, specifically mammals.",
    "The term \"species\" generally refers to distinct groups of organisms. Humans are part of the animal kingdom, which includes many other species.",
    "I should consider a broad range of animal species, as they all generally have blood, which circulates through their bodies.",
    "The choices provided include various terms, and I need to evaluate them in relation to the question.",
    "Choice A: vampires are fictional creatures, usually depicted as having blood, but they aren't a scientifically recognized species.",
    "Choice B: a person is synonymous with human, which is already specified in the question, and therefore does not qualify as an additional species.",
    "Choice C: a soccer game is an event or activity involving humans, it does not represent a species or any organism with blood.",
    "Choice D: capillaries are blood vessels in the circulatory system, but they are not a species or organism that possesses blood; they are part of organisms that do.",
    "Choice E: \"animals\" broadly represent a variety of species that have blood, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most accurate choice that encompasses other species having blood, aside from humans, is animals."
