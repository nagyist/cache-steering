  "query": "Question: James consumed a liquid.  What did he most likely use to hold the liquid?\n\nChoices:\nA: jar\nB: cup\nC: drinking glass\nD: container\nE: tankard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of liquids and typical containers used for them.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided for common liquid containers.",
    "A jar is typically used for storage rather than drinking directly from it.",
    "A cup is a common vessel for drinking beverages, making it a strong candidate.",
    "A drinking glass is another common option specifically designed for consuming liquids.",
    "The term \"container\" is too vague and could apply to many different types of vessels, not specifically designed for drinking.",
    "A tankard is typically associated with larger quantities of drink, often for beer or ale, and is less common for everyday liquid consumption.",
    "Comparing \"cup\" and \"drinking glass,\" both are likely candidates, but a drinking glass is often used for a wider variety of beverages.",
    "Given that the question implies James consumed a liquid, a drinking glass is a more likely choice than a cup for this scenario.",
    "So, by analyzing the context and the specific usage of each option, I conclude that the most likely answer is a drinking glass."
