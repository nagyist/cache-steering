  "query": "Question: James needed more sleep at night, so he did what earlier?\n\nChoices:\nA: get into bed\nB: closed his eyes\nC: go to sleep\nD: relax\nE: rest",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that James needed more sleep at night, which implies he was feeling tired or fatigued.",
    "The phrase \"needed more sleep\" suggests that he was looking for a way to ensure he gets sufficient rest during the night.",
    "To achieve more sleep, a logical step for James would be to prepare himself to transition from being awake to falling asleep.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"go to sleep\" directly indicates the action of falling asleep, which is the ultimate goal of needing more sleep.",
    "\"Get into bed\" would be a preliminary action toward going to sleep, but it does not necessarily guarantee that he is actually sleeping.",
    "\"Closed his eyes\" is also a step toward going to sleep but does not indicate the completion of the process.",
    "\"Relax\" and \"rest\" both refer to actions that could lead to sleep, but do not explicitly mean that James is falling asleep.",
    "Since the question seeks an action James did earlier to facilitate more sleep, \"go to sleep\" captures this intention most accurately.",
    "Upon reviewing all the options, \"go to sleep\" is the best fit as it directly relates to James' need for more sleep."
