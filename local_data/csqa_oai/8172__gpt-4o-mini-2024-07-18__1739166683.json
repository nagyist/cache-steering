  "query": "Question: What will happen after you hear thunder?\n\nChoices:\nA: quit\nB: silence\nC: lightning\nD: lighting\nE: lightening",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the situation. Hearing thunder usually indicates a thunderstorm is occurring or approaching.",
    "Next, let's recall the relationship between thunder and lightning. Thunder is the sound produced by lightning.",
    "When we hear thunder, it means that lightning has already occurred, but we are experiencing the sound after the fact because light travels faster than sound.",
    "Now, let's consider the answer choices provided. We need to choose the option that logically follows after hearing thunder.",
    "Option A, \"quit,\" doesn't logically relate to thunder.",
    "Option B, \"silence,\" could occur after the thunder fades, but it doesn't happen immediately after hearing it.",
    "Option C, \"lightning,\" does not follow as an immediate result of hearing thunder since lightning occurs before (not after) the thunder is heard.",
    "Option D, \"lighting,\" seems to reference illumination, which is unrelated to the context of thunder.",
    "Option E, \"lightening,\" suggests \"making lighter,\" which also doesn\u2019t connect well to the event of hearing thunder.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, I realize that none of the options directly answers what happens immediately after hearing thunder, but by understanding the sequence of events, we can conclude that hearing thunder implies that lightning has already occurred."
