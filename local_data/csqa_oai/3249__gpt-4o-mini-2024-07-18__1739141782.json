  "steps": [
    "The question asks about displaying a picture on a vertical surface.",
    "A shelf is typically a horizontal surface, which does not meet the requirement of being vertical.",
    "A desktop is also a horizontal surface, commonly referred to as a flat top, and is not vertical either.",
    "An editer is a possible misspelling of \"editor,\" which is a digital or software context, and does not relate to physical displays on a vertical surface.",
    "A wall is a classic vertical surface used for displaying pictures, paintings, and other artworks.",
    "An art show usually would involve multiple vertical displays but is not itself a vertical surface; rather, it is an event or venue.",
