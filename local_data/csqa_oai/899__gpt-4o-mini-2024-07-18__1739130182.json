  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a robot that is reading books, which suggests an ability to either understand or process information from them.",
    "The phrase \"shockingly began to read\" indicates that this is an unexpected behavior for a robot, implying that it might have developed or acquired a new skill or ability.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"learn to read\" (D) aligns with the idea that the robot has acquired the skill necessary to read books, which is a significant achievement for a machine.",
    "Evaluating the other options: \n- \"choose one\" (A) does not fit the context.\n- \"get comfortable\" (B) relates to an emotional state, which doesn't apply here.\n- \"bought a book\" (C) implies the robot could make purchases, which isn't directly supported by the action of reading.\n- \"open up\" (E) is vague and doesn't relate to reading specifically.",
    "Since learning to read is the most relevant option that describes an unexpected capability for a robot, it makes the most sense as the answer."
