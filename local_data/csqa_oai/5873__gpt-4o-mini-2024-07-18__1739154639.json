  "query": "Question: Where can you buy an electric fan?\n\nChoices:\nA: sauna\nB: home\nC: closet\nD: hardware store\nE: computer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where electric fans are commonly used. Electric fans are typically found in homes, offices, and other indoor environments where cooling is necessary.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. A sauna is generally a hot environment and may not require an electric fan.",
    "Then, consider the 'home' option. While fans are used in homes, this option suggests purchasing rather than using, so it may not be the most relevant choice.",
    "Look at the 'closet' option. While a closet may store an electric fan, it is not a place where one would buy an electric fan.",
    "Then, evaluate the 'hardware store' option. Hardware stores often carry various electrical appliances, including electric fans, making it a typical place for buying such items.",
    "Finally, assess the 'computer' option. Computers are not relevant to purchasing electric fans either as they do not sell them nor are they a location for buying them.",
    "Now, compare the most relevant options to purchase an electric fan. The hardware store stands out as the primary location for buying appliances such as electric fans."
