  "steps": [
    "Billy owns a clothing store, which suggests he is likely to live in proximity to where his business is located.",
    "The question specifies that Billy owned the finest clothing store in the midwest, which is a geographical region of the United States.",
    "The midwest includes states like Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan, which have cities and towns that could support a high-end clothing store.",
    "Options A (strip mall) and E (shopping mall) refer to specific types of retail environments and are not typical residential areas, so they are unlikely locations for Billy's home.",
    "Option B (heaven) is not a plausible location for anyone to physically reside, so it is also unlikely.",
    "That leaves us with options C (Ohio) and D (city or town), both of which are feasible living locations for Billy.",
    "Since Billy's clothing store is described as the finest in the midwest, it makes sense that he might live in an urban area where such a store would thrive, making option D (city or town) more plausible.",
    "However, Ohio is specifically mentioned as part of the midwest, which would also be a potentially realistic option for his residence.",
    "Both options C and D can be correct but C (Ohio) is a specific location in the midwest, while D (city or town) is more general.",
    "In terms of specificity, answering with C (Ohio) provides a clear link to the specific region where Billy's store is located."
