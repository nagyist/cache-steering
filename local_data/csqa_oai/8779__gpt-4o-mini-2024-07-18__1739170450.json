  "steps": [
    "I need to identify the definition of the word \"cargo\". Cargo generally refers to goods or items that are transported, typically by ship, aircraft, or vehicle.",
    "Next, I will analyze each of the provided answer choices to see if they relate to the definition of cargo.",
    "Choice A: \"aeroplane\" does not refer to goods but is a mode of transport.",
    "Choice B: \"boat\" is also a mode of transport and does not mean cargo.",
    "Choice C: \"giftwrap\" is an item used to wrap gifts, unrelated to the transport of goods.",
    "Choice D: \"hiding in\" does not have any relationship to cargo either.",
    "Choice E: \"ship's hold\" specifically refers to the compartment in a ship where cargo is stored. This directly associates with the definition of cargo as it is the space where goods are kept during transport.",
    "Given that \"ship's hold\" specifically indicates a location pertaining to the cargo of a ship, I conclude it is the most relevant choice."
