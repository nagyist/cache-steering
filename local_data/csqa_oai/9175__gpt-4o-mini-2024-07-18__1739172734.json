    "The question asks for a solution that the two sides found, suggesting that the solution should be something positive or acceptable after hard negotiations.",
    "Analyzing the choices: \"hexachord\" (A) is unrelated to negotiations and does not make sense in context.",
    "\"Bearable\" (B) suggests a level of acceptance but implies that it is not ideal or satisfactory, which may not align with the spirit of finding a solution.",
    "\"Food\" (C) does not relate to negotiations in a meaningful way and is irrelevant to the context.",
    "\"Agreeable\" (D) suggests that both sides came to a mutually acceptable and satisfactory resolution, making it a strong candidate.",
    "\"Easy\" (E) implies that the solution was simple, which contradicts the premise that the negotiation was hard.",
    "Therefore, \"agreeable\" (D) is the most fitting option given the context of a hard negotiation leading to a satisfactory solution."
