  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"he saw the garage across the street from his house.\" This indicates that the garage is located just across the street from where he lives.",
    "The options provided are A: motor park, B: building, C: neighbor's house, D: downtown, and E: modern house.",
    "Since the garage is specifically described as being across the street from his house, we can deduce that it is likely to be associated with a private residence rather than a public or commercial area.",
    "Option D (downtown) does not fit because downtown usually refers to a commercial area far from a typical residential neighborhood.",
    "Options A (motor park) and B (building) are also less likely to describe a garage located directly across from a house, as they suggest larger or more communal spaces rather than private residences.",
    "This leaves us with option C (neighbor's house), which implies that the garage is part of a neighboring property directly across the street.",
    "Given the context of the statement and the proximity of the garage, it can be concluded that the most fitting answer among the choices is that the garage is part of the neighbor's house."
