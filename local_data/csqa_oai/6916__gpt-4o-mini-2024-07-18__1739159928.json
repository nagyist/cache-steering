  "query": "Question: Alabama has to consider a hurricane once in awhile as it is one of the whats?\n\nChoices:\nA: gulf states\nB: united states\nC: seaport\nD: alabama\nE: deep south",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the primary geographical features of Alabama. Alabama is located in the southeastern region of the United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "Consider the characteristics of the Gulf states, which include states that have coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico. These typically include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.",
    "Acknowledge that hurricanes often affect the Gulf states due to their proximity to warm ocean waters that fuel such storms. Alabama is known for experiencing hurricanes or tropical storms during hurricane season.",
    "Evaluate the other choices given the context of the question. \n- Option B, \"united states,\" is too broad and does not specifically relate to hurricanes.\n- Option C, \"seaport,\" is inaccurate as Alabama itself does not primarily identify as a seaport.\n- Option D, \"alabama,\" is redundant; the question is asking about a categorization.\n- Option E, \"deep south,\" although partially applicable, is more a cultural or historical region than a specific category related to hurricanes.",
    "Since Alabama's status as a state affected by hurricanes aligns with its inclusion among the Gulf states, this makes option A the most relevant answer."
