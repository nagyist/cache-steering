  "query": "Question: He chose a flashy car when he got the promotion, he wanted people to know he could afford what things?\n\nChoices:\nA: heavy\nB: expensive\nC: obesity\nD: carpooler\nE: red",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that he chose a flashy car after receiving a promotion. This suggests that he wants to show off his new financial status.",
    "We should consider what \"flashy\" implies in this context. A flashy car is typically associated with high cost and luxury, indicating wealth.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, we need to determine which word connects to showing off wealth.",
    "Option A \"heavy\" does not relate to wealth or status.",
    "Option B \"expensive\" directly relates to high cost, which aligns with the idea of a flashy car symbolizing wealth.",
    "Option C \"obesity\" is irrelevant and does not connect to the context of the promotion or flashy car.",
    "Option D \"carpooler\" does not make sense in the context of wanting to display wealth.",
    "Option E \"red\" is simply a color and does not relate to the concept of wealth or financial status either.",
    "Therefore, the only option that logically connects to wanting people to know he could afford something, in this case, is expensive."
