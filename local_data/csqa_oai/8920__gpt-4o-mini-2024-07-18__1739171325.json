  "query": "Question: There is a giant enemy crap.  It is too big to fit though doors.  So it is stuck where?\n\nChoices:\nA: virginia\nB: cape cod\nC: make person sick\nD: fish market\nE: outside",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"giant enemy crab\" suggests a large creature that is typically found in the ocean or coastal areas.",
    "The description states the crab is \"too big to fit through doors,\" indicating it cannot enter buildings or other enclosed spaces.",
    "Given that it is stuck, it must be in an open area where it can still exist despite its size.",
    "Next, I will examine the answer choices provided to see which options make sense in the context of a large crab that cannot fit through doors.",
    "Choice A (Virginia) is a location but does not imply any specific open space for the crab to be stuck.",
    "Choice B (Cape Cod) is a coastal region but still does not convey that it\u2019s an open space where the crab could remain stuck.",
    "Choice C (make person sick) is not applicable, as it doesn't indicate a location at all.",
    "Choice D (fish market) implies a location where fish are sold, but it is typically an enclosed space and would not be suitable for a giant crab that can't fit through doors.",
    "Choice E (outside) suggests an open area, which aligns with the crab being too large to enter any buildings.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the crab must be stuck outside since it cannot fit indoors anywhere due to its size."
