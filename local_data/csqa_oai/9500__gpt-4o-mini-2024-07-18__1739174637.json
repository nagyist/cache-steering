  "query": "Question: If a person sees an accident, what do they generally wonder?\n\nChoices:\nA: wonder what happened\nB: cross street\nC: run away\nD: wash themselves\nE: feel lucky",
  "steps": [
    "The person witnesses an accident and will likely have immediate thoughts about the situation.",
    "One common reaction in such scenarios is curiosity about the circumstances that led to the accident.",
    "The choice \"wonder what happened\" directly reflects this curiosity and is a typical human reaction when observing an unexpected event.",
    "The other options involve actions or emotions that are not as directly related to witnessing an accident.",
    "\"Cross street\" could imply moving closer to the scene, but it's not a general reaction for everyone.",
    "\"Run away\" suggests fear or danger, which may not be the primary thought for all witnesses.",
    "\"Wash themselves\" is irrelevant and does not logically connect to witnessing an accident.",
    "\"Feel lucky\" could refer to the observer feeling fortunate not to be involved, but it is not the first reaction.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate and general response to witnessing an accident is the curiosity encapsulated in \"wonder what happened.\""
