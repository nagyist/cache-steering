    "Losing when competing against someone involves a direct comparison between one's abilities and those of an opponent.",
    "This experience often leads to feelings of disappointment or a sense of inadequacy, as individuals reflect on their performance.",
    "One common emotional response to losing is frustration, stemming from unmet expectations and the desire to succeed.",
    "While losing can sometimes motivate individuals to improve (encouragement), the immediate emotional impact often includes negative feelings rather than positive reinforcement.",
    "A Mexican stand-off refers to a situation of mutual stalemate and does not apply to losing in competitions.",
    "Injury is typically associated with physical competitions but does not inherently relate to the emotional impact of losing.",
    "Emotions certainly play a role in the experience of losing, but we need to focus on the likely immediate effects rather than just categorizing the outcome as an emotion.",
