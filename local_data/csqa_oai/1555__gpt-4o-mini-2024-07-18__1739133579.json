  "steps": [
    "The question asks where there is likely to be a large volume of text, suggesting a location that contains substantial written material.",
    "Choice A, \"bookshelf,\" typically holds books and other materials but does not inherently represent a large volume of text by itself.",
    "Choice B, \"collection of books,\" implies a group or assortment of books which could indicate a larger volume of text than a single bookshelf, but is still not definitive.",
    "Choice C, \"books,\" refers to individual physical items which together can form a large volume, but in isolation as a term, it\u2019s broad and not specific.",
    "Choice D, \"set of books,\" suggests a specific grouping that may contain multiple volumes contributing to a larger collection of text, but again it's limited in scale for the emphasis on \"large volume.\"",
    "Choice E, \"library,\" is a place specifically designed to house and provide access to a large number of books and written materials, making it the most appropriate choice for the context of the question.",
    "Considering all options, \"library\" embodies not just a single volume but many, making it stand out from the other choices."
