  "query": "Question: Jack saw little point to communicating beyond the basics.  To him, it was just a means to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: go swimming\nB: making friends\nC: exchange information\nD: people to think\nE: confusion",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking why Jack finds communication to be mainly about the basics and what he believes is the primary purpose of communicating.",
    "Given that Jack sees little point in communicating beyond the basics, it suggests he values efficiency in communication rather than emotional or social nuances.",
    "Let's examine the answer choices to see which one aligns with Jack's perspective on communication as a basic function.",
    "Choice A (\"go swimming\") does not relate to communication and seems irrelevant.",
    "Choice B (\"making friends\") implies a social aspect to communication, which contradicts Jack's viewpoint of limiting communication to basics.",
    "Choice C (\"exchange information\") fits Jack's perspective, as it suggests a pragmatic function of communication where the focus is on delivering or receiving necessary information.",
    "Choice D (\"people to think\") is vague and does not clearly indicate a direct relationship with communication.",
    "Choice E (\"confusion\") implies a negative view of communication, which does not reflect Jack's belief that basics serve a distinct purpose.",
    "After analyzing the answer choices, Choice C (\"exchange information\") clearly aligns with the notion of communicating only as a means to serve a functional purpose, which Jack appears to endorse."
