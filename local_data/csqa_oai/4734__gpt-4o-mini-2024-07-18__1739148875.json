  "query": "Question: Where is one likely to find a wild fox?\n\nChoices:\nA: hen house\nB: painting\nC: chicken coop\nD: wooded areas\nE: electrical circuit",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the natural habitat of a wild fox. Foxes are typically found in areas where they can find food and shelter, which often includes forests and wooded regions.",
    "Next, let's analyze the options provided. A hen house (A) and chicken coop (C) are locations associated with domesticated animals and farming, not natural habitats for wild foxes. Therefore, these options are less likely.",
    "Now, let's look at option B, a painting. This reference is not a physical location, so it is irrelevant to the question regarding where a wild fox might be found.",
    "Option E, an electrical circuit, similarly does not relate to the natural environment of a fox. Foxes do not inhabit such areas.",
    "The final option is D, wooded areas. This option aligns well with the known habitats of wild foxes, as they thrive in woodland regions where they can hunt for food and find cover from predators and human disturbances.",
    "Having analyzed all options, it is clear that the only plausible location where one would typically find a wild fox is in wooded areas."
