  "query": "Question: Where in Northern Europe would you find many canals?\n\nChoices:\nA: sydney\nB: bridge\nC: amsterdam\nD: venice\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the geographical location of each choice. Sydney is in Australia, which is not in Northern Europe.",
    "Next, I will consider \"bridge.\" Briges can be found in many places, but this option is vague and does not specify a location in Northern Europe.",
    "Now, considering \"Amsterdam,\" I know that Amsterdam is in the Netherlands, which is in Northern Europe and is famous for its extensive canal system.",
    "Next, I will examine \"Venice.\" Venice is well-known for its canals, but it is located in Italy, which is southern Europe, not Northern.",
    "Now, let's look at \"Michigan.\" Michigan is a state in the United States and is not located in Northern Europe.",
    "After analyzing each option, I find that the only location in Northern Europe known for its canals is Amsterdam.",
    "I have ruled out all other options as they either do not pertain to Northern Europe or do not have a significant canal system.",
    "I can conclude confidently that Amsterdam is the correct answer, as it is the only choice that meets all criteria."
