  "query": "Question: The gun was uncomfortable tucked in her pants, where did she put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: drawer\nB: holster\nC: crime scene\nD: police helicopter\nE: police station",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the gun was uncomfortable tucked in her pants, indicating that she may want to find a more suitable place to store it.",
    "The option \"drawer\" (A) suggests a place where one might keep items, but this is less likely since it implies she would have to return home or to a location with a drawer to store it.",
    "The option \"holster\" (B) implies a proper carrying device for a gun, which would make it more comfortable to carry. This is a plausible option.",
    "The option \"crime scene\" (C) suggests she left the gun at the location of a crime, which doesn\u2019t seem practical if she was concerned about comfort.",
    "The option \"police helicopter\" (D) seems unlikely, as there's no context suggesting she would have access to a police helicopter or leave the gun there.",
    "The option \"police station\" (E) indicates a location to surrender a weapon, but it doesn't suggest a comfortable method of carrying or storing the gun either.",
    "Reviewing the options, using a holster (B) stands out as the most logical choice for comfort while carrying a firearm.",
    "Given the context of the question and the options presented, \"holster\" is the most suitable choice."
