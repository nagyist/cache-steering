  "steps": [
    "To determine where you would play a trumpet and need to walk the entire time, I will analyze each option regarding typical activities involved.",
    "Option A and B both mention \"music store\" and \"music shop,\" which typically do not involve walking while playing instruments, as they are locations for purchasing or browsing musical items.",
    "Option C, \"drill team,\" generally involves marching and performing choreography, but it is not primarily music-focused, as it emphasizes marching formations and precision.",
    "Options D, \"brass band,\" and E, \"marching band,\" are both groups that typically require musicians to perform while moving.",
    "Brass bands often perform in parades or stationary concerts rather than continuously walking. Therefore, \"brass band\" may not fit the criteria of walking the entire time.",
    "Conversely, a \"marching band\" is specifically designed for playing while walking, usually during parades or football games.",
    "Given that the question specifically emphasizes playing a trumpet while needing to walk the entire time, the most fitting option would indeed be \"marching band.\"",
    "As I've evaluated the context and requirements of each option, it's clear that \"marching band\" is the only choice that entails playing an instrument while continuously walking."
