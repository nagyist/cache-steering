  "query": "Question: The man was watching TV instead of talking to his wife, what is he avoiding?\n\nChoices:\nA: get fat\nB: entertainment\nC: arguments\nD: wasting time\nE: quality time",
  "steps": [
    "The man is engaged in an activity (watching TV) instead of interacting with his wife.",
    "By watching TV, he is likely choosing to avoid a conversation or interaction with her.",
    "Conversations with a spouse can lead to various outcomes, including disagreements or discussions that may not be easy.",
    "The avoidance of talking suggests that he may not want to confront any potential conflicts or discussions.",
    "This leads to the conclusion that he is likely avoiding arguments that may arise from the discussion.",
    "Additionally, spending time on TV instead of with his wife may also imply he is avoiding quality time together.",
    "However, the more direct avoidance stemming from his choice to not engage in conversation points to avoiding arguments rather than just quality time itself.",
    "I can compare the other options to see if they fit better. \"Get fat\" doesn't directly relate, \"entertainment\" is something he is engaging in, \"wasting time\" isn't relevant, and while \"quality time\" is affected, the primary avoidance is likely arguments.",
    "So, I conclude that the man is primarily avoiding arguments by choosing to watch TV."
