  "steps": [
    "To learn to play the upright piano, one would typically need instruction or guidance from someone knowledgeable.",
    "A music class is a structured environment where individuals receive lessons from a teacher, which is conducive to learning an instrument like the piano.",
    "A music room refers to a space that might be used for practice or lessons, but does not imply formal instruction.",
    "A music store could have pianos for sale and possibly some informal lessons, but it is not primarily a learning environment.",
    "While practicing at home (in a house) is important for learning, it does not provide the instruction necessary to learn how to play.",
    "The term \"medium\" does not apply in this context as it does not refer to a place of learning for piano.",
