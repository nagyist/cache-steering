  "query": "Question: The helm is the steering control for what which pulls shipping barges through bodies of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: sailing vessel\nB: tugboat\nC: motorboat\nD: ship\nE: ferry",
  "steps": [
    "The helm is a steering mechanism used to control a vessel's direction, typically associated with various types of boats and ships.",
    "In the context of the question, we need to identify which type of vessel specifically pulls shipping barges.",
    "A sailing vessel primarily uses sails for movement and is not typically used for pulling barges.",
    "A motorboat generally has a smaller size and is also not designed specifically for towing large barges.",
    "A ship is a broad term that can refer to various types of vessels, but it does not specifically signify the role of towing barges.",
    "A ferry usually transports passengers or vehicles across bodies of water but does not focus on towing barges.",
    "A tugboat is designed specifically for towing or pushing barges and other vessels, making it an essential part of maritime operations.",
    "The question explicitly mentions pulling shipping barges, which aligns perfectly with the function of a tugboat.",
    "Thus, the best answer that matches the capability of pulling shipping barges is 'tugboat.'"
