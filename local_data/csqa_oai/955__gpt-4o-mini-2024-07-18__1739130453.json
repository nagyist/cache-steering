  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the locations mentioned in the options to determine where barbecue sauces would be available.",
    "Option A: Detroit is a city known for its culinary options, but it might not be the most specific choice for purchasing barbecue sauces.",
    "Option B: Australia is a country that might have barbecue sauces, but it's a broad area and does not refer to a specific purchasing location.",
    "Option C: Michigan Park specifies a neighborhood or park area that could potentially have local stores or vendors, but it still lacks specificity for common shopping.",
    "Option D: A cafe may serve food that includes barbecue, but it is not primarily a retail location for buying sauces.",
    "Option E: A retail store is the most general but directly suggests a location dedicated to selling various products, including barbecue sauces.",
