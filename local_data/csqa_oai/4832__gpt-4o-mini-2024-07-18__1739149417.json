  "query": "Question: Where are you when an employee brings you cooked potatoes?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathroom\nB: cellar\nC: countryside\nD: restaurant\nE: plate",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the context in which an employee would bring cooked potatoes to someone.",
    "Considering the choices, a \"bathroom\" is an unlikely place for receiving food, so option A can be dismissed.",
    "A \"cellar\" is typically used for storage, particularly of ingredients or beverages, but it's not a common place for serving food, thus option B can also be dismissed.",
    "The \"countryside\" is merely a location and does not imply a service context where food would be directly served; therefore, option C is not appropriate.",
    "A \"restaurant\" is a dining establishment where employees serve food to customers, making it a likely place to receive cooked potatoes, thus option D seems plausible.",
    "The option \"plate\" implies a receptacle for food but does not represent a location where one would typically interact with an employee serving food; thus, option E is not a suitable choice.",
    "Comparing all choices, option D, \"restaurant,\" is the most logical setting for an employee bringing cooked potatoes."
