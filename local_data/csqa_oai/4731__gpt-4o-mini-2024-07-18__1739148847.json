  "query": "Question: The food needs to be kept chilled but there is no refrigerator. Where should it be kept?\n\nChoices:\nA: stapler\nB: cupboard\nC: desk drawer\nD: office\nE: pantry",
  "steps": [
    "The objective is to find a location where the food can be kept chilled without a refrigerator.",
    "Next, I need to evaluate each option based on its suitability for keeping food chilled.",
    "A stapler is an office supply item and does not provide any cooling or chilling capability. Therefore, it's not suitable.",
    "A cupboard is typically a closed space for storage but usually does not maintain any chilling. Hence, it\u2019s not an ideal choice for keeping food chilled.",
    "A desk drawer is also a closed storage option, but like a cupboard, it does not provide any cooling. Thus, it's not suitable for keeping food chilled.",
    "An office is a general space with variable conditions, but it does not inherently offer a cooling mechanism for food storage. Therefore, it's not suitable.",
    "A pantry is often a cool, dark space and can sometimes be used for storing food items effectively, especially if it\u2019s located in a cooler part of the house or building.",
    "Given that pantries often maintain a cooler environment compared to other areas due to less traffic and better insulation, it would be the best option among those listed.",
    "Thus, of all the options provided, the pantry stands out as the most reasonable choice to keep food chilled."
