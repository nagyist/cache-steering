  "query": "Question: The child wanted to test electricity, so what did he feel as a result?\n\nChoices:\nA: cause fire\nB: shock\nC: short fuse\nD: kill if used improperly\nE: produce heat",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the child wanted to test electricity. This implies that the child was likely experimenting with electrical devices or circuits.",
    "When someone tests electricity, especially without proper knowledge or safety precautions, they can experience various effects, particularly from electric currents.",
    "The most common immediate physical reaction to direct contact with electricity is an electric shock. This is a sensation caused by the flow of electric current through the body.",
    "Other options such as \"cause fire\" implies a potential consequence of electrical experimentation but is not a direct sensation felt during testing.",
    "\"Short fuse\" does not relate directly to a sensation felt when experiencing electricity; it refers to a possible result in a circuit, not a physical sensation.",
    "\"Kill if used improperly\" conveys a possible consequence of dangerous electrical mishaps but again does not refer to a direct physical sensation.",
    "\"Produce heat\" can happen due to electrical resistance but is typically not a sensation that one 'feels' immediately compared to a shock.",
    "Based on the above evaluations, the most accurate and straightforward answer to the sensation felt when testing electricity is \"shock.\""
