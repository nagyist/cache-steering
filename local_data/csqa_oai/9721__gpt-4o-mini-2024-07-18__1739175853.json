  "query": "Question: Billy's disability prevented him from moving, but it didn't alter his mind or what?\n\nChoices:\nA: activity\nB: potence\nC: qualification\nD: competency\nE: strength",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of Billy's disability and its implications. The sentence mentions that his disability prevents him from moving, which typically refers to physical limitations.",
    "Next, I consider what aspects often remain unaffected despite physical disabilities. Typically, these may involve cognitive functions, knowledge, skills, or various personal attributes.",
    "The three options that stand out as relevant attributes are \"qualification,\" \"competency,\" and \"strength.\" Since \"strength\" refers mostly to physical abilities, it is likely not the correct answer since Billy's disability affects movement.",
    "Now, let's analyze \"qualifications.\" This term often refers to credentials or accomplishments that someone may have. Disabilities do not necessarily affect a person\u2019s qualifications, but this term primarily relates to formal achievements.",
    "Next, I consider \"competency,\" which refers to the ability to do something successfully or efficiently. Competencies can be both mental and emotional and are typically not affected by physical disabilities.",
    "Since the context emphasizes that Billy's mind is intact despite his disability, \"competency\" seems closely linked to mental capabilities and skills that can remain unaffected.",
    "While both \"qualifications\" and \"competency\" seem possible, the more relevant term in the context of mental functions is \"competency.\" This choice captures the idea of cognitive and skills-related attributes being unaffected.",
    "Now, to finalize the answer, I would rule out options A (activity) and E (strength) as they are less relevant to mental or cognitive aspects. I also find \"qualification\" lacks the direct link to what Billy's mind is, leaving \"competency\" as the most appropriate term."
