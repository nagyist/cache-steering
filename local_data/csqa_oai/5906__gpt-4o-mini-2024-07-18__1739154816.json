  "query": "Question: What is someone beginning work they really want to do likely to feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: working\nB: stress\nC: excitement\nD: confusion\nE: panic",
  "steps": [
    "To determine how someone feels when starting a job they really want, I need to consider the psychological state associated with new opportunities and aspirations.",
    "Someone starting a job they desire is generally anticipating the chance to engage in work they find fulfilling, which can foster positive emotions.",
    "Excitement is a common response to positive life changes and new beginnings, such as starting a job one has looked forward to.",
    "I can eliminate options like B (stress) since while starting a new job can sometimes be stressful, excitement typically overshadows that feeling for someone who is starting work they are passionate about.",
    "Option D (confusion) is also unlikely, as someone starting work in a field they have chosen usually has clarity about their goals.",
    "Option E (panic) seems less applicable too, as panic is a more extreme and negative reaction, not fitting a scenario where one is starting a desired job.",
    "Considering the above deductions, excitement (C) is the most appropriate emotion to describe how a person feels in this scenario.",
    "It's important to validate that excitement aligns with motivation, passion, and positivity, which are all related to pursuing desired work.",
    "Thus, confirming that option C encapsulates the experience of starting a job one truly desires."
