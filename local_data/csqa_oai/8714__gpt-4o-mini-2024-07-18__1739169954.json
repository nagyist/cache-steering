  "query": "Question: If people need something on the other side of a body of water, what must they do?\n\nChoices:\nA: flap their arms and fly\nB: cross river\nC: complete high school\nD: die suddenly\nE: talk to each other",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the problem: people need to obtain something on the other side of a body of water.",
    "Next, we consider the most logical action to take in this scenario, which generally involves crossing the body of water.",
    "Now, we examine each option.",
    "Option A (flap their arms and fly) is not a practical or realistic option for people needing something across the water.",
    "Option B (cross river) directly addresses the need to reach the other side, as crossing a river is a common method of getting to the other side of a body of water.",
    "Option C (complete high school) is unrelated to the need for something on the other side of a body of water, as education does not solve the immediate problem.",
    "Option D (die suddenly) is an extreme and unrelated response to needing something across the water.",
    "Option E (talk to each other) might imply communication about how to get something, but it does not physically solve the issue of getting to the other side.",
    "Considering the options, the only valid and practical response to the need for something on the other side of a body of water is to cross it."
