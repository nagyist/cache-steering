  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the context of learning to ski. Typically, falling and maintaining balance is a significant aspect of the learning process.",
    "Next, I evaluate the choices. \"Slip on ice\" (A) is a possibility but may not necessarily be something difficult to do; it can be seen as a natural occurrence.",
    "\"Fall down\" (B) seems relevant to skiing, as beginner skiers often fall, but the phrasing suggests it may be a common part of skiing rather than a particularly challenging aspect.",
    "\"Fall over\" (C) is quite similar to \"fall down.\" Thus, both B and C might refer to the same difficulty experienced when learning to ski.",
    "\"D sweat\" (D) is a bodily response and is not directly connected to skill acquisition in skiing, so we can likely eliminate it.",
    "\"Maintain balance\" (E) is crucial in skiing and one of the fundamental skills that beginners have difficulty with. Learning to keep one\u2019s balance on skis is key to progressing.",
    "Comparing the difficulty of the actions, maintaining balance is an ongoing challenge while skiing, unlike slipping, falling down, or falling over, which are more incidental.",
    "Given this analysis, maintaining balance is often cited as the hardest aspect for beginners while skiing because it is essential to prevent falls and improve skiing skills."
