  "query": "Question: Expressing yourself by using complicated words and technical language is likely to draw what from you audience?\n\nChoices:\nA: communication\nB: getting arrested\nC: stage fright\nD: blank stares\nE: applause",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the intention behind using complicated words and technical language. It is typically aimed at conveying complex ideas or demonstrating expertise.",
    "Next, evaluate the likely reaction of an audience when presented with language that is overly complicated or technical. Not all audience members may have the same level of understanding.",
    "Think about whether complicated language could alienate some audience members, leading to confusion or disinterest.",
    "Consider the reaction of the audience when they don't grasp the language being used. This could manifest as a lack of engagement or understanding.",
    "Evaluate each of the answer choices:\n- A (communication): While communication is the goal, this may not be achieved effectively if the language used is too complex.\n- B (getting arrested): There is no logical connection between complex language use and legal consequences.\n- C (stage fright): This relates to anxiety rather than audience reaction.\n- D (blank stares): This indicates a lack of understanding, which aligns with the use of complicated language.\n- E (applause): Applause is typically a response to clear and engaging communication, which may not occur if the audience is confused.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most plausible outcome of using complicated words and technical language is that the audience might respond with blank stares, indicating confusion or misunderstanding."
