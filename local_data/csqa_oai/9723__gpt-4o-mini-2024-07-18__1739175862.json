  "steps": [
    "First, if someone is caught hurting another person, it typically indicates a violation of laws or social norms.",
    "Legal systems are set in place to handle cases of physical harm to others, which usually results in legal repercussions for the offender.",
    "These legal repercussions could include criminal charges, civil lawsuits, or other legal problems that the offender will have to face.",
    "While it may also cause emotional or physical distress for both the victim and the perpetrator, the initial focus in a situation involving harm often revolves around legal aspects.",
    "Although options like \"public outcry\" (D) or \"physical pain\" (C) could be possible, they are secondary effects rather than direct consequences of being caught.",

    "Considering all the above points, legal problems (A) are the most immediate and direct consequence of being caught hurting someone."
