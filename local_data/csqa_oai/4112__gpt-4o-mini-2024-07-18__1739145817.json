  "query": "Question: If there is a bird at my window, what is it likely sitting on?\n\nChoices:\nA: cage\nB: forest\nC: a ledge\nD: windowsill\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that there is a bird at my window, which implies proximity to the window.",
    "The options provided include various locations or structures where a bird could be situated.",
    "A bird is more likely to be found on something in close proximity to the window, such as a ledge or windowsill.",
    "Examining option A, a cage, this is unlikely as it suggests the bird is contained rather than outside at the window.",
    "Option B, forest, is also unlikely since it describes a more distant location rather than something immediate like the window.",
    "Option E, countryside, describes a broader area and does not specifically indicate a location relevant to the window.",
    "Now considering options C and D, both could realistically hold a bird at a window.",
    "\"Windowsill\" (option D) refers to the ledge directly on the structure of the window and is a common resting place for birds at windows.",
    "\"Ledge\" (option C) could refer to any kind of ledge nearby or on the building, but the most common ledge associated with a window is indeed the windowsill.",
    "Since \"windowsill\" is the most specific and relevant option, it is the best choice."
