  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the final step for a farmer after making things grow.",
    "To understand the process involved, we should consider the general life cycle of crops.",
    "Typically, a farmer first plants seeds, then the seeds sprout and grow, and eventually produce flowers and fruit.",
    "The phrase \"after making things grow\" implies that the growing process has already occurred.",
    "After the growth has occurred, the next logical step is to collect the mature crops.",
    "Among the answer options provided, \"harvesting\" directly refers to the act of gathering mature crops.",
    "Other options like \"flowering,\" \"blooms,\" and \"growth\" do not represent steps that occur after the crops have matured.",
    "The option \"planting\" represents an initial phase, occurring before growth, not after.",
    "Since harvesting is a clear and recognized final step after crops have grown, this is the most appropriate answer."
