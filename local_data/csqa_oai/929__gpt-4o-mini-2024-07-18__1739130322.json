  "steps": [
    "To find a location where I can view sharks in a clear tunnel, I need to consider places known for such attractions.",
    "Aquariums often have exhibits with clear tunnels that allow visitors to see sharks swimming around them, and Sea World is a well-known aquarium.",
    "The South Pacific, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico are large bodies of water, but they do not specifically offer a clear tunnel experience for viewing sharks directly.",
    "The question asks for a specific location rather than a general area in an ocean.",
    "Sea World has multiple locations, such as Sea World San Diego, which features an underwater tunnel where visitors can see sharks and other marine life swim over them.",
    "The Pacific Ocean itself is too broad and does not offer a specific viewing experience with tunnels\u2014it consists of ocean water with sharks swimming in it.",
    "While the South Pacific or Indian Ocean might contain sharks, they do not have the specific infrastructure nor guarantee the tunnel viewing experience.",
    "The Gulf of Mexico is another body of water, but similar to the previous oceans, it does not specifically offer the tunnel experience.",
    "Based on these considerations, the best answer is Sea World, as it explicitly provides a clear tunnel for viewing sharks."
