  "query": "Question: A shelf holding things you eat that need to be kept cold would be inside what?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: cupboard\nC: bookstore\nD: corner\nE: antarctica",
  "steps": [
    "To begin, we need to identify the characteristics of the items that need to be kept cold. These items typically include perishable foods, dairy products, and beverages that require refrigeration to remain safe for consumption.",
    "Next, we consider the different choices provided in the question. The first choice is \u201crefrigerator,\u201d which is specifically designed to keep food and drinks cold.",
    "The second choice, \"cupboard,\" usually refers to a storage space for non-perishable items, and does not provide cooling; therefore, it would not be suitable for items that need to be kept cold.",
    "The third choice, \"bookstore,\" is a retail environment for books and has no relation to food storage, particularly cold storage.",
    "The fourth choice, \"corner,\" is a description of a location within a room that does not provide any relevant context regarding food storage.",
    "The fifth choice, \"antarctica,\" while cold, is not a practical location for storing food on a regular basis, and does not refer to a typical storage method for everyday food items.",
    "Thus, evaluating all choices, \"refrigerator\" is the only option that directly deals with keeping perishable items cold, fulfilling the requirement as set out in the question."
