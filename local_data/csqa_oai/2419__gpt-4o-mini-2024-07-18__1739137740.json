  "query": "Question: Where can you put leftover soup?\n\nChoices:\nA: toilet mug\nB: cupboard\nC: container\nD: supermarket\nE: jar",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what leftover soup is and what is appropriate for storing it.",
    "Leftover soup is a perishable food item that needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage.",
    "I am considering where leftover soup can be stored for later use.",
    "Option A, toilet mug, is not a suitable place for food storage due to hygiene concerns.",
    "Option B, cupboard, is typically used for storage, but it does not specify the proper conditions for soup, such as being covered or having a container.",
    "Option C, container, directly indicates a proper medium for storing soup, ensuring it is sealed and refrigerated, which aligns with food safety guidelines.",
    "Option D, supermarket, is not a storage option but a place to buy food, which does not apply here.",
    "Option E, jar, might also work for storing soup, as jars can be airtight. However, it is a specific type of container.",
    "While jar is a valid storage option, container is more general and encompasses various types, making it the broader correct answer.",
    "Thus, the best answer focusing on proper storage is option C, container, because it includes any appropriate vessel for leftovers."
