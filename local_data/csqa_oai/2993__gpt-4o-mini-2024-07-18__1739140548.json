  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the emotional state of someone who has just committed an act of killing.",
    "When someone kills another person, they may experience a range of emotions as a direct result of that action.",
    "The emotion of 'remorse' (C) relates to feelings of regret or guilt for the action taken, which is likely to occur after taking a life.",
    "Choosing 'horrible' (A) also reflects a negative emotional response, but it is less specific than 'remorse.' It could encompass a variety of feelings without pinpointing guilt.",
    "The option 'funeral' (B) represents a situation that occurs after a death, not an emotional response felt by the killer.",
    "'Going to jail' (D) focuses on the consequences of the act rather than the emotional impact on the perpetrator.",
    "'Scared' (E) could be a potential feeling due to the fear of repercussions, but it does not encompass the more profound emotional reaction of guilt.",
    "Among all the options, 'remorse' (C) is the most relevant emotional response that one might have immediately after committing such an act.",
    "In conclusion, the strongest candidate representing what someone is likely to feel after killing someone is 'remorse.'"
