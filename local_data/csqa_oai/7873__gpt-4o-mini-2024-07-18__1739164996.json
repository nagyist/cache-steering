  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the context of the sentence. It discusses a defendant being guilty of obstructing justice.",
    "Next, we recognize that obstructing justice is a legal term often associated with a legal proceeding.",
    "We then consider the roles typically involved in legal proceedings; one key role is that of the prosecution.",
    "The prosecution's job is to present evidence and arguments to show that the defendant is guilty of the charges against them.",
    "Looking at the choices, we see that \"prosecution\" (C) is a term that directly relates to the legal system and fits the context of explaining a defendant's guilt.",
    "Other options like \"riot\" (A), \"choir\" (B), \"getting hurt\" (D), and \"committing perjury\" (E) do not relate to explaining guilt in a legal setting.",
    "Thus, we confirm that the explanation of the defendant's guilt in obstructing justice would indeed fall under the responsibilities of the prosecution."
