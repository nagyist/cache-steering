  "steps": [
    "A maid is typically hired to help with household tasks, which can vary widely depending on the needs of the employer.",
    "The primary responsibilities of maids often include cleaning and organizing various areas of a home.",
    "The options provided include various aspects of a maid's duties, but not all choices are suitable as main reasons for hiring a maid.",
    "Choice A states \"cleaning house\u201d, which is a broad category of the maid's duties and reflects a common reason for hiring one.",
    "Choice C states \"clean house\u201d, which is essentially the same as choice A but slightly different in wording.",
    "Choice B (\"iron shirts and trousers\") represents a specific task but does not encompass the full scope of what a maid does.",
    "Choice D (\"maid uniform\") pertains to the attire of the maid, not the reason for hiring one.",
    "Choice E (\"clean room\") is too specific and does not reflect the potential broader responsibilities of a maid.",
    "Both choices A and C relate directly to the primary function of a maid, but since they basically mean the same thing, one of these should be the final answer.",
    "Considering the clear wording, choice A (\"cleaning house\") is slightly more encompassing than C (\u201cclean house\u201d), making it a better fit for the general role of a maid."
