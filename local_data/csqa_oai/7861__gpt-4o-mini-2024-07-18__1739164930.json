  "query": "Question: Bill would not allow Sam to built a new addition.  Sam protested that the construction was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: restrict\nB: off-limits\nC: forbid\nD: permitted\nE: prohibit",
  "steps": [
    "We need to analyze the context of the sentence provided. Bill did not allow Sam to build a new addition, which implies that Bill has set a restriction against Sam's construction plans.",
    "The word \"protested\" indicates that Sam is expressing disagreement or objection regarding Bill's decision. Sam's protest would likely involve claiming that there is justification for the construction.",
    "In considering the provided choices, we need to identify a term that suggests Sam is arguing that the construction should be allowed or is legitimate.",
    "Choice A, \"restrict,\" suggests limitation, which does not align with Sam's argument against the restriction.",
    "Choice B, \"off-limits,\" indicates that something is not allowed, which is the opposite of what Sam would defend in his protest.",
    "Choice C, \"forbid,\" also refers to creating a ban, similar to what Bill is doing, which is again contrary to Sam's position.",
    "Choice D, \"permitted,\" suggests that something is allowed. This aligns well with the idea that Sam is arguing against the restriction and claiming the construction is acceptable.",
    "Choice E, \"prohibit,\" implies a forbidding action, which would not support Sam's protest either, as it reaffirms the limitation he is contesting.",
    "The most logical choice, given that Sam is protesting and possibly claiming the construction should be allowed, is choice D, \"permitted.\""
