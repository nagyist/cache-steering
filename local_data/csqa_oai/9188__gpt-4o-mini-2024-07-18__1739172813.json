  "query": "Question: The vet was concerned about all of the blood he saw, where was the blood coming from?\n\nChoices:\nA: person\nB: animals\nC: hospital\nD: battlefield\nE: soccer game",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the context of the question. A veterinarian (vet) typically deals with animals rather than people or places like hospitals or battlefields.",
    "Next, since the vet is concerned about blood, it likely indicates the presence of an injury or a medical issue involving animals.",
    "Considering the options, \"person\" and \"hospital\" imply a human-related context, which is usually outside a vet's area of focus.",
    "\"D: battlefield\" might suggest a scenario involving injuries related to combat situations, but this isn't typically associated with a vet's concerns.",
    "\"E: soccer game\" could imply injuries to players, but again, this situation is typically managed by human medical professionals, not a vet.",
    "The most logical choice left that relates closely to a vet's role would be \"B: animals.\" Vets take care of injured or ill animals, which fits the scenario described.",
    "Thus, the blood mentioned in the question is most likely coming from animals that the vet is treating."
