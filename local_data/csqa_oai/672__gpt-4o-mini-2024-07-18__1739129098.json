  "query": "Question: Where can you purchase food and eat it at tables?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: fast food restaurant\nC: library\nD: conference\nE: paper",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify places where food can be purchased and consumed on-site.",
    "A house is typically a personal residence where food can be prepared and eaten, but it is not a place where food is purchased in the context of this question.",
    "A fast food restaurant is specifically designed for the purchase and consumption of food, often providing tables for customers to eat at.",
    "A library generally does not allow food consumption inside and is not a location to purchase food.",
    "A conference may provide food options, but it is not a place dedicated for purchasing food in the same way a restaurant does.",
    "The option \u201cpaper\u201d does not relate to purchasing or consuming food at all.",
    "Among the choices, the only place that clearly offers the service of purchasing food and eating it at tables is a fast food restaurant.",
    "I confirm that none of the other options (house, library, conference, paper) fit the criteria as clearly as option B."
