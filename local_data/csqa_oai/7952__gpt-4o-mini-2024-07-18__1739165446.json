  "query": "Question: Where would you borrow coffee if you do not have any?\n\nChoices:\nA: meeting\nB: convenience store\nC: supermarket\nD: fast food restaurant\nE: friend's house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider my options for borrowing coffee. I need a place where coffee is available in a way I can borrow it.",
    "Next, evaluate the most likely options. A convenience store typically sells items rather than allowing borrows.",
    "Similarly, a supermarket primarily sells groceries, including coffee, rather than lending items.",
    "Fast food restaurants often serve coffee but are more focused on sales rather than lending items.",
    "A meeting might not have coffee readily available for borrowing; it would depend on whether coffee is provided there.",
    "Consider the option of borrowing coffee from a friend's house. Friends are likely to share or lend items more informally.",
    "Among the options, a friend's house seems the most accommodating for a borrowing scenario.",
    "All other places focus more on selling rather than lending products, which further supports the idea that a friend's house is the best choice.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all the options, the most viable place to borrow coffee is a friend's house."
