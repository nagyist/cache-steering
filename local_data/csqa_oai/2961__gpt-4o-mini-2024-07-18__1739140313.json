  "steps": [
    "The context mentions a \"courtyard\" of a \"famous palace.\" This suggests a location that is well-known and likely associated with historical or royal significance.",
    "Options A (Spain), B (Versailles), C (courtroom), D (office complex), and E (lawn) are provided. Among these, options C and D seem less likely to be associated with a palace.",
    "A \"courtroom\" (option C) implies a legal setting, which does not fit the description of a palace. An \"office complex\" (option D) is also not indicative of a palace environment.",
    "Both Spain (option A) and Versailles (option B) are associated with palaces. The Palace of Versailles is one of the most famous palaces in the world.",
    "While Spain has many palaces, there is no specific palace referenced; thus, it is less clearly associated than Versailles.",
    "Given the clues about a \"famous palace\" and the distinct association of Versailles with such a term, it becomes evident that this is a strong candidate.",
    "Considering the information gathered, Versailles stands out as the answer that best fits the description."
