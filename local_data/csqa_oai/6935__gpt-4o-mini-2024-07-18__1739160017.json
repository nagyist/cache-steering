  "query": "Question: Where would you get some chocolate if you want to bake a cake?\n\nChoices:\nA: box\nB: supermarket\nC: chicken stall\nD: restaurant\nE: movies",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where baking ingredients, like chocolate, are usually available.",
    "Typically, chocolate for baking is sold in grocery stores or supermarkets, where baking supplies are common.",
    "I consider the other options: a \"box\" does not pertain to a location where one buys ingredients, it's too vague.",
    "A \"chicken stall\" is specific to poultry and does not sell baking ingredients like chocolate.",
    "A \"restaurant\" may sell desserts that contain chocolate, but it is not a place where you typically purchase ingredients for home baking.",
    "\"Movies\" do not sell chocolate in a form suitable for baking; rather, they might sell chocolate as snacks.",
    "Given these considerations, the only feasible location for buying baking chocolate is the supermarket."
