  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the context of the statement that Bill had to pay tax on the full price. This suggests that there are circumstances where tax is calculated based on the price before any adjustments (like discounts or refunds).",
    "Next, let's consider the choices provided. A discount would reduce the effective amount Bill paid, but he still has to pay tax on the original amount. A refund is typically a return of funds after a purchase, and taxes are not adjusted retroactively on previously taxed amounts.",
    "The choice \"less money\" could imply he ended up with less in his pocket, but it does not directly address the tax situation. \"Death and\" is an incomplete phrase and does not seem relevant to the question, while \"free money\" implies he received funds without a transaction, which would not typically incur a tax obligation based on a purchase price.",
    "The most logical choice that aligns with the concept of paying tax on the \"full price\" despite receiving some financial advantage would be \"A: discount.\" A discount does not affect the tax basis, meaning he must pay the tax regardless of the discount\u2019s impact on his out-of-pocket cost.",
    "Therefore, I will validate my reasoning: if he received a discount, he still owes taxes on the original amount rather than the discounted one, supporting that tax applies to total sales price."
