  "query": "Question: Why would a person go to school?\n\nChoices:\nA: party\nB: own house\nC: more leisure time\nD: successful in life\nE: not feel pain",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary purpose of attending school. Generally, people go to school to receive an education, which can lead to various benefits in their personal and professional lives.",
    "Next, analyze the choices given. Choice A (\"party\") does not align with the primary educational purpose of school. While socializing can occur, it is not a main reason for attending.",
    "Choice B (\"own house\") can be a potential result of education, as it may lead to better employment opportunities; however, it is not a direct reason for going to school.",
    "Choice C (\"more leisure time\") does not make sense as an objective of schooling, as education typically requires commitment and studying, which often reduces leisure time rather than increasing it.",
    "Choice D (\"successful in life\") aligns with the common goal of education. An education can lead to success in many aspects of life, including career success and personal growth.",
    "Lastly, choice E (\"not feel pain\") is unrelated to education and does not provide any logical reasoning for attending school.",
    "After evaluating all choices, the strongest rationale for attending school is captured in choice D."
