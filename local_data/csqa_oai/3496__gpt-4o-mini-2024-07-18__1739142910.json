  "query": "Question: He needed to sign the papers, he got his good fountain pen from the sliding what?\n\nChoices:\nA: calligrapher's hand\nB: shirt pocket\nC: desk drawer\nD: portfolio\nE: blotter",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that he needed to retrieve his fountain pen to sign papers.",
    "The words \"sliding what\" suggest that the object from which he retrieved the pen must be something that slides open or closed.",
    "A \"calligrapher's hand\" does not logically fit as it cannot slide, nor is it an object or receptacle.",
    "A \"shirt pocket\" might fit, as a pocket can slide open, but it is less likely to be associated with a fountain pen retrieval context, considering the options.",
    "A \"desk drawer\" is specifically designed to slide open, and it is a common place to store writing instruments like fountain pens.",
    "A \"portfolio\" could also slide open, but it typically contains documents and is less likely to be where a pen is kept.",
    "A \"blotter\" is a flat surface used for writing and absorbing ink and does not make sense as a source for retrieving a pen.",
    "Considering practicality, the most logical location for retrieving a good fountain pen would be from a desk drawer.",
    "After considering all options, \"desk drawer\" is the most appropriate choice based on the clues provided in the question."
