  "query": "Question: What could happen to you if you are cleaning house for only a short time?\n\nChoices:\nA: exhaustion\nB: tiredness\nC: sneezing\nD: order\nE: make money",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of cleaning a house for a short period of time. The duration is a key factor in determining the possible outcomes.",
    "Cleaning for a short duration may not lead to extreme physical exertion, which could typically cause exhaustion.",
    "Tiredness can occur, but since the cleaning is for a short time, it is less likely to be a significant outcome compared to longer cleaning sessions.",
    "While cleaning, one might stir up dust and allergens in a short period, which could lead to sneezing, especially if the area is not well maintained.",
    "Order in the house is likely to improve with any level of cleaning, but this outcome doesn\u2019t exclusively relate to the short time frame.",
    "Making money is generally not a direct result of cleaning a house for a short time unless one has a specific arrangement for payment that is associated with cleaning.",
    "Evaluate which outcomes are most directly related to the nature of cleaning briefly\u2014it appears that sneezing is a likely result from dust and allergens.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting choice based on the reasoning is sneezing, as that is an immediate outcome that could happen quickly during short cleaning sessions."
