  "query": "Question: Where is a telephone booth likely to be red?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: gotham city\nC: london\nD: city\nE: gas stations",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the different locations listed in the options and their associations with telephone booths.",
    "A telephone booth is traditionally associated with urban settings, particularly in cities. This helps limit the options to urban locations.",
    "The color of a telephone booth can provide clues. Red is notably associated with British telephone booths.",
    "Evaluate the specific options: \n- Airport (A) does not specifically have red booths associated with it.\n- Gotham City (B) is fictional and while it may have red booths in adaptations, it's not a real-world location.\n- London (C) is known for its iconic red telephone booths.\n- City (D) is too vague and does not specify a particular city with such booths. \n- Gas stations (E) typically do not have telephone booths at all.",
    "Given the strong cultural reference to London's red telephone booths, this is the most logical association.",
    "Next, double-check if any other choices could realistically contain red telephone booths, but re-confirm that London is the only place with such a specific historic color association.",
    "Weigh the other options: neither the airport nor gas stations are known for telephone booths, and Gotham City is fictitious.",
    "With the analysis complete, it is evident that the answer that best matches the query is London."
