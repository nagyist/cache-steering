  "query": "Question: Where do people go to see animals?\n\nChoices:\nA: surface of earth\nB: state park\nC: zoos\nD: laboratory\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of where animals are typically kept or displayed for public viewing.",
    "Zoos are specifically designed to house and display a variety of animal species for the public to observe and learn about them.",
    "State parks can contain wildlife, but they are not specifically places where animals are confined or regularly displayed for public observation like zoos.",
    "Laboratories may have animals for research and testing purposes, but they are not places for public viewing of animals.",
    "A garden might have some animals, such as birds or insects, but it is not a primary destination for seeing a variety of animals.",
    "The surface of the earth is too broad and general; it does not refer to a specific location where animals can be seen.",
    "Comparing the choices, C (zoos) is the most suitable answer since they are dedicated places for observing a wide range of animals.",
    "The other options do not provide the same level of accessibility or variety in viewing animals as zoos do."
