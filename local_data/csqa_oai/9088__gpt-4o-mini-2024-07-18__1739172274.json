  "query": "Question: Where would you put a car near your house?\n\nChoices:\nA: scrap heap\nB: manual\nC: parking garage\nD: repair shop\nE: driveway",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider the options available for parking a car near a house.",
    "Scrap heap (A) is not a suitable place to put a car if I intend to use it regularly; that is for cars that are out of service or to be disposed of.",
    "Manual (B) does not seem relevant as it's typically a term relating to operating instructions rather than a place to put a car.",
    "A parking garage (C) is a common and practical option for storing a car, especially if it\u2019s designed to keep vehicles safe from the elements.",
    "A repair shop (D) is another potential location, but it implies the car would need repairs, which doesn\u2019t suggest regular, everyday parking.",
    "Driveway (E) is another feasible option, as it typically allows for easy access to the home and is commonly used for parking at residential properties.",
    "I need to weigh the options between the parking garage (C) and driveway (E), as both are good options for regular parking.",
    "The driveway is often where one would park immediately next to their house, especially if they want quick access in and out.",
    "The parking garage is useful for urban areas or homes without a driveway, but it may be less convenient for quick access compared to a driveway.",
    "Since the question specifically asks \"near your house,\" the most logical places would be the driveway or the parking garage. However, the driveway is the more traditional and immediate option for parking close to a residential home."
