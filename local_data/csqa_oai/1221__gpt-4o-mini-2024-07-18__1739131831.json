    "Next, let's look at the choices provided to understand their relevance to being considered good.",
    "Option A, \"compliments,\" implies that a good person acknowledges and uplifts others, which is a positive trait, but it may not fully encompass the broader notion of being \"good.\"",
    "Option B, \"green thumb,\" refers to the ability to grow plants well. While this is a positive skill, it does not inherently reflect moral goodness or contribution to society.",
    "Option C, \"ride horses,\" does not have any clear connection to being good or virtuous; it\u2019s merely a hobby or activity.",
