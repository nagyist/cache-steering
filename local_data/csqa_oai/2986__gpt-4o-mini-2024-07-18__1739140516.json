  "steps": [
    "In medieval times, access to stores as we know them today was limited. Most purchases were made at local markets, which may not have been cheap or easily accessible for a poor family.",
    "Bread was a staple food in the medieval diet, and it could often be made at home with basic ingredients like flour and water. This would likely be a cheap way to satisfy hunger if the family had access to these ingredients.",
    "Bringing home fish could imply fishing or purchasing it from a market. However, fishing would typically require some gear or access to water bodies, while buying fish could be expensive and not readily available for a poor family.",
    "Going to the market would also represent a cost, as it might involve not just the expense of food but also transportation or trade. A poor family may not have enough surplus to visit the market frequently.",
    "Eating a hamburger is anachronistic for a medieval family since hamburgers as known today did not exist during that time period. Hence, this option is irrelevant.",
    "After evaluating all options based on the context of a medieval family, making bread at home stands out as the cheapest and most practical solution to satisfy hunger."
