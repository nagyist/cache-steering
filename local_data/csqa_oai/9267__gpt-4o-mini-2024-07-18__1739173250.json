  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the purpose of bringing coins with me. Coins are generally carried for transactions or storage.",
    "Next, I will eliminate options that don't typically align with carrying coins.",
    "Option A, \"medium\", is ambiguous and does not directly relate to carrying coins.",
    "Option B, \"water fountain\", is a place where coins are often thrown in, not a place to carry them.",
    "Option C, \"wishing well\", is similar to a water fountain, as it\u2019s a place where coins are thrown for wishes, not carried.",
    "Option D, \"desk\", is a static location where you might keep coins, but it doesn't imply carrying them.",
    "Option E, \"purse\", is designed specifically for carrying items, including coins, wherever you go.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, \"purse\" is the only logical place to store coins for transport."
