  "query": "Question: What do I say when I am meeting people for the first time?\n\nChoices:\nA: hugging\nB: introducing yourself\nC: making friends\nD: smiling\nE: shake hands",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the context of meeting someone for the first time. Typically, this involves communication or interaction to establish familiarity.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option in terms of its appropriateness and commonality during a first-time meeting.",
    "Option A, 'hugging', is usually reserved for people who know each other and is not typically the first thing done when meeting someone new.",
    "Option B, 'introducing yourself', is a common social practice and a key aspect of meeting someone for the first time; it involves stating your name and possibly a little about yourself.",
    "Option C, 'making friends', is a broad concept and doesn't refer specifically to what to say during a first encounter. It usually is a goal rather than an action.",
    "Option D, 'smiling', while universally friendly, is more of a non-verbal gesture and doesn't represent a verbal interaction or what you explicitly say.",
    "Option E, 'shake hands', is a common physical gesture during introductions, but it primarily refers to an action rather than what to say.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most relevant and appropriate answer to what to say when meeting people for the first time is 'introducing yourself', as it directly involves communication."
