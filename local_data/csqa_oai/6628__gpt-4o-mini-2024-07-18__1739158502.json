  "query": "Question: Where do you find a rock?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: mountains\nC: farm\nD: countryside\nE: mountain range",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that rocks are naturally occurring solid aggregates of minerals or mineraloids, which means they can be found in various environments.",
    "Next, review the choices to identify where rocks commonly exist.",
    "Analyze choice A: \"ground\". Rocks can indeed be found on the ground, as they are part of the Earth's crust, making this a valid option.",
    "Then, analyze choice B: \"mountains\". Mountains are largely composed of rock, making it another valid location.",
    "Now, evaluate choice C: \"farm\". While farmland might contain rocks, it is not a primary source of rocks compared to other environments listed.",
    "Examine choice D: \"countryside\". This is a broad area that often contains various geological features, including exposed rocks; therefore, it is also a valid option.",
    "Lastly, consider choice E: \"mountain range\". Mountain ranges are made up of many rocks and geological formations, so this is further confirmed as a valid location.",
    "In summary, choices A, B, D, and E are all suitable locations for finding rocks, whereas choice C is less relevant."
