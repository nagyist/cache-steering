  "steps": [
    "The scenario indicates that the car needed to be parked while the crew worked on the driveway. This suggests that the owner could not park the car in a place where it would interfere with the refinishing work.",
    "A parking lot could be a plausible option as it is a designated area for parking vehicles, but it doesn't indicate proximity to the owner's home or driveway.",
    "A street corner is also a possible option, but it could cause inconvenience or obstruction to traffic, making it less likely to be the preferred choice.",
    "Parking \"in Phoenix\" appears to be an option that involves a specific location far from the original context of the driveway. This option seems less relevant since the owner's focus seems to be on convenient parking.",
    "Parking in the garden could be problematic; typically, gardens are not designed to accommodate vehicles. This option is unlikely.",
    "Parking at the neighbor's house could make sense, especially if the neighbor is nearby and the owner has a good relationship with them. It allows for convenient access while keeping the driveway clear.",
    "Considering the context and the need for the car to be parked away from the refinishing area, parking at the neighbor's house seems the most logical solution.",
    "Thus, an analysis of all options leads me to conclude that the best answer is parking the car at the neighbor\u2019s house."
