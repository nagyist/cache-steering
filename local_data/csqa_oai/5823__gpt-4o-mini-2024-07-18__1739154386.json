  "steps": [
    "The term \"little\" generally refers to a small amount or size.",
    "To find the opposite of \"little,\" I need to consider words that imply a larger amount or size.",
    "The word \"least\" (Choice A) refers to the smallest degree, which does not fit as a direct opposite.",
    "The word \"much\" (Choice B) indicates a large quantity but is not a direct antonym for size.",
    "The term \"bog\" (Choice C) does not relate to size or amount at all.",
    "The phrase \"lot of\" (Choice D) suggests a large quantity but isn't a single-word antonym.",
    "The term \"big\" (Choice E) directly contrasts with \"little\" in terms of size, making it a viable opposite.",
    "Now comparing \"big\" and \"lot of,\" \"big\" serves as a clear antonym in size, while \"lot of\" conveys quantity but isn't as straightforward.",
    "Since we\u2019re looking for a single-word antonym, \"big\" fits best among the options provided."
