  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the opposite of something being likened to something else. To liken often means to compare two things based on similarities.",
    "If we consider what it means to liken something, we can infer that the process involves identifying shared characteristics or qualities between two entities.",
    "Therefore, the opposite of likening would involve highlighting differences rather than similarities between the two entities.",
    "Let's examine the answer choices to see which one best reflects the idea of emphasizing differences rather than similarities.",
    "Choice A: \"discern\" generally means to perceive or recognize something, but it doesn't imply a direct opposition to likening.",
    "Choice B: \"distinguish\" means to recognize or point out differences between two or more items, which aligns closely with the concept of contrasting rather than likening.",
    "Choice C: \"metaphor\" is a figure of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. This relates to likening rather than opposing it.",
    "Choice D: \"discriminate\" often refers to recognizing a distinction or differentiating but can carry negative connotations in social contexts; it does not strongly convey an opposition to likening.",
    "Choice E: \"contrast\" explicitly refers to the act of comparing two or more things to show the differences, clearly opposing the act of likening.",
    "Given these considerations, \"contrast\" strongly represents the concept of highlighting differences, making it the best choice as the opposite of likening."
