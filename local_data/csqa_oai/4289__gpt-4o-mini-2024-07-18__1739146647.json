  "query": "Question: Where would you find a window in a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: front door\nB: space shuttle\nC: wall\nD: office\nE: car",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question about where you would find a window in a house, I need to identify locations in a house where windows are typically located.",
    "Considering the structure of a house, windows are generally found in walls. This is their primary placement as they are designed to allow light and air into the rooms.",
    "Next, I review the choices given: \nA: front door - typically does not contain a window, although some doors may have small windows.\nB: space shuttle - not a typical house and more related to spacecraft.\nC: wall - this is where windows are generally located in a house.\nD: office - while offices in houses can have windows, they are not a specific answer to where you would find a window overall.\nE: car - cars can have windows, but they are not part of a house.",
    "From the analysis, the only option that directly corresponds to a part of a house where a window is commonly found is C: wall.",
    "I will double-check the reasoning: windows are installed in walls of houses to provide natural light; therefore, the option that connects windows directly with houses is indeed wall."
