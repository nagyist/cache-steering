  "steps": [
    "The question asks how a series of attributes is typically displayed, indicating we should consider formats or mediums for presenting data.",
    "The options presented include various concepts; some relate to formats and others do not. We need to narrow down which options pertain to display formats.",
    "Option A, \"on-screen,\" implies displaying data on a digital device, which is a valid method for displaying attributes.",
    "Option B, \"calculus,\" and option E, \"calculas,\" refer to mathematical theories and do not pertain to display formats.",
    "Option C, \"description,\" suggests verbal or written representation, which can display attributes but is not a typical method for series.",
    "Option D, \"array,\" refers to a structured format used typically in programming and data representation that can efficiently display attributes in rows and columns.",
    "Now, comparing the relevant options: \"on-screen\" suggests a medium while \"array\" suggests a formatting method for data display.",
    "\u201cArray\u201d is a specific way of organizing data that is widely recognized in technology and computing domains, making it a strong candidate for how attributes are displayed.",
    "While \"on-screen\" does imply a method of display, it is more general and does not provide specificity on how the attributes are organized as an \"array\" would.",
    "Therefore, in terms of typical data arrangement and display of attributes, \"array\" stands out as the most relevant answer."
