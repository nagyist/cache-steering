  "query": "Question: Where is a good place for a window in a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: restroom\nB: building\nC: wall\nD: classroom\nE: space shuttle",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what a \"good place for a window\" means in the context of a house.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option to determine if it represents a suitable location for a window.",
    "Option A suggests a \"restroom.\" While windows can be installed in restrooms for ventilation and natural light, they are not always present or considered ideal due to privacy concerns.",
    "Option B suggests a \"building.\" While buildings can have windows, this option is too general and not specific to a location within a house.",
    "Option C suggests a \"wall.\" Walls are the primary surfaces where windows are commonly installed in houses, making this a valid option.",
    "Option D suggests a \"classroom.\" Classrooms can have windows, but this option is also too specific and not relevant to a house.",
    "Option E suggests a \"space shuttle.\" Windows in space shuttles are designed for a vastly different environment and functionality, making this option irrelevant for a house.",
    "I can confirm that \u201cwall\u201d is a broad term for the structural location of windows in many rooms of a house.",
    "No other option aligns so well with the general trait of where windows are found in houses compared to \"wall.\""
