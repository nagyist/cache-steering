  "query": "Question: James saw a Koala while driving to work. Where might James live?\n\nChoices:\nA: wilderness\nB: queensland\nC: great outdoors\nD: jungle\nE: austrailia",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the native habitat of koalas. Koalas are primarily found in Australia, specifically in eucalyptus forests in the coastal regions of the eastern and southeastern parts of the country.",
    "Next, I eliminate option A (wilderness) because it's too vague and doesn't specifically indicate Australia, where koalas are native.",
    "Then, I look at option B (Queensland) and note that Queensland, being a state in Australia, is indeed a place where koalas can be found.",
    "I further analyze option C (great outdoors). While koalas are part of the great outdoors in general, this option does not specify a location linked directly to koalas.",
    "Next, I consider option D (jungle). This is not applicable as koalas do not inhabit jungle environments; they live in eucalyptus forests.",
    "Finally, option E (Australia) is quite broad but still accurate, as koalas are native to Australia and are commonly associated with this country.",
    "Now I need to determine the most sensible option. While both B (Queensland) and E (Australia) could be correct, Queensland is a specific region within Australia and directly indicates James\u2019s location relative to where he saw a koala.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the best answer concerning where James might live, given his direct encounter with a koala, would be option B (Queensland)."
