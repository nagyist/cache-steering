  "query": "Question: The robber wanted to conceal his pistol, where did he put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: police station\nB: war\nC: police officer's belt\nD: river\nE: pants",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine where a robber would likely hide a pistol to conceal it effectively.",
    "Considering the choices, a police station would not be a reasonable hiding place since it is a highly secured area.",
    "Choosing \"war\" as a hiding place is not plausible; it doesn't represent a specific physical location where one could hide a gun.",
    "A police officer's belt is a practical place for an officer, but it would not serve as a hiding place for a robber trying to conceal a pistol.",
    "A river would not typically be a practical choice for hiding something since it can easily be found or swept away, making it less likely for concealment.",
    "Hiding the pistol in pants seems plausible as it could be hidden within the garment, making it less visible to others.",
    "Thinking further about the overall context, a robber would aim to keep the concealed weapon accessible while trying to avoid detection.",
    "Thus, out of all choices, placing the pistol in pants seems the most typical method to effectively conceal a weapon.",
    "After analyzing all options, I conclude that \"pants\" is the best answer for where the robber concealed his pistol."
