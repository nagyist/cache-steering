  "query": "Question: Why might someone avoid getting a new car?\n\nChoices:\nA: move quickly\nB: go fast\nC: cost money\nD: crash\nE: slow down",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a reason someone might avoid getting a new car.",
    "One potential reason could be financial; purchasing a new car typically involves a significant expense.",
    "Option C states \"cost money,\" which directly relates to the financial burden of a new car purchase.",
    "Options A, B, D, and E do not seem to connect directly to the idea of avoidance due to the implications of expense or financial commitment.",
    "\"Move quickly\" and \"go fast\" seem to focus on speed, irrelevant to the choice of whether to buy a car or not.",
    "\"Crash\" implies a risk associated with driving rather than a reason to avoid buying a new car.",
    "\"Slow down\" also doesn't connect well with the rationale for avoiding a purchase.",
    "Given that the primary concern for avoidance in this context revolves around financial implications, \"cost money\" is clearly the relevant option."
