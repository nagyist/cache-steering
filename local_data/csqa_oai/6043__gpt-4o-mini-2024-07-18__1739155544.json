  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes a bird that was flying and landed on a branch. The context of landing suggests looking for a physical attribute that helps the bird land.",
    "Considering the choices, \"having for pet\" (A) doesn't fit the context of landing on a branch.",
    "\"Falling down\" (B) is not something the bird would use to land; it seems more like an action rather than a physical attribute.",
    "\"Feathers\" (C) are part of the bird's body and are essential for flying, but they are not the main attribute to support landing.",
    "\"Two legs\" (D) could be a possible choice since birds land using their legs.",
    "\"Two wings\" (E) suggests the bird's means of flying and it wouldn't land on wings.",
    "Between the options D (two legs) and C (feathers), considering that the bird uses its legs to perch on a branch, legs are the most relevant attribute for landing.",
    "Thus, the answer must be focused on how birds physically interact with branches when landing."
