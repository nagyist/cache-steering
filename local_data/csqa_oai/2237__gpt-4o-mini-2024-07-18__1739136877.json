  "query": "Question: John spent time relaxing because  he was told he needed to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: relax\nB: lower blood pressure\nC: feel happy\nD: lie back\nE: sleeping",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the core reason why John decided to relax. The question states he was told he \"needed to do\" something.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"relax\" and \"lie back\" both suggest the act of relaxing, while \"lower blood pressure,\" \"feel happy,\" and \"sleeping\" imply outcomes or states that could be beneficial from relaxation.",
    "\"Lower blood pressure\" is a health-related command that fits as a reason for relaxation.",
    "\"Feel happy\" could also be a motivational reason for wanting to relax, but it is more of a goal rather than a directive.",
    "\"Relax\" and \"lie back\" are instructions that imply what John should do to achieve relaxation but do not explain why he was instructed to relax.",
    "Considering the phrase \"needed to do,\" it suggests a necessity for a specific health-related reason rather than just the act itself.",
    "\"Lower blood pressure\" stands out because it is a valid health-conscious instruction that necessitates relaxation.",
    "The other options generally describe outcomes of relaxing but not direct reasons for why he was advised to relax.",
    "Thus, the most plausible option that fits the context of being told to do something for health benefits is \"lower blood pressure.\"",
    "Cross-referencing all options, it confirms that A, C, D, and E do not directly point to a necessity for relaxation in the way that B does."
