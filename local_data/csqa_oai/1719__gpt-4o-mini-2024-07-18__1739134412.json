  "query": "Question: When a person is living on the streets they likely what?\n\nChoices:\nA: shameful\nB: ridiculous\nC: lazy\nD: restricted\nE: have no home",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the situation of a person living on the streets. This generally implies they do not have stable housing.",
    "Next, examine the implications of living on the streets. It suggests a lack of resources or options for stable living arrangements.",
    "Now, look at the choices provided. \"A: shameful\" does not directly describe their living situation; shame is more of a subjective judgment.",
    "The option \"B: ridiculous\" also does not logically connect to the realities of living on the streets. It suggests a lack of seriousness, which isn't applicable.",
    "Explore \"C: lazy.\" This is a stereotype that does not accurately reflect the complex reasons individuals may live on the streets, such as economic hardship, mental health issues, or lack of support systems.",
    "Now, analyze \"D: restricted.\" While living on the streets can entail certain restrictions, this does not encapsulate the fundamental situation of not having a home.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"E: have no home.\" This is a straightforward reflection of the situation of someone living on the streets, as they indeed lack a permanent residence."
