  "query": "Question: If you're traveling, you must be doing what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fatigue\nB: going somewhere\nC: exhilarating\nD: crying\nE: diarrhea",
  "steps": [
    "First, when traveling, the primary action involved is usually the act of moving from one location to another.",
    "Second, the term \"traveling\" inherently implies that you are departing from a starting point and progressing towards a destination.",
    "Third, \"going somewhere\" logically fits with the definition of traveling, as it signifies the movement involved in the act.",
    "Fourth, options A (fatigue), C (exhilarating), D (crying), and E (diarrhea) do not describe the core action of traveling.",
    "Fifth, fatigue, exhilaration, crying, and diarrhea may be feelings or conditions experienced during travel, but they do not adequately define the action of traveling itself.",
    "Sixth, narrowing down the choices, B (going somewhere) directly correlates with the most fundamental aspect of travel.",
    "Seventh, we can consider that in any instance of traveling, regardless of the purpose, an individual is indeed going somewhere.",
    "Eighth, therefore, it is logical to conclude that the correct answer links directly to the action related to the journey taken during travel.",
    "Ninth, the choice B aligns perfectly as it strictly answers the question posed.",
    "Tenth, reaffirming that all other options don't define travel nor represent essential actions taken when on a journey."
