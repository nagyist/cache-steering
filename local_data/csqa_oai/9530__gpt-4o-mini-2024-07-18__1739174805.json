  "query": "Question: The catwalk was five stories up and exposed, everybody had to wear helmets and harnesses at the where?\n\nChoices:\nA: mountain\nB: construction site\nC: theatre\nD: fieldhouse\nE: fashion show",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"five stories up\" suggests a high elevation which commonly indicates a vertical structure like a building.",
    "The use of \"helmets and harnesses\" implies a setting where safety gear is necessary due to risks associated with height, which narrows it down to a risky environment.",
    "A mountain would suggest an outdoor setting where climbers need equipment, but this context seems more structured and built.",
    "A construction site fits the description as it often involves high elevation work and safety equipment is a must due to the risk of falls.",
    "Theatre typically does not require harnesses unless referring to specific rigging work which isn\u2019t mentioned here.",
    "A fieldhouse usually refers to a sports facility and is unlikely to have catwalks elevated like this.",
    "A fashion show does have catwalks, but typically does not require helmets and harnesses, making it less likely as the right answer.",
    "Reviewing the conditions, the environment where the catwalk is mentioned aligns closely with the characteristics of a construction site rather than the other options."
