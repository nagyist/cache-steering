  "query": "Question: What do you want to do when you go to performance that is interactive?\n\nChoices:\nA: know where\nB: leave\nC: experience\nD: applaud\nE: admiration",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about something one would want to do at an interactive performance.",
    "An interactive performance typically involves audience participation or engagement, suggesting that a passive role (like just watching) wouldn\u2019t be the aim.",
    "Choice A (\"know where\") isn't related to actions typically associated with engagement in a performance, as it suggests more about information rather than participation.",
    "Choice B (\"leave\") is contrary to the idea of wanting to engage; if someone leaves, they are not participating.",
    "Choice D (\"applaud\") indicates appreciation but does not reflect interactive behavior; applause is usually a response after the action rather than during it.",
    "Choice E (\"admiration\") suggests appreciation as well but does not imply an active role; it\u2019s more about a feeling than an action.",
    "Choice C (\"experience\") directly relates to the idea of engaging actively with the performance; it reflects participating and immersing oneself in the interactive aspect.",
    "Among the choices, only \"experience\" fits the context of wanting to engage interactively in a performance."
