  "query": "Question: They began moving car with their bare hands to save the child trapped underneath, nobody could explain where they got the what to do so?\n\nChoices:\nA: strength\nB: energy\nC: force\nD: drive\nE: mood",
  "steps": [
    "The situation involves people attempting to lift a car with their bare hands, which implies a sudden exertion of physical capability.",
    "The phrase \"nobody could explain where they got the what to do\" suggests that the needed attribute was unexpected and not rationally derived from their circumstances.",
    "The act of lifting a heavy object like a car requires significant physical effort, which is typically associated with strength.",
    "Energy and drive also come to mind, but they are not as directly indicative of the physical capability to lift an object.",
    "Mood is unlikely to be a contributing factor as it does not relate to the physical act or capacity to lift.",
    "Force can refer to the exerted physical strength but can also be ambiguous as it aligns with physics terminology rather than human action.",
    "Between strength, energy, force, drive, and mood, the most applicable term in the context of human ability to physically lift a heavy object is strength.",
    "Considering common language usage, \"strength\" is often used to describe the physical capability to perform such demanding tasks.",
    "Therefore, the final choice that best fits the question's context is A: strength."
