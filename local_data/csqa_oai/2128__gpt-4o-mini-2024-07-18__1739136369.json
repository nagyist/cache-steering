  "query": "Question: Where is a corner shop selling derby souvenirs likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: kentucky\nB: england\nC: india\nD: iowa\nE: town",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what \"derby\" refers to. It commonly signifies a horse race but can also refer to local events in several places, most notably the Kentucky Derby, which is a famous horse race held in Louisville, Kentucky.",
    "Next, considering that derby souvenirs would likely relate to horse racing, we should focus on locations that are known for horse racing events or have significance in derby culture.",
    "Now, looking at the choices: \n- Kentucky (A) is directly associated with the Kentucky Derby.\n- England (B) has a history of horse racing but is not specifically tied to the term \"derby\" in the same way that Kentucky is.\n- India (C) doesn't have a strong association with derby events.\n- Iowa (D) is not particularly known for significant horse racing events or derbies.\n- Town (E) is too vague and does not specifically indicate a geographic area relevant for derby souvenirs.",
    "Given that the strongest association with \"derby\" and souvenirs comes from Kentucky due to the Kentucky Derby, a corner shop selling derby souvenirs is likely to be located there.",
    "Even though England has a history of horse racing, the term \"derby\" in a souvenir context is most popularly linked with Kentucky.",
    "Thus, the location most fitting for a corner shop selling derby souvenirs is definitely Kentucky, as it is the most recognized and culturally relevant option."
