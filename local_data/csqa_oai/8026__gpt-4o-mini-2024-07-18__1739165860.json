  "query": "Question: He had done wrong, he felt everybody judging him and began what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being judged\nB: hurt feelings\nC: go to jail\nD: feeling guilty\nE: apologetic",
  "steps": [
    "The statement indicates that he acknowledges his wrongdoing, which implies he is self-aware.",
    "The feeling of being judged suggests a possible emotional response to the perception of others' opinions about him.",
    "Feeling guilt is a common reaction when one believes they have done something wrong and is aware of judgment from others.",
    "The choices provided offer various emotional and situational responses (A: being judged, B: hurt feelings, C: go to jail, D: feeling guilty, E: apologetic).",
    "\"Being judged\" (A) suggests the ongoing process rather than an emotional response. It does not align well with the idea that he began something.",
    "\"Hurt feelings\" (B) could be a response to judgment but focuses on his feelings rather than an action prompting change in behavior.",
    "\"Go to jail\" (C) seems extreme and situationally specific; it may not apply unless a criminal aspect is confirmed, which is not stated.",
    "\"Feeling guilty\" (D) captures the essence of his emotional state after recognizing his wrongdoing.",
    "\"Apologetic\" (E) suggests a potential action he might take (apologizing), which logically connects but may not be his immediate emotional response.",
    "Choosing between feeling guilty and being apologetic, \"feeling guilty\" aligns with the emotional turmoil described in the statement."
