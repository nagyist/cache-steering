  "query": "Question: If you're in North America traveling an expressway toward the Atlantic Ocean, where are you traveling to?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: large city\nC: state\nD: american city\nE: eastern united states",
  "steps": [
    "If I am traveling on an expressway toward the Atlantic Ocean, I know that the Atlantic Ocean is located on the eastern coast of North America.",
    "We need to consider what geographical areas can be reached if traveling toward the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "Traveling east from a central point in North America would logically lead to regions that are part of the eastern United States.",
    "Among the answer choices provided, I should determine which ones align with this geographic concept.",
    "Choice A (michigan) is incorrect because Michigan is primarily located in the northern parts of the Midwest and doesn't directly lead to the Atlantic.",
    "Choice B (large city) is too vague and does not specifically indicate one entity.",
    "Choice C (state) is not specific enough as there are multiple states in the eastern U.S.",
    "Choice D (american city) is again too vague, as there are many American cities in the eastern part of the country.",
    "Choice E (eastern united states) is the most accurate since it encompasses all geographic regions toward the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "Thus, my final choice that accurately represents the direction toward the Atlantic Ocean in terms of geographic classification will be option E."
