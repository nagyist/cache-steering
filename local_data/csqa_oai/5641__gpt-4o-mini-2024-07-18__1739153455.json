  "query": "Question: James picked glass walls because they let more light into the room. Why did they let light in?\n\nChoices:\nA: inventive\nB: half empty\nC: recyclable\nD: clear\nE: very fragile",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking why glass walls allow more light into a room.",
    "To understand this, we need to consider the properties of glass.",
    "Glass is a transparent material, meaning it allows light to pass through it.",
    "This transparency lets natural light enter the room, making it brighter.",
    "Next, we examine the provided answer choices to see which relates to glass allowing light in.",
    "Choice A, \"inventive,\" doesn't relate to the transparency of glass.",
    "Choice B, \"half empty,\" is not relevant to the physical properties of glass.",
    "Choice C, \"recyclable,\" refers to glass's ability to be recycled, not its transparency.",
    "Choice D, \"clear,\" directly describes glass's transparency.",
    "Choice E, \"very fragile,\" pertains to glass's durability but not its light permeability.",
    "The choice that best explains why glass walls let light in is \"clear.\""
