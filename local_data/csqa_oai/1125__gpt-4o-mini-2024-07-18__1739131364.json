  "query": "Question: What is water rapids that are choppy considered?\n\nChoices:\nA: blue\nB: dangerous\nC: surface of earth\nD: shaky\nE: important",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a specific characteristic of water rapids that are choppy.",
    "Choppy water rapids typically occur due to fast-moving currents and obstacles that disturb the water's surface.",
    "Choppy water can create instability, making it difficult to navigate.",
    "This instability poses risks, which leads to the questioning of whether the rapids can be classified as dangerous due to these conditions.",
    "Reviewing the options: A (blue) does not relate to the choppiness or quality of rapids; B (dangerous) directly addresses the risk factor; C (surface of earth) is a broad category that does not specify characteristics; D (shaky) is a synonym for unstable but less specific; E (important) does not fit the context.",
    "Among the options, 'dangerous' accurately describes the risks associated with choppy rapids.",
    "'Shaky' could describe the physical state but does not encapsulate the inherent risk.",
    "Thus, the most fitting word that describes choppy water rapids is related to their potential threat level."
