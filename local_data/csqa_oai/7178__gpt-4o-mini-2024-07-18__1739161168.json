    "The question discusses the perception that helping those in need may hinder their ability to help themselves.",
    "This notion suggests that when assistance is given, individuals may become reliant on that support rather than finding their own solutions.",
    "The key term in the question is \"dependence,\" which refers to the state of relying on someone or something for support.",
    "Analyzing the answer choices, we consider which option aligns with the idea of reduced self-sufficiency due to assistance.",
    "Option A, \"good will,\" does not directly relate to the concept of losing the ability to assist oneself.",
    "Option B, \"helpfulness,\" also does not correspond to the notion of reducing self-reliance.",
    "Option C, \"dependence,\" clearly reflects the concern that helping others might make them reliant on assistance, thus eroding their capability to help themselves.",
    "Option D, \"smiles,\" seems unrelated as it pertains to emotional responses rather than the ability to assist oneself.",
    "Option E, \"problems,\" could be a broad concern but does not specifically address the direct relationship between assistance and self-sufficiency.",
    "Upon thorough evaluation, the only answer that directly correlates to the concept of losing the ability to help oneself due to received assistance is \"dependence.\""
