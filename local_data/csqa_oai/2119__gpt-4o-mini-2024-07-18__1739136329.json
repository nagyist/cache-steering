  "query": "Question: Superman refuses to kill.  He does this because he feels that every life is what?\n\nChoices:\nA: short\nB: finite\nC: important\nD: good\nE: created",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider Superman's moral philosophy. He is known for upholding a strong ethical code, which includes the refusal to kill. This suggests he values life highly.",
    "Next, think about why someone would refuse to take a life. Typically, this would stem from a belief that the life in question has significant value or importance.",
    "Now, analyze the choices provided: \n- A (short): This doesn\u2019t logically tie into why he wouldn't kill.\n- B (finite): While life is finite, this does not directly address his moral stance on killing.\n- C (important): This aligns with the idea that each life has inherent value, which could motivate someone to refuse to kill.\n- D (good): This could apply but is less specific than 'important'.\n- E (created): This implies a belief in the sanctity of life but isn't as direct as 'important'.",
    "From the analysis, \u201cimportant\u201d (C) stands out as the most fitting reason why Superman would refuse to take a life\u2014he sees each life as holding great value.",
    "Now, double-check the reasoning: if Superman believes every life is \"important,\" it justifies his refusal to end lives and aligns well with his character principles.",
    "Lastly, reaffirming that the refusal to kill is rooted in a belief in the importance of every individual life leads to the conclusion that this choice strongly reflects Superman's ethos."
