  "query": "Question: What would you open to find a bottle of glue?\n\nChoices:\nA: classroom\nB: desk drawer\nC: school\nD: closed container\nE: a barrel.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where glue is commonly used. Glue is typically used in school projects or crafts.",
    "Next, identify specific locations where glue might be found in the context of a school or classroom setting.",
    "Classrooms often have supplies like glue available for students to use during art projects or other assignments.",
    "A desk drawer is also a likely place to find glue, especially if it's a personal desk where one might store commonly used supplies.",
    "Examine the options provided: A classroom is a location where glue is often found, as are desk drawers.",
    "The option \"school\" is broader than \"classroom\" and does not specify a particular place like a desk drawer.",
    "The option \"closed container\" is too vague and could refer to any number of items not specifically related to glue.",
    "The option \"a barrel\" seems unlikely, as barrels are not typically associated with glue storage in everyday situations.",
    "Having analyzed the choices, it seems that both \"classroom\" and \"desk drawer\" are reasonable places to find a bottle of glue. However, a desk drawer is more specific."
