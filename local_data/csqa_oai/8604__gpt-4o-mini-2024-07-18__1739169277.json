  "query": "Question: Ben was usually an eloquent speaker, but this time he had difficulty reading the words on the teleprompter, so he did much what?\n\nChoices:\nA: stammering\nB: maundering\nC: speechless\nD: talking\nE: tongueless",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is implied by Ben usually being an eloquent speaker. This means he is typically articulate and capable of expressing himself well in speech.",
    "Next, analyze the situation where Ben had difficulty reading the words on the teleprompter. This suggests that he struggled to communicate effectively this time.",
    "Now, look at the options provided. The term \"stammering\" refers to speaking with sudden involuntary pauses and a tendency to repeat the initial letters of words, which could fit Ben's struggle.",
    "The term \"maundering\" means to talk in a rambling manner, which does not directly relate to experiencing difficulty reading and speaking.",
    "The word \"speechless\" suggests being unable to speak at all, which is not accurate since he was attempting to speak but facing difficulties.",
    "The option \"talking\" is too general and does not explicitly reflect the difficulty he was facing.",
    "Lastly, \"tongueless\" implies a complete inability to talk, which again is not the case here since he was trying to read from the teleprompter.",
    "Given the context of Ben's situation and his struggle to speak eloquently, the best choice is \"stammering,\" as it directly relates to difficulty in verbal expression under pressure."
