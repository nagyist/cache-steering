  "steps": [
    "Identify what gasoline is and common places associated with it. Gasoline is a petroleum product used primarily as fuel in internal combustion engines.",
    "Consider the context of the question. It asks about locations where gasoline can be obtained.",
    "Evaluate option A: power mower. A power mower may use gasoline, but it is not a place where gasoline can be acquired.",
    "Evaluate option B: boat. While boats may use gasoline, similar to the power mower, a boat is not a location where gasoline is obtained.",
    "Evaluate option C: refineries. Refineries are facilities that process crude oil into gasoline and other products. However, gasoline is usually not sold directly to the public at refineries.",
    "Evaluate option D: gas station. Gas stations are specifically designed to sell gasoline to consumers and are a common, accessible location for this fuel.",
    "Evaluate option E: oil rig. Oil rigs are offshore or onshore structures where oil is extracted, and they do not serve as a direct point of sale for gasoline.",
    "From the evaluation, the only location listed that sells gasoline directly to consumers is the gas station."
