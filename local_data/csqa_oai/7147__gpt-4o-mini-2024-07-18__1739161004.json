  "query": "Question: Where is a white rat likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: laboratory\nC: roof\nD: cellar\nE: sewers",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the habitats and environments where white rats are commonly found. White rats are often used in scientific research and are bred specifically for laboratory use.",
    "Analyze the options given: A kitchen is primarily a human living space and not where you'd find a rat, especially not in a formal or controlled setting.",
    "The roof is typically not a common place for a white rat to inhabit, as they prefer environments where food, moisture, and shelter are readily available.",
    "A cellar may provide shelter and some food sources, but it's more common for wild rats rather than specifically white rats, which are bred for laboratories.",
    "Sewers are often associated with wild rats, especially in urban environments, which are not habitats for domesticated white rats.",
    "The laboratory setting is specifically designed for the breeding and research involving white rats, making it the most suitable and likely location among the given options.",
    "Since all other options are less likely or completely unsuitable, the most rational conclusion is that a white rat is likely to be in a laboratory."
