  "query": "Question: I put up a railing to make sure I don't fall at my house, but now when I sit outside it blocks my view, what am I sitting on?\n\nChoices:\nA: deck\nB: stairwell\nC: house\nD: lawn\nE: flight of stairs",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a railing that is installed to prevent falls, which suggests the person is in an elevated area that requires safety measures, typically found on a deck or stairwell.",
    "Since the railing is blocking the view while sitting outside, it indicates that the person is at a location where they can sit down and have a view, such as a deck or a lawn.",
    "A \"deck\" is often built at an elevated level where railings are common. It is typically an outdoor space for sitting and can provide a view of the surroundings.",
    "On the other hand, a \"lawn\" is ground level and does not usually have railings. If the person was on the lawn, the railing wouldn\u2019t block their view as mentioned.",
    "Considering \"stairwell\" and \"flight of stairs,\" these would imply a vertical utility rather than a sitting area, making them less likely for the context of sitting outside.",
    "The remaining options are \"house\" and \"deck.\" Sitting on the house doesn't make sense in this context as one typically does not sit \"on\" a house.",
    "Therefore, the only option that explains both the need for the railing (to prevent falls) and the situation of sitting outside is a \"deck.\""
