  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the teacher was explaining the mammoth and the time it lived, and it specifies that he used terms that are foreign to the students. This implies that the term should be a scientific term or a specific time period rather than a more common or vague reference.",
    "Looking at the options provided, \"pleistocene\" is a scientific term that refers to a specific geological epoch known for the existence of mammoths. This aligns with the context of teaching about mammoths and distinct historical periods.",
    "The other options, such as \"museum of natural history\" and \"smithsonian institution,\" are proper nouns and refer to specific institutions rather than scientific terms or epochs. These would not fit the description of being foreign to students in the context of explaining a time period.",
    "\"Antarctica\" refers to a geographical location and does not directly relate to the context of the mammoth's time compared to the Pleistocene epoch.",
    "\"Old times\" is a very vague term and does not provide specific information or relate scientifically to the study of mammals like the mammoth. It is not suitable in this context either.",
    "Since we are looking for a scientific term related to the period in which mammoths lived, \"pleistocene\" is the only appropriate option."
