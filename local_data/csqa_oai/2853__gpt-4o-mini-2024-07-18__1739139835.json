  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what the question is asking: \"Where could you see a bone?\" This indicates we are looking for a location or entity where bones can be observed.",
    "Next, we analyze each of the choices provided. \"Museum\" typically features displays that may include bones, particularly those of dinosaurs or other ancient creatures.",
    "\"Vertebrates\" refers to a group of animals and does not indicate a specific location where one could physically see a bone. It is broad and encompasses many species but does not fit the query directly.",
    "The option \"cow\" suggests a type of animal that has bones, but it does not specify a context or location for seeing a bone; seeing a cow does not guarantee seeing a bone.",
    "\"Texas\" is a geographical location which on its own does not imply that one would see a bone specifically. While Texas may have places where bones can be seen (like a museum), it remains too vague.",
    "\"Arm\" refers to a part of a human body which certainly contains bones but does not answer the question about where one could see a bone in the broader or general context.",
    "Now, let's compare the analyzed options. The \"museum\" is dedicated to education and display, making it the most likely choice to see a bone in a coherent context.",
    "The rest of the options do not explicitly provide a location or appropriate context to see a bone as clearly as the \"museum\" does.",
    "Having gone through the reasoning, the clear choice stands out as \"museum.\" This is the best and most direct answer."
