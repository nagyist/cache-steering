  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to find an art gallery?\n\nChoices:\nA: london\nB: downtown area\nC: large city\nD: middle of town\nE: frankfurt",
  "steps": [
    "An art gallery is typically located in areas where there is a high concentration of culture, art, and tourism.",
    "Large cities tend to have more art galleries compared to smaller towns due to higher population and affluent communities.",
    "The choices given include specific and general locations like \"London,\" \"Frankfurt,\" and \"large city.\"",
    "While \"London\" (A) and \"Frankfurt\" (E) are specific cities known to have art galleries, they don't encompass all possible locations where art galleries could be found.",
    "The option \"downtown area\" (B) generally refers to a central business district which is usually associated with multiple amenities, including art galleries.",
    "The term \"middle of town\" (D) is more ambiguous but also suggests a central location where art galleries could be present.",
    "Considering that many art galleries thrive in urban settings, the option \"large city\" (C) is the most inclusive and all-encompassing choice.",
    "Therefore, since art galleries can be found in various large cities around the world, it makes \"large city\" the best answer overall."
