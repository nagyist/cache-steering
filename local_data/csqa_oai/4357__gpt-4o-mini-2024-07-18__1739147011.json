  "query": "Question: I get hot when I run, so what am is my body likely to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: searching for oxygen\nB: tiredness\nC: shortness of breath\nD: exhaustion\nE: sweating",
  "steps": [
    "When I run, my body requires more energy, which generates heat as a byproduct of increased metabolic activity.",
    "As my body temperature rises, it needs to cool itself down to maintain a safe internal temperature.",
    "One of the primary methods my body uses to cool down is through the process of sweating.",
    "Sweating involves the secretion of moisture on the skin's surface, which evaporates and helps to dissipate heat.",
    "While I may also experience tiredness or exhaustion from running, these are not direct physiological responses to overheating.",
    "Shortness of breath could occur due to increased physical exertion but is not a direct response to heat regulation.",
    "The sensation of needing more oxygen during exertion also does not directly correlate with getting hot; it\u2019s a result of using more energy.",
    "Thus, the most straightforward and immediate physiological response to getting hot when I run is sweating."
