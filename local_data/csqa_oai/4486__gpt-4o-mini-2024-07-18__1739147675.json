  "query": "Question: Joe got his kid a plush bald Eagle.  Where did he probably get it from?\n\nChoices:\nA: pet shop\nB: great outdoors\nC: nature reserve\nD: canada\nE: toy store",
  "steps": [
    "The item in question is a plush bald eagle, which is a toy that resembles an eagle. Therefore, the location where Joe likely acquired it should be a place that sells toys or similar items.",
    "A pet shop typically sells live animals and pet-related items, not plush toys, so it is an unlikely source for a plush bald eagle.",
    "The \"great outdoors\" refers to natural environments, such as parks, forests, or wilderness areas, which wouldn't sell toys like a plush eagle. Hence, it's not a probable place to acquire this item.",
    "A nature reserve may focus on conservation and education about wildlife. Although it might have gift shops, plush toys likely wouldn\u2019t be the main merchandise found there.",
    "Canada is a country where bald eagles are found in the wild, but this does not directly relate to a place to buy a plush toy. Therefore, this option can be ruled out as well.",
    "A toy store is a place specifically designed to sell toys, including plush items. This would be the most logical place for Joe to buy a plush bald eagle.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the only location directly related to selling a plush bald eagle is the toy store.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is that Joe got the plush bald eagle from a toy store."
