  "query": "Question: When the farmer was reproducing sheep, what did one sheep give later?\n\nChoices:\nA: fun\nB: wool\nC: birth\nD: larger family\nE: problems",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine what the primary function of a sheep is when it is being bred by a farmer. Generally, farmers breed sheep primarily for specific agricultural products or for reproduction.",
    "Considering the choices provided, we can identify which options are relevant to the outcomes of sheep reproduction.",
    "Option A: fun - This is not a tangible outcome related to reproduction.",
    "Option B: wool - While sheep do provide wool, it is not a direct product of reproduction; rather, it is a by-product of their growth and maintenance.",
    "Option C: birth - This directly correlates to the process of reproduction, as breeding sheep typically leads to the birth of lambs.",
    "Option D: larger family - While breeding does expand the number of sheep in a flock, it is more of an indirect description and not a direct outcome of a single sheep's contribution.",
    "Option E: problems - This is subjective and does not directly reflect the product of sheep reproduction.",
    "Analyzing the most direct and relevant outcome of sheep reproduction, \"birth\" matches perfectly since it indicates what one sheep can give in the context of reproduction."
