  "query": "Question: I needed my jeans washed when my electricity was cut off, where did I go?\n\nChoices:\nA: thrift store\nB: clothing store\nC: costume shop\nD: shopping mall\nE: laundromat",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the person needed their jeans washed, which implies a need for cleaning or laundering services.",
    "The electricity being cut off indicates that the person may not be able to use home appliances like a washing machine. Therefore, they must seek an alternative place for washing their jeans.",
    "A thrift store typically sells second-hand clothing but does not offer laundry services, so it is not a suitable option.",
    "A clothing store sells new apparel and accessories but also does not provide laundering services, making it an irrelevant choice.",
    "A costume shop specializes in costumes and theatrical clothing and would not provide laundry services for regular jeans.",
    "A shopping mall hosts various stores and services, but it is not specifically known for laundry services. Although some malls may have laundromats, it's not a direct answer to the need for washing clothing.",
    "A laundromat is a facility specifically designed for washing clothes, allowing people to wash, dry, and sometimes fold their laundry without needing electricity at home.",
    "Since the requirement was to wash jeans and the facilities of a laundromat align perfectly with that need, it stands out as the best choice.",
    "Going through all the options, the laundromat is the only place that directly addresses the need for getting jeans washed due to the lack of electricity."
