    "The act of receiving letters from strangers could imply a sense of connection, support, or care, which often evokes positive emotions.",
    "Considering the choices, \"strain\" suggests stress, which does not align with a heartfelt response to letters of support.",

    "\"Realization\" could imply an understanding of something deeper but lacks the emotional connotation tied to receiving letters.",
    "\"Get news\" seems less relevant since the question focuses mainly on feelings rather than information.",
