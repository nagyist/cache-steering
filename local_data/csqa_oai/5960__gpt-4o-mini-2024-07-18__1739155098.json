  "steps": [
    "First, I need to clarify what is meant by the term \"Blue Mountain\" in the context of the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
    "The Blue Ridge Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountain range and extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania.",
    "I need to consider each of the answer choices to determine where \"Blue Mountain,\" specifically named as such, is located.",
    "Looking at choice A, the Appalachians is a broader range that includes the Blue Ridge Mountains but does not specify a state.",
    "Next, I check choice B, Virginia, which contains portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains but is not known for \"Blue Mountain.\"",
    "Choice C, Pennsylvania, has a specific area called Blue Mountain, which is part of the Appalachian range.",
    "For choice D, North Carolina also contains parts of the Blue Ridge but does not commonly refer to any part of it as \"Blue Mountain.\"",
    "Lastly, in choice E, Montana is too far west and has no relation to the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
    "After evaluating all the options, Pennsylvania stands out since it explicitly has \"Blue Mountain\" identified within its boundaries."
