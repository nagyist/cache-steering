  "steps": [
    "We are tasked with identifying a term that describes the situation of waiting for a bus that has already come and gone.",
    "The scenario implies a failure to synchronize one's action (waiting) with the bus schedule, indicating some issue with timing.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"timing\" directly relates to the notion of being in the right place at the right time.",
    "Other choices, such as \"getting bored\" or \"patience,\" do not significantly capture the essence of missing the bus based on incorrect timing.",
    "\"Expenditure of time\" could be a consequence of waiting fruitlessly, but it does not specifically denote the failing in relation to the bus's arrival.",
    "\"Public transportation\" is a broad category that doesn't focus on the failure involved in this situation.",
    "Thus, the most accurate term to describe waiting unnecessarily due to poor timing is \"timing.\""
