  "steps": [
    "Identify the geographical location of Nevada. Nevada is located in the western United States.",
    "Determine the geographical location of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is to the west of the United States.",
    "Consider the direction from Nevada to the Pacific Ocean. If you were to travel west from Nevada, you would reach the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Evaluate the answer choices provided. We are looking for the direction of the Pacific Ocean from Nevada.",
    "Analyze each choice: \n- A (atlas) does not indicate a direction.\n- B (san francisco bay) is a location but not a directional indication from Nevada.\n- C (beach) is also not directional.\n- D (southern hemisphere) does not apply, as it is about latitude, not direction.\n- E (west) is a direct and accurate description of where the Pacific Ocean is located from Nevada.",
    "Confirm that \"west\" is the correct and clear direction towards the Pacific Ocean from Nevada."
