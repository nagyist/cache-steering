  "query": "Question: Humans have a number of body parts that serve multiple functions.  Name something that they have an abundance of, and which serves a dual function.\n\nChoices:\nA: two arms\nB: lay eggs\nC: video game\nD: two eyes\nE: ten fingers",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which options represent body parts and whether they serve multiple functions.",
    "Looking at the choices, A (two arms) represents limbs but they primarily serve one main function (movement and manipulation).",
    "Choice B (lay eggs) does not refer to a body part; rather, it mentions a reproductive process, which isn't relevant for this question.",
    "Choice C (video game) also does not represent a body part at all and is not applicable.",
    "Choice D (two eyes) serves the function of vision but can also play a role in non-verbal communication (express emotions, attention). Hence, it has dual functions.",
    "Choice E (ten fingers) also serves multiple functions including gripping, manipulation of objects, and aiding in communication through gestures. Thus, it has dual functions as well.",
    "Now, comparing choices D and E, both serve multiple functions. However, D (two eyes) might offer a clearer duality with its distinct roles in vision and communication.",
    "I must decide between the clarity of dual functions in D versus the dexterity of E. While both serve dual functions, I find the case of E to be very strong in terms of manual dexterity and communication.",
    "I will consider the prominence of functions; while D serves significant roles, E's manipulation aims more at fine motor skills and signals. Thus, I lean towards E as the most abundant body part serving two main functions."
