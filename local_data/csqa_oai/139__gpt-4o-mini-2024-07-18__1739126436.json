  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location of a soccer field that is not contained in a building.",
    "A soccer field is typically an outdoor space where soccer is played, as it requires a large, open area.",
    "The choices given include locations and types of environments where one might find a soccer field.",
    "Choice A (playground) refers to a specific type of area primarily for children, which may not specifically feature a soccer field.",
    "Choice B (Mexico) is a country and while soccer is popular there, it does not specifically describe the location of a soccer field.",
    "Choice C (town) could potentially have soccer fields, but it is not a definitive answer regarding location.",
    "Choice D (outside) directly indicates that the field is not enclosed, which aligns well with the question's requirement.",
    "Choice E (world cup) refers to a major soccer event that occurs at various locations around the world, rather than indicating a specific place for a soccer field.",
    "After analyzing the options, the best choice that denotes a general outdoor location for a soccer field is \"outside\"."
