  "query": "Question: The small child liked looking at all the pictures of the animals and hearing his mom say the accompanying rhymes, but the jellyfish was his favorite animal in the whole what?\n\nChoices:\nA: japanese restaurant\nB: lake\nC: zoo\nD: book\nE: current",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes a child enjoying pictures and rhymes about animals, suggesting that the context is likely associated with a collection of animals.",
    "Given that the child has a favorite animal, it's important to consider where one typically finds a variety of animals.",
    "Of the choices provided, \"jellyfish\" is not commonly found in a traditional \"zoo\" or \"lake\"; they are aquatic creatures and typically found in the ocean or in aquariums.",
    "\"Japanese restaurant\" doesn't fit because jellyfish are not a primary attraction or subject of interest in that context, although they might be served as food.",
    "The \"current\" is a natural phenomenon and doesn't align with where one would have a favorite animal; it refers more to water flow.",
    "This leads to considering \"book\" as a possibility: books often feature illustrations of animals and might include jellyfish. This aligns with the child's activity of enjoying pictures and rhymes.",
    "By process of elimination and considering the context (pictures and rhymes), the most logical and fitting answer is that the child's favorite animal, the jellyfish, is likely found in a book where animals are depicted."
