  "query": "Question: People die, that's why you tend to find a graveyard where?\n\nChoices:\nA: by a bus stop\nB: every town\nC: arlington\nD: church property\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where graveyards are typically found, I should first consider the context in which graveyards are associated with human life and death.",
    "Graveyards are places where people are buried after they pass away, generally indicating that they are an integral part of communities and societies.",
    "In most cultures, graveyards are often located in areas that are easily accessible to the living for visitation and remembrance, such as towns or community spaces.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"every town\" stands out, as most towns have cemeteries or graveyards as a standard part of their structure.",
    "The option \"by a bus stop\" seems unlikely, as graveyards are not typically located close to high-traffic areas for public transport.",
    "The option \"arlington\" refers specifically to Arlington National Cemetery, which is a prominent graveyard but does not encompass the general situation of graveyards in other places.",
    "\"Church property\" is another possibility, as many churches have graveyards, but it does not cover the more widespread presence of graveyards in towns.",
    "The option \"city\" is too broad, as it could refer to any urban area but does not directly imply the existence of graveyards like \"every town\" does.",
    "After analyzing these options, the most logical conclusion is that graveyards are universally found in \"every town.\""
