  "query": "Question: The bee had to be shipped down south to avoid the cold winter, where was it originally from?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: united states\nC: sky\nD: china\nE: apiary",
  "steps": [
    "The bee is being shipped down south, which implies it is originally from a colder region, as it is trying to avoid the cold winter.",
    "Michigan is known for its cold winters, particularly due to its northern location in the United States.",
    "The \"united states\" refers to a broader area and does include colder states like Michigan but is not specific to the original location of the bee.",
    "The \"sky\" is not a plausible origin for a bee; it does not make sense in the context of a geographical location.",
    "China could have cold regions, but it is also a much broader geographical area that might not directly relate to the specific context of bees being shipped to avoid a cold winter.",
    "An \"apiary\" is where bees are kept, but it is also not a geographical location per se. Instead, it pertains more to beekeeping and does not indicate where the bee was originally.",
    "Among the choices, Michigan (A) is the most plausible specific location that suggests a cold environment from which bees might need to be shipped south for a warmer winter.",
    "Evaluating all options, \"united states\" could encompass the idea of a colder area, but it lacks the specificity that makes Michigan the more logical answer.",
    "Given the clues provided in the question about the need to ship the bee south, the most reasonable conclusion is that the bee was originally from Michigan."
