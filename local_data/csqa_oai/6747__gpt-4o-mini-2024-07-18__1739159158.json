  "query": "Question: Where would a cat not belong?\n\nChoices:\nA: back alley\nB: swimming pool\nC: milky way galaxy\nD: compost pile\nE: back yard",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the environments listed in the choices to determine where a cat would typically be found or not found.",
    "A back alley is a common environment for stray cats to roam and find food. Therefore, this would be a possibility for a cat.",
    "A swimming pool is primarily an artificial structure designed for water activities, which is not a natural environment for cats. While a cat might wander near it, they generally do not belong inside a swimming pool.",
    "The milky way galaxy refers to the vast expanse of space where our solar system exists, and no animals, including cats, are found in space. This is a very unnatural environment for any animal.",
    "A compost pile can attract various creatures, including cats, as they may be drawn to the smells of potential food sources among the compost. Hence, cats could be found in a compost pile.",
    "A backyard is often a safe and familiar environment for cats, whether they are pets or strays. Therefore, a cat can belong in a backyard.",
    "Now, evaluating the environments: a cat can be found in a back alley (A), a compost pile (D), and a backyard (E).",
    "A swimming pool (B) is an unnatural environment, so it is less suited for a cat; however, the milky way galaxy (C) is completely uninhabitable for cats.",
    "Hence, comparing these two clear choices, the milky way galaxy (C) is the most definitive answer to the question as it is impossibly far removed from a cat's natural habitat."
