  "query": "Question: What holds a lit cigarette when no one is around?\n\nChoices:\nA: hand\nB: cool lip\nC: light fire\nD: ashtray\nE: carton",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what items or entities can hold a lit cigarette when there are no people present.",
    "A hand is typically what people use to hold a cigarette; however, if no one is around, a hand cannot hold it.",
    "A cool lip is also related to holding a cigarette, but it implies the presence of at least one person, so it does not fit the criteria of being alone.",
    "A light fire can refer to the act of lighting a cigarette but does not actually hold it. It's not an appropriate answer.",
    "An ashtray is specifically designed to hold used or lit cigarettes and does not require human presence to serve this purpose.",
    "A carton contains cigarettes and therefore does not hold a lit cigarette by itself. It's merely packaging.",
    "Since the question asks for what holds a lit cigarette when no one is around, the only suitable option remaining is the ashtray.",
    "I re-evaluate all choices: hand, cool lip, light fire, ashtray, and carton. The ashtray is explicitly made to hold a lit cigarette when there\u2019s no one around.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the answer must be the ashtray."
