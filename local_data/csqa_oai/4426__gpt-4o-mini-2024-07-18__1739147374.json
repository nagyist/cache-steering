  "steps": [
    "To determine which lawn is most likely to be found on a street, we should consider the common characteristics of the options provided.",
    "Option A, \"green yard,\" is vague and could refer to any well-maintained lawn. However, it doesn't specifically indicate a location.",
    "Option B, \"suburbia,\" refers to residential areas but doesn't directly relate to a specific type of lawn on a street.",
    "Option C, \"golf course,\" usually contains extensive grass areas but is less likely to be located directly on a street.",
    "Option D, \"front yard,\" is a specific type of lawn that is typically found adjacent to a house facing a street, making it very likely to be on a street.",
    "Considering the nature of lawns in relation to streets, \"front yard\" fits perfectly as it describes a lawn specifically designed to face the street.",
    "Option E, \"Michigan,\" is a location rather than a specific type of lawn, thus it is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Since \"front yard\" (Option D) is the only option that directly correlates with being on a street, it seems like the most appropriate answer."
