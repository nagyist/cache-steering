  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the person had a long-held assumption, which suggests that they might have been unaware of certain truths or realities.",
    "Since the revelation is likely contrary to their previous assumption, it implies a sense of surprise or emotional impact upon learning the truth.",
    "Now, we must analyze the choices provided: Hurt (A), Satisfaction (B), Understanding (C), Joy (D), and Shock (E).",
    "Hurt (A) may be fitting if the truth is negative, but it does not encapsulate all possible reactions to a truth revelation.",
    "Satisfaction (B) implies that the truth is fulfilling, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the surprise aspect of discovering the truth.",
    "Understanding (C) indicates a comprehension of the situation, which may come after the initial shock, but does not capture the emotion of the surprise itself.",
    "Joy (D) suggests a positive emotion but doesn't directly imply the element of surprise that often accompanies new revelations.",
    "Shock (E) directly conveys the surprise element, indicating that the person was startled or overwhelmed by the unexpected nature of the truth.",
    "Given that the question implies a sudden realization or the emotional turmoil of discovering something unexpected, \"shock\" seems to be the most appropriate answer."
