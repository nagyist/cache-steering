  "query": "Question: What is the opposite of ordinary?\n\nChoices:\nA: strange\nB: special\nC: unbelievable\nD: exceptional\nE: weird",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the opposite of \"ordinary,\" we first need to define what \"ordinary\" means. \"Ordinary\" refers to something that is common, usual, or regular, lacking any unique or remarkable features.",
    "Next, we consider the given options: A: strange, B: special, C: unbelievable, D: exceptional, E: weird. We need to assess each option in relation to the meaning of \"ordinary.\"",
    "Option A: \"strange\" usually implies something that is odd or unusual, but it does not directly imply the positive connotation of being remarkable or valuable.",
    "Option B: \"special\" suggests something that stands out in a positive way, making it different from the ordinary. This is a strong candidate for the opposite of ordinary.",
    "Option C: \"unbelievable\" denotes something that is hard to believe, but it does not necessarily imply that it is the opposite of ordinary, as it may refer to extreme cases or exaggeration.",
    "Option D: \"exceptional\" means something that is not typical and stands out for its quality or significance. This is another strong contender for being the opposite of ordinary.",
    "Option E: \"weird\" can imply abnormality or strangeness, but like \"strange,\" it does not inherently convey the sense of value or positivity found in something distinguished from the ordinary.",
    "Between options B (\"special\") and D (\"exceptional\"), both indicate a degree of distinction and are directly related to being opposite of \"ordinary.\" However, \"exceptional\" leans more towards being outstanding, while \"special\" can mean simply different in a good way.",
    "In the context of opposites, \"exceptional\" might carry a stronger connotation of being a notable departure from the norm than \"special,\" which might suggest merely being different."
