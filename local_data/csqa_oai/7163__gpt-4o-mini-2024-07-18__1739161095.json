  "query": "Question: The agricultural specialist walked from row to row, so where was he likely?\n\nChoices:\nA: sequence of similar things\nB: farmer's field\nC: working field\nD: auditorium\nE: vegetable garden",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"agricultural specialist\" suggests a person who has expertise in farming or agriculture-related activities.",
    "Walking from \"row to row\" indicates that there were organized lines or arrangements of something, which is common in agricultural settings.",
    "Choices A (\"sequence of similar things\") and D (\"auditorium\") do not align with typical agricultural practices or settings, as they do not involve physical rows that one would walk through.",
    "The phrase \"farmer's field\" is a strong contender because it directly relates to agriculture and typically contains rows of crops.",
    "The term \"working field\" could also refer to a place where agricultural activities take place, but it is less specific than \"farmer's field.\"",
    "\"Vegetable garden\" suggests a smaller, possibly personal space for growing vegetables, which does involve rows, but may not commonly be associated with an \"agricultural specialist.\"",
    "Choosing between \"farmer's field\" and \"working field,\" a \"farmer's field\" implies a specific location managed for agricultural production, making it the most likely option for an agricultural specialist.",
    "The other options (A, C, D, E) either do not fit the context as well or are more generic or smaller-scale agricultural settings.",
    "Based on context and the specificity of the terms, \"farmer's field\" is the best choice."
