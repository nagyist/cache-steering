  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the location of the principal's office.",
    "Typically, a principal's office is found in a specific type of building related to education.",
    "We can eliminate options that are not typically associated with educational institutions.",
    "Options A (hallway), D (school building), and E (skyscraper) are relevant to buildings, but we need to find the most accurate location for a principal's office.",
    "Option A (hallway) is not a suitable location, as it is not a dedicated office space.",
    "Option C (city) is too broad and does not specify a particular building type where a principal's office would be.",
    "Option D (school building) is the most appropriate as it directly indicates the structural environment where a principal's office is located.",
    "Comparing option D (school building) against other options, it is clear that principal's offices are specifically located within school buildings.",
    "Thus, I finalize that the principal's office is most accurately referred to as being located in the school building."
