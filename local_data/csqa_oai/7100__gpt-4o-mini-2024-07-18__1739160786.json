  "query": "Question: Sam appear calm, but he had been up all night because he was what?\n\nChoices:\nA: anxious\nB: sleepy\nC: frenzied\nD: frustrated\nE: flustered",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the implication of Sam appearing calm despite being up all night. This suggests he is managing his outward demeanor well.",
    "Analyze the potential reasons for someone being up all night. Common reasons include feeling anxious, experiencing frustration, or being very busy or excited (frenzied).",
    "Evaluate the choice \"anxious\". It aligns with being up all night, as anxiety can lead to sleepless nights. However, it does not directly relate to appearing calm.",
    "Review the choice \"sleepy\". Being sleepy suggests a need for rest, which does not contradict being calm but does not explain why he was up all night.",
    "Consider the choice \"frenzied\". This implies chaotic activity or excitement, which is the opposite of calm. Thus, it is less likely.",
    "Assess the choice \"frustrated\". Frustration can keep someone awake, but if he was calm, it would be surprising to have been frustrated all night.",
    "Finally, analyze \"flustered\". This means agitated or confused, which also conflicts with calmness despite the lack of sleep.",
    "Considering the analysis, \"anxious\" is the best fit. One can be anxious and put on a calm facade, making it the most logical conclusion for someone who has been up all night."
