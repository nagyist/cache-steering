  "query": "Question: Sally didn't know what she planned to do.  She was going to remodel her front garden, but she couldn't because of zoning rules.  Such was the perils of living where?\n\nChoices:\nA: outside of house\nB: urban area\nC: town hall\nD: front yard\nE: michigan",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the context surrounding Sally's situation. She had plans to remodel her garden but was impeded by zoning rules.",
    "Next, zoning rules typically apply in certain areas and are designed to regulate land use, indicating that Sally lives in an area with such regulations.",
    "We should consider where zoning rules are commonly enforced. They are often found in urban areas or towns, rather than rural settings or specific locations like a front yard or a town hall.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"urban area\" is directly related to a place where stringent zoning rules are likely to exist.",
    "\"Outside of house\" and \"front yard\" do not explain the living situation; rather, they refer to specific locations without addressing the broader context of regulation.",
    "\"Town hall\" is a building where zoning regulations may be made or discussed, but it does not refer to where Sally lives.",
    "\"Michigan\" is a state and does not specifically indicate a regulatory context without further details, thus lacking relevance to the zoning aspect.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the option that best reflects the type of location where one would be subject to zoning rules is \"urban area.\""
