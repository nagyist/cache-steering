  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that \"he was annoying,\" which suggests that the person in question has characteristics that irritate others.",
    "To interpret the word \"bore,\" it refers to someone who is dull or tiresome to be around, which aligns with the definition of annoying.",
    "The options provided include \"distant,\" \"foe,\" \"bore,\" \"remote person,\" and \"hermit.\"",
    "\"Distant\" typically implies physical or emotional separation, which does not directly link to being annoying.",
    "\"A foe\" refers to an enemy, which does not correspond with being annoying but rather suggests hostility.",
    "The term \"remote person\" again implies isolation rather than annoyance.",
    "\"A hermit\" indicates someone who lives in seclusion, which doesn\u2019t necessarily relate to being annoying to neighbors.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, \"bore\" stands out as the most fitting option that corresponds to being annoying or tiresome to others."
