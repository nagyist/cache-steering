  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a person typically checks a mirror to see their outfit after getting dressed.",
    "Considering the choices given, a dressing room is specifically designed for trying on clothes and typically has mirrors for this purpose.",
    "The toilet usually has a mirror, but it's not a common place where one would try on outfits, as it is primarily for personal hygiene.",
    "A bedroom often has a mirror and is a common place to get dressed, allowing a person to check their outfit before leaving.",
    "The term \"house\" is too vague, as it could refer to any room and doesn't specify where one would likely check their outfit.",
    "A hotel room could have a mirror but is not as general or common as a bedroom in a home setting for checking outfits.",
    "Given these considerations, the most appropriate choices for checking one's outfit would primarily be either a dressing room or a bedroom.",
    "However, since the question seems to look for a more residential and common setting, the bedroom is often the place where individuals get dressed and check their outfits.",
    "Thus, while both A and C have merit, C (bedroom) is a personal and accessible place for checking outfits after getting dressed in a typical everyday scenario."
