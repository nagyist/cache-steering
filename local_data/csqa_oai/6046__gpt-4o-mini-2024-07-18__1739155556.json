  "query": "Question: I wish to attach two pieces of paper without using glue, what should I use?\n\nChoices:\nA: stick\nB: pantry\nC: office\nD: desk drawer\nE: stapler",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the function of the items listed in the choices.",
    "\"Stick\" could imply a sticky substance or item, but it generally refers to something that adheres without permanent attachment, like tape.",
    "\"Pantry\" is a storage area for food items and does not relate to attaching paper.",
    "\"Office\" is a location or context for work but does not directly suggest a method for attaching paper.",
    "\"Desk drawer\" is a storage compartment and does not provide a method for attaching paper either.",
    "\"Stapler\" is a device specifically designed to fasten or attach multiple sheets of paper together using metal clips.",
    "Now, I compare the options: the only item that directly helps attach paper without glue is the stapler.",
    "Given that a stapler mechanically binds sheets of paper together, it is the clear choice.",
    "I conclude that the best answer among the provided choices for attaching paper without glue is E: stapler."
