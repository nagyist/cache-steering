  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the women were scantily clad\" implies that their clothing was minimal and potentially provocative, suggesting a focus on appealing to sexual attraction.",
    "The phrase \"did their jobs well\" indicates that despite their appearances, they performed their tasks effectively.",
    "The question asks what it was easy to use sex to do, indicating a connection between their appearance and the ability to influence or affect behavior or sales.",
    "Looking at the choices, the use of sex traditionally aligns with aspects of sales and marketing, particularly in industries where sexual appeal can enhance interest or attention.",
    "Choice A, \"sell beer,\" is plausible as alcohol advertising often utilizes sexual imagery to attract customers.",
    "Choice E, \"sell candy,\" seems less relevant because candy sales do not commonly hinge on sexual appeal.",
    "Choice B, \"cost money,\" does not directly relate to the use of sex; it is more concerned with financial implications rather than a behavior or sales context.",
    "Choice C, \"feel good,\" could be connected to the allure of sexuality but doesn\u2019t directly tie back to a job or task being completed.",
    "Choice D, \"last hour,\" does not provide a clear context for sexual appeal or influence, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Considering all choices, \"sell beer\" (Choice A) seems the most appropriate as it reflects the use of sexual attractiveness in successfully marketing a product."
