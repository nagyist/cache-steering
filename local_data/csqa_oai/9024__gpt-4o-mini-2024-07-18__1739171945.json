  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what the children did around the campfire.",
    "Typically, campfires are associated with activities that bring people together, often in a storytelling context or social interaction.",
    "Choice A, \"play with toys,\" is not a common activity around a campfire, where the focus is usually on group activities rather than individual play.",
    "Choice B, \"hear stories,\" aligns well with traditional campfire gatherings where storytelling is a cherished activity, particularly in camping or outdoor settings.",
    "Choice C, \"play games,\" while plausible, is less typical than storytelling at a campfire, although some games may involve group interaction (e.g., charades).",
    "Choice D, \"play house,\" is not relevant in this context as it is more aligned with indoor play and not typically associated with campfires.",
    "Choice E, \"play ball,\" does not fit well with the setting of a campfire; playing ball would usually occur in a more open and spacious area rather than around a fire.",
    "After analyzing each option, \"hear stories\" is the most fitting activity for children gathered around a campfire."
