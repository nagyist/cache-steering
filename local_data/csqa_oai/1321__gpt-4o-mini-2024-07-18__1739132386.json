  "query": "Question: Some kids are shy in school, so taking a shower where can be intimidating?\n\nChoices:\nA: bath room\nB: motel room\nC: pool\nD: locker room\nE: at hotel",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"kids\" and their shyness, which suggests a context typically associated with communal or social settings where privacy is limited.",
    "Taking a shower in a \"bathroom\" is usually done in a private setting, so it's unlikely that this would be intimidating for kids.",
    "A \"motel room\" is also a private space and not a common place for kids to shower in a school context, so it likely doesn\u2019t fit the scenario.",
    "A \"hotel\" aligns similarly with a motel; it is also a private setting, so it wouldn\u2019t be intimidating for kids.",
    "A \"pool\" could cause some intimidation if kids are required to change and shower in front of others, but it is not traditionally where showers are taken.",
    "A \"locker room\" at a school or sports facility is specifically designed for changing and showering in a shared environment, which can easily lead to feelings of shyness among kids.",
    "Based on the context of the question, the place where shyness might significantly manifest in terms of taking showers is a shared environment like a locker room.",
    "Since all other options represent private or less intimidating environments, the locker room is the most fitting answer for where it can be intimidating."
