  "query": "Question: Sally had a throat injury.  She can't talk because she is unable to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: swallow food\nB: will listen\nC: open mouth\nD: make sound\nE: dry mouth",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sally has a throat injury, which suggests that her throat may be damaged or inflamed.",
    "Since the throat is involved in vocalization, an injury there would likely affect her ability to speak.",
    "The options provided must be analyzed to determine what directly relates to her inability to talk.",
    "Option A mentions \"swallow food,\" which is related to eating but not directly to speaking.",
    "Option B states \"will listen,\" which is not directly related to talking; listening is the opposite action.",
    "Option C says \"open mouth,\" which may imply her ability to physically open her mouth, but it doesn't specifically address the inability to speak.",
    "Option D mentions \"make sound,\" which is directly tied to her inability to talk because talking requires making vocal sounds.",
    "Option E talks about \"dry mouth,\" which can influence talking but does not directly explain a profound inability to talk stemming from a throat injury.",
    "The most logical conclusion based on the options is that a throat injury limits her ability to \"make sound,\" thus affecting her ability to speak."
