  "query": "Question: If you have an underlying heart condition, what might running twenty six miles cause?\n\nChoices:\nA: tiredness\nB: passing out\nC: death\nD: exhaustion\nE: heartbreak",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about potential risks associated with running a marathon distance (twenty six miles) specifically for someone with an underlying heart condition.",
    "Individuals with heart conditions may have compromised cardiovascular health, which can increase the risk of severe complications during intense physical activities like running a marathon.",
    "Tiredness (A) and exhaustion (D) are common effects of running long distances even in healthy individuals, so they are likely, but may not indicate a severe risk associated with existing health conditions.",
    "Passing out (B) can occur under extreme exertion but is not necessarily fatal and may happen even in those who are healthy.",
    "Death (C), while a serious outcome, is a potential risk for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions during extreme physical exertion.",
    "Heartbreak (E) is not a medical condition related to exertion and does not apply in this context.",
    "Considering the severity of the outcomes, we find that running such a distance could potentially be life-threatening for someone with heart problems, making death a serious possibility.",
    "Thus, the most alarming and severe consequence of running twenty six miles for someone with a heart issue would be death."
