    "The question is asking about the needs of a person going for a long walk.",
    "Walking for an extended period could lead to discomfort if the proper gear isn\u2019t worn.",
    "Comfortable shoes are essential for long walks to prevent blisters, soreness, and fatigue.",
    "The other options do not directly relate to the immediate physical needs of someone walking.",
    "Option A (roads) is not necessary as the person could walk anywhere, including trails or parks.",
    "Option B (headache) is undesirable and not a need for a long walk.",
    "Option D (slim waist) is not a requirement for walking; while it could be a benefits-related outcome, it's not a direct need.",
    "Option E (best things in life) is too vague and does not pertain directly to the act of walking itself.",
    "Consequently, the most relevant answer that fulfills an essential requirement for walking is comfortable shoes."
