  "query": "Question: Where do you eat most of your food?\n\nChoices:\nA: in a bowl\nB: home\nC: freezer\nD: kitchen\nE: store",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the location where most food is consumed.",
    "The options provided suggest different places or containers related to food.",
    "Option A (in a bowl) refers to a container rather than a place, which makes it less likely to be the answer.",
    "Option B (home) suggests a general place where meals are typically eaten.",
    "Option C (freezer) is where food is stored, not where it is eaten.",
    "Option D (kitchen) is a room where food is prepared and often eaten but is more specific than home.",
    "Option E (store) refers to a place where food is bought, not eaten.",
    "Given that we are discussing where food is eaten, the most logical answers are B (home) and D (kitchen).",
    "Home is a broader term that includes the kitchen, where food is usually eaten.",
    "Considering that most meals are consumed at home and that many meals may also be eaten in the kitchen, home is the best answer."
