  "query": "Question: Sarah was not a little girl anymore.  She learned the hard way when buying new clothes.  What size might she have worn?\n\nChoices:\nA: large\nB: big\nC: see work\nD: lot of\nE: bog",
  "steps": [
    "The context implies that Sarah has grown up and is no longer a little girl, suggesting she needs larger sizes in clothing.",
    "The phrase \"not a little girl anymore\" typically means she has transitioned to adult sizing.",
    "In clothing terms, \"large\" is a common size for adult women, especially if they are not classified as 'little'.",
    "The choice \"big\" is not typically used as a clothing size, making it less likely to be the correct answer.",
    "The phrase \"see work,\" \"lot of,\" and \"bog\" do not relate to clothing sizes and appear to be nonsensical in this context.",
    "Based on understanding clothing sizes and the context of Sarah being an adult, the most appropriate size from the choices given is \"large.\""
