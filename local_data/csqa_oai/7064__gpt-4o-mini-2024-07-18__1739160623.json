  "query": "Question: You enter the parking lot of a grocery store from where?\n\nChoices:\nA: town\nB: strip mall\nC: street\nD: neighborhood\nE: sewer",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the point of entry into the parking lot of a grocery store.",
    "We should consider the most common access points for a parking lot associated with a grocery store.",
    "Typically, parking lots for grocery stores are accessed from adjacent roads or streets.",
    "The choice \"town\" could imply entering from a general area but is not specific and is less common than entering from a street.",
    "The choice \"strip mall\" suggests a commercial area that could be near a grocery store, but it is not typically the main access point to grocery store parking.",
    "The choice \"neighborhood\" suggests residential areas, which could lead to a grocery store but are not the primary access.",
    "The choice \"sewer\" does not logically connect to how someone would enter a grocery store parking lot.",
    "Given the common practices of urban planning and the design of grocery stores, the most logical choice for entering the parking lot is \"street.\"",
    "I will evaluate the options one more time to ensure \"street\" stands out as the best choice based on typical access points."
