  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"John sat in a folding chair\" suggests that the seating is likely temporary or movable, which is common in multi-purpose spaces.",
    "The mention of a \"bit room\" may imply a larger space, potentially used for gatherings or events, as folding chairs are often used for such purposes.",
    "The presence of a \"stage\" indicates that the room is designed for performances, presentations, or meetings where there might be a speaker or a performance area.",
    "Considering the context of folding chairs and a stage, this setup aligns with rooms designed for audiences, rather than more personal or permanent settings.",
    "An \"auditorium\" is specifically designed for performances and usually features a stage as well as movable or tiered seating, making it a strong candidate.",
    "While a \"meeting hall\" could also accommodate folding chairs and may have a stage, it typically does not emphasize performances as much as an auditorium does.",
    "A \"school\" could have a stage but generally does not focus exclusively on performances, and the term is too specific to a type of institution rather than just a space.",
    "A \"church\" could indeed feature a stage for services and performances; however, the folding chairs and the absence of specific religious references suggest a more secular setting.",
    "Comparing all options, the term \"auditorium\" most accurately encapsulates a space with a stage designed for audiences and flexible seating arrangements, fitting the description best."
