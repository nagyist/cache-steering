  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to put shoes?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: table\nC: box\nD: bed\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of storing shoes. Proper storage keeps them organized, out of the way, and maintains their condition.",
    "Next, evaluate each option starting with \"A: closet.\" A closet is designed for storage and often has space specifically for shoes, making it a rational choice.",
    "Now look at \"B: table.\" While shoes can technically be placed on a table, this is not practical as it can clutter the space and is not designed for shoe storage.",
    "Next, consider \"C: box.\" A box can provide protection from dust and damage and can be used for storage, but it lacks the organizational advantages of a closet.",
    "Now assess \"D: bed.\" Placing shoes on the bed is not appropriate as it disrupts the sleeping area and is inconvenient for readily accessing shoes.",
    "Finally, look at \"E: park.\" A park is an outdoor area not suited for storing personal items like shoes. It is neither safe nor practical for storage.",
    "Evaluating the practicality, accessibility, and suitability of each option leads to the conclusion that the closet is the best place for shoes."
