  "query": "Question: Johnny had a number of tools, including a hammer, which is needed because of his work.  Where might he have worked?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: tool box\nC: hardware store\nD: house\nE: repair shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the tool mentioned: a hammer. A hammer is a common tool used in various settings, particularly in construction, repair, and DIY projects.",
    "Next, we review the choices. A garage (A) could imply a personal workspace for hobbies or car repairs, where a hammer might be needed, but it's less specific.",
    "The tool box (B) is a storage item rather than a work setting, therefore it's not a valid choice for where Johnny might have worked.",
    "A hardware store (C) generally sells tools and supplies, and while Johnny might be there to buy tools, it's less likely he would be working there as a hammer is mentioned as a possession.",
    "A house (D) could suggest he was doing home repairs or projects, which is plausible; many homeowners use hammers for various renovations or repairs.",
    "An repair shop (E) stands out as a strong candidate, as hammers are frequently utilized in repair settings, such as automotive or appliance repair shops.",
    "Comparing the likelihood of these settings, the repair shop (E) directly relates to the use of the hammer in a work context versus the other choices which are either less specific or not work-related.",
    "Thus, while both a house and a repair shop could involve the use of a hammer, the repair shop is more targeted towards professional work.",
    "Finally, re-evaluating all possible answer choices with a focus on the work aspect leads to the strongest association with Johnny requiring a hammer."
