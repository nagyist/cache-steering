  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the house had expensive insurance due to a history of flooding.",
    "We need to determine which part of the house is most likely to be affected by flooding and therefore would contribute to the need for expensive insurance.",
    "The options provided are various parts of a house, and we should consider where flooding would typically cause damage.",
    "A residential area might experience flooding, but it does not point to a specific part of the house.",
    "The kitchen could potentially be flooded, but it is not typically a primary area impacted by flooding compared to others.",
    "The yard can be affected by flooding, but it does not relate to the interior of the house where damage would be significant for insurance purposes.",
    "The living room might face some flooding issues, but it's generally less likely than areas that are underground or at a lower level of the house.",
    "The basement is usually the most vulnerable area of a house to flooding, especially if a property is located in a flood-prone area.",
    "Historically, basements tend to have a higher insurance rate because they are prone to water damage from floods.",
    "Therefore, it logically follows that the expensive insurance is due to the basement having an established history of flooding."
