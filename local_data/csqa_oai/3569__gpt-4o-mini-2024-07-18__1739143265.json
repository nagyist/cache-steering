  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to identify common locations where food, specifically hot dogs, is sold outside of grocery stores.",
    "Hot dogs are often associated with casual outdoor eating, which suggests parks or recreational areas might be common locations.",
    "I recall that hot dogs are frequently sold at sporting events, such as baseball or football games.",
    "Disneyland may have a variety of food options but is not primarily known for hot dogs specifically.",
    "Churro stands do not typically sell hot dogs, so that option can be eliminated.",
    "Bowling alleys usually provide snacks and some type of food, but hot dogs are not the most commonly featured item.",
    "Now, comparing the notable venues, parks and sporting events stand out as the most likely places for hot dogs.",
    "However, sporting events have a strong association with hot dogs being a popular item sold at stands and concessions.",
    "Thus, considering all options, the most common venue away from grocery stores where hot dogs are sold would be a sporting event."
