  "query": "Question: The water spout wouldn't turn off.  Eventually, what was totally filled?\n\nChoices:\nA: the kitchen\nB: sink\nC: fountain\nD: access to water\nE: florida",
  "steps": [
    "The situation starts with a water spout that is malfunctioning and won't turn off.",
    "If the water spout continues to run without stopping, it would continuously pour water into whatever is nearby.",
    "Typically, a kitchen would have a sink where water would accumulate if the spout is running.",
    "As the water fills the sink, it will eventually reach a point of overflowing when it can no longer contain any more water.",
    "While it\u2019s possible for other options to involve water, the most direct consequence of a sink filling is water spilling over from it.",
    "The kitchen may get wet, but it is the sink that directly fills with water when the spout does not turn off.",
    "Other choices such as 'fountain', 'access to water', and 'florida' do not directly apply in the context of the water spout malfunction.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the sink is what was totally filled as a result of the spout malfunctioning."
