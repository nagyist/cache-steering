  "query": "Question: What leads a company to get in trouble?\n\nChoices:\nA: mail order\nB: branch out\nC: commit crime\nD: liquidated\nE: procure",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options given in the context of a company getting into trouble. \"Commit crime\" (C) seems like a direct action that could lead a company into legal issues or reputational damage.",
    "Next, let's consider \"mail order\" (A). This typically refers to a method of selling goods that may not inherently lead a company into trouble unless mismanaged or fraudulent practices are involved.",
    "Looking at \"branch out\" (B), this usually refers to expanding a business into new areas. While there can be risks involved, it does not automatically imply trouble unless miscalculations occur.",
    "For \"liquidated\" (D), this term relates to the closing of a business. It is a state that a company may reach but isn't necessarily an action that leads to trouble; rather, it is a consequence of other issues.",
    "Finally, \"procure\" (E) means to obtain something, which by itself doesn't equate to trouble for a company unless it involves unethical or illegal procurement processes.",
    "Comparing all these options, \"commit crime\" (C) is the most direct cause of trouble for a company. Other options might lead to difficulties but do not inherently cause trouble like committing a crime would."
