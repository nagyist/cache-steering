    "Let's analyze the options. A parking area is typically associated with places where people come to stay or visit, suggesting a need for vehicle access.",
    "Option A, a book store, usually doesn't have a large parking area, as they are often located in central urban locations where foot traffic is prioritized.",
    "Option B, people, is not a physical location; therefore, it cannot have a parking area.",
    "Option D, a school yard, typically wouldn't have a designated parking area for visitors but may have drop-off zones for students.",
