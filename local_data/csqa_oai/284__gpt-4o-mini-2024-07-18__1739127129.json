    "James believes that he is a good fit for the job and has relevant experience, but he is worried about not fulfilling all the requirements set by the employer.",
    "The qualifications that he lacks may lead him to feel that he could be viewed unfavorably compared to other candidates who meet all the criteria.",
    "Since he is particularly interested in securing this job, any uncertainty regarding the qualifications can heighten his anxiety about the outcome of his application.",
    "The worry may stem from the fear that his application will not be strong enough due to the missing qualifications.",
    "As a result, the most logical concern in this context, given his aspirations and the competitive nature of job applications, is the possibility of being rejected.",
    "Other options, such as hope and acceptance, are not directly related to the specific concern stemming from his lack of qualifications.",
