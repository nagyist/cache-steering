  "query": "Question: Where would you find many a bookshelf?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: library\nC: book store\nD: furniture store\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the typical places where books are stored.",
    "Bookshelves are primarily designed to hold books, so I should look for places that are likely to have a significant number of books.",
    "A library is a facility specifically dedicated to housing collections of books for public use. It generally contains many bookshelves filled with various titles.",
    "A bedroom might have a bookshelf, but it typically would not have as many books as a library.",
    "A bookstore sells books, and it would have bookshelves stocked with various books, but not as extensive a collection as a library.",
    "A furniture store may have bookshelves as part of their inventory, but it is not primarily a space for storing books. They may not have a large collection of books available.",
    "The ocean is not a relevant space for bookshelves, as it is not a place to find books or bookshelves at all.",
    "Comparing the above options, while both the library and bookstore have bookshelves, the library is likely to have many more bookshelves with a wide variety of books on them compared to a bookstore.",
    "Ultimately, the library is the prime location for finding many bookshelves specifically designed for holding books."
