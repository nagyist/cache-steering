  "steps": [
    "The question asks where James might look first for a pencil sharpener.",
    "A pencil sharpener is typically found in places where writing or school supplies are kept.",
    "Let's analyze the options: \n- A cabinet may contain office supplies but is not specifically associated with a pencil sharpener.",
    "- A library would have writing tools but is less likely to have pencil sharpeners readily available for personal use.",
    "- A nightstand usually contains personal items, not typically school supplies or office tools.",
    "- A stationery store specializes in writing tools and supplies, which would definitely have pencil sharpeners, but it may not be a convenient first choice if he is already at home.",
    "- A desk drawer is a common place where writing tools, including pencil sharpeners, are stored in a home or office setting.",
    "Considering convenience and common locations for such an item, the desk drawer is likely the first place James would check."
