  "query": "Question: Where is an inexpensive place to have a reception?\n\nChoices:\nA: outside\nB: wedding party\nC: restaurant\nD: church basement\nE: country club",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify options that typically allow for hosting receptions at a lower cost.",
    "Option A, \"outside,\" could be inexpensive if one uses a public park or backyard, but costs can vary depending on permits, setup, and weather considerations.",
    "Option B, \"wedding party,\" isn't a specific location but rather an event; thus, it's not directly comparable as a place to have a reception.",
    "Option C, \"restaurant,\" can be a cost-effective choice if the restaurant offers group deals or packages for receptions.",
    "Option D, \"church basement,\" often provides a low-cost venue option for those affiliated with a church, as sometimes it may be free or have a minimal rental fee.",
    "Option E, \"country club,\" typically comes with higher costs due to membership fees and service charges, making it less inexpensive compared to other options.",
    "Now, I will compare the cost-effectiveness of each viable option: outside, restaurant, and church basement.",
    "Between \"outside,\" \"restaurant,\" and \"church basement,\" I consider that a church basement might offer amenities at a significantly lower cost than a restaurant or outside venue, especially for members.",
    "Ultimately, the options that are likely to be the most budget-friendly are church basement and possibly outside, but the church basement stands out due to likely minimal costs and resources available."
