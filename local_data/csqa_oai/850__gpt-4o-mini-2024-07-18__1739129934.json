  "query": "Question: Where would you hear a viola along side many other string and brass instruments?\n\nChoices:\nA: symphony\nB: band\nC: create music\nD: orchestra\nE: string quartet",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define where violas are typically found in musical settings. Violas are string instruments that are often part of larger ensembles.",
    "Next, consider the options. A symphony usually refers to a work composed for an orchestra, but it is not an ensemble itself.",
    "A band primarily consists of woodwinds and brass instruments, with percussion, but it typically does not feature string instruments like the viola.",
    "\"Create music\" is a broad term that doesn't specify any particular ensemble where a viola would be found, making it less likely the correct answer.",
    "A string quartet consists of four string instruments, typically two violins, a viola, and a cello. While it does include a viola, it doesn't feature a large variety of instruments like brass.",
    "On the other hand, an orchestra is defined as a large ensemble that includes strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments.",
    "In an orchestra, the viola plays an integral part among the violin section and complements brass and woodwind instruments as well.",
    "Therefore, considering all the options, the environment where one would most likely hear a viola alongside many string and brass instruments is an orchestra."
