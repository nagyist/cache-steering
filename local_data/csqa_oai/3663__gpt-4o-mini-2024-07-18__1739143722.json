  "query": "Question: What would a soprano be a part of in church?\n\nChoices:\nA: add high notes\nB: opera house\nC: choit\nD: choir\nE: movie",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what a soprano is. A soprano is a type of singing voice that is higher in pitch, typically associated with female singers.",
    "Next, we need to consider the context of the question, which specifically mentions a church setting.",
    "In churches, music is often an important part of worship services. Various musical groups can perform in this setting.",
    "One common musical ensemble found in churches is a choir, which often includes soprano voices along with other vocal ranges such as alto, tenor, and bass.",
    "Now, let's look at the options provided: A (add high notes) is not a specific group; B (opera house) refers to a venue, not a church activity; C (choit) appears to be a misspelling and is likely meant to refer to a choir; D (choir) is the correct term; and E (movie) does not relate to church music.",
    "Between options C and D, it's important to note that \"choir\" is the correct spelling and the widely recognized term used in church settings.",
    "Thus, the logical conclusion is that a soprano would be part of a choir in a church."
