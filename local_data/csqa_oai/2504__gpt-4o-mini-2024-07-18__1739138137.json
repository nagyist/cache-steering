  "query": "Question: Where would you put a book after you buy it?\n\nChoices:\nA: discount store\nB: ground\nC: university\nD: house\nE: antique store",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where a purchased book is typically taken after buying it. Common places include home or another location related to its intended use.",
    "Next, evaluate each option to see if it makes sense as a place for a book after purchase.",
    "A discount store is not a logical place to put a book after buying, as it is where the purchase occurs, not a destination afterwards.",
    "The ground is also not a suitable place for a book since it is not a protective or sensible location for an item like a book.",
    "A university could be a legitimate place for a book depending on the context, especially if the book is academic or related to studies. However, it is more of a potential destination rather than a typical post-purchase location.",
    "A house is a typical place where one would take a book after buying it, as it is a personal reading space and where most people keep their books.",
    "An antique store could be argued as a place for book purchases, but it\u2019s less common to think someone would buy a book and leave it there after purchase compared to a personal home.",
    "After analyzing all the options, the most reasonable answer based on common sense and typical behavior would be to keep the book at home."
