  "query": "Question: What is necessary for bathing?\n\nChoices:\nA: suntan lotion\nB: reading newspaper\nC: using soap\nD: cleanliness\nE: slip and fall",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what is necessary for bathing, we need to identify the essential component required in the act of bathing itself.",
    "Bathing typically involves cleaning oneself, which implies the use of a cleaning agent.",
    "The most common cleaning agent used in bathing is soap, which serves to remove dirt and oils from the skin.",
    "Next, we assess the relevance of the other options. Suntan lotion is not necessary for bathing; it is typically used for sun protection afterward.",
    "Reading the newspaper has no direct relation to the act of bathing and is not necessary for it.",
    "Cleanliness is a result of bathing rather than a necessity for the act itself; it describes the state after bathing, not the means to bathe.",
    "The option \"slip and fall\" is also unrelated to the process of bathing, rather it describes a potential hazard associated with bathing.",
    "After evaluating the options, the only one that directly relates to the process of bathing is the use of soap.",
    "Therefore, to bathe properly, using soap is a fundamental requirement."
