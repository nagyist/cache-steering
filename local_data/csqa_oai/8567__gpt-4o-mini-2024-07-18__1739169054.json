  "query": "Question: What aisle do you walk down to get  lettuce?\n\nChoices:\nA: building\nB: canned goods\nC: grocery store\nD: church\nE: department store",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what the question is asking. It is asking for the specific place or aisle in relation to where you can find lettuce.",
    "Consider the options provided. The choices are building, canned goods, grocery store, church, and department store.",
    "Evaluate the choice 'building'. A building is too generic and does not specify an aisle or context for finding lettuce.",
    "Evaluate the choice 'canned goods'. Lettuce is a fresh produce item typically not found in canned form, so this option is unlikely to be correct.",
    "Evaluate the choice 'grocery store'. Grocery stores are typically where fresh produce like lettuce is sold. This seems to be a plausible option.",
    "Evaluate the choice 'church'. A church does not sell groceries and is therefore not a relevant place to find lettuce.",
    "Evaluate the choice 'department store'. While some department stores might have food sections, they typically do not focus on fresh produce like lettuce.",
    "Since the choice 'grocery store' directly correlates with the context of purchasing lettuce, it stands out as the best option among the choices provided.",
    "Confirm that lettuce is commonly found in the appropriate aisle within a grocery store for fresh produce."
