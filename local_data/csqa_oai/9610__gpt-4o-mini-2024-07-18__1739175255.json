  "query": "Question: Lilly wanted to see every type of flower that there is.  But this is a tall order, because flowers grow all over what?\n\nChoices:\nA: surface of earth\nB: netherlands\nC: countryside\nD: state park\nE: anthology",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Lilly wants to see every type of flower, which implies a very broad range of flowers found in various locations.",
    "The phrase \"this is a tall order\" suggests that it may be difficult to find all types of flowers in one single location, indicating a need to explore multiple environments.",
    "To determine where flowers grow, I need to think of places where flowers are typically found geographically.",
    "The options provided can be analyzed: \n- \"A: surface of earth\" suggests all places globally where flowers can grow.\n- \"B: netherlands\" implies a specific country known for tulips but does not cover all flower types.\n- \"C: countryside\" indicates rural areas which generally have diverse types of flowers.\n- \"D: state park\" is a specific area but also limited to the variety within state parks.\n- \"E: anthology\" does not relate to physical locations of flower growth.",
    "Since Lilly wants to see every type of flower, the most inclusive option is one that refers to a broad category rather than a specific location.",
    "Among the options, \"A: surface of earth\" would encompass all ecosystems globally where flowers can grow, making it the most suitable answer.",
    "However, \u201ccountryside\u201d (C) is significant too, as it connotes a broad area that does contain a variety of flowers compared to more restricted options.",
    "Nevertheless, \"surface of earth\" still triumphs over \"countryside\" in terms of sheer coverage and inclusivity."
