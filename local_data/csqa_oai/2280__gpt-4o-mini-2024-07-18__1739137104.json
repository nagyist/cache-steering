  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"he returned the dictionary\" implies he was putting it back in its original location or a designated place.",
    "The context suggests that the dictionary was being used as a makeshift object, likely to correct a wobbly piece of furniture.",
    "The use of \"wobbly leg\" signifies an object that typically has legs and is unstable, possibly a table or chair.",
    "Among the options given, \"chair\" and \"table\" are both furniture items that have legs. However, it's common to place items under tables to stabilize them.",
    "While chairs can also have wobbly legs, they are less frequently propped up or stabilized with books or large items like dictionaries.",
    "Analyzing the phrase \"under the wobbly leg,\" it's likely that the dictionary, being a flat object, would fit better under a table rather than a chair.",
    "Since \"table\" is referenced in option C, it aligns well with both the notion of stability and the usage of a dictionary as a support.",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer that fits the context of the sentence is a table, as it is common to stabilize furniture by placing objects under their legs."
