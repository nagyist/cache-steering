  "steps": [
    "To determine where one can find a singing human, we need to consider environments where humans typically perform or engage in singing activities.",
    "A band is a musical group that focuses on performing songs, so it inherently includes singing humans as part of its function.",
    "An aircraft is primarily for transportation; although people can sing on flights, aircraft is not a designated place for singing.",
    "Outer space is an environment without air, making singing impossible due to the lack of sound transmission.",
    "A space shuttle is a type of spacecraft used to carry astronauts into orbit. While astronauts may sing inside it, a space shuttle itself is not a place typically associated with singing.",
    "A factory is focused on manufacturing and production, and while there might be humans present, singing is not a common or typical activity there.",
    "Comparing the options, the band is the only place directly associated with singing.",
    "Since only the band clearly corresponds to a place where one would expect to find singing humans regularly and intentionally, it stands out as the best answer."
