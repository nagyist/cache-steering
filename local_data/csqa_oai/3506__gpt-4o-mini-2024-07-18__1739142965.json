  "query": "Question: What divider is often between two buildings that cars drive on?\n\nChoices:\nA: fork in road\nB: sidewalk\nC: living room\nD: street\nE: binder",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question, which is asking for a term that describes something that acts as a divider between two buildings where cars drive.",
    "Next, I will analyze each of the given options to see which one fits the description of a divider for cars between buildings.",
    "Option A, \"fork in road,\" refers to a point where a road splits into two directions, which is not specifically a divider between buildings.",
    "Option B, \"sidewalk,\" is typically a path for pedestrians that runs alongside a road but does not serve as a vehicle driving area.",
    "Option C, \"living room,\" is a part of a house or building and does not relate to external structures or driving areas.",
    "Option D, \"street,\" denotes a public road in a city or town that is typically flanked by buildings. This term aligns well with the idea of a divider for vehicles.",
    "Finally, option E, \"binder,\" is unrelated to the context of buildings or driving.",
    "Based on the evaluations, the most appropriate answer for the divider that is often between two buildings where cars drive on is \"street.\""
