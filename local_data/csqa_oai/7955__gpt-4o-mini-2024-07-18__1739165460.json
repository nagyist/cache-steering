    "Option A, \"building,\" does not fit because buildings are stationary and not related to road trips.",
    "Option B, \"ocean,\" doesn't fit because it is not a vehicle; it refers to a body of water.",
    "Option C, \"computer screen,\" is not a vehicle and does not relate to physical travel or road trips.",
    "Option D, \"bus,\" is a valid mode of transportation for road trips, but it is less commonly associated with family trips compared to a personal vehicle.",
