  "steps": [
    "To determine where to look for crabs near the shore, we must consider habitats where crabs are typically found.",
    "Crabs are commonly found in natural settings such as beaches, tidepools, and bays, where they can hide and find food.",
    "Cooking pots are not a natural habitat for crabs; they are used for cooking after crabs are caught, so they are not a viable option.",
    "Beach sand could potentially have some crabs, but it is not a primary habitat; crabs generally prefer areas that provide shelter and food.",
    "Tidepools are small pools of seawater that trap marine life when the tide goes out, creating a perfect environment to find crabs since they seek shelter within them.",
    "Chesapeake Bay is a broader location where crabs can be found, but it\u2019s less specific compared to tidepools, which directly imply a site for immediate searching.",
    "A fish market would be a place to buy crabs, not where to find them living in the wild.",
    "Based on the natural habitats and options given, the best choice that represents a place to actively search for crabs would be tidepools."
