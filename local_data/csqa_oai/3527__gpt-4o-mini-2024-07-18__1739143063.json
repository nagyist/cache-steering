  "query": "Question: What does an apple tree need to create new trees?\n\nChoices:\nA: new york\nB: farm yard\nC: new jersey\nD: grass\nE: flowers",
  "steps": [
    "To create new trees, an apple tree must produce seeds, which is a natural part of its reproductive process.",
    "The seeds of the apple tree are typically found within the apples it produces, which need to be pollinated to develop properly.",
    "Pollination occurs through the transfer of pollen, which often requires flowers to facilitate the process.",
    "Flowering is essential for an apple tree because it produces the blossoms needed for pollination to take place.",
    "Once a flower is pollinated, it can develop into a fruit containing seeds, which can then grow into new apple trees if planted.",
    "Thus, the presence of flowers is a critical requirement for the apple tree to produce new trees.",
    "The options provided include cities and unrelated concepts, but option E (flowers) directly relates to the reproductive process of the apple tree.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, the necessity of flowers stands out as the essential factor for creating new apple trees."
