  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the options presented regarding what might be illegal when playing cards at a casino.",
    "Option A: \"remember\" - Remembering cards or strategies is a common practice in card games and is not illegal.",
    "Option B: \"help\" - Helping another player is generally acceptable, although it can be frowned upon in some contexts. It may not be illegal per se.",
    "Option C: \"count\" - Counting cards, particularly in blackjack, is often frowned upon by casinos and can lead to being banned, although it is not technically illegal as it does not involve cheating.",
    "Option D: \"winning\" - Winning is the objective of playing cards in a casino and is certainly not illegal.",
    "Option E: \"dealing\" - Dealing cards is the monopoly of the casino staff and cannot be done by players, but it is regulated rather than strictly illegal.",
    "Upon considering the context and legality of the actions related to playing cards in a casino, it appears that while counting cards is not illegal, it is often banned by casinos. However, it is important to distinguish between what is illegal and what is against casino policies.",
    "Thus, the only option that is commonly associated with significant consequences, such as being banned or ejected from a casino, is counting cards, since it directly conflicts with casino rules aimed at maintaining a fair game."
