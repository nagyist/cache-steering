  "steps": [
    "Identify the items mentioned in the question: clothing, sporting goods, and housewares.",
    "Consider the nature of each choice: A backpack (A) is a type of accessory but not a place to buy the mentioned items. A house (B) is a type of residence and not a retail location. A department store (C) typically carries a wide variety of goods, including clothing, sporting goods, and housewares. A mall (D) is a larger commercial area that includes various stores but is not a single retail outlet. A table (E) is a piece of furniture, not a place to shop.",
    "Eliminate options: A, B, and E have been eliminated as they do not represent locations for purchasing the items listed.",
    "Evaluate the remaining options: The department store (C) is a solid choice as it explicitly offers a range of items, including all those mentioned. The mall (D) is less specific and includes many stores that may carry those items but also could include stores that do not.",
    "Reinforce the choice of department store (C): It is directly associated with all three categories mentioned in the question, making it the most accurate answer."
