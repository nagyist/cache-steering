  "query": "Question: Skiing can be very risky, it can be the cause of a very serious what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fall down\nB: fall in\nC: getting cold\nD: accident\nE: trip and fall",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the main focus of the question, which is about the risks associated with skiing.",
    "Next, I should consider what negative outcomes can occur while skiing that are serious in nature.",
    "Looking at the options, \"accident\" is a widely recognized term that typically refers to serious incidents that can occur during skiing.",
    "The other options, such as \"fall down\" and \"trip and fall,\" seem to describe types of incidents that can happen when skiing, but they do not convey the seriousness that \"accident\" does.",
    "The term \"getting cold\" does not directly relate to a serious incident but rather a condition that can occur during the activity.",
    "I should also analyze the likelihood of each option being associated with serious outcomes in skiing. \"Accident\" typically encompasses various serious occurrences, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Comparing the terms \"fall down,\" \"fall in,\" and \"trip and fall,\" they all seem to describe more minor incidents rather than serious risks.",
    "Therefore, it seems clear that the most appropriate answer that aligns with the phrase \"very serious\" in the context of skiing would be \"accident.\""
