  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to store the title to you car or deed to your home?\n\nChoices:\nA: magazine article\nB: safe deposit box\nC: glove box\nD: library\nE: book",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a car title or home deed. These documents are important legal papers that prove ownership and should be stored securely to prevent loss or theft.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided options for security and accessibility. A magazine article and a library are not suitable for storing legal documents.",
    "Assess the glove box. While it is accessible, it is not a secure location, as the car can be broken into easily.",
    "Now, consider the safe deposit box. This is typically held in a bank and offers a high level of security against theft, fire, and other damages.",
    "The safe deposit box also allows for limited access, meaning only authorized individuals can get to the documents when needed. This is essential for important legal documents like a title or deed.",
    "Price and cost considerations may arise, but the priority is on security and preservation of these important documents.",
    "I can dismiss options A (magazine article), C (glove box), D (library), and E (book) because they do not provide the required security or suitability for storing such critical documents.",
    "Given all considerations, the most logical choice for storing the title to a car or deed to a home is indeed the safe deposit box."
