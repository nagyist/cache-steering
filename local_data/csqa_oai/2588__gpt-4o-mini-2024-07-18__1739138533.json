  "steps": [
    "When people are exposed to a virus, the primary expectation is that they may develop an illness.",
    "Viruses typically provoke a biological response in the body, which often leads to symptoms of sickness.",
    "Common symptoms of viral infections include fever, cough, fatigue, and other signs of illness, which would indicate that individuals get sick.",
    "The other choices presented (joy, laugh, talk to each other, ask questions) are not typical reactions to virus exposure.",
    "Experiencing joy, laughter, or engaging in conversations is not directly related to viral exposure and does not align with the general understanding of human reactions to illness.",
    "Thus, I can conclude that the most reasonable outcome of being exposed to a virus is that individuals may get sick."
