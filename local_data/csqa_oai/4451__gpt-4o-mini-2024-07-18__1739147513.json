  "query": "Question: What do airplanes do?\n\nChoices:\nA: carry freight\nB: catch on fire\nC: stall\nD: in the clouds\nE: accelerate",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider what airplanes primarily do and their general purpose.",
    "Airplanes are primarily designed to transport passengers and cargo over long distances.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"carry freight\" (Choice A) directly relates to the concept of airplanes transporting goods.",
    "\"Catch on fire\" (Choice B) is not a function or purpose of an airplane, but rather a possible hazard.",
    "\"Stall\" (Choice C) refers to a specific aerodynamic condition but is not a function of what airplanes do.",
    "\"In the clouds\" (Choice D) is a description of location rather than an action performed by airplanes.",
    "\"Accelerate\" (Choice E) is a part of the flying process, but by itself does not encapsulate the main purpose of airplanes.",
    "Among the options, \"carry freight\" aligns best with the defining function of airplanes as a means of transportation.",
    "Next, we can eliminate the other options as they do not represent the primary function of airplanes.",
    "Since \"carry freight\" is the only option that accurately describes what airplanes do, it must be the correct selection."
