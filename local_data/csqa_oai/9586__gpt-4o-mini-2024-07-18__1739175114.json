  "query": "Question: Where do you go to see a dinosaur bone?\n\nChoices:\nA: human body\nB: arm\nC: tomb\nD: pyramid\nE: museum",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which asks where one would go to see a dinosaur bone.",
    "Next, assess the choices provided: human body, arm, tomb, pyramid, and museum.",
    "The human body and arm are not likely places to see a dinosaur bone, as these parts of the anatomy do not contain dinosaur remains.",
    "Now examine \"tomb\" and \"pyramid.\" While tombs and pyramids are associated with historical artifacts, they are primarily linked to human remains and cultural artifacts rather than dinosaur bones.",
    "The option \"museum\" is specifically related to places where historical artifacts, scientific specimens, and educational exhibits are displayed.",
    "Museums often have exhibits dedicated to dinosaurs, including their bones, fossils, and skeletons.",
    "By reasoning through the relevance of each option, it is clear that \"museum\" is the most logical choice to view a dinosaur bone.",
    "Therefore, the best choice based on the process of elimination and relevance to the subject is \"museum.\""
