  "query": "Question: As a human who valued privacy he asked that everybody do what so he could act without eyes upon him?\n\nChoices:\nA: have to sleep\nB: turn away\nC: look at him\nD: row boat\nE: let down",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the key concept in the question, which revolves around privacy and acting without the observation of others.",
    "The phrase \"act without eyes upon him\" suggests that he wanted to avoid being watched or judged by others while he performed actions or made decisions.",
    "Now, let's examine each choice to determine which one aligns best with the need for privacy and the desire for people not to watch him.",
    "Choice A: \"have to sleep\" does not relate to privacy in a manner that would allow him to act freely, as it implies that he would be inactive.",
    "Choice B: \"turn away\" implies that others should not face him, which aligns with the request to not be observed and allows him the privacy he desires.",
    "Choice C: \"look at him\" directly contradicts the premise of wanting privacy, as asking others to look at him would mean inviting observation.",
    "Choice D: \"row boat\" does not seem relevant to the context of privacy and acting without being watched, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Choice E: \"let down\" is vague and does not specifically address the issue of needing privacy from observation.",
    "After analyzing the choices, \"turn away\" clearly stands out as the action that allows him to act without being watched, which is the essence of his request."
