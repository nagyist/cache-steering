  "steps": [
    "The question specifically asks where in the U.S. foreigners might expect to see a bald eagle but probably won't, meaning the location must be associated with expectations of bald eagle sightings, yet not likely to fulfill that expectation.",
    "Bald eagles are typically found near large bodies of open water with abundant food supplies, chiefly across North America. They are specifically common in states with large lakes and rivers.",
    "Looking at the choices, Florida (A) has numerous rivers and is known for its wildlife, including bald eagles, thus making it a likely place.",
    "Canada (B), while it is just north of the U.S. and has bald eagles, is not a U.S. location. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t fit the criteria.",
    "Washington (C) is famous for its natural habitats suitable for bald eagles, especially in areas like the Puget Sound. It's a known place to see them, reducing the likelihood of a foreigner's expectation not being met.",
    "Utah (D) is less famous for bald eagle sightings compared to some other states but does have them, especially in certain regions, so it could be a place where they may be somewhat expected.",
    "Colorado (E) also has regions where bald eagles can be found, particularly around lakes and rivers, thus not fulfilling the conditions of \u201cprobably won't\u201d see them as well.",
    "Therefore, among the options, Washington (C) stands out, as it is not only rich in bald eagle sightings but could likely create the expectation of seeing them due to its reputation, even though individual sightings can vary.",
    "Since the question emphasizes a location where foreigners might expect to see if directly due to the association but don\u2019t really have a high chance of doing so, Washington makes the most sense."
