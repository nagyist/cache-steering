    "Choice A is \"laughter.\" While laughter often accompanies having fun, it's not solely a facial sign; it also includes vocal sounds.",
    "Choice B is \"pleasure.\" This is more of an internal feeling rather than a specific facial expression.",
    "Choice C is \"smiling.\" Smiling is a clear and significant facial expression that indicates enjoyment and fun.",
    "Choice D is \"being happy.\" Like pleasure, this represents an overall emotional state rather than a specific facial sign.",
