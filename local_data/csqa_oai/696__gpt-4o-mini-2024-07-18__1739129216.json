  "query": "Question: Where can someone purchase a contraceptive device without a prescription?\n\nChoices:\nA: pharmacy\nB: person\nC: drugstore\nD: bedroom\nE: mcdonalds",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to clarify what a contraceptive device is. Common examples include condoms and some types of hormonal contraceptives.",
    "Next, I have to consider which of the answer choices is a place where contraceptive devices are typically sold.",
    "I know that pharmacies and drugstores usually carry contraceptive devices like condoms.",
    "While both a pharmacy and a drugstore generally sell contraceptive devices without requiring a prescription for over-the-counter options, I should check the terms used in the question.",
    "The term \"drugstore\" is often synonymous with \"pharmacy,\" but it may also imply a wider selection of goods.",
    "Now I analyze the other options. \"Person\" and \"bedroom\" do not qualify as commercial places for purchase, and \"McDonald's\" is a fast-food restaurant where contraceptive devices would not typically be sold.",
    "Therefore, I conclude that both \"pharmacy\" and \"drugstore\" are correct places for purchasing contraceptives without a prescription, but I need to choose one of the provided options.",
    "Since \"drugstore\" is one of the answer choices and is considered a common retail space for purchasing contraceptive devices, I will choose that option."
