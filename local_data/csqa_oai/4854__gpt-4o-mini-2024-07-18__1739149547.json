  "query": "Question: Where would a highlighter be used in a legal case?\n\nChoices:\nA: office supply store\nB: office drawer\nC: desk drawer\nD: case\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the primary function of a highlighter, which is to emphasize or highlight important information in text.",
    "Next, I will consider the context of a legal case, where documents such as briefs, evidence, and legal texts are often examined.",
    "I will analyze where one would typically find and use a highlighter in relation to a legal case.",
    "An office supply store (Choice A) is a place to buy supplies but is not a place where a highlighter would be used in a legal case.",
    "An office drawer (Choice B) may contain a highlighter, but it is not specifically related to the act of using a highlighter in a legal case.",
    "A desk drawer (Choice C) is similar to an office drawer and could contain a highlighter, but again, it doesn't focus on the usage in a legal case setting.",
    "A 'case' (Choice D) could refer to the ongoing legal matter, but using a highlighter within an ongoing case is a bit vague; it doesn't specify a clear location or context.",
    "Considering Choice E, a school setting typically involves study materials where highlighters may be used, but this does not pertain specifically to legal cases.",
    "Since the context of \"case\" suggests the legal situation where reviewing documents would be most prominent, highlighting pertinent information within those documents appears most appropriate.",
    "Therefore, while several options discuss different locations or contexts for highlighter usage, the most straightforward answer in relation to the legal case would be 'D' when highlighting crucial parts of evidence or text during the case process."
