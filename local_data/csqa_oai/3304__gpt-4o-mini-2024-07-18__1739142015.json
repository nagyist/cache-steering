  "query": "Question: Washing clothes over and over many times what do they do?\n\nChoices:\nA: transmutate\nB: wear out\nC: torn\nD: get wet\nE: wet clothes",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the effect of repeatedly washing clothes many times.",
    "Washing clothes typically involves subjecting them to water, detergent, and mechanical action, which can impact their fabric integrity.",
    "Over time, the repeated exposure to these conditions can lead to the degradation of the materials, causing them to lose their structural integrity.",
    "\"Transmutate\" suggests a transformation into a different substance, which isn't typically what washing does to clothes.",
    "\"Wear out\" is a term that describes the gradual damage and loss of usability due to regular use or washing.",
    "\u201cTorn\u201d might imply the clothes could develop rips or tears, but it doesn\u2019t encapsulate all effects of washing as \u201cwear out\u201d does.",
    "\u201cGet wet\u201d and \u201cwet clothes\u201d are outcomes of washing but do not describe the long-term effects of repeated washing.",
    "Thus, of all the choices, \"wear out\" most accurately describes the cumulative effect of washing clothes many times."
