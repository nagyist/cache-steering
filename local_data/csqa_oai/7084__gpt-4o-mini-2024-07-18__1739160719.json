    "The question describes a koala that has moved to a new home because it couldn\u2019t find its usual haunts. This indicates that its previous habitat is somehow related to natural environments, likely where koalas typically live.",
    "Koalas are native to Australia and are most commonly associated with eucalyptus trees, specifically gum trees. Since they are arboreal, they make their homes in trees.",
    "Among the provided choices, both \"gum tree\" (E) and \"great outdoors\" (C) could relate to koala habitats. However, \"great outdoors\" is a broader term that may refer to general natural spaces without specifying the type of space.",
    "The phrase \"made its home at the top of something else\" suggests that the new home is elevated, which aligns well with the behavior of koalas living in trees.",
    "The \"gum tree\" specifically indicates the type of tree koalas inhabit, making it the most accurate option in this context.",
    "\"Jungle\" (A) and \"pet shop\" (D) are not realistic habitats for a koala, and \"San Diego Zoo\" (B) is a man-made environment, which contradicts the idea of it finding its home in the wild.",
    "Comparing all options, gum trees are indeed where koalas typically make their home and are elevated structures.",
    "Thus, it is logical to conclude that the correct answer for where the koala is living now, considering it has moved from its usual settings, is in a gum tree."
