  "query": "Question: what do scientists want to identify when they discover a new animal?\n\nChoices:\nA: human\nB: conduct experiment\nC: specific\nD: if they are nice\nE: plant",
  "steps": [
    "Scientists aim to identify the classification of a new animal, which includes determining its species and place in the animal kingdom.",
    "To achieve this classification, scientists analyze various characteristics of the new animal such as its physical features, genetic makeup, and behavior.",
    "By determining these characteristics, scientists can gain insights into the animal\u2019s ecological role and evolutionary history.",
    "Identifying the specific species is crucial for understanding biodiversity and the relationships between different organisms.",
    "The term \"specific\" in the options suggests the act of pinpointing the exact species among a broader classification.",
    "Answer choices like A (human) and E (plant) do not align with the immediate goal of identifying a new animal.",
    "Choice B (conduct experiment) is related to research but does not pertain to the identification process specifically.",
    "Choice D (if they are nice) is not a scientific measure and holds no relevance to the identification of an animal.",
    "Thus, the most logical and relevant answer from the choices provided is C (specific), as the primary goal involves identifying the specific species."
