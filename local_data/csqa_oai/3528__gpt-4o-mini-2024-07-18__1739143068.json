  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the statement: John was an important person, but when wronged he could be what? This suggests we are looking for a term that reflects a negative change in his demeanor or characteristics when he feels wronged.",
    "Next, let's look at the choices provided. We need to determine which of these terms could reflect a negative or diminished response due to feeling wronged.",
    "Choice A: trivial. This indicates something of little importance, which does not align with the notion of John's reaction to being wronged.",
    "Choice B: petty. This word suggests being concerned with small or insignificant matters, especially in a spiteful way. This could align with John's potential reaction when wronged.",
    "Choice C: slight. While this can suggest something minor or not substantial, it doesn\u2019t necessarily convey the negative aspect of John's response that we are looking for.",
    "Choice D: negligible. Similar to trivial, this terms indicates something that can be ignored due to its insignificance, which does not fit the context of John's reaction.",
    "Choice E: impolite. This indicates a lack of manners and could be a possible reaction when someone feels wronged, however, it does not capture the essence of John\u2019s importance.",
    "After evaluating all the options, \"petty\" stands out as it specifically describes a personality change corresponding to being wronged and is relevant to John's prior importance."
