  "steps": [
    "First, the construction manager has a responsibility to keep the financiers informed about the status of the project they are funding.",
    "One of the key aspects that financiers would be concerned about is the progress of the construction, as it directly affects their investment.",
    "The word \"briefing\" suggests that the communication is aimed at updating or informing the financiers about important information.",
    "Collaboration (Choice A) and exchanging ideas (Choice D) are important, but they are not the primary focus of a construction project update\u2014it is more about progress.",
    "The term \"bulldozer\" (Choice C) refers to equipment and is not relevant in the context of a briefing to financiers.",
    "The option \"static\" (Choice E) seems unrelated as it doesn't pertain to the context of construction project updates.",
    "Considering the context of a construction manager briefing financiers, the most logical topic would be the current state or progress of the construction project.",
    "Therefore, the conclusion is that the construction manager was likely briefing the financiers on the progress of the building project."
