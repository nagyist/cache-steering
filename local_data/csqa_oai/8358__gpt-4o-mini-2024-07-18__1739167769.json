  "query": "Question: At work I do lots of math, so I keep a calculator open and handy on my what?\n\nChoices:\nA: wristwatch\nB: office\nC: purse\nD: accounting department\nE: desktop",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which is about keeping a calculator handy at work for math-related tasks.",
    "Next, evaluate each option based on practicality and common scenarios in a work environment.",
    "Option A: Wristwatch. While some smartwatches have calculator functions, they are not typically used for extensive calculations, especially in a work context, where more functionality is needed.",
    "Option B: Office. This is a general term, but it could imply a desk or workspace where someone would generally use a calculator frequently.",
    "Option C: Purse. A purse is not practical for storing a calculator, especially if regular access is needed for work tasks.",
    "Option D: Accounting department. This is a specific area where calculators are used, but the phrasing of the question suggests a more general location one would keep a calculator handy.",
    "Option E: Desktop. A desktop is a very likely and practical location for keeping a calculator as it implies a workspace setup where a calculator would be readily available for use.",
    "After analyzing the options, \"desktop\" stands out as the most logical choice where one would keep a calculator for frequent access at work."
