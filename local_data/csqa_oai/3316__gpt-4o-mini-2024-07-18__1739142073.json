  "steps": [
    "The person is scared of violent burglars, which indicates they feel threatened and are concerned about their safety.",
    "The choices must be evaluated based on how they relate to the feeling of fear and the presence of potential danger from burglars.",
    "Choice A, \"get a hanky,\" does not address the fear of burglars and seems unrelated to personal safety.",
    "Choice B, \"cross street,\" could be a behavior associated with avoiding danger, but it doesn't directly focus on the threat from burglars.",
    "Choice C, \"feel sleepy,\" is not a logical response to fear, and it suggests a state of relaxation rather than addressing the danger.",
    "Choice D, \"arm himself,\" is a direct and logical action for someone fearful of violent burglars. Arming oneself implies taking measures to protect against potential threats.",
    "Choice E, \"receive mail,\" is unrelated to the context of fear and has no bearing on the person's safety concerning burglars.",
    "Considering all the responses, the most reasonable action for someone scared of burglars is to take a protective measure, which corresponds with choice D."
