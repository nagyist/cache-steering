  "query": "Question: If you have beans while eating breakfast you may experience what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fullness\nB: indigestion\nC: gas\nD: gain energy\nE: stomach ache",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nutritional content of beans. Beans are high in fiber and protein, which can lead to feelings of fullness.",
    "Second, recognize that fiber, although beneficial, can also lead to digestive issues for some individuals, potentially causing indigestion.",
    "Third, understand that beans are known to cause gas in some people due to the complex sugars (oligosaccharides) that can be difficult to digest.",
    "Fourth, reflect on how beans might contribute to energy levels. While they provide protein and slow-releasing carbohydrates, this might not be the most immediate effect compared to other breakfast foods.",
    "Fifth, consider the possibility of a stomach ache. This could happen if a person is not used to eating beans or has a sensitivity to them.",
    "Now, evaluate the options based on more common experiences with beans specifically at breakfast.",
    "Gas production is a well-documented issue for many who consume beans, especially for those who are not regularly incorporating them into their diet.",
    "While fullness, indigestion, and potential stomach aches are possible, the symptom most commonly associated with a meal high in beans is gas.",
    "Eliminate options that are less common compared to gas. Fullness and gain energy are not typically immediate reactions to eating beans.",
    "Conclude that the most likely experience from eating beans at breakfast is gas."
