  "query": "Question: After the guilty verdict in the killing the judge gave a speech, he told the murderer he was pure what?\n\nChoices:\nA: wrong\nB: death of\nC: bad\nD: negative\nE: evil",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of the question, which revolves around the judge's speech following a guilty verdict in a murder case.",
    "Judges often use strong language to convey the severity of the crime and the moral implications of a person's actions.",
    "The choices provided include words that describe negative traits or states: wrong, death of, bad, negative, and evil.",
    "In legal and moral contexts, the term \"evil\" is often used to describe particularly heinous acts, such as murder.",
    "I should consider whether the other options fit the context of the judge's speech. \"Wrong\" could apply but is more general and less impactful than \"evil.\"",
    "\"Death of\" does not make sense as a descriptive term for an individual or their actions.",
    "\"Bad\" is another descriptor, but it is also too vague to convey the weight of a murder verdict.",
    "\"Negative\" is similar to \"bad\" and does not capture the moral gravity of the act in question.",
    "Thus, \"evil\" stands out as the most appropriate term the judge could use to describe someone who has committed murder, as it conveys a strong condemnation of the act."
