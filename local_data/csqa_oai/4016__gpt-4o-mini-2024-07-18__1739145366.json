  "steps": [
    "The question states that residents believe the city should manage garbage waste, indicating a need for a municipal solution rather than individual responsibility.",
    "The options provided include several infrastructure elements related to waste management and sanitation.",
    "Option A, \"garbage can,\" is a personal disposal method and does not represent a city-managed solution.",
    "Option B, \"garbage dump,\" is indeed a location where waste is collected, managed, and stored at a larger scale, appropriate for city management.",
    "Option C, \"sewer,\" primarily relates to wastewater disposal and not directly to garbage waste.",
    "Option D, \"street,\" refers to public roadways, not an element directly tied to waste management.",
    "Option E, \"gutter,\" is meant for stormwater drainage and does not pertain to solid waste management specifically.",
    "Considering the role of each option in managing garbage waste, the 'garbage dump' is the most fitting creation for a city to handle the disposal of large amounts of waste."
