  "query": "Question: What happens when glass has been hit?\n\nChoices:\nA: melted\nB: break easily\nC: shattering\nD: hold water\nE: many different colors",
  "steps": [
    "When glass is hit, it may undergo a physical change due to the force applied to it.",
    "One potential outcome of hitting glass is that it may crack or break, depending on the strength of the impact.",
    "If the impact is strong enough, the glass is likely to shatter rather than just crack or break into large pieces.",
    "The term \"shattering\" specifically refers to glass breaking into many small, sharp fragments as opposed to just breaking into larger, more manageable pieces.",
    "To evaluate the options, let's analyze each one: \n- A: \"melted\" does not apply as glass typically does not melt upon being hit unless subjected to extreme heat, which is not implied by 'hitting'.\n- B: \"break easily\" is somewhat accurate but does not describe the extent of breaking.\n- C: \"shattering\" describes the most common and dramatic outcome when glass is hit with significant force.\n- D: \"hold water\" is irrelevant as it does not relate to the action of hitting.\n- E: \"many different colors\" is not relevant as well and does not pertain to the state of glass after being hit.",
    "Based on the specific context of the outcome of glass being hit, \"shattering\" most accurately represents what typically occurs rather than just breaking or any other characteristics of glass."
