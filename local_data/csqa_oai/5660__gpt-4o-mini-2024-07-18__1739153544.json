  "query": "Question: John put  salt on his salad.  Mary suggested that he should spritz what on it, instead?\n\nChoices:\nA: peppers\nB: black pepper\nC: vinegar\nD: cure meat\nE: adding flavor",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that John put salt on his salad, which indicates he is looking to add flavor to his food.",
    "Mary suggests that he should spritz something on his salad, which implies she is recommending a liquid component to enhance the taste.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, A (peppers) and B (black pepper) are not spritzable items; they are typically added as dry spices.",
    "Choice D (cure meat) does not apply here, as it\u2019s not a condiment or seasoning fit for a salad but rather a method of preserving meat.",
    "Choice E (adding flavor) is too vague and does not represent a specific item that can be spritzed on the salad.",
    "This leaves us with choice C (vinegar), which is commonly used as a dressing or flavoring for salads and can be easily spritzed.",
    "Additionally, vinegar is known for its complementary flavor profile with salt, making it an appropriate choice for Mary to suggest.",
    "After reviewing all options, the most fitting answer that aligns with the context of spritzing something on a salad is indeed vinegar."
