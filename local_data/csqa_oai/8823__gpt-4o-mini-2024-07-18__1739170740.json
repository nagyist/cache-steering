  "query": "Question: Where can you buy a purse as well as a TV?\n\nChoices:\nA: handbag\nB: department store\nC: pocket\nD: pocket\nE: home",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a location where both a purse and a TV can be purchased.",
    "A \"handbag\" (choice A) refers specifically to a type of purse and does not typically sell TVs, so it cannot be the answer.",
    "A \"pocket\" (choices C and D) is a part of clothing and cannot be a place to buy items, so these options are not valid.",
    "The term \u201chome\u201d (choice E) could imply a place where one might own a purse and a TV but does not represent a store or purchasing location.",
    "A \"department store\" (choice B) is a retail establishment that typically sells a variety of goods, including clothing (like purses) and electronics (like TVs).",
    "Given the range of products that department stores carry, it is reasonable to conclude that you could buy both a purse and a TV there.",
    "I will compare the relevant characteristics of each choice:\n- Handbag: only purses\n- Department store: a variety of items including purses and TVs\n- Pocket: not a purchasing location\n- Home: not a purchasing location",
    "Since the only choice that allows for the purchase of both items is the department store, the correct answer must be B."
