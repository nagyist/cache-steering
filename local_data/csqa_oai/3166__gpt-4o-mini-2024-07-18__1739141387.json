  "query": "Question: Where can you find a single musician that an audience is listening to?\n\nChoices:\nA: studio\nB: stage\nC: band\nD: symphony\nE: orchestra",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the nature of a \"single musician\" and the context of a performance where an audience is actively listening.",
    "A \"studio\" is typically a place where musicians record music and may not necessarily have an audience present.",
    "A \"band\" usually refers to a group of musicians, implying multiple individuals rather than a single one, even though some bands may have a lead musician.",
    "A \"symphony\" typically involves a large ensemble playing classical music, suggesting it does not center around a single musician.",
    "An \"orchestra\" similarly consists of many musicians and is not representative of a single musician performing.",
    "A \"stage\" is a performance area where musicians can perform, and it is plausible to have a single musician performing there in front of an audience.",
    "Thus, among the choices provided, the option \"stage\" is the most reasonable place for a single musician to perform and be listened to by an audience."
