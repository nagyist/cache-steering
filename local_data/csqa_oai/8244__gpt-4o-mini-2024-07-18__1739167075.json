  "steps": [
    "The question asks where the supreme courthouse in a state is typically located.",
    "In the context of U.S. states, supreme courthouses are often the highest court in the state judicial system.",
    "These courthouses are significant institutions that handle important legal matters and are symbolically important for the judiciary.",
    "Typically, the seat of government for each state is in the capital city, which serves as the administrative center of the state.",
    "Since the supreme court represents the highest legal authority in the state, it is logical for it to be located in the capital where the state's government and legislative bodies are also found.",
    "While some states may have unique circumstances, the general practice is to have the supreme court situated in the capital city.",
    "This makes option C (\"capital city\") the most reasonable choice based on the standard practices in the United States.",
    "Options A, B, D, and E do not typically represent the location of a state supreme court, as they either refer to a specific state, an ambiguous location, or unrelated contexts (such as marriage)."
