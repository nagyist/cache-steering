  "steps": [
    "The question asks for what everyone was instructed to do after the yoga class.",
    "The phrase \"sit quietly\" suggests an activity that promotes relaxation and focus.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"meditate\" aligns best with the idea of sitting quietly.",
    "\"Sitting down\" is a general instruction and does not imply an activity; it simply states the physical position.",
    "\"Alone\" describes a state rather than an activity that one would be instructed to do.",
    "\"Shut up\" is an informal phrase and does not convey a mindful or calming activity typically associated with yoga.",
    "\"Go home\" indicates an endpoint rather than a continuation of mindfulness or quietness.",
    "Considering the nature of yoga and the context, the most reasonable action after sitting quietly would be meditation.",
    "Thus, the correct answer based on the process of elimination and contextual reasoning is B."
