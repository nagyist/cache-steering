  "query": "Question: If you're using scuba gear in the ocean where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: beach\nB: surface of earth\nC: future\nD: waterfalls\nE: underwater",
  "steps": [
    "Scuba gear is designed for underwater exploration, allowing divers to breathe while submerged.",
    "The ocean is a large body of salt water, typically associated with being below the surface.",
    "Using scuba gear implies that a person is not just at the water's surface but is likely swimming or diving deep within the water.",
    "The beach refers to the area where land meets the ocean, which is at the surface and not where scuba gear would primarily be used.",
    "The surface of the Earth includes various environments but does not specifically indicate being underwater.",
    "The term \"future\" does not have any correlation with the use of scuba gear or being in the ocean.",
    "Waterfalls are usually areas where water flows over a vertical drop and does not typically imply the use of scuba gear.",
    "Given all these considerations, the only appropriate environment for using scuba gear is when one is submerged in water.",
    "Thus, the correct answer must represent being underwater, which is the primary purpose of scuba gear."
