  "query": "Question: If you don't have anything designed to hold a dollar bill, where would you likely carry it?\n\nChoices:\nA: wallet\nB: billfold\nC: purse\nD: pocket\nE: bank",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where one would likely carry a dollar bill if they don't have a designated holder for it.",
    "A wallet is a common holder for dollar bills, but since the question specifies that there is nothing designed to hold it, a wallet is not applicable.",
    "A billfold is essentially another term for a wallet, which also suggests it's designed to hold dollar bills, making it an unsuitable option based on the condition.",
    "A purse can also hold dollar bills but usually accommodates various items, including cards and personal belongings.",
    "Pockets are common places to carry loose items like bills, and they don\u2019t require any specific design for holding money.",
    "Carrying a dollar bill in a bank wouldn't fit the context of carrying it on your person, as it's meant for storing money rather than carrying based on need.",
    "Considering the context of the question, both \"purse\" and \"pocket\" are reasonable choices for where one might carry a dollar bill without a specific holder.",
    "However, a pocket is simpler and more commonly used for carrying loose items compared to a purse.",
    "Comparing the two feasible options (pocket and purse), the pocket is typically a more likely choice when one does not have any designated carrying item."
