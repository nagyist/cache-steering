  "query": "Question: Where would a snake hide before ambushing prey?\n\nChoices:\nA: burlap sack\nB: closet\nC: pet shops\nD: hot country\nE: deep grass",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a snake would conceal itself prior to attacking its prey. This suggests that the location should offer a form of camouflage or cover that allows for stealth.",
    "Option A, a burlap sack, is not a natural habitat for snakes and is unlikely to be their choice for hiding. It does not provide a suitable environment for ambushing prey.",
    "Option B, a closet, is also an unnatural setting for a snake to hide, as it is typically a human-made space and does not fit a snake's natural behavior in the wild.",
    "Option C, pet shops, while they may house snakes, do not serve as a natural ambush location for a snake looking for prey.",
    "Option D, a hot country, describes a geographical location but doesn't specify a particular hiding spot where a snake could ambush prey. Furthermore, it does not inherently suggest a natural cover for hunting.",
    "Option E, deep grass, provides a natural environment that is ideal for snakes to hide and wait for potential prey. It offers sufficient cover and concealment from both predators and the animals they may target.",
    "Out of the provided options, deep grass stands out prominently as the most suitable and effective location for a snake to ambush someone or something.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all options, it is clear that the best answer based on the reasoning provided is deep grass."
