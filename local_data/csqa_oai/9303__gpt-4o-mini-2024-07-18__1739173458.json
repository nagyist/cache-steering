  "query": "Question: What estuary in Maryland and Virginia is known for its crab?\n\nChoices:\nA: fish market\nB: clam chowder\nC: cooking pot\nD: tidepools\nE: chesapeake bay",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about a specific estuary in Maryland and Virginia that is famous for its crab, which is a notable seafood in that region.",
    "Crabs, particularly blue crabs, are well known in the Chesapeake Bay area, which encompasses parts of both Maryland and Virginia.",
    "The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, so it fits the description of being an estuary.",
    "I am evaluating the choices given: \nA (fish market) refers generally to a type of place, rather than an estuary; \nB (clam chowder) is a dish, not an estuary; \nC (cooking pot) also refers to a vessel and isn't related directly to the estuary; \nD (tidepools) are specific coastal features but do not refer to the Chesapeake Bay specifically; \nE (Chesapeake Bay) is the only option that refers to the actual estuary recognized for its crab.",
    "Given all the considerations, the Chesapeake Bay stands out as the well-known estuary famous for crab dishes and harvesting.",
    "Thus, I can confidently conclude that the correct answer focuses on the estuary itself, which is Chesapeake Bay."
