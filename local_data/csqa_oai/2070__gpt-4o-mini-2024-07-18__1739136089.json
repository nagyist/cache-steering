  "steps": [
    "The question states that a bald eagle is flying over St. Paul. St. Paul is a specific location in the United States.",
    "Next, I need to identify where St. Paul is geographically. St. Paul is the capital of Minnesota.",
    "Now, I can gather information about the flight patterns or habitats of bald eagles. They are primarily found near large bodies of water, including lakes and rivers.",
    "The presence of bald eagles is common in Minnesota due to its abundant natural resources, including rivers and lakes which serve as hunting grounds.",
    "Given that the question specifies \u201cover St. Paul,\u201d it implies that the bald eagle is currently located in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minnesota.",
    "Now I can analyze the answer choices provided. The options are Texas, Thermal, Minnesota, Canada, and Photograph.",
    "Out of the options provided, I have identified Minnesota as a direct match to St. Paul\u2019s location.",
    "Texas is a different state altogether, Thermal does not correspond to a location relevant to the question, Canada is a neighboring country but not near St. Paul specifically, and Photograph doesn't represent a location.",
    "Thus, the most logical and accurate answer based on geographic location is Minnesota."
