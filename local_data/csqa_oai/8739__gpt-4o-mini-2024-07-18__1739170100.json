  "query": "Question: Where is beaver likely to be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: strip club\nB: zoo\nC: lake or river\nD: millpond\nE: forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the natural habitat of a beaver. Beavers are semi-aquatic mammals that are primarily associated with water bodies.",
    "Next, think about where beavers typically build their homes. They are known for constructing dams and lodges in bodies of water like lakes and rivers.",
    "Evaluate each choice in relation to a beaver's preferred habitat. A strip club (A) is an urban and human-centric environment not suitable for a beaver.",
    "A zoo (B) could have beavers, but it is not a natural habitat; it's an artificial environment for animal display and not where beavers are typically found in the wild.",
    "A lake or river (C) is a direct match with beavers\u2019 natural habitat, as they thrive in these environments.",
    "A millpond (D) could also be a habitat for a beaver since it is a type of stagnant water created by a dam, but it is a more specific feature rather than a general habitat.",
    "Lastly, although forests (E) are places where beavers might be found nearby to gather materials for building dams, they rely primarily on water bodies to live.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the best choice that aligns with the natural habitat where beavers are most likely found is a lake or river (C)."
