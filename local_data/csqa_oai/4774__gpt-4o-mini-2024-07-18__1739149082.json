  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a politician who makes numerous empty promises during a campaign. This suggests that their true intentions may not align with their public declarations.",
    "Among the provided choices, we should consider what the underlying motivation of a politician might be when engaging in such behavior.",
    "The act of making empty promises could indicate a desire to gain something from the electorate, primarily focusing on achieving a goal that allows them to continue functioning in their political role.",
    "Out of the options, \"power\" (A) could imply a broader ambition, while \"influence\" (B) suggests a secondary goal. However, it is less specific than the goal of achieving election results.",
    "The choice \"win elections\" (C) directly correlates with the results of a political campaign, focusing on a campaign's primary aim.",
    "Looking at \"re-elected\" (D), while this also has relevance, it focuses more on an ongoing cycle rather than the immediate goal of the current campaign.",
    "Finally, \"bribe\" (E) seems to imply unethical behavior but doesn\u2019t squarely match the overall aspect of making promises in a campaign setting.",
    "After analyzing the options, it becomes clear that the most relevant and immediate goal of making empty promises during a campaign is to win elections."
