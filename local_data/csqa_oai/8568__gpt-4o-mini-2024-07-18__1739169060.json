  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question. It mentions a class of children walking in a line with a guide, which typically suggests they are on an outing or field trip.",
    "Next, evaluate the options given. Choices A (to school) and D (view video) imply a more stationary or educational environment rather than an outing.",
    "Choice E (jump rope) refers to a specific activity rather than a destination or goal for the outing.",
    "Choice C (tickle) is not plausible as it doesn't align with a guided group activity and is not a typical purpose for a field trip.",
    "This leaves us with choice B (see exhibits), which is a common reason for children to be led in a line by a guide, often at a museum or similar venue.",
    "To verify this, consider that field trips usually involve observing or learning from exhibits, making this the most fitting choice.",
    "Lastly, confirm that each of the other options does not describe a logical destination or activity for the context provided."
