  "query": "Question: What midwestern area is likely to have a marmot running free?\n\nChoices:\nA: zoo\nB: encyclopedia\nC: jungle\nD: countryside\nE: great plains",
  "steps": [
    "First, let\u2019s establish what a marmot is. A marmot is a large ground squirrel that typically lives in mountainous areas and open habitats.",
    "Next, we should consider the geographic regions mentioned in the options, specifically within the Midwest.",
    "The Midwest is characterized by flat plains and grasslands, which provides an ideal habitat for wildlife, including marmots.",
    "A zoo (Choice A) is an artificial environment where animals are kept in captivity and would not be considered a natural habitat for a wild marmot.",
    "An encyclopedia (Choice B) is merely a source of information and does not represent a physical location for wildlife.",
    "A jungle (Choice C) is typically a dense, tropical forest environment, which is not a characteristic of the Midwest.",
    "The countryside (Choice D) could potentially support a marmot population as it refers to rural areas with natural habitats.",
    "The great plains (Choice E) are a significant portion of the Midwest and are known for their open grasslands, which are suitable for marmots.",
    "Now, we know that while both countryside and great plains could support a marmot, the great plains are specifically recognized for their vast tracts of suitable habitat.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, great plains are the most likely area in the Midwest to encounter a marmot running free."
