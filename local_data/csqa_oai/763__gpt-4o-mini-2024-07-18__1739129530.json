  "query": "Question: Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway.  Where might he be?\n\nChoices:\nA: department store\nB: school\nC: garden\nD: office building\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway, which suggests that he was in a location where they could become muddy, such as outdoors or in another messy environment.",
    "The shoes being muddy indicates that he was likely outside before entering, which rules out indoor places that maintain cleanliness, such as a department store, school, or office building.",
    "The presence of an entryway implies a home or a similar structure, as these spaces usually have entryways for people to come in and take off their shoes.",
    "Among the options, a \"garden\" is a plausible location where someone would get muddy, but it does not typically have an entryway like a house does.",
    "The only option that allows for both a muddy environment (like being outdoors prior) and an entryway is a \"house.\"",
    "Since Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway, it further supports the idea that he is most likely returning to a house, as that is where such behavior is typical.",
    "Analyzing all choices, only \"house\" consistently matches the clues given: muddy shoes, the presence of an entryway, and returning from outside.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion is that Sam is likely at home."
