  "query": "Question: A toddling child who is learning about the world is gaining what?\n\nChoices:\nA: time\nB: desire to travel\nC: greater mobility\nD: increased security\nE: pleasure",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a \"toddling child,\" which indicates that the child is learning to walk and explore their surroundings.",
    "As toddlers begin to walk and move around, they experience physical changes that contribute to their ability to navigate their environment.",
    "In this context, the primary skill that a child is developing during this phase is \"mobility,\" which refers to their ability to move freely and explore.",
    "Option A, \"time,\" does not directly correlate with a child's capability or development in a physical sense.",
    "Option B, \"desire to travel,\" is more abstract and does not specifically relate to the physical act of learning to walk or move.",
    "Option D, \"increased security,\" may be related but does not directly imply the ability or skill the child is gaining.",
    "Option E, \"pleasure,\" could be experienced by the child as they explore, but it is not the fundamental skill they are gaining at this stage.",
    "Given the focus on the physical aspect of a toddler's development, \"greater mobility\" is the most direct and relevant choice in relation to what a toddler is gaining."
