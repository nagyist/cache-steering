    "The question asks where a man would typically carry a dollar bill.",
    "A wallet is a common accessory for carrying cash, including dollar bills, securely on one's person.",
    "A bank is a place where money is stored or exchanged but not a location for personally carrying a dollar bill.",
    "A car can hold items, including cash, but it is not a personal carrying method for a dollar bill.",
    "A purse is generally associated with women and may not be a typical answer for a man.",
    "A pocket is also a plausible option for carrying small items like a dollar bill.",
    "Between a wallet and a pocket, a wallet is specifically designed for carrying cash, making it the more likely choice.",
    "While a pocket is indeed another option, it lacks the organization and protection a wallet provides.",
