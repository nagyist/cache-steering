  "steps": [
    "The question is about the context in which a person would wear a yarmulke, which is a traditional Jewish head covering.",
    "Yarmulkes are typically worn in religious settings, particularly within the Jewish faith, to show respect and reverence.",
    "One of the choices given is \"synagogue,\" which is a place of worship and community for Jewish people.",
    "Attending a synagogue would be a common situation where one would wear a yarmulke.",
    "The other options (A: demonstration, B: concert, C: garage, D: bus stop) do not imply a religious context or necessity for wearing a yarmulke.",
    "Therefore, \"synagogue\" is the most logical answer to the question."
