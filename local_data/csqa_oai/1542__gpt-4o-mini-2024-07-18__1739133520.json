  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which revolves around having \"nothing to do.\"",
    "Consider what state or condition a person is typically in when they have nothing to do.",
    "The phrase \"nothing to do\" suggests that the person is free and has extra time on their hands.",
    "Analyze the options provided to see which one aligns with having extra or free time.",
    "Option A (\"poor\") does not relate to having free time.",
    "Option B (\"know everything\") also does not pertain to the concept of free time.",
    "Option C (\"headache\") generally refers to a physical condition and does not align with doing nothing.",
    "Option D (\"spare time\") directly signifies having time available beyond obligations or tasks.",
    "Option E (\"make more money\") does not fit with the context of having nothing to do.",
    "Thus, the best answer correlating with a lack of activities or obligations is \"spare time.\""
