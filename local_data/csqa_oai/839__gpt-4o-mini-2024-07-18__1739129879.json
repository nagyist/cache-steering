  "query": "Question: What planet is the atlantic ocean part of?\n\nChoices:\nA: planet\nB: basin\nC: submarines\nD: earth\nE: pacific",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's clarify what the Atlantic Ocean is. The Atlantic Ocean is a large body of saltwater that covers a significant portion of the Earth's surface.",
    "Next, I need to identify if the Atlantic Ocean is associated with any other planet or if it is specific to our planet, Earth.",
    "Various oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean, do not exist on planets outside of Earth. They are geographical features unique to our planet.",
    "Now let's evaluate the options given. Option A, \"planet,\" is too general and does not specify a location.",
    "Option B, \"basin,\" refers to a geographical depression that can contain water but does not specify a particular planet.",
    "Option C, \"submarines,\" pertains to vessels designed to operate underwater and is not related to the planetary question at hand.",
    "Option D, \"earth,\" directly refers to the planet where the Atlantic Ocean is located.",
    "Finally, examining option E, \"pacific,\" labels another ocean, opposite the Atlantic, and does not answer the question.",
    "Thus, the only correct option that accurately identifies the planet associated with the Atlantic Ocean is option D, \"earth.\""
