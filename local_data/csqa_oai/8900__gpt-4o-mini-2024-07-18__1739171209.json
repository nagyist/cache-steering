  "query": "Question: What is a human adapted to handle?\n\nChoices:\nA: co2\nB: community\nC: population\nD: diverse situations\nE: school",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the phrase \"a human adapted to handle.\" We need to identify what humans have evolved or developed skills to manage effectively.",
    "Evaluating option A, \"co2,\" while humans can process carbon dioxide, this is a biological process rather than an adaptation specifically for handling it.",
    "Looking at option B, \"community,\" humans are indeed social creatures and have developed skills to live and interact within communities. This is a significant aspect of human adaptation.",
    "Next, consider option C, \"population.\" While humans do interact with populations, this term is more vague and does not specifically capture an adaptive skill.",
    "For option D, \"diverse situations,\" humans are known for their adaptability in numerous environments and challenges faced throughout evolution, which suggests a capacity to handle diversity in situations.",
    "Finally, option E, \"school,\" refers to a specific learning environment rather than a broad adaptation. While education is important, it does not represent an overarching human adaptation.",
    "After evaluating all the options, options B (community) and D (diverse situations) emerge as strong candidates, but D captures a broader and more essential aspect of human adaptability."
