  "steps": [
    "The question asks about an appropriate location for planting tomatoes.",
    "Tomatoes are typically grown in soil and require sunlight and space to flourish.",
    "An auditorium is an indoor venue primarily used for performances and gatherings, not for planting.",
    "A \"toothrow\" does not represent a known location for planting anything; it appears to be an incorrect term.",
    "A vegetable garden is specifically designed for growing plants, including vegetables like tomatoes.",
    "The porch is an outdoor area but is usually not suitable for planting rows of plants, particularly vegetables.",
    "A farmer's field is large and can be used for planting crops, including tomatoes, but it is less specific than a vegetable garden.",
    "The vegetable garden is the most logical and practical choice focused specifically on growing vegetables such as tomatoes.",
    "Comparing all the options, a vegetable garden best suits the need for planting tomatoes."
