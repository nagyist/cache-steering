  "query": "Question: What body part does dirt sometimes get under?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: fingernails\nC: surface of earth\nD: ground\nE: eat cake",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the options given in relation to the question about where dirt sometimes gets under.",
    "The question specifically refers to a body part, so I need to identify which options relate to body parts and which ones do not.",
    "Looking at the options, \"street,\" \"surface of earth,\" \"ground,\" and \"eat cake\" do not pertain to body parts at all.",
    "The only option that mentions a body part is \"fingernails.\"",
    "Dirt is often found under fingernails due to hand activities, gardening, or outdoor play.",
    "I will now verify if any of the other options could somehow relate to dirt being under them, but they don't represent body parts.",
    "Since no other options relate to body parts, I conclude that \"fingernails\" is the only correct choice.",
    "Thus, the body part that dirt sometimes gets under is indeed \"fingernails.\""
