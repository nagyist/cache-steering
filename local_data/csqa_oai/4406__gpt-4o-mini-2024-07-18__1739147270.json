  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the collective term for space, planets, moons, and everything we can observe.",
    "The options provided are: A: front, B: sentence, C: universe, D: lifestyle, and E: jar.",
    "Option A, \"front,\" does not relate to space or celestial bodies.",
    "Option B, \"sentence,\" pertains to language and does not apply to space-related contexts.",
    "Option C, \"universe,\" directly refers to all of space, including all celestial bodies and everything observable.",
    "Option D, \"lifestyle,\" deals with ways of living and is not relevant to cosmic entities.",
    "Option E, \"jar,\" typically refers to a container and has no connection to the topic of space.",
    "Comparing the definitions of the options, \"universe\" stands out as the only term that encompasses all elements of space and celestial bodies.",
    "Thus, after eliminating the irrelevant options, we conclude that the correct choice fits the definition of the collective term for everything observed in space."
