  "query": "Question: After building his fire, the camper tried washing his hands, what was the immediate result?\n\nChoices:\nA: dry skin\nB: health\nC: dry hands\nD: skin irritation\nE: become wet",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves a camper who has built a fire and then tries to wash his hands. The key action here is \"washing his hands.\"",
    "Washing hands typically involves water, which signifies that the camper's hands will come in contact with water, potentially making them wet.",
    "The act of washing hands with water is unlikely to result in dry skin or dry hands since washing generally introduces moisture.",
    "Considering option E, if he washes his hands, they would indeed become wet, which corresponds directly to the action.",
    "Next, let's analyze the other options:\n- Option A (dry skin) contradicts the action of washing, which adds moisture.\n- Option B (health) is a vague outcome and doesn\u2019t directly relate to the immediate physical state of his hands.\n- Option C (dry hands) again contradicts the hand-washing action, which inherently makes them wet.\n- Option D (skin irritation) could happen for various reasons, but is not the immediate result of simply washing hands.",
    "From the analysis above, the most straightforward and immediate effect of washing his hands is indeed that they become wet."
