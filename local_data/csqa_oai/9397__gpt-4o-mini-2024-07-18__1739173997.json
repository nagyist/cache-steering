  "query": "Question: Dan didn't like what he was seeing, so he turned the control know and flipped it to Andy.  What is the knob on?\n\nChoices:\nA: doorway\nB: control panel\nC: television\nD: drawer\nE: opening doors",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that Dan doesn't like what he is seeing, which suggests that he wants to change or control something. This indicates that the knob is likely related to some kind of device or system.",
    "\"Control knob\" implies that it is used to manage or adjust settings on a machine or device. This narrows down the possibilities to devices like machinery, electronics, or control panels.",
    "The action of flipping the control knob to Andy might imply that the control or observation of what is on the screen (or what is being managed) is now being passed to someone else, which suggests it might be something visual.",
    "Considering the options, \"doorway,\" \"drawer,\" and \"opening doors\" don\u2019t typically involve a control knob in a context that implies changing a visual state, but a control panel or television could.",
    "Out of the remaining options, a \"control panel\" is a common place where knobs are used to adjust various settings or controls. However, it is unclear if Dan was looking at an array of controls or simply a screen.",
    "A television has controls that can be adjusted with a knob (like volume or channel), and based on Dan\u2019s dislike of what he sees, this could imply he was watching a program he didn\u2019t like.",
    "Since the context of \"turning the control knob\" suggests a visual interface changing and flicking the control to Andy suggests a new perspective or input, a television fits better.",
    "Thus, considering all the reasoning, the knob is most likely on a television, given that it can be adjusted while being observed."
