  "query": "Question: What would use a classical stringed instrument?\n\nChoices:\nA: concert\nB: music store\nC: string quartet\nD: rock band\nE: barbershop",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what defines a classical stringed instrument. Classical stringed instruments typically include the violin, viola, cello, and double bass, which are often used in orchestral and chamber music settings.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the choices given: \n- A concert could feature classical music, but it's a general term and doesn't specify string instruments.\n- A music store would sell string instruments rather than use them.\n- A string quartet is a specific group that exclusively uses string instruments.\n- A rock band typically relies more on electric instruments and may not prominently feature classical stringed instruments.\n- A barbershop music group usually focuses on vocal harmonies and does not involve string instruments.",
    "Since the question specifies the use of classical stringed instruments, I need to determine which option specifically involves their performance.",
    "The string quartet is defined as a musical ensemble consisting of four string players, commonly playing classical music. It directly uses classical string instruments.",
    "While other groups like concerts or rock bands may occasionally feature string instruments, they do not exclusively use classical stringed instruments in the way a string quartet does.",
    "Thus, among all the options, the string quartet is the most appropriate choice that primarily uses classical stringed instruments."
