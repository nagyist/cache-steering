  "query": "Question: Where would you store a saltshaker when not in use?\n\nChoices:\nA: own kitchen\nB: empty restaurant\nC: table setting\nD: kitchen cupboard\nE: cruet",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the function of a saltshaker. It is a common kitchen item used for seasoning food.",
    "Next, consider where we typically keep kitchen items when they are not in use. Common storage places include cabinets, cupboards, and dedicated containers.",
    "Now, let's look at the choices provided:\n- A: own kitchen - This suggests a personal kitchen where the saltshaker could be stored.\n- B: empty restaurant - This option implies a commercial space but it is specified as empty, which is not a typical storage choice for a saltshaker.\n- C: table setting - This indicates a place where items are used during a meal, and not a storage option.\n- D: kitchen cupboard - This is a practical and common storage option for kitchen items when they are not being used.\n- E: cruet - While a cruet can hold salt, it is specifically used for that purpose and wouldn\u2019t typically be considered a storage location for a saltshaker.",
    "Evaluating D (kitchen cupboard) against the other options, it stands out as the most logical choice for storing a saltshaker when not in use.",
    "Also, option A (own kitchen) could refer to the kitchen cupboard but is not specific enough to imply a dedicated storage space.",
    "Considering the choices again, D remains the most appropriate as it directly suggests a storage space."
