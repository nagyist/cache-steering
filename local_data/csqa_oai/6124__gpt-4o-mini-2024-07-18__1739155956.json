  "query": "Question: That person next to me is always on her cell phone.\n\nChoices:\nA: feel important\nB: know what time\nC: talk about themselves\nD: issues\nE: own house",
  "steps": [
    "The statement describes someone who is \"always on her cell phone,\" suggesting they are frequently engaged with it.",
    "Being on a cell phone can mean a variety of activities such as talking, texting, browsing social media, or checking the time.",
    "The activity of being constantly on the phone may indicate the person seeks attention or validation, which aligns with feeling important.",
    "Thinking about social media use, it is common for individuals to post updates or interact in ways that center around themselves, which fits the idea of talking about themselves.",
    "The option \"know what time\" does not align well with the statement since being on the phone is likely not solely to know the time.",
    "The option \"issues\" could relate to why someone might be on their phone, but it seems less relevant without more context about their involvement in specific issues.",
    "\"Own house\" does not seem to have any correlation with the act of being on a cell phone.",
    "Given these considerations, the most likely motivations for a person who is consistently on their phone would be either to feel important or talk about themselves.",
    "Among the options, \"talk about themselves\" directly refers to how social media allows users to share personal experiences and thoughts, which connects to the constant phone use.",
    "The choice that most directly reflects the behavior described in the prompt is then examined closely, and it aligns better with \"talk about themselves\" as it captures the essence of constant engagement for self-expression."
