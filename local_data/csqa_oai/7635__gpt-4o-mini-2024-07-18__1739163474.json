  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the main goal of work conducted outside the home.",
    "To interpret the term \"main goal,\" I need to consider what most people aim to achieve by working.",
    "Many engage in work primarily to secure financial stability and support themselves or their families.",
    "While having fun, creating, or producing goods can be benefits or parts of work, they are not universally the main objectives for most workers.",
    "\"Workhour\" is not a goal but rather a description of the time spent working and is therefore not relevant.",
    "Earning money is a fundamental reason people take up employment, particularly outside the home where resources are exchanged for labor.",
    "Thus, I need to weigh the importance of the other options (fun, workhour, create, produce goods) against earning money.",
    "None of the other options encapsulates the primary objective of going to work as pinpointedly as earning money does.",
    "Therefore, the most accurate choice reflecting the main goal, applicable broadly, is earning money."
