  "steps": [
    "Thinking about nice memories generally creates a state of calmness and tranquility in a person.",
    "When one reminisces, it often helps to alleviate stress and can lead to relaxation.",
    "Out of the given options, relaxing is most closely aligned with the idea of thinking about nice memories.",
    "\"Sitting quietly\" suggests an action rather than a mental state, making it less fitting.",
    "\"Concentrate\" and \"stay focused\" imply a need for mental strain or attention, which conflicts with the idea of reminiscing.",
    "\"Waking up\" does not correspond directly with the action of thinking about memories.",
    "Since the act of reflecting on good memories induces relaxation, the best choice here directly associated with that effect is \"relax.\""
