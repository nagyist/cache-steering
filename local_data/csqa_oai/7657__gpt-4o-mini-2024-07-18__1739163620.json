  "query": "Question: You keep things you eat that do not need to be kept cold on a shelf inside of what?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: cupboard\nC: corner\nD: night stand\nE: bookstore",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to food items that do not require refrigeration.",
    "Refrigerators are used to keep food cold, so choice A is not applicable.",
    "A cupboard is a storage space typically used for keeping dry goods and non-perishable items, which aligns with the question.",
    "The term \"corner\" in choice C does not specifically refer to a storage item for food, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.",
    "A night stand, choice D, is generally used for convenience items like lamps or books, not for food storage.",
    "A bookstore, choice E, is a place where books are sold and does not relate to storing food.",
    "Based on the analysis, the best option for storing food that does not need to be kept cold is a cupboard.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer is based on the context of food storage."
