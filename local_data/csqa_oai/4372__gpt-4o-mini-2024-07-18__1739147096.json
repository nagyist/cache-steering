  "query": "Question: What is likely to have a thick membrane?\n\nChoices:\nA: cell\nB: animal\nC: filtration\nD: separating fluids\nE: fresh egg",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the options presented and identify what it means for something to have a thick membrane.",
    "A thick membrane would generally refer to a barrier that is either physically substantial or has a complex structure, often designed to protect or separate.",
    "Examine option A (cell): Cells have membranes, but generally, they are not described as \"thick,\" instead they are more flexible and thin.",
    "Examine option B (animal): Animals have various types of membranes in their bodies, but again, they are typically not classified under the \"thick\" category in general terms.",
    "Examine option C (filtration): Filtration often involves processes and equipment but doesn't specifically highlight a \"thick membrane.\"",
    "Examine option D (separating fluids): This could involve membranes, but it doesn't specifically suggest a thick one.",
    "Examine option E (fresh egg): A fresh egg has a thick membrane (the egg white's membrane) that surrounds its contents and provides physical protection. This is often noted for its sturdiness.",
    "By comparison, option E stands out as it directly refers to a structure known for its thickness in a biological context.",
    "Therefore, considering all options and reasoning through their descriptions, the option that best fits the criteria of having a thick membrane is a fresh egg."
