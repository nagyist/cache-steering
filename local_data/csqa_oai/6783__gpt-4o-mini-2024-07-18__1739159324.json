  "query": "Question: If you were lazy you'd probably choose to just watch television simply because what?\n\nChoices:\nA: entertained\nB: see favorite show\nC: plug in\nD: get comfortable\nE: you're bored",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of being lazy and the motivation behind the choice to watch television. Generally, laziness implies a desire for minimal effort and to be entertained without a lot of action.",
    "Next, look at the choices provided. \"Entertained\" (A) suggests a general response to the TV; it is too broad and not a direct reason.",
    "The option \"see favorite show\" (B) gives a specific motivation but does not encompass the laziness aspect and is more about personal preference than the act of choosing laziness.",
    "\"Plug in\" (C) refers to the action of turning on the television, but does not articulate a reason for choosing to watch as a lazy option.",
    "\"Get comfortable\" (D) aligns with the concept of laziness, as one would typically want to relax and not exert themselves. However, it doesn't connect directly to the act of watching television specifically.",
    "Finally, \"you're bored\" (E) is a compelling reason for choosing to watch television, as boredom indicates a lack of engagement in other activities and a tendency to resort to passive entertainment.",
    "Therefore, considering these reflections, the best choice that directly connects laziness to the act of watching television is \"you\u2019re bored.\" It summarizes a common situation where one might choose television due to a lack of other interests or activities."
