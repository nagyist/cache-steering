  "steps": [
    "The question states that scientists initially thought something was an impossibility, indicating that it was believed to be entirely unlikely or even impossible based on previous understanding.",
    "With the introduction of new evidence, the situation changed, implying that the new evidence has altered the previous viewpoint and opened the door to new interpretations or outcomes.",
    "The word \"chance\" in the question suggests a shift from something being impossible to something now being at least a potential outcome, rather than something that must occur or can be guaranteed.",
    "Looking at the choices, 'inevitability' suggests something that must happen and contradicts the idea of something that was once impossible.",
    "'Certainty' also implies that the event will definitely occur, which doesn't align with the notion of a \"chance.\"",
    "'Possibility,' 'possible,' and 'possibility' all convey the idea that something can happen, which aligns with the revised view provided by the new evidence.",
    "The difference between 'possibility' and 'possible' is that 'possibility' is a noun, while 'possible' is an adjective. In the context of the question, we are looking for a noun form to express the concept that something can occur given the new evidence.",
    "Thus, between the choices 'possibility' and 'possible,' 'possibility' best captures the essence of the change in perspective due to the new evidence.",
    "Therefore, the most accurate answer to convey that it is now feasible to entertain the idea that it could happen is 'possibility.'"
