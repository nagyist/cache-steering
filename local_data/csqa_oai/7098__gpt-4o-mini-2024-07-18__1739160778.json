    "First, I need to assess the effects of consuming a lot of alcohol on the human body and behavior.",
    "Drinking a lot of alcohol often leads to impaired judgment and coordination, which can result in injuries from accidents or falls.",
    "Excessive alcohol consumption can also lead people to engage in risky or foolish behaviors, commonly referred to as \"doing stupid things.\"",
    "Another effect of heavy drinking is the potential for amnesia or memory loss, occasionally referred to as \"blackouts\".",
    "Hangovers are a common aftermath of heavy drinking, characterized by headaches, nausea, and other uncomfortable symptoms the next day.",
    "Drunkenness is the state or condition of being intoxicated due to excessive alcohol consumption and is also a direct result of drinking a lot.",
    "Now, I need to analyze which of these effects are the most significant or common as a direct consequence of drinking large amounts of alcohol.",
    "Injuries can indeed happen due to drinking; however, they are often secondary to decisions made while intoxicated.",
    "\"Doing stupid things\" captures risky behaviors resulting from reduced judgment due to alcohol, but this is somewhat vague.",
