  "query": "Question: The teacher yelled at her students, what prompted her to do that?\n\nChoices:\nA: answering questions\nB: talk too much\nC: teach children\nD: to start lunch\nE: open boxes",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the context in which a teacher would yell at students. Typically, this action would be prompted by behavior that is disruptive or not aligned with classroom expectations.",
    "Next, let's analyze each option to see if it logically leads to the teacher's frustration that would result in yelling.",
    "Option A: \"answering questions\" seems like a positive behavior, so it is unlikely that it would prompt a teacher to yell.",
    "Option B: \"talk too much\" is a likely reason for a teacher to yell, as excessive talking can disrupt the class and hinder learning.",
    "Option C: \"teach children\" represents the teacher's primary role and does not indicate behavior that would cause yelling.",
    "Option D: \"to start lunch\" does not connect with the typical reasons for a teacher to yell at students; it\u2019s more about scheduling rather than behavior.",
    "Option E: \"open boxes\" also does not correlate with behavior that would invoke a yelling response from a teacher.",
    "Having analyzed all the options, the only choice that aligns with disruptive behavior is option B, which indicates that the students were talking too much."
