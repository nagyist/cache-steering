  "query": "Question: Most human hair is where?\n\nChoices:\nA: mammals\nB: legs\nC: sink\nD: arm\nE: person's head",
  "steps": [
    "Let's consider where human hair is most commonly found on the body. Generally, humans have hair all over their bodies, but certain areas have significantly more hair than others.",
    "Mammals, in general, have hair, but this option is too broad and does not specifically pertain to the question of human hair.",
    "Looking at option B, legs do have hair, but they do not have the most hair compared to other areas of the human body.",
    "Option C refers to the sink. While it is possible for hair to fall out and collect in a sink, this does not pertain to the physical location of most human hair.",
    "In option D, the arms do have some hair, but again, they are not the area with the most hair on a human body.",
    "Now examining option E, the person's head. The head is where a significant amount of hair is concentrated, such as scalp hair, which is generally the most prominent area of hair growth.",
    "Comparing all options, option E clearly stands out as the correct answer because the majority of human hair is found on the head."
