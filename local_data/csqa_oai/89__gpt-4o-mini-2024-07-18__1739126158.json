  "query": "Question: What group of musicians will include someone playing the cello?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: symphony\nC: band\nD: music store\nE: music shop",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the role of a cello within musical groups. The cello is a string instrument that is typically found in orchestras and symphonies.",
    "Next, I review the choices to see which one would most likely have a cello player associated with it.",
    "Choice A: \"ocean\" does not relate to musicians or musical groups.",
    "Choice B: \"symphony\" commonly includes a variety of string instruments including the cello.",
    "Choice C: \"band\" can refer to various types of musical groups, but traditionally, bands do not have cellos.",
    "Choice D: \"music store\" is a place to buy musical instruments but does not represent a group of musicians.",
    "Choice E: \"music shop\" is similar to the music store, serving as a retail space for instruments, not a group of musicians.",
    "Given that the cello is part of an orchestra or symphony, and since \"symphony\" references a musical group including cellists, it stands out as the correct answer."
