  "steps": [
    "Killing is a serious offense and typically falls under criminal law.",
    "A criminal offense often necessitates a criminal trial to determine guilt or innocence.",
    "Killing can lead to different types of trials depending on the circumstances, such as murder or manslaughter.",
    "A trial of the sword is a historical reference, not a modern legal practice, meaning it doesn\u2019t apply to contemporary legal proceedings.",
    "While a guilty conscience and going to jail are potential outcomes of a killing, they are not types of trials.",
    "Going to jail is a possible consequence of being found guilty, but it occurs after the trial.",
    "The option \"no longer live\" signifies death, which is not a trial outcome, but rather an end result.",
    "Based on legal terminology, the most accurate option related to the act of killing and resulting legal proceedings is \"criminal trial.\""
