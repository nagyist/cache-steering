  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"he read book after book\" suggests that the person has a strong inclination or passion for reading.",
    "Given this inclination towards reading, it is likely that he enjoys activities associated with reading and learning.",
    "The choice \"A: travel new places\" does not directly relate to the activity of reading, as it suggests a physical activity rather than an intellectual one.",
    "The choice \"B: learn new\" could align with the idea of reading to acquire knowledge and expand one's understanding, which is often a primary motive for reading.",
    "The choice \"C: learn to read\" implies a focus on the process of reading itself rather than the content and insights gained from reading books, which may not fully capture what the passage conveys.",
    "The choice \"D: enjoyable\" suggests that he finds reading enjoyable, but it does not specify what he enjoys doing beyond reading.",
    "The choice \"E: bored\" does not fit well as reading book after book typically indicates an avoidance of boredom rather than experiencing it.",
    "Among the choices, \"B: learn new\" is the most appropriate as it reflects the purpose of reading multiple books, which is to gain knowledge and learn new things."
