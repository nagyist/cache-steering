  "query": "Question: Where might you use a bus to get around?\n\nChoices:\nA: michigan\nB: computer\nC: ocean\nD: new york\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider where buses are commonly used for transportation.",
    "Buses are typically used in urban areas and cities to transport people from one location to another.",
    "In the options provided, we should identify locations or environments where bus transportation is practical.",
    "Option A (Michigan) is a state; while it has buses, it's not specifically a location where one would universally rely on a bus.",
    "Option B (computer) does not relate to physical transportation; it's a tool for tasks, not for getting around.",
    "Option C (ocean) does not suit the purpose because the ocean is not a place where buses operate.",
    "Option D (New York) is known for its extensive bus system, particularly in New York City.",
    "Option E (city) is a general term but encompasses many places where buses are commonly used.",
    "Therefore, both New York and city are valid answers, but we need to consider if the question asks for specific locations or a general one.",
    "Given that \"city\" encapsulates many places and is a common area for bus usage, it stands out as a broader and more inclusive term."
