    "The phrase \"had a lot on his plate\" suggests that he was overwhelmed or burdened with many tasks or responsibilities related to opening a business.",
    "When someone is overwhelmed with responsibilities, it typically leads to negative outcomes rather than positive ones.",
    "Possible negative outcomes from being overwhelmed can include increased anxiety, pressure, and inability to focus effectively on tasks.",
    "In this context, a common consequence of being overwhelmed by various tasks is experiencing stress.",
    "The options provided include both negative and positive consequences, but we are looking for what is typically caused by feeling overwhelmed.",
    "While headaches, failure, and stress can be related to being overwhelmed, the most direct consequence mentioned directly in contexts of having too much to handle is generally stress.",
    "Making money and success are positive outcomes and are, therefore, less likely to be direct consequences of being overwhelmed in the context of opening a business.",
    "Given that stress is a frequent and expected result of having too much responsibility and pressure, it fits logically as the answer."
