  "query": "Question: You can find cards all sorts of places, but if you want to bet on them in all sorts of games where should you go?\n\nChoices:\nA: toy store\nB: casino\nC: table\nD: table play\nE: deck",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the question, which involves betting on cards in games. This indicates a need for a place where card games are played competitively for money.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option A, a toy store, does not typically facilitate betting or competitive card games, so it can be eliminated.",
    "Option B, a casino, is a venue explicitly designed for gambling and offers various card games such as poker, blackjack, and others where betting occurs. This option is a strong candidate.",
    "Examine option C, \"table.\" While card games are played at tables, this is too vague and does not indicate a location specifically for betting.",
    "Option D, \"table play,\" also suggests playing cards at a table but similarly lacks clarity regarding a designated location for betting on these games.",
    "Lastly, consider option E, \"deck.\" A deck relates to the cards themselves but does not represent a place where betting occurs.",
    "After analyzing all options, option B (casino) consistently stands out as the place specifically intended for betting on card games."
