  "query": "Question: Bill saw that Lilly was praying. He wasn't religious, so he didn't pray himself.  He felt that it was just what?\n\nChoices:\nA: good feeling\nB: relief\nC: feel safer\nD: sense of peace\nE: wasted time",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context provided: Bill is observing Lilly, who is engaging in an act of prayer.",
    "Next, note that Bill is explicitly stated to be non-religious. This implies that he may not share the same beliefs or practices as Lilly.",
    "Given that he didn\u2019t pray himself, it suggests that he may see praying as unnecessary or irrelevant to him.",
    "Next, evaluate the options. Option A, \"good feeling,\" does not effectively capture the essence of Bill\u2019s perspective as a non-participant in the prayer.",
    "Option B, \"relief,\" could imply that Bill feels relieved seeing Lilly pray, but without any context of stress or problem to relieve, this is unlikely.",
    "Now, consider option C, \"feel safer.\" This does not align well with the provided context, since Bill's non-religious stance may not give him any perception of safety through prayer.",
    "Option D, \"sense of peace,\" is plausible because he could appreciate the calming aspect of Lilly's prayer without agreeing with or partaking in it himself.",
    "However, option E, \"wasted time,\" appears likely since as a non-religious person, Bill may dismiss prayer as an ineffective use of time.",
    "Now, assess both option D and option E. While D captures a potential emotional response, E aligns more closely with Bill's non-religious view and possible judgement of prayer.",
    "Thus, considering all options and Bill's perspective, the most fitting interpretation of his feelings toward Lilly praying is that he perceives it as \"wasted time.\""
