  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the sentence: \"People were talking on the corner.\"",
    "The phrase suggests that there is a group of individuals engaged in conversation.",
    "Next, I consider the nature of the interaction. \"Talking\" implies communicating with someone.",
    "I need to look at the choices provided to see which one makes sense in the context of talking.",
    "Choice A: \"god\" is unlikely because the context implies a physical conversation among people.",
    "Choice B: \"mix\" does not directly relate to the action of talking.",
    "Choice C: \"with people\" is a straightforward option that logically fits the context of talking.",
    "Choice D: \"have friends\" implies a relationship but does not directly answer who they were talking with.",
    "Choice E: \"see people\" suggests observation rather than communication.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the only choice that directly answers the question and logically fits is \"with people.\""
