  "query": "Question: The football field was all ready for Friday night at the local what?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: high school\nC: city\nD: college campus\nE: excrete",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"football field,\" which is typically associated with various levels of football competitions. Understanding the context is crucial to determining where the event is likely to take place.",
    "Looking at the options provided, I can see that \"university,\" \"high school,\" and \"college campus\" are all potential locations that may host football games. \"City\" is too vague, and \"excrete\" is clearly unrelated.",
    "Since the term \"local\" suggests a community setting, \u201chigh school\u201d is a strong possibility because high school football games are quite popular and occur frequently in local areas.",
    "However, \"college campus\" also fits as local college football games are also common and engage the community, just like high school games do.",
    "\"University\" is similar to \u201ccollege,\u201d but it may not be as commonly referenced when discussing local high school football events, as high schools are standalone entities as opposed to being part of a university's broader structure.",
    "\"City\" seems too generalized and doesn't align with the specific mention of a football field set for a local night event.",
    "Given that the context likely relates to a setting known for community involvement and local gathering, I lean towards either \"high school\" or \"college campus.\"",
    "I consider the possibility of local high school games being more frequent and iconic in many places, especially on a typical Friday night when such games often take place.",
    "Thus, weighing both \u201chigh school\u201d and \u201ccollege campus,\u201d the more traditional and likely scenario for the term \"local\" in relation to a football field is high school.",
    "After considering these points thoroughly, I conclude that \"high school\" is the best fit for the question asked."
