  "query": "Question: The lizard tried to stay cool by resting in what sort of location?\n\nChoices:\nA: sunny place\nB: rocky areas\nC: shady spot\nD: garden\nE: dirt",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the behavior of lizards in relation to temperature regulation.",
    "Lizards are ectothermic creatures, meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.",
    "When temperatures are high, lizards often seek shelter to avoid overheating.",
    "This behavior typically involves moving to areas that provide shade to cool down.",
    "Evaluate the options provided:\nA: sunny place - this would increase temperature, not decrease it.",
    "B: rocky areas - while some may provide shade, not all rocky areas are shaded.",
    "C: shady spot - this is directly related to seeking cooler temperatures.",
    "D: garden - a garden can have various spots, but doesn't specify if it is shady or not.",
    "E: dirt - while resting in dirt can be cool, it does not inherently signify a temperature-regulating behavior.",
    "Based on the analysis, the best option that fits the lizard's behavior to stay cool is a shady spot."
