  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a table is and its typical uses in various contexts.",
    "A table is generally a piece of furniture with a flat surface, used for various purposes such as dining, working, or displaying items.",
    "Next, I consider where tables are commonly found or purchased.",
    "Demonstration implies showing or exhibiting something, but it doesn't typically relate to where one would obtain a table.",
    "A kitchen can have a table, but it is not a place where you typically purchase a table. It is more for using one.",
    "A furniture store specializes in selling furniture, including tables, making it a likely place to obtain one.",
    "A hallway is a passageway and is not a location where one would find or purchase a table.",
    "An apartment can have a table, but similar to the kitchen, it is not where you specifically acquire one.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most appropriate choice for where you would get a table is the furniture store."
