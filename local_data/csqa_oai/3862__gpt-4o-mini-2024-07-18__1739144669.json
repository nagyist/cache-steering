  "query": "Question: John and George are camping together.  They're sitting around a pile of sticks and john is lighting a match.  Why is john lighting a match?\n\nChoices:\nA: illumination\nB: set on fire\nC: make fire\nD: making flame\nE: frustration",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context. John and George are camping, which often involves fires for warmth and cooking.",
    "Next, think about what lighting a match typically indicates. It usually suggests the intention to start a fire.",
    "Look at the choices provided. 'Set on fire' (B) could imply John is trying to ignite something, but it's vague about his intention.",
    "'Illumination' (A) suggests using the match for light, but this is not the most common reason for lighting a match while camping.",
    "'Making flame' (D) is similar to starting a fire but focuses specifically on the flame rather than the broader action of making fire.",
    "'Frustration' (E) does not logically fit the scenario of using a match while camping.",
    "The most direct interpretation of John lighting a match is to create fire, which is a fundamental part of camping activities.",
    "In light of all these considerations, 'Make fire' (C) is the clearest and most relevant choice to what John is attempting to do by lighting the match."
