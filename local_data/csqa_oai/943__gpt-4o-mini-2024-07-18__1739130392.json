  "steps": [
    "First, consider the term \"fossilized.\" Fossilization is a process where organic material is transformed into fossil through various geological processes over a long period of time.",
    "Next, analyze the options given in the context of fossilization. \"Sanded\" implies a physical process related to smoothing surfaces, which does not apply to fossilized wood.",
    "Look at the term \"composted\". This refers to the breakdown of organic material in a compost system, rather than preservation as a fossil.",
    "Examine \"warp,\" which suggests a bending or distortion that does not correlate with the concept of fossilization.",
    "Then, consider \"hardened.\" While fossilized wood may become harder, this term is very generic and does not specifically refer to the process of turning wood into a fossil.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"petrify.\" This term specifically describes the process where organic material (like wood) becomes \"petrified,\" turning into stone through mineralization.",
    "Based on the evaluation, the best option that accurately describes what paleontologists would call fossilized wood is clearly \"petrify.\""
