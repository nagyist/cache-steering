  "steps": [
    "We need to determine what kind of space might have a sofa bed in the context of hosting friends at home.",
    "The sofa bed is a type of furniture often used in areas where additional sleeping space is needed, typically for guests.",
    "Considering the listed choices, a \"guest room\" (D) is most directly related to accommodating overnight guests.",
    "While a basement (A) or garage (C) could potentially have a sofa bed, these are not typically the most common or preferred places to host guests.",
    "A \"hotel\" (B) is not applicable as they are not hosting friends at a hotel, but rather at their own home.",
    "Looking at choice E, \"horseradish\" is irrelevant and does not fit the context of the question.",
    "Therefore, among the remaining choices\u2014basement, garage, and guest room\u2014the \"guest room\" is the most logical option for apologizing about only having a sofa bed.",
    "Upon reviewing the options again, it confirms that a guest room signifies a place meant for visitors, making it the most suitable answer."
