  "query": "Question: Where is glue well used?\n\nChoices:\nA: desk drawer\nB: cabinet\nC: art room\nD: school\nE: closed container",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what activities typically involve the use of glue. Glue is commonly used in arts and crafts, which are often conducted in creative spaces such as art rooms.",
    "Next, evaluate whether any of the other options are as relevant as the art room for glue usage. A desk drawer might contain glue but is not a place where glue is frequently used; it is more of a storage area.",
    "Similarly, while a cabinet may store glue, it is not specifically associated with glue usage.",
    "The option \"school\" could involve glue, particularly in classrooms or art classes, but it's too broad as a location compared to the specific use case in an art room.",
    "Lastly, consider \"closed container.\" While glue can be stored in a closed container, it does not represent a place where glue is actively used.",
    "After analyzing all options, it is clear that the art room is where glue is fundamentally used for various projects and creativity."
