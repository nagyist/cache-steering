  "query": "Question: Where would a dance club be the furthest in the same direction as the side that won the Civil War?\n\nChoices:\nA: ohio\nB: downtown area\nC: michigan\nD: south\nE: united states",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the side that won the Civil War. The Union was the victorious side in the American Civil War.",
    "Determine the geographical direction of the Union relative to the Civil War conflict. The Union states were primarily in the northern part of the United States.",
    "Review the options given: A (Ohio), B (downtown area), C (Michigan), D (South), E (United States).",
    "Recognize that 'D: South' refers to the Confederate states, which lost the Civil War and are not in the same direction as the victorious Union.",
    "Note that options A (Ohio) and C (Michigan) are northern states, which are aligned with the Union and therefore go in the same direction.",
    "Consider option E (United States) which encompasses all states, making it not a specific direction.",
    "However, since Ohio is somewhat farther south compared to Michigan, which is further north and more aligned with the direct Northern direction connected to the Union, notice that Michigan is the furthest in the same direction.",
    "Therefore, the location of Michigan is the northernmost option given."
