  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"trivia hound\" suggests that the person enjoys collecting facts and knowledge about various topics.",
    "The enjoyment of answering questions implies a passion for learning and acquiring information.",
    "Studying is a common method for acquiring knowledge, which aligns with the person's love for trivia.",
    "The choices provided include benefits or results of studying, but we need to consider the motivation behind the studying.",
    "\"Better grades\" could be an outcome, but it doesn't capture the joy of learning for its own sake.",
    "\"Higher intelligence\" might be a goal, but it sounds more abstract and doesn't reflect the specific satisfaction of trivia.",
    "\"Increasing knowledge\" directly relates to the love for answering questions and the pursuit of information.",
    "\"Inspiration\" does not specifically address the context of trivia or answering questions.",
    "\"Strain eyes\" is unrelated to studying for knowledge; rather, it has negative connotations and seems out of place.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer that encapsulates the person\u2019s love for studying to answer questions is \"increasing knowledge.\""
