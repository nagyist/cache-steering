  "steps": [
    "To determine what John could do at the age of 15, we need to establish what significant milestones typically occur around that age.",
    "In many educational systems, students often start high school around the age of 14 or 15. It is common for students to enter high school when they are 14 or turning 15 during that year.",
    "The choices given include various activities related to education, but we need to find the one that aligns with turning 15.",
    "Teaching a class (choice A) is not something that typically happens at age 15. Trying to get something (choice B) is vague and doesn't specifically relate to age. Going to class (choice D) and studying a book (choice E) are general activities and don't specifically signify a milestone.",
    "Consequently, the most relevant option that signifies a transition associated with age 15 is the opportunity to enter or attend high school.",
    "Since this year marks John's entry into high school for the first time, the correct answer must be that this is the first year he would get to go to high school."
