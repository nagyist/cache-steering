  "steps": [
    "The statement begins with \"Everyone is ordinary,\" suggesting that it is a common perception that people are generally similar or average in some way.",
    "Next, the phrase \"but we are often told we are\" implies a contrast to the idea of being ordinary, suggesting that there is some positive or idealized way in which people are often perceived or described.",
    "I will consider the choices provided: A (unbelievable), B (strange), C (special), D (ugly), E (exceptional).",
    "Choice A, \"unbelievable,\" seems less fitting since it has a connotation of skepticism or disbelief, which doesn't align with the idea of being told something positive.",
    "Choice B, \"strange,\" contrasts with being ordinary and would suggest being out of the norm, which again is not a positive claim typically made about people.",
    "Choice C, \"special,\" implies a positive distinction, suggesting that while everyone is ordinary, there is something unique or valuable about each individual.",
    "Choice D, \"ugly,\" is quite negative and does not align with the idea of being told something uplifting or positive about oneself.",
    "Choice E, \"exceptional,\" also carries a positive connotation and aligns with the idea of being distinguished from the ordinary. However, \"exceptional\" can imply being significantly better than average rather than simply unique.",
    "Between \"special\" and \"exceptional,\" \"special\" seems to encapsulate a more universally positive sentiment that is often communicated in various contexts regarding significant others or individuals.",
    "Comparing all the choices, \"special\" directly contrasts the idea of being ordinary in a warm and affirming way, while remaining relatable to everyone."
