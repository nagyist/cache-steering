  "query": "Question: In the Roman Empire a person who was not of noble birth was called a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: inferior\nB: plebeian\nC: priest\nD: common\nE: ignoble",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a term used in the Roman Empire to describe a person who was not of noble birth.",
    "In Roman society, there were distinct social classes, including patricians (nobility) and plebeians (commoners).",
    "The term \"plebeian\" specifically refers to the common people of ancient Rome, who were not part of the aristocracy or nobility.",
    "The options provided include various terms that could potentially refer to individuals of lower status in society.",
    "The term \"inferior\" suggests a lower status but is not specific to Roman society or its social structure.",
    "The term \"priest\" does not relate to social class but rather to a role in religion.",
    "The term \"common\" generally refers to the average person but is not a specific historical term used in the Roman context.",
    "The term \"ignoble\" means not honorable in character or purpose, but again, it is more of a qualitative judgment than a specific class designation.",
    "Out of all the options, \"plebeian\" is the term that accurately reflects the classification of individuals who were not of noble birth in the Roman Empire.",
    "I will double-check: \"plebeian\" is indeed used to describe the commoners of Rome, consolidating my previous reasoning."
