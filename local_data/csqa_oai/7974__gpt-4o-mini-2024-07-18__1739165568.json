  "query": "Question: John doesn't understand triangles, but that's why he's taking the class on what?\n\nChoices:\nA: trigonometry\nB: music room\nC: mathematics\nD: music shop\nE: algebra",
  "steps": [
    "John does not understand triangles, which means he needs to learn about them.",
    "Triangles are a fundamental part of various branches of mathematics, including geometry and trigonometry.",
    "Since John is taking a class to learn about triangles, the class must be related to the field of mathematics.",
    "Among the options provided, trigonometry is specifically focused on the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles.",
    "While geometry also involves triangles, the question hints that John is specifically looking for classes that would help him understand them.",
    "The other options - music room and music shop - are clearly not related to learning about triangles.",
    "Algebra can involve geometric concepts, but it does not directly pertain to triangles in the same manner that trigonometry does.",
    "Given that John is taking a class specifically to understand triangles, the best option is therefore trigonometry."
