  "query": "Question: Billy didn't understand computers but he could work them.  This was because he could easily do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: be smart\nB: advance knowledge\nC: follow instructions\nD: produce sound\nE: do work",
  "steps": [
    "Billy didn't understand computers indicates that he may not have a deep comprehension of how computers function.",
    "However, it states that he could work with them, so there must be a method he uses to interact with computers effectively.",
    "The phrase \"could easily do what\" suggests that there is a skill or ability that enables him to operate computers despite his lack of understanding.",
    "Considering the choice options, \"follow instructions\" stands out as a potential ability he might possess.",
    "If Billy can follow instructions, he can perform tasks on the computer without needing to fully understand the underlying technology.",
    "The other options, such as \"be smart\" and \"advance knowledge,\" imply a cognitive ability or knowledge base that he may lack.",
    "\"Produce sound\" and \"do work\" do not directly relate to the ability to operate computers in the context given.",
    "Therefore, the most logical reasoning is that Billy manages to work with computers by following specific instructions."
