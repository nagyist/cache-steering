  "steps": [
    "The question asks about how most lizards achieve locomotion.",
    "Lizards are reptiles that typically have a specific structure that enables them to move.",
    "The common forms of locomotion in lizards include running, climbing, and swimming.",
    "Lizards generally have four legs that they use for walking and running.",
    "While bones, tails, and a backbone are important for structural support and balance, they do not directly contribute to locomotion in the way legs do.",
    "The choice \"change color of skin\" is unrelated to locomotion, as it's more about camouflage or temperature regulation.",
    "Since most lizards have four legs and rely on them for mobility, this option appears to be the most accurate.",
    "I will now check if there's any ambiguity or additional context that might change this reasoning.",
    "After reviewing, it remains clear that the primary method of movement in most lizards is through the use of their four legs."
