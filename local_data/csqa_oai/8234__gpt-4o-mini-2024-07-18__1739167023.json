  "query": "Question: Each witness had to take oath, this oath was to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: laugh\nB: truthful\nC: not lie\nD: think\nE: sense of duty",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the context of taking an oath and its general purpose in legal or formal situations.",
    "Oaths are typically taken to affirm honesty and integrity in one's statements, particularly in court or when giving testimony.",
    "We then consider the implications of the wording in the choices provided. The choices involve various attitudes or states of being, but we need to focus on what an oath generally signifies.",
    "A typical oath includes commitments to tell the truth, which relates closely to being truthful.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"truthful\" (B) and \"not lie\" (C) both relate to the obligation of honesty during testimony.",
    "However, \"truthful\" (B) could be seen as a broader concept, while \"not lie\" (C) is a more direct and explicit expression of the obligation involved in the oath.",
    "Next, we look at the other choices. \"Laugh\" (A) does not fit the context, as it does not relate to taking an oath. \"Think\" (D) is also irrelevant in this context. \"Sense of duty\" (E) could be a part of the reasoning behind the oath but not the primary focus.",
    "Thus, the most direct response that relates to the purpose of taking an oath in a witness context is \"not lie\" (C)."
