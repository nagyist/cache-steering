  "steps": [
    "The question presents a scenario where an animal is in a predicament and must make a choice between flight or an alternative action.",
    "The phrase \"flight or fight\" is commonly used to describe the two primary responses animals can have in dangerous situations: they can either flee from the danger (flight) or confront it (fight).",
    "Given this context, we need to identify which of the provided options represents the alternative to \"flight,\" keeping in mind that \"flight\" involves escaping and seeking safety.",
    "Option A (\"leave home\") does not directly align with the context of responding to a threat, as it implies moving away from a location rather than confronting a danger.",
    "Option B (\"hunt for food\") is unrelated to a predicament involving potential danger, as it suggests a proactive, non-defensive action.",
    "Option C (\"smell prey\") is more about sensory perception and does not reflect a choice between flight and an alternative action related to a threat.",
    "Option D (\"feel pain\") describes a sensation that does not present an active choice in response to danger.",
    "Option E (\"fight for life\") aligns perfectly with the \"fight or flight\" response. It implies confronting a threat rather than escaping from it.",
    "Since the question asks for the alternative to \"flight,\" \"fight for life\" in option E clearly fits this scenario."
