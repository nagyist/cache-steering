  "query": "Question: The library wanted to get the community more involved, so they began to screen family what?\n\nChoices:\nA: monitor\nB: homes\nC: drive in movie\nD: theatre\nE: movies",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the library is seeking to engage the community and is considering an event or activity that could involve families.",
    "The phrase \"screen family\" suggests an activity that involves showing something, rather than simply observing or monitoring.",
    "The options provided include a mix of activities and venues, but the term \"screen\" is most commonly associated with showing films or videos.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"drive in movie\" and \"movies\" both involve screening films, while \"monitor,\" \"homes,\" and \"theatre\" seem less likely to relate to an event meant to involve families.",
    "Considering that libraries often show films to foster community engagement, the term \"movies\" on its own is a broad and fitting option for what they could screen.",
    "\"Drive in movie\" is a specific type of event that is less common in a library setting and typically requires more logistical planning.",
    "Since the question uses the term \"family,\" it implies a focus on more traditional movie-viewing activities, rather than something specialized like a drive-in.",
    "Out of the options, \"movies\" (E) seems to be the most straightforward and typical activity for a library wanting to engage families.",
    "After considering all the options, \"movies\" as a general activity aligns perfectly with a library's goal of increasing community participation."
