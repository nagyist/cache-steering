  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the reputation effect of a person who does good to others.",
    "People generally appreciate and respect those who perform good deeds and help others.",
    "This appreciation translates into a positive quality in a person's reputation.",
    "Among the options given, we need to identify which best matches this positive quality in reputation.",
    "Option A (own house) does not relate to reputation but is rather a personal asset.",
    "Option B (admiration) directly connects to how people view someone who does good deeds, indicating that they garner respect and esteem.",
    "Option C (acknowledgment) could also relate to how good deeds are recognized by others but seems less emotive than admiration.",
    "Option D (relaxation) is unrelated to the reputation aspect and pertains more to personal well-being.",
    "Option E (good things in life) is also vague and does not specifically address reputation.",
    "Among all the options, 'admiration' is the most powerful and direct quality associated with a positive reputation built on doing good to others."
