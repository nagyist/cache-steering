  "query": "Question: What is the result of reaching a tentative agreement?\n\nChoices:\nA: communicate with\nB: settlement\nC: shake hands\nD: celebration\nE: part ways",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what a tentative agreement is. It usually indicates that two parties have come to a preliminary understanding or compromise, but it may not yet be final or binding.",
    "Next, I consider what typically happens after a tentative agreement. There often involves further discussion or negotiation to finalize the terms, which can result in a formal settlement.",
    "Reviewing the answer choices, I see that \"B: settlement\" aligns with the idea of finalizing an agreement after a tentative one. The term suggests an agreed-upon resolution to a dispute or negotiation.",
    "Choices \"A\", \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\" imply different outcomes or actions that do not directly result from a tentative agreement. For example, \"A: communicate with\" and \"E: part ways\" do not imply resolution, while \"C: shake hands\" and \"D: celebration\" suggest positive interactions that might not necessarily follow a tentative agreement.",
    "Therefore, since the process following a tentative agreement typically leads to a formal settlement, I can conclude this is the most logical answer."
