  "query": "Question: Where would you keep a business telephone directory?\n\nChoices:\nA: office\nB: house\nC: book shelves\nD: phone booth\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a business telephone directory, which is typically used for professional contact information.",
    "Next, think about the environment where a business telephone directory would be most useful. It is likely to be needed in a professional setting where business communications occur regularly.",
    "The office is usually the primary location where business operations take place, making it a logical place to store a business telephone directory.",
    "Next, consider the other choices. A house may hold personal directories, but it\u2019s less common for business directories to be stored there.",
    "Bookshelves could be a place where the directory is stored, but it does not specify the context of the environment, making it less ideal than a defined office space.",
    "A phone booth is an old-fashioned setting primarily designed for making calls, not as a repository for business directories.",
    "The term \"building\" is quite broad and could refer to any type of structure, which is less specific than an office.",
    "Since the office is specifically designated for business activities, it serves as the most appropriate choice for keeping a business telephone directory.",
    "Reviewing all options, the office stands out as the most logical and suitable environment for storing a business telephone directory."
