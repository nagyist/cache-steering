  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the general nature of competition between two people.",
    "In a competitive scenario, each person is typically trying to outperform the other.",
    "This can lead to a variety of emotions and results, depending on the context of the competition.",
    "Encouragement (Choice A) can happen, but it's not guaranteed as competition often breeds intensity.",
    "Injury (Choice B) can be a risk in physical competitions, but it's not an inevitable outcome of competition itself.",
    "Frustration (Choice C) can arise during competition, especially if one feels they are not performing well.",
    "Ultimately, in a competition between two individuals, there must be a resolution; one person must win or be declared the winner while the other does not.",
    "This leads to the idea that the most definitive outcome of the competition is that there will be one winner (Choice D).",
    "Pride (Choice E) can also be a result of competition, but it is often tied to the outcome of winning or losing.",
    "Considering the nature of competition where two individuals are involved, the most straightforward and inevitable outcome is that one person wins."
