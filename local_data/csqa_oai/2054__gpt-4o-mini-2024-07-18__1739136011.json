  "query": "Question: It was impossible to find a parking garage, so James took a bus whenever he wanted to go where?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: car\nC: building\nD: restaurant\nE: downtown",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the context of the sentence. It states that James found it impossible to find a parking garage, which suggests that he did not want to use his car due to parking issues.",
    "Next, we consider the implications of taking a bus. People typically take a bus when they need to go somewhere without the hassle of parking, indicating he is likely going to a destination that is not easily accessible by car.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices:\n- A: neighbor's house - This could be a possible destination, but it is not certain and could imply a close proximity which may not require the bus.\n- B: car - This option does not make sense as he is looking for alternatives to using a car.\n- C: building - This is vague and does not specify a destination.\n- D: restaurant - This is a feasible destination where one might go by bus; however, it is still quite specific.\n- E: downtown - This is a common location where people might take a bus due to limited parking availability.",
    "The most logical conclusion considering ease of access and practical reasons for taking public transport is that James is likely going somewhere busy or where parking is limited, which aligns most with \"downtown.\"",
    "Thus, while he could be heading to a restaurant or other places, \"downtown\" captures the general purpose of taking a bus at all, which is to avoid parking issues."
