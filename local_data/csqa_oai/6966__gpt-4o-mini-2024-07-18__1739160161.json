  "steps": [
    "Identify the geographical area mentioned in the question. The term \"extremely large southern area\" suggests looking for a broad region in the southern United States.",
    "Consider the options provided. A (western Texas) refers to a specific area in the southern U.S., while B (field), C (amazon river), D (high grass), and E (falling down) do not clearly represent large regions in the southern U.S.",
    "Evaluate option A. Western Texas is indeed a large region known for its desert landscape and is part of the southern United States. It is also known to have habitats that include various venomous snakes, such as rattlesnakes and copperheads.",
    "Evaluate option C (amazon river). The Amazon River is located in South America and is not a region of the southern U.S.",
    "Evaluate option B (field). A field is simply an area of land and is not a large southern region.",
    "Evaluate option D (high grass). Like option B, this is not a defined geographical area and does not meet the criteria of a large southern region.",
    "Evaluate option E (falling down). This does not refer to any recognized geographical area, thus disqualifying it as an answer.",
    "Considering all options, the only choice that accurately fits as an \"extremely large southern area in the U.S. that has venomous snakes\" is A (western Texas)."
