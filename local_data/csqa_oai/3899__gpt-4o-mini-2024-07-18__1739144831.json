  "query": "Question: What does a projectile pass through?\n\nChoices:\nA: battle field\nB: air\nC: gun\nD: weapon\nE: baseball",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what a projectile is. A projectile is an object that is thrown into the air with an initial force and then moves under the influence of gravity and other forces.",
    "Identify the medium through which a projectile travels after being propelled. When a projectile is launched, it usually travels through the air before it lands.",
    "Evaluate the options given. Options A (battle field), C (gun), D (weapon), and E (baseball) do not accurately represent the medium that a projectile would travel through once launched.",
    "Determine if option B (air) accurately represents the path of a projectile. Since a projectile travels through the air after being launched, this option is applicable.",
    "Double-check other options to ensure none are more appropriate. A projectile is not specifically defined by passing through a battlefield, a gun, a weapon, or a baseball, but rather air is the consistent environment through which it travels.",
    "Conclude that the only suitable option that accurately describes what a projectile passes through is option B."
