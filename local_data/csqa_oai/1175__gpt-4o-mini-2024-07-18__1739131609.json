  "steps": [
    "To understand the consequences of getting too warm, we must consider the human body's natural response to increased temperature.",
    "One primary response to rising temperatures is the activation of sweat glands in the skin.",
    "Sweating serves to cool the body down as sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, removing heat.",
    "If the body continues to warm up without adequate means to cool down, sweating becomes the main strategy for thermoregulation.",
    "Other physiological changes, such as increased heart rate or redirecting blood flow to the skin, may also occur, but these generally support the sweating process.",
    "The options provided include feelings and actions that are not directly related to the body's physiological response to excess heat.",
    "Feeling guilty, sleeping, feeling more comfortable, and cuddling do not occur as primary responses to getting too warm.",
    "Thus, the most relevant and direct consequence of getting too warm is sweating.",
    "After reviewing all the choices and considering the physiological processes involved, it is clear that sweating is the primary response."
