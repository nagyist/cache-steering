  "steps": [
    "The question is discussing a rule that prohibits smoking inside a building.",
    "To comply with the rule, individuals who wish to smoke would have to find an alternative location, as it is not allowed inside.",
    "The alternative location for smoking, in such situations, is typically designated as outside the building.",
    "Looking at the choices available: \n- A (go outside) is a direct action that someone would have to take to adhere to the rule. \n- B (unhealthy) does not fit as an action taken for smoking. \n- C (coughing) is a possible consequence of smoking but does not relate to adhering to the rule. \n- D (foolish) is a judgment and not an action. \n- E (inhale) refers to the action of smoking itself but is not relevant to the requirement of finding a place to smoke.",
    "Based on the understanding of the rule and the options provided, the only suitable choice that indicates what one has to do to smoke legally is to go outside."
