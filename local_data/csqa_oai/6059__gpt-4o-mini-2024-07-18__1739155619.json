  "query": "Question: He cried when seeing the bill, what did he feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: wipe eyes\nB: miserable\nC: distraught\nD: shed tears\nE: were sad",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"he cried\" indicates a strong emotional response, suggesting that the person is feeling something deeply.",
    "The presence of a bill that evokes crying implies that the bill could be surprising, overwhelming, or upsetting, hinting at negative emotions.",
    "Analyzing the choices, we can categorize them based on their emotional weight. \nA (\"wipe eyes\") is more of an action rather than an emotional feeling.",
    "B (\"miserable\") and C (\"distraught\") are both strong emotional responses, but C (\"distraught\") implies a higher level of distress than B (\"miserable\").",
    "D (\"shed tears\") is again describing an action related to crying, rather than a feeling.",
    "E (\"were sad\") is a possibility but seems less intense than what is suggested by his crying and the context of a surprising bill.",
    "Considering the context of crying upon seeing something as potentially distressing as a bill, \"distraught\" (C) aligns with a deeper emotional response.",
    "To confirm, \"miserable\" describes a state of unhappiness but doesn't capture the level of distress implied by \"cried\" in the context of receiving an unexpected bill.",
    "Thus, the most fitting choice that encapsulates the strong emotional response of crying, especially in a stressful situation, is \"distraught.\""
