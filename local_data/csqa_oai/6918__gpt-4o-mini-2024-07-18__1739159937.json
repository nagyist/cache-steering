  "query": "Question: Where would you likely go to buy an armoire?\n\nChoices:\nA: living room\nB: furniture store\nC: butcher shop\nD: house\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the most likely place to purchase an armoire, which is a large cabinet typically used for storing clothing or linens.",
    "The choices given include options that may or may not sell armoires directly.",
    "Choice A, living room, does not make sense as a place to buy furniture; it's a space in a house, not a store.",
    "Choice C, butcher shop, is not relevant because it specializes in meat products and would not sell furniture.",
    "Choice D, house, refers to a physical dwelling and not a place of purchase, so it does not apply.",
    "Choice E, bedroom, is typically where an armoire might be used, but it doesn't indicate a place to buy one.",
    "Choice B, furniture store, is the most logical option since it specializes in selling furniture, including armoires.",
    "I will evaluate if there are any alternative stores listed in other choices that commonly sell armoires, but none of them fit the bill as well as a furniture store.",
    "Given that we need a specific place to purchase an armoire, and furniture stores are indeed the standard venue for such purchases, the reasoning leads to option B being the best choice."
