  "query": "Question: Sam didn't expect to see something like that underground.  He used his hand to shade his eyes from what?\n\nChoices:\nA: direct sunlight\nB: brightness\nC: moon\nD: full sunlight\nE: bright light",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the phrase \"Sam didn't expect to see something like that underground.\" This indicates that he is in a place where there is typically little to no natural light.",
    "Next, since he is underground, it is unlikely that he is directly exposed to sunlight. This rules out options A (direct sunlight) and D (full sunlight).",
    "Now, let's think about what he might see underground that would cause him to shade his eyes. This could involve some form of bright light that is unexpected.",
    "Looking at the remaining options B (brightness), C (moon), and E (bright light), I need to assess what could realistically cause brightness underground.",
    "The \"moon\" (option C) would not usually cause a significantly bright light effect underground. Therefore, it is less plausible compared to options that refer to light sources that could be encountered underground.",
    "This leaves options B (brightness) and E (bright light). Both suggest a strong light but are worded differently. However, they appear similar in meaning.",
    "Given that he has to shade his eyes, the term \"bright light\" (option E), suggests a more intense light source which aligns well with needing to block out intense illumination.",
    "Thus, since \"brightness\" could be interpreted more broadly and is less specific, \"bright light\" explicitly denotes an intensity that would make someone shield their eyes.",
    "After analyzing all aspects, I am confident that the best answer that fits the scenario of Sam shading his eyes underground due to unexpected illumination is \"bright light.\""
