  "query": "Question: One indicator of a mouse in your house is what?\n\nChoices:\nA: cheese\nB: kitchen\nC: small hole\nD: department store\nE: garden",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider what are common indicators or signs that a mouse is present in a building or room.",
    "Mice often leave physical evidence of their presence, such as droppings, chewed materials, and entry points.",
    "One of the most significant signs of a mouse is the presence of small holes or gaps, as these are the entry points mice can use to get into a house.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the choices given: \n- A: cheese - While it's often humorously associated with mice, it's not an indicator of their presence.\n- B: kitchen - Mice may be found in kitchens, but the kitchen itself is not a direct indicator of mouse presence.\n- C: small hole - This directly relates to the entry points for mice and is a clear indicator they are present.\n- D: department store - This has no relevance to mouse indicators in a home.\n- E: garden - While a garden can attract mice, it is not a direct indicator of them being inside the house.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the most relevant option that indicates the presence of a mouse is a \"small hole.\""
