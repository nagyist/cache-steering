  "query": "Question: Where could a bee get stuck easily?\n\nChoices:\nA: soft drink\nB: in traffic\nC: countryside\nD: swarm\nE: field of flowers",
  "steps": [
    "I will analyze where a bee might encounter situations that could lead to it getting stuck or trapped.",
    "Looking at option A, \"soft drink,\" I think a bee could easily get trapped in a soft drink due to the liquid creating a barrier and the bee potentially drowning or being unable to escape.",
    "For option B, \"in traffic,\" bees do not get stuck in traffic like vehicles do; they can fly away easily, so this option is unlikely.",
    "Next, I consider option C, \"countryside.\" While there may be obstacles, the countryside generally provides space for bees to move freely without getting stuck.",
    "In option D, \"swarm,\" bees can swarm and move together, but swarming suggests they are not stuck; they are actively flying in a group.",
    "Finally, in option E, \"field of flowers,\" bees are often found in fields of flowers, but they also can move freely among the flowers and don\u2019t get stuck there.",
    "Based on the analysis, the choice that definitively leads to a situation where a bee could get stuck is option A, \"soft drink,\" as they could easily drown or trap themselves."
