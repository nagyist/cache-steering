  "query": "Question: The study showed driving while sleep deprived led to as many what accidents as being drunk?\n\nChoices:\nA: dangerous\nB: stressful\nC: being followed by\nD: honk the horn\nE: deadly",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that driving while sleep deprived has a negative impact similar to drunk driving.",
    "I need to identify what type of accidents the study is referring to that occur due to either driving while sleep deprived or drunk driving.",
    "Among the choices given, I should determine which type of accidents can be particularly severe or fatal in nature.",
    "\"Deadly\" refers specifically to accidents that result in death, which is a serious consequence and aligns with the nature of both sleep deprivation and alcohol consumption.",
    "The term \"dangerous\" could apply, but it is more general and does not specifically indicate fatality.",
    "\"Stressful\" does not correspond to outcomes but rather describes a state of being.",
    "\"Being followed by\" and \"honk the horn\" seem irrelevant in the context of the question.",
    "Based on the context that the study shows a direct comparison to drunk driving, the most fitting answer among the options is related to the severity of the accidents.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the type of accidents referred to in the study are best classified as \"deadly.\""
