  "query": "Question: If you've thrown a rod you've done damage to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: fishing camp\nB: hardware store\nC: engine\nD: your spine\nE: sporting goods store",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand what it means to \"throw a rod.\" This commonly refers to throwing a connecting rod in an engine context, which indicates a failure in the engine.",
    "Next, consider each of the answer choices to determine what would be damaged in the process of throwing a rod.",
    "A fishing camp (Choice A) would typically not be directly impacted by an engine problem, so this isn't a strong contender.",
    "A hardware store (Choice B) could be indirectly impacted if one were to buy supplies for repair but is not the entity directly damaged.",
    "An engine (Choice C) is directly related to the activity of throwing a rod, as this action typically signifies severe damage to the engine itself.",
    "Your spine (Choice D) is irrelevant to the context of throwing a rod; it does not relate directly to engines or mechanical parts.",
    "A sporting goods store (Choice E), like the hardware store, would not directly incur damage due to throwing a rod and is unrelated to engine mechanics.",
    "After evaluating all the options, it becomes clear that the act of throwing a rod most logically corresponds with damage inflicted upon the engine.",
    "Thus, since the other options do not have a direct connection to the act of throwing a rod, confirm that the answer has to be related to the engine."
