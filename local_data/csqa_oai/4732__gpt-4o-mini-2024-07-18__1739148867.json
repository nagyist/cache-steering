  "steps": [
    "I first consider the meaning of the phrase \"writing into the wee hours,\" which implies that John was likely working late at night, possibly writing a paper or some other document.",
    "This type of activity typically requires a writing surface, which could be a table, desk, or possibly even a night stand, depending on where he was working.",
    "Considering that writing involves papers, notebooks, pens, and other supplies, the places that would most likely be messy due to this activity would still be surfaces where writing normally happens.",
    "While each choice has its merits, a \"desk\" is a common place for people to write and is often associated directly with writing tasks.",
    "An \"apartment\" as a whole wouldn't be a specific area where the mess would be left; it refers to the entire living space.",
    "The \"closet\" is also unlikely as a place where one would typically write. It's more of a storage space, not usually associated with writing.",
    "The \"table\" could be a candidate, but it doesn't strongly suggest a primary writing area as much as a \"desk\" would.",
    "The \"night stand\" is again less likely as it typically holds items like alarm clocks or books rather than being used for extensive writing.",
    "After evaluating all the options, the strongest and most logical inference for where John left a mess due to writing is at his \"desk.\""
