  "query": "Question: James needed a heavy chain wrap around his tires.  Where might he find one?\n\nChoices:\nA: gear shift\nB: engine compartment\nC: hardware store\nD: jewelry store\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the purpose of a heavy chain for tires, which is commonly used for traction in snowy or icy conditions.",
    "Next, I think about locations that typically sell items related to vehicle maintenance or accessories, such as chains for tires.",
    "A hardware store usually carries a variety of items for home improvement and outdoor activities, which might include tire chains.",
    "A gear shift does not hold any relation to where tire chains are found since it is a component of the vehicle's transmission system.",
    "The engine compartment is also not relevant, as it contains engine components rather than accessories such as tire chains.",
    "A jewelry store is unlikely to carry heavy chains meant for tires; they deal primarily with decorative items.",
    "A garage might have tire chains, but it is more associated with storage rather than purchasing new items.",
    "Thus, the most logical and suitable option for purchasing a heavy chain for tires is a hardware store."
