  "query": "Question: Where do you dip a spoon into?\n\nChoices:\nA: hole\nB: glass of iced tea\nC: kitchen drawer\nD: table setting\nE: bowl of soup",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of a spoon, which is commonly used for scooping or ladling food or liquids.",
    "Next, evaluate the options based on where a spoon would typically be dipped into food or liquid.",
    "Option A, \"hole,\" is ambiguous and not a common context for dipping a spoon.",
    "Option B, \"glass of iced tea,\" is a valid choice, as you could dip a spoon into it to stir or scoop.",
    "Option C, \"kitchen drawer,\" is not suitable because you do not dip a spoon into a drawer.",
    "Option D, \"table setting,\" does not involve dipping, as a table setting refers to the arrangement of utensils and dishes.",
    "Option E, \"bowl of soup,\" also describes a situation where you would dip a spoon to scoop or taste the soup.",
    "Now compare options B and E. Both appear to be valid, but the bowl of soup is a more traditional and common context for using a spoon.",
    "Finally, since both choices B and E involve dipping, I will choose the one that is most commonly associated with spoon usage, which is \"bowl of soup.\""
