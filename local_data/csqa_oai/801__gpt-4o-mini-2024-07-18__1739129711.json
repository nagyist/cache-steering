  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the scarcity of anemones in a specific glove-shaped state.",
    "The phrase \u201cglove-shaped state\u201d likely refers to a state in the United States that has a geographical outline resembling a glove.",
    "Michigan is commonly referred to as the \"glove\" state due to its unique shape, with the lower peninsula resembling a glove.",
    "Next, we evaluate the presence of anemones in Michigan. Anemones typically thrive in marine environments, and Michigan has freshwater lakes, which are not ideal habitats for anemones.",
    "Comparing the other options, \"lake,\" \"tide pool,\" \"nursery,\" and \"Atlantic Ocean,\" we consider their relevance to marine environments.",
    "\"Lakes\" (option B) are freshwater bodies and do not support anemones, similar to Michigan's habitat.",
    "\"Tide pool\" (option C) is a marine environment but usually contains anemones; thus, it doesn't fit the context of scarcity.",
    "\"Nursery\" (option D) typically refers to a place where young marine organisms are protected, which can also involve marine life, including anemones.",
    "\"The Atlantic Ocean\" (option E) is a rich marine environment that supports many anemones and sea life.",
    "Since the question specifies a lack of anemones in a \"glove-shaped state,\" the only viable candidate from the context is Michigan, as it is the only glove-shaped state and has fewer marine environments that support anemones compared to the other options."
