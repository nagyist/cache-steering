  "query": "Question: What will telling many people about an embarrassing situation lead to?\n\nChoices:\nA: notoriety\nB: emotional distress\nC: riot\nD: bad dreams\nE: annoyance",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequences of telling many people about an embarrassing situation.",
    "When someone shares an embarrassing situation, it typically leads to increased awareness among others.",
    "This increased awareness can create various reactions depending on the social context and the nature of the embarrassment.",
    "Let's analyze the options provided: \n- A: notoriety \u2013 This implies gaining fame or infamy, which might occur but isn't a direct result for everyone.\n- B: emotional distress \u2013 Sharing an embarrassing moment could lead to feelings of shame or anxiety for the person who shared it.\n- C: riot \u2013 This seems highly unlikely as sharing an embarrassing situation does not typically incite violent reactions.\n- D: bad dreams \u2013 While emotional distress might lead to bad dreams, it is not a guaranteed consequence.\n- E: annoyance \u2013 Others may feel annoyed by the oversharing, but it\u2019s not necessarily the primary impact on the individual.",
    "Considering the likelihood and directness, emotional distress (B) seems to be a significant potential outcome for the person who shared the embarrassment.",
    "Weighing the relevance of each option, emotional distress directly ties to the act of sharing something embarrassing.",
    "Notoriety could follow but isn\u2019t a common response and isn't guaranteed.",
    "The other options do not directly correlate with the act of sharing an embarrassing situation in the way emotional distress does."
