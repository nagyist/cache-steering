  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that John was told to leave the cheese in the cellar for a few years. This suggests that aging is a key aspect of the process.",
    "Cheese often improves in flavor and texture as it ages. This is a common practice in cheese-making to enhance the product.",
    "The aging process of cheese can develop complex flavors that wouldn't be present in fresh cheese. Therefore, age significantly impacts the quality of cheese.",
    "Looking at the choices, both options B (\"age well\") and E (\"age to get better\") refer to the aging process positively influencing the cheese.",
    "However, the phrasing \"age to get better\" (option E) conveys a more explicit intention of improvement, while \"age well\" (option B) is somewhat vague.",
    "Since the context of the question suggests that John's task of leaving the cheese in the cellar is specifically to improve its quality over time, \"age to get better\" captures this intention more directly than \"age well.\"",
    "The choices C (salad dressing) and A (strong odor) do not pertain to the direct benefit of aging cheese.",
    "D (flavor) is too broad and doesn't imply the process of aging specifically, unlike option E which directly refers to the aging process benefiting the cheese.",
    "Thus, the best answer that explains why John was told to leave the cheese in the cellar is option E, as it relates directly to the process and purpose of aging cheese."
