  "query": "Question: What is the large-sclae  general result of waging war?\n\nChoices:\nA: death and destruction\nB: killing people\nC: defeat\nD: people die\nE: evil",
  "steps": [
    "Analyzing the options, the question asks for the general result of waging war on a large scale.",
    "All the options include negative outcomes of war, but I need to find the most comprehensive or general one.",
    "Option A, \"death and destruction,\" encompasses both loss of life and damage to property and societies, making it broad in scope.",
    "Option B, \"killing people,\" is specific to loss of life but does not encompass the broader destruction associated with war.",
    "Option C, \"defeat,\" refers to the outcome of losing a conflict, which is a result for some but not a general trend seen across all wars.",
    "Option D, \"people die,\" again focuses specifically on the loss of life, similar to option B.",
    "Option E, \"evil,\" is a moral judgment rather than a direct result of war and seems less quantitative or specific.",
    "Comparing the options, option A is the most comprehensive as it captures both the loss of life and the widespread destruction that accompanies large-scale warfare.",
    "After considering the definitions and implications of each term in relation to the question, I conclude that option A best represents the large-scale general result of waging war."
