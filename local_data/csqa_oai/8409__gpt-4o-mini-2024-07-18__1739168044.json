  "query": "Question: Where would you keep a container can of corn?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: in a packet\nC: liquid\nD: pantry\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a can of corn. It is a food product that is typically stored for later use.",
    "Next, think about where food products are usually kept in a house. Common locations include kitchens and dining areas.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices given. \"Garage\" (A) is not a typical place for food storage due to temperature and accessibility issues.",
    "The choice \"in a packet\" (B) does not logically apply since it refers to packaging rather than a storage location.",
    "The option \"liquid\" (C) does not relate to storage and instead describes the state of matter, which is not applicable here.",
    "Looking at \"pantry\" (D), it is a specific place designed for storing food items, including canned goods like corn.",
    "Lastly, the option \"cupboard\" (E) is also a valid food storage location but is generally less specific than a pantry.",
    "Considering that a pantry is specifically designed for food and typically holds canned goods, it is the most appropriate choice."
