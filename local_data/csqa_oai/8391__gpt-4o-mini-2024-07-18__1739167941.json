  "query": "Question: He was trying to explain to his religious parents that stopping being married to his ex was the right thing to do, but they still found it what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pleasure\nB: objected\nC: depression\nD: wrong\nE: relief",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a scenario where someone is attempting to explain their actions regarding ending a marriage to their religious parents.",
    "The context implies that the parents have a particular set of beliefs that might conflict with the person's decision to stop being married.",
    "The person believes that stopping the marriage was the right decision, suggesting there may be a moral or ethical conflict with the parents' views.",
    "The options provided include feelings or reactions: pleasure (A), objected (B), depression (C), wrong (D), and relief (E).",
    "\"Objected\" (B) implies direct opposition or disapproval, which seems likely in this situation where the person has a differing view from their parents.",
    "\"Wrong\" (D) suggests the parents view the decision as morally incorrect, which aligns with the context of their religious beliefs.",
    "\"Pleasure\" (A) and \"relief\" (E) don't seem to fit the context of the parents' feelings about the situation; rather, those terms might indicate positive feelings, which contradicts the likely response of parents discussing their child's marriage.",
    "\"Depression\" (C) could indicate a personal emotional state, but it does not directly address the parents' perspective on the decision itself.",
    "Considering the likely religious and moral beliefs of the parents, it is reasonable to conclude that they would view the person\u2019s decision as \"wrong.\""
