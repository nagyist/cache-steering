  "query": "Question: Where do you throw a ball down the lane?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: basketball court\nC: rural countryside\nD: highway\nE: bowling alley",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where to throw a ball down a lane, we need to clarify what type of ball and what type of lane we are discussing. In common contexts, throwing a ball down a lane is associated with a specific environment.",
    "A bowling lane is a narrow, long strip where players roll a bowling ball to knock down pins. This suggests that we are looking for an environment related to bowling.",
    "Next, I will analyze the answer choices to find where a bowling ball is typically thrown.",
    "Choice A, \"city,\" could potentially have bowling alleys, but it is too broad and does not specify a clear location related to throwing a ball down a lane.",
    "Choice B, \"basketball court,\" is not relevant as basketball involves shooting a ball into a hoop, not throwing it down a lane.",
    "Choice C, \"rural countryside,\" is also not applicable as it does not depict any venue for throwing a ball down a lane.",
    "Choice D, \"highway,\" is irrelevant as throwing balls down a highway is unsafe and doesn't pertain to any formal throwing activity.",
    "Finally, Choice E, \"bowling alley,\" directly pertains to a place where you throw a bowling ball down a lane in an organized way to knock down pins."
