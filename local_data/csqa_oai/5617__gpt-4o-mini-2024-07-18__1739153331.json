  "query": "Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a smaller result?\n\nChoices:\nA: written down\nB: added up\nC: start number game\nD: divided\nE: multiplied",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the basic operations commonly applied to positive integers that can yield a smaller result.",
    "Positive integers are whole numbers greater than zero, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on.",
    "If I consider the operations of addition, multiplication, and division, addition and multiplication will generally increase the value of positive integers.",
    "Dividing positive integers, on the other hand, tends to yield smaller results since dividing a number by a positive integer greater than 1 results in a smaller number.",
    "Now, I'll examine the options provided. Options A and C do not represent mathematical operations, so they can be disregarded as they don\u2019t pertain to obtaining a smaller numerical result.",
    "Option B, adding up, would generally result in a larger number, as combining positive integers increases the total.",
    "Option E, multiplying, also increases the numbers since multiplying positive integers together yields a value larger than either of the original integers (if both integers are greater than 1).",
    "Thus, the only operation that would lead to obtaining a smaller result from positive integers is D, dividing, since it consistently decreases the value."
