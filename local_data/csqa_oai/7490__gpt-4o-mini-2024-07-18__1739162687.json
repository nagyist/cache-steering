  "steps": [
    "The question describes a young boy who is scared to dance, indicating that he is likely not participating in the dancing activity.",
    "Given that he found a corner of the auditorium, it suggests he is trying to avoid the main area where dancing occurs.",
    "The phrase \"spent the whole evening\" implies he remained in that corner throughout, indicating a state of inactivity or avoidance.",
    "Looking at the choices, options A (am happy), B (celebrate), C (moving), and D (partner) do not align with a scared person avoiding dancing.",
    "Option E (sitting still) fits best because it implies staying in one place without joining in on the dance, which aligns with being scared.",
    "Thus, the boy is likely sitting still in the corner of the auditorium rather than engaging with others or dancing."
