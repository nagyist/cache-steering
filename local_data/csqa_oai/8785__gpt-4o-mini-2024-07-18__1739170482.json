    "The question is asking about who a person accused of murder must face in court.",
    "In a court case, the accused individual faces the legal entity that brings the charges against them.",
    "In criminal cases, this entity is commonly referred to as the prosecution.",
    "The prosecution represents the state or the government and is responsible for proving the accused's guilt.",
    "Looking at the answer options: \n- A: incarceration refers to being imprisoned, which is a consequence, not who they face in court.\n- B: imprisonment is a result of a conviction, not an entity in court.\n- C: prosecution is indeed the party that the accused faces in court during a criminal trial.\n- D: Benedict Cumberbatch is an actor and unrelated to the legal process.\n- E: problems are a general term and do not specify a party in court.",
