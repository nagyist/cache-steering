  "query": "Question: Where do you get a contraceptive device?\n\nChoices:\nA: person\nB: pharmacy\nC: drug store\nD: an adult squirrel\nE: bedroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a contraceptive device is. It's a medical device used to prevent pregnancy, and it is generally obtained through healthcare facilities or retail locations that sell health-related products.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided. \"Person\" (A) is too vague and doesn't specify a professional or location where one could acquire such a device.",
    "Looking at \"pharmacy\" (B), this is a well-known place where contraceptives, including contraceptive devices, can be purchased or acquired via prescription.",
    "Now, consider \"drug store\" (C). A drug store typically includes pharmacies and sells various health products, including contraceptive devices.",
    "The option \"adult squirrel\" (D) is clearly humorous and not a realistic source for a contraceptive device.",
    "Lastly, \"bedroom\" (E) is a location rather than a source of obtaining a contraceptive device; you typically would not get one there.",
    "Since both \"pharmacy\" and \"drug store\" are valid locations for obtaining contraceptive devices, compare both. A drug store usually encompasses the functionality of a pharmacy as well, making it a broader answer.",
    "Thus, while both B and C are potential answers, C may be considered more inclusive of the context where various contraceptive devices can be acquired."
