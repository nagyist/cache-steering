  "query": "Question: Where is a bicycle likely to be stolen?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: schoolyard\nC: toy store\nD: netherlands\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the locations provided as potential places where a bicycle might be stolen.",
    "The street is a common public place where bicycles can be left unattended, making it vulnerable to theft.",
    "A schoolyard may also have bicycles, especially among students, but it is generally more supervised compared to the street.",
    "A toy store is less likely to have bicycles present, as it primarily sells toys rather than serving as a location for bicycling or storing bikes.",
    "The Netherlands is known for its high cycling culture, but it's not a specific location where a bicycle would be stolen; it's more of a context.",
    "A garage could be a possible place for theft if the garage is not secured, but it's more common for bicycles to be stolen while in public places rather than private garages.",
    "Given the analysis, the street is the most public and least secure location for bicycles, making it the most likely place for theft.",
    "Comparing the likelihood of theft across all options, the street stands out as the most probable location for a bicycle to be stolen."
