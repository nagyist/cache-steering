  "steps": [
    "When someone drinks alcohol with the intention of getting drunk, they are likely to consume a significant amount of alcohol.",
    "The next morning after heavy drinking, many people report experiencing adverse effects, which are commonly referred to as a hangover.",
    "A hangover typically includes symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dehydration.",
    "Considering the choices, \"getting drunk\" (A) is not relevant the next morning, as that occurs during the act of drinking, not after.",
    "\"Need to urinate\" (B) can be a symptom during drinking due to alcohol\u2019s diuretic effect, but it is not specifically what one experiences the next morning.",
    "\"Sickness\" (C) could encompass feelings of nausea that might accompany a hangover, but it is less specific than the term \"hangover\" itself.",
    "\"Loss of control\" (D) typically refers to the state while drinking and does not apply to the next morning after the effects of alcohol wear off.",
    "The most common and specific experience one can associate directly with the aftermath of heavy drinking is a hangover (E).",
    "Given that a hangover encapsulates multiple symptoms that occur after drinking to excess, it is the most appropriate answer in this context."
