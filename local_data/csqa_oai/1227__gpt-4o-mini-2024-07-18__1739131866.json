  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of a butane stove, which is typically used for cooking outdoors due to the emission of fumes.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided to identify a suitable outdoor setting where a butane stove could be used.",
    "Option A (community kitchen) is usually an indoor or semi-covered area and may not be appropriate for using a butane stove.",
    "Option B (the post office) is primarily an indoor facility and not suitable for cooking.",
    "Option C (apartment) is also an indoor living space, making it unsuitable for using a butane stove because of the fumes.",
