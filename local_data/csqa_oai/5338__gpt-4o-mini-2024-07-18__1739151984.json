  "steps": [
    "Identify the phrase \"the smallest of the fifty.\" This likely refers to one of the fifty states in the United States.",
    "Consider which states are known for being small. Among the fifty states, Rhode Island is widely recognized as the smallest state in the U.S.",
    "Next, evaluate the context provided in the sentence. The mention of \"admiring the apple tree\" suggests a natural setting, which can relate to various options like a meadow, garden, or park. However, the specific location needs to correspond to the size reference.",
    "Look at the options provided: A: meadow, B: Idaho, C: Rhode Island, D: garden, E: park. Among these, only Rhode Island is recognized as the smallest state.",
    "Check if the other options make sense in the context. While \"meadow,\" \"garden,\" and \"park\" are possible relaxing places, they don\u2019t align with the uniqueness of being the smallest of the fifty states.",
    "Idaho does not match the criteria of being the smallest since it is significantly larger than Rhode Island.",
    "Since there is only one option out of the five that fits the description of \"the smallest of the fifty,\" it further supports that Rhode Island is the correct choice.",
    "Finally, confirm that the context of relaxing in nature aligns well with being in Rhode Island, which has many parks and gardens."
