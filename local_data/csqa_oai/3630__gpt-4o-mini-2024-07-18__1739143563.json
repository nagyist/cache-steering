  "steps": [
    "The question asks about keeping chicken fresh for an extended period.",
    "I need to evaluate each of the choices, considering how well they preserve chicken freshness.",
    "French fries (A) are a type of food and do not offer conditions for preserving chicken.",
    "A plate (B) can hold chicken but does not provide refrigeration or freezing, leading to quick spoilage.",
    "A freezer (C) is designed to keep food frozen, significantly extending its freshness by inhibiting bacterial growth and spoilage.",
    "Pizza (D) is also a food and does not provide a storage solution for chicken.",
    "A fast food restaurant (E) may have storage methods, but they do not necessarily provide a longer preservation time than a home freezer.",
    "Out of all the options, the freezer is specifically used to keep foods like chicken fresh for extended periods due to low temperatures.",
    "Thus, the most suitable choice, considering the context of the question, is the freezer."
