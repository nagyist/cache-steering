    "The question asks what feeling or state might result from only getting a small taste of something.",
    "Getting only a small taste typically implies that the experience was limited or not fully satisfying.",
    "If one only gets a small taste of something pleasurable, it is likely to lead to a feeling of incomplete satisfaction.",
    "Looking at the choices: \n- A: new realization does not necessarily relate to a taste experience.\n- B: handicap does not seem relevant in this context.\n- C: joy might derive from a taste but does not directly relate to getting only a small taste.\n- D: ownership doesn't connect with the idea of sampling or having a limited experience.\n- E: wanting more implies a desire for a larger experience after a small taste, which aligns with the idea of incomplete satisfaction.",
    "The most fitting choice is E, as a small taste often leaves a person eager for more of the experience."
