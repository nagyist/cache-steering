  "steps": [
    "Consider what aspects of the body are used during tennis, especially focusing on the physical movements involved.",
    "Tennis involves a significant amount of lateral movement, requiring players to quickly move side to side.",
    "Lateral movement predominantly engages and exercises the lower body, particularly the legs.",
    "Evaluate the other options: skill refers to the proficiency in playing, which while important, is not a physical aspect; hand refers to grip and control, but lateral movement primarily utilizes the legs; competition is the nature of the sport, and the racket is an equipment used to play.",
    "The phrasing \"really gets the whats\" implies a focus on physical engagement rather than skill, competition, or equipment.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the clear answer regarding what gets worked out during lateral movement in tennis is the legs."
