  "steps": [
    "The question implies that there is some negative condition that is preventing the sun from shining. This suggests we are looking for an adjective that describes a condition that obstructs or obscures sunlight.",
    "The options provided (cloudy, grotesque, evil, hideous, ugly) must be considered in terms of how they relate to obstructing the sun.",
    "Option A, \"cloudy,\" directly relates to weather conditions that can block sunlight. If it's cloudy, the sun can be obscured, hence it can stop shining.",
    "Options B (\"grotesque\"), C (\"evil\"), D (\"hideous\"), and E (\"ugly\") describe negative attributes but do not directly relate to the concept of blocking sunlight.",
    "While one could argue that \"grotesque,\" \"evil,\" \"hideous,\" and \"ugly\" represent unpleasantness, none of them accurately fits the context of hindering sunlight like \"cloudy\" does.",
    "Additionally, \"cloudy\" is commonly used to describe specific weather conditions linked directly to the sun's inability to shine brightly or clearly.",
    "In conclusion, the only option that specifically describes a meteorological condition that prevents the sun from shining is \"cloudy.\""
