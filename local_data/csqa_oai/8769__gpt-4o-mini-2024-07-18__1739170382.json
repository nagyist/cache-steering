  "query": "Question: What does a doctor have to do before he is allowed to take an exam to get his MD?\n\nChoices:\nA: provide care\nB: let blood\nC: resuscitate\nD: distance himself\nE: study medicine",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what a doctor must do before taking an exam for an MD, I need to understand the sequence and prerequisites typically required for medical licensure and examinations.",
    "Medical education usually requires a rigorous curriculum, including theoretical and practical components. This is generally completed before sitting for licensing exams.",
    "I need to consider each of the options provided: A: provide care, B: let blood, C: resuscitate, D: distance himself, and E: study medicine.",
    "Option A, \"provide care\", suggests a post-examination requirement; care is provided after being licensed, not before.",
    "Option B, \"let blood\", seems related to a medical procedure but does not represent a prerequisite for taking exams.",
    "Option C, \"resuscitate\", implies a practical skill but, again, is not a requirement before taking the exam.",
    "Option D, \"distance himself\", does not make sense as a prerequisite and is not relevant to medical licensing.",
    "Option E, \"study medicine\", appears to be the logical requirement as one must complete medical studies and training to qualify for the MD exam.",
    "Evaluating all options, the only prerequisite step that aligns with the licensing process for a doctor before taking the MD exam is studying medicine."
