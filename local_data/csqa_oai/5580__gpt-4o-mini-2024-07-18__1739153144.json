  "steps": [
    "The question states that a machine was needed to help with studies, suggesting an educational or research context.",
    "Considering the function of the machine, it must be suitable for tasks related to learning or experimentation.",
    "Analyzing the choices provided, the 'house' option (C) generally implies a domestic environment, which may not be directly focused on studies.",
    "The 'industrial area' (A) is primarily centered around mass production and manufacturing, which doesn't align with study purposes.",
    "A 'restaurant' (B) is designed for food service, which is not typically related to academic studies.",
    "An 'office' (E) can have study-related activities but is generally more focused on business operations rather than pure educational research.",
    "In contrast, a 'laboratory' (D) explicitly implies a space for scientific experiments, research, and possibly educational studies, making it a suitable environment for using a machine that aids in studies.",
    "Thus, based on the context and functions mentioned in the question, the laboratory stands out as the most appropriate choice."
