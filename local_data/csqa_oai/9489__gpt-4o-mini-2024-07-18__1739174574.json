  "query": "Question: The comforter was missing from the couples' sleep the other night and they were cold, where should it have been?\n\nChoices:\nA: livingroom\nB: linen closet\nC: bedroom\nD: at the cleaners\nE: washing machine",
  "steps": [
    "The situation involves a couple who experienced coldness at night due to a missing comforter.",
    "A comforter is typically used on a bed to provide warmth, especially in cold conditions.",
    "The phrase \"the couples' sleep\" indicates that the situation occurred during their sleeping hours, suggesting the context is a bedroom.",
    "Since the couple was cold, it follows that the comforter should have been in a place where they could use it for warmth while sleeping.",
    "The options include locations relevant to where a comforter might normally be found or might have been taken.",
    "Option A, \"livingroom,\" seems less likely since comforters are usually not used there for sleeping.",
    "Option B, \"linen closet,\" is a possibility as that\u2019s a place where comforters might be stored, but it\u2019s not where it should have been for immediate use during sleep.",
    "Option D, \"at the cleaners,\" indicates that the comforter would be unavailable for use, making it an unlikely option.",
    "Option E, \"washing machine,\" also suggests the comforter is out of reach and would not provide warmth while sleeping.",
    "Since the best place for the comforter during the night would have been the bedroom where they sleep, option C is the most reasonable answer."
