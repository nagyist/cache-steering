  "query": "Question: The area of land next to the ocean is called what?\n\nChoices:\nA: underwater\nB: surface of earth\nC: waterfalls\nD: delta\nE: beach",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the area of land specifically adjacent to the ocean.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided to identify which one relates to the land next to the ocean.",
    "Choice A, \"underwater,\" refers to areas that are beneath the water surface and does not describe land next to the ocean.",
    "Choice B, \"surface of earth,\" is a very broad term that can refer to any land on the planet and does not specifically indicate land next to the ocean.",
    "Choice C, \"waterfalls,\" refers to a natural feature where water flows over a vertical drop but does not relate to land next to the ocean.",
    "Choice D, \"delta,\" refers to landforms that occur where a river meets a larger body of water, which may be near oceans; however, it is not synonymous with the area next to the ocean.",
    "Choice E, \"beach,\" refers to a specific area of shoreline, which is defined as the land along the edge of an ocean, sea, lake, or river.",
    "Given that a beach is the most commonly associated term with land adjacent to the ocean, it matches the definition the question seeks.",
    "Thus, the correct answer is the only option that directly defines the area of land next to the ocean."
