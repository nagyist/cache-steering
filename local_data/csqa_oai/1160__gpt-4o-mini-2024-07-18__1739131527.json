  "query": "Question: His long walk home wasn't over, he lived on the tenth storey of a walk up what?\n\nChoices:\nA: skyscraper\nB: book of stories\nC: tall building\nD: apartment building\nE: mall",
  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that the person lives in a structure that requires climbing stairs, as it is specifically mentioned to be a \"walk up.\"",
    "A 'walk up' typically refers to a residential building without an elevator, suggesting a multi-storey concept.",
    "Among the answer choices, 'skyscraper' (A) implies a very tall building which often has elevators, contradicting the \"walk up\" concept.",
    "The term 'book of stories' (B) does not relate to physical buildings and is irrelevant in this context.",
    "'Tall building' (C) is somewhat vague and could fit, but it does not specifically indicate a residential nature.",
    "'Apartment building' (D) directly refers to a residential structure where people live, and it can certainly be a 'walk up.'",
    "'Malls' (E) do not fit the description, as they are commercial rather than residential buildings.",
    "Upon analyzing each choice, 'apartment building' is the most fitting answer due to its relation to residential living and compatibility with the concept of a 'walk up.'"
