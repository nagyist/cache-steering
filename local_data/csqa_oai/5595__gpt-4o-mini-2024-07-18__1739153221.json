  "steps": [
    "The main purpose of deodorant is to reduce body odor, particularly in areas where sweat glands are concentrated.",
    "The most common area of application for deodorant is the underarms, also known as armpits.",
    "Other options such as the medicine chest and grocery store do not represent locations for application; rather, they are places where deodorant could be stored or purchased.",
    "Applying deodorant on my hand does not align with its intended use, as it would not effectively reduce odor in the most critical area.",
    "\"Own bathroom\" may imply a place for storage or application, but it doesn't specify the most logical body area for application.",
    "Given that the armpits are the primary area of application for deodorant, this is the focus of my conclusion.",
    "After reviewing all the options, I determine that B (armpits) is the correct answer based on the intended use of deodorant."
