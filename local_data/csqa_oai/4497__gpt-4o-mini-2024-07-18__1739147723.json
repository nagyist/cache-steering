  "query": "Question: Where is a dentist likely to be busy because of hockey?\n\nChoices:\nA: minnesota\nB: office building\nC: city\nD: street\nE: fights",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where hockey is popular. Hockey is particularly popular in certain geographic regions in the United States and Canada.",
    "Next, think about which states are known for their strong hockey culture. Minnesota is widely recognized for its love of hockey, with many high school, college, and professional teams.",
    "Consider the implications of hockey on dental work. Injuries during hockey games, such as dental injuries from sticks or pucks, would lead to an increase in dentist visits.",
    "Determine if any of the answer choices could indicate a location in which a dentist would be busy because of hockey. Options like \"office building,\" \"city,\" and \"street\" are less specific and would not directly connect to hockey.",
    "\"Fights\" could refer to the often physical nature of hockey, but it does not directly indicate a location where a dentist would be busy.",
    "Given that Minnesota is known for both hockey popularity and the resulting injuries that would require dental work, it stands out as a valid option.",
    "Review the choices again: Minnesota (A) aligns with being busy due to hockey, while others do not. \"Office building,\" \"city,\" and \"street\" are too vague, and \"fights\" does not imply a specific location.",
    "Conclude that the dentist would likely be busy in Minnesota due to the high hockey engagement and potential for dental injuries related to the sport."
