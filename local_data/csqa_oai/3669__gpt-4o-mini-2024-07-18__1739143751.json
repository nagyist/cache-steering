  "query": "Question: She left the states and traveled across the pond, her next art gallery was in what city?\n\nChoices:\nA: soho\nB: london\nC: art museum\nD: new york city\nE: on a mural",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"across the pond\" is a common idiomatic expression used to refer to traveling from the United States to Europe, specifically the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "Given that she left the states, this indicates that she is now in or preparing to go to a location in Europe, most likely in the UK, since \"across the pond\" typically refers to the Atlantic crossing to the UK.",
    "The phrase \"art gallery\" implies that she is visiting a location that showcases art, which is a common activity in major cities known for their art scenes.",
    "Among the answer choices provided, only \"London\" (Choice B) is a well-known city that is globally recognized for its art galleries and museums.",
    "Soho (Choice A) is a district within London, but it is not a city; thus, it cannot be the answer to the question.",
    "\"Art museum\" (Choice C) is a type of venue rather than a specific location or city.",
    "New York City (Choice D) is in the United States, and since she left the states, this does not fit the scenario presented in the question.",
    "\"On a mural\" (Choice E) does not represent a city, and therefore it does not provide a valid answer to the question.",
    "The only choice that aligns with the travel from the states and correlates with a well-known city having art galleries is London (Choice B)."
