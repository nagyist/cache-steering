  "steps": [
    "The question asks about what you can view a window with your current task on.",
    "A \"window\" typically refers to a digital interface on a screen where tasks can be viewed or managed.",
    "Option A (bus) does not logically allow for viewing a window related to a current task as buses do not have interfaces for such tasks.",
    "Option C (classroom) typically refers to a physical space where learning occurs, not a window for tasks.",
    "Option D (binocular) is a tool for viewing distant objects, not for viewing tasks or windows.",
    "Option E (car) does not provide a direct relation to a window for viewing tasks, unless it refers to specific smart car interfaces, which is less common.",
    "Option B (computer screen) is the primary interface where digital windows are displayed, allowing users to perform and view tasks.",
    "Considering all options, the most appropriate answer is the one that directly involves a digital interface designed for tasks."
