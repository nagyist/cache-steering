  "query": "Question: Nate washed  his personal silverware and put it in a  drawer.   Where might that drawer be?\n\nChoices:\nA: bedroom\nB: kitchen\nC: table\nD: restaurant\nE: cupboard",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that Nate washed his personal silverware, which suggests that it is something commonly used for eating and serving food.",
    "Considering the nature of silverware, it is most often located near the place where meals are prepared and consumed, which is typically the kitchen or dining area.",
    "Now, looking at the provided choices, A (bedroom) seems unlikely as bedrooms typically do not contain silverware.",
    "Choice C (table) refers to a surface where food is eaten, but does not necessarily indicate a place where silverware is stored.",
    "Choice D (restaurant) does not fit since this pertains to a professional setting rather than personal silverware.",
    "Choice E (cupboard) can be a possible location, as cupboards are often used to store kitchen items, including silverware.",
    "However, since Nate washed and stored his personal silverware, it makes more sense for him to place it in a drawer specifically designed for utensils, which is usually located in the kitchen.",
    "Overall, the kitchen is both a practical and common location for storing personal silverware, especially after washing."
