  "steps": [
    "To determine where beautiful cars are often found, I need to evaluate each option for its relevance to the presence of aesthetically pleasing vehicles.",
    "Option A mentions a bridge. While beautiful cars could potentially drive over a bridge, it is not a primary location where they are showcased or specifically gathered.",
    "Option B is a car show. This option is specifically designed for showcasing beautiful and unique cars, making it a prime location where one would expect to find such vehicles.",
    "Option C is a freeway. While beautiful cars may be seen on a freeway, it is not a dedicated venue for showcasing them, as the focus is on driving rather than displaying.",
    "Option D refers to a parking lot. Although beautiful cars could be parked there, it lacks the personal touch and organized showcase that a car show would have.",
    "Option E is a race track. While some beautiful cars are present at race tracks, those cars are typically performance-oriented rather than showcasing their aesthetic qualities.",
    "After analyzing all options, I find that a car show is specifically designed to display beautiful cars, making it the most fitting choice."
