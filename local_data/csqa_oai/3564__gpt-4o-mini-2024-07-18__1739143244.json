  "query": "Question: At reception desk John asked  to see a person who was helping him make a sale.  Lilly came out immediately and took him back to her space, and talked to him about his needs.  He said that he was willing to lower the price to 80,000 if it would sale faster.  Where might John be?\n\nChoices:\nA: large office\nB: at hotel\nC: building\nD: real estate office\nE: store room",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the context of the scenario. John is at a reception desk, indicating he is likely in a professional or commercial setting.",
    "Next, Lilly comes out to help John, which suggests that there is a business or service environment where staff members assist customers or clients.",
    "John is discussing a sale and is willing to negotiate the price. This indicates he is likely involved in a transaction that requires negotiation and may involve significant items, such as properties or high-value goods.",
    "Considering the mention of a \u201csale\u201d and the context of price negotiation, it seems that John is involved in a business related to selling or purchasing something.",
    "The use of the term \"sale\" and the financial aspect suggests it is not related to a personal or casual setting, which would be more typical in places like a hotel, store room, or a large office without a specific sales role.",
    "Analyzing the options, a \"real estate office\" is specifically designed for buying and selling properties, which aligns with John's willingness to negotiate the price.",
    "The other options such as a large office, hotel, building, or store room do not strongly fit the context of a specific sale involving negotiation of price in the way described.",
    "Since the narrative heavily implies a transactional nature involving a negotiation, the most sensible option is that John is in a real estate office."
