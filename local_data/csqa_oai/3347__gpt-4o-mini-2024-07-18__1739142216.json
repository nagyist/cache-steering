  "query": "Question: What type of college do you learn science at?\n\nChoices:\nA: space lab\nB: a state college\nC: school\nD: nanotechnology\nE: university",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about the type of college where science is learned.",
    "I need to analyze the choices given and see which ones are appropriate institutions for learning science.",
    "Option A, \"space lab,\" is a facility focused on space research rather than a formal educational institution, so it is not the answer.",
    "Option B, \"a state college,\" is indeed an institution where one can learn various fields including science, but it is a more specific term than what might be considered general for science studies.",
    "Option C, \"school,\" is a broad term that refers to any educational institution, but it lacks specificity in relation to higher education institutions that focus on science.",
    "Option D, \"nanotechnology,\" refers to a field of study rather than an institution. Thus, it cannot be the answer.",
    "Option E, \"university,\" is a common term for institutions of higher education where a variety of subjects, including science, are taught.",
    "Comparing the terms closely, both \"state college\" and \"university\" are valid places to learn science, but \"university\" usually encompasses a broader range of advanced scientific studies.",
    "Since the question asks generally about a type of college for learning science, \"university\" is the most appropriate general term."
