  "query": "Question: Dancing or walking too much will lead to what on your feet?\n\nChoices:\nA: humiliation\nB: fatigue\nC: skin\nD: blisters\nE: exhaustion",
  "steps": [
    "When engaging in activities like dancing or walking, the feet undergo significant physical activity and pressure.",
    "This activity can cause wear and tear on the skin of the feet, leading to various outcomes.",
    "Two key potential outcomes of excessive activity on the feet include blister development and fatigue.",
    "Blisters form as a result of friction on the skin, which can occur during extensive movement.",
    "Fatigue, on the other hand, refers to the overall tiredness felt in the muscles after prolonged use.",
    "While both fatigue and blisters are reasonable outcomes, the question focuses on a specific physical condition resulting from excess movement.",
    "Among the choices, \"blisters\" stands out as a direct consequence specific to activity-related stress on the skin.",
    "Humiliation, skin, and exhaustion do not directly address the physical manifestation related to feet during excessive dancing or walking.",
    "Thus, the most accurate answer that describes a direct outcome observed on the feet would be blisters."
