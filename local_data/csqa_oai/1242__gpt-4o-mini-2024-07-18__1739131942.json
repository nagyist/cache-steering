  "query": "Question: What does one do at an office?\n\nChoices:\nA: work\nB: school building\nC: workplace\nD: skyscraper\nE: public building",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question about what one does at an office, I need to consider the primary purpose of an office space.",
    "An office is generally a place where individuals or teams engage in work-related activities.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"work\" directly describes the primary action that occurs at an office.",
    "\"School building\" refers to an educational institution, which is not what an office is used for.",
    "\"Workplace\" is another term that describes an office, but it is more general and not specific to the action done there.",
    "\"Skyscraper\" refers to a type of building and does not specifically relate to the activities in an office.",
    "\"Public building\" describes buildings that serve the public, but again, it's not focused on the specific activities taking place at an office.",
    "Comparing all options, \"work\" is the most accurate term that describes the main activity in an office setting.",
    "Although \"workplace\" could also be a suitable term, it does not convey a specific action like \"work\" does.",
    "Thus, the best fit based on the question is the choice that explicitly states what one does at an office."
