  "query": "Question: He went to visit his brother going to a Bulldog school in the south, the humidity was intense but seemed plain and ordinary by now to his brother where?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: atlanta\nC: georgia\nD: countryside\nE: landscape",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze who \"he\" is in the statement, but we already know he is visiting his brother.",
    "Next, the statement mentions that the brother is attending a \"Bulldog school.\" This often refers to the University of Georgia, whose mascot is a Bulldog.",
    "Given that the brother is attending a Bulldog school and the context is set in the south, it is reasonable to conclude that the brother is likely in Georgia, where the University of Georgia is located.",
    "The statement also mentions the humidity being intense yet plain and ordinary, which suggests the brother has become accustomed to the climate in that region.",
    "Considering these clues, we must determine which of the answer choices best corresponds to the location of the Bulldog school in the south.",
    "The answer options include air, Atlanta, Georgia, countryside, and landscape. Among these, \"Georgia\" is the most direct reference to the location of the Bulldog school, while \"Atlanta\" is a city within Georgia.",
    "However, since our focus is on identifying the state where the Bulldog school (University of Georgia) is located, the most appropriate choice would be \"Georgia\" not \"Atlanta.\"",
    "The other options (air, countryside, landscape) do not specifically indicate a location related to the Bulldog school.",
    "Thus, after considering all the steps, it is clear that Georgia is the correct answer, as it encompasses the area where the brother is going to school."
