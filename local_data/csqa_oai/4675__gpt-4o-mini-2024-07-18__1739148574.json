  "query": "Question: A disposable razor is aptly named, it ends up where?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: hotel room\nC: garbage\nD: closet\nE: medicine cabinet",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"disposable\" indicates that the razor is designed for limited use and is meant to be thrown away after a certain point.",
    "Considering the nature of disposable products, they are typically not meant for long-term storage or repeated use, suggesting they should be discarded after use.",
    "Looking at the choices, a \"supermarket\" would be a place where disposable razors are sold, but they do not end up there after use.",
    "A \"hotel room\" might have disposable razors for guests, but once used, they are not likely to remain there; they are generally disposed of.",
    "A \"closet\" and a \"medicine cabinet\" are both places where personal toiletries are stored for future use, which would not align with the disposable nature of the product.",
    "\"Garbage\" is the most logical place for disposable items after they have served their purpose, as they are designed to be thrown away.",
    "Given these considerations, the most appropriate answer among the options is that a disposable razor ends up in the garbage."
