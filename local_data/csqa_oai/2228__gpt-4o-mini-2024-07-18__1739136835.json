  "steps": [
    "The question asks where there is likely to be more than one desk drawer.",
    "A desk typically has one or more drawers, but the phrasing \"more than one\" suggests a specific context.",
    "Choice A refers to \"holding office supplies\" which does not specifically indicate a location with multiple desks or desk drawers; it could refer to any single desk drawer.",
    "Choice B, \"desk,\" generally indicates a single piece of furniture, which on its own does not imply multiple drawers.",
    "Choice C, \"room,\" could theoretically have multiple desks or furniture pieces, but does not specifically connect to desk drawers.",
    "Choice D, \"office,\" is a space commonly containing multiple desks, each with potentially more than one drawer.",
    "Choice E, \"school,\" may contain desks in classrooms, and often classrooms do have individual desk drawers, but the context of the entire school suggests variety.",
    "Comparing the most relevant choice, \"office\" stands out as an environment specifically designed to accommodate multiple desks and thus multiple desk drawers.",
    "Considering other choices, \"office\" is the most suitable option for containing more than one desk drawer."
