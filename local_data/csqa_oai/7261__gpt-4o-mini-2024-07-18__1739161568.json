  "query": "Question: His mother took his schooling very seriously and wanted to be the president of what group?\n\nChoices:\nA: corporation\nB: whitehouse\nC: church\nD: board room\nE: pta",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that his mother is serious about his schooling, which suggests a focus on educational involvement or parental support in schooling.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"pta\" (Parent-Teacher Association) is directly related to schooling, as PTAs are organizations comprised of parents and teachers to promote collaboration in schools.",
    "The other options (corporation, whitehouse, church, board room) do not specifically align with direct involvement in a child's schooling. \"Whitehouse\" refers to the U.S. presidency, which isn't related to education.",
    "\"Corporation\" and \"board room\" imply a business context, which is not relevant to parenting or educational oversight.",
    "\"Church\" could denote community involvement, but it is not clearly linked to the concept of schooling the way \"pta\" is.",
    "Since the question is about her being the president of a group linked to his schooling, the only logical choice is \"pta.\"",
    "Therefore, I conclude that the answer should focus on the educational aspect represented in the options."
