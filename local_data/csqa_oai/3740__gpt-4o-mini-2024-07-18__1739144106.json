  "query": "Question: Bob didn't know that the secret passageway was there when he bought the place. It led to a bomb shelter in the back yard.  Where might the passage way have been?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: building\nC: hotel\nD: shopping mall\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Bob bought \"the place,\" which implies that he purchased a specific location rather than a commercial property or public space.",
    "Considering the choices, \"airport,\" \"building,\" \"hotel,\" and \"shopping mall\" typically refer to commercial or public spaces where it would be less common to find secret passageways designed for personal or private use.",
    "On the other hand, \"house\" indicates a private residence where secret passageways are more likely to exist, especially if it includes features like a bomb shelter.",
    "The nature of a bomb shelter also implies it would be hidden and not something commonly associated with public places like hotels, shopping malls, or airports due to safety and structural reasons.",
    "Thus, the most plausible answer is that the secret passageway leading to a bomb shelter would be found in a house."
