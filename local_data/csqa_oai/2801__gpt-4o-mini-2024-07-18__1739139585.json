  "query": "Question: The shark was navigating across from the African coast to New York, where was it?\n\nChoices:\nA: bathtub\nB: seawater\nC: atlantic ocean\nD: saltwater\nE: sea world",
  "steps": [
    "The shark is a marine animal that typically lives in oceans and seas.",
    "The African coast is located near the Atlantic Ocean, which connects to the waters surrounding the Americas, including New York.",
    "The phrase \"navigating across\" implies that the shark is traveling over a large body of water.",
    "Since the shark is traveling from the African coast to New York, it must be in the Atlantic Ocean during its journey.",
    "I need to evaluate the choices provided to see which fits the context.",
    "Choice A, \"bathtub,\" is not a relevant environment for a shark.",
    "Choice B, \"seawater,\" is a broader term and doesn\u2019t specifically indicate the geographic area.",
    "Choice C, \"atlantic ocean,\" directly describes the specific ocean where the journey takes place.",
    "Choice D, \"saltwater,\" is similar in nature to seawater but is also too general without geographic specificity.",
    "Choice E, \"sea world,\" is a theme park and does not align with the natural habitat of sharks.",
    "Given the context and the choices, the most accurate answer that specifies the area where the shark was navigating is \"atlantic ocean.\""
