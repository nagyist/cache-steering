  "query": "Question: He grew tired of standing in the kitchen his whole shift, where was he?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: friend's house\nC: restaurant\nD: jail\nE: fraternity house",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"grew tired of standing\" suggests a location where standing for long periods is common.",
    "In a kitchen setting, especially in the context of a shift, it implies a work environment where food is being prepared or served.",
    "A restaurant is a plausible candidate, as it regularly employs staff who stand for extended periods while cooking or serving.",
    "The neighbor's house, friend's house, and fraternity house do not typically involve long work shifts that require standing, which makes them less likely.",
    "Jail also does not fit the context, as it doesn't involve work shifts in a kitchen by the inmate.",
    "Considering the context of the kitchen being part of a job, the most likely option is a restaurant.",
    "The setting implies a professional environment rather than a personal or legal situation.",
    "I have analyzed all the options and eliminated those that do not fit the work environment implied by \"standing in the kitchen his whole shift.\""
