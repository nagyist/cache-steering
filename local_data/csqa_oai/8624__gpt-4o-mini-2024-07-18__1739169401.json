  "query": "Question: Where do you stock weaponry?\n\nChoices:\nA: machine gun\nB: fishing rod\nC: tin can\nD: artillery\nE: double in worth",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where to stock weaponry, indicating that the options should be related to weaponry or military equipment.",
    "Examining the options, A (machine gun) and D (artillery) are clearly types of weaponry that can be stocked.",
    "Option B (fishing rod) is not a weapon, and C (tin can) does not pertain to weaponry.",
    "Option E (double in worth) is a phrase and does not represent any physical object or weaponry.",
    "Focusing on options A and D, I need to determine which is more appropriate as a place to stock weaponry.",
    "A machine gun is a specific type of weapon, while artillery refers to a category of large-caliber guns used in warfare.",
    "Stocking could refer to storing, which pertains to the larger strategic equipment, making artillery the more appropriate answer.",
    "Since D (artillery) is about large weapon systems that would typically be stocked and stored, it is a strong candidate.",
    "A machine gun is also a weapon but suggests a different scale and context of storage than artillery.",
    "Conclusively, since artillery is a broader category of weaponry that typically involves storage, it is the best choice."
