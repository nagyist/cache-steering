  "query": "Question: He knew of prairie dogs back home but wasn't sure if what he saw was a marmot, but the outback tour guide explained it was during his tour of where?\n\nChoices:\nA: north america\nB: australia\nC: desert\nD: wilderness\nE: switzerland",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"tour guide\" and specifically refers to the \"outback,\" which is commonly associated with Australia.",
    "The prairie dogs mentioned in the question are native to North America, but since it states that he was confused about whether he saw a marmot, this could indicate an animal that resembles prairie dogs but is in a different habitat.",
    "Marmots are primarily found in mountainous or rural areas and are not typically associated with desert or wilderness settings directly yet could still be found in varying terrains.",
    "Since he is partaking in an outback tour, and the outback is a unique setting in Australia, it strongly suggests that the combination of animals mentioned ties back to this region.",
    "Given that the tour is described as an \"outback\" tour, it automatically ties back to Australia rather than North America, Switzerland, or a general desert or wilderness setting.",
    "The other choices (North America, desert, wilderness, and Switzerland) do not logically fit together with the mention of outback, which implies Australian geography and ecology.",
    "In summary, all reasoning points toward Australia being the likely setting for the tour where the guide explained the animal."
