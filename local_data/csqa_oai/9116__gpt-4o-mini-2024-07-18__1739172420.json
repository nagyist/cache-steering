  "query": "Question: Where can someone go and buy cheese?\n\nChoices:\nA: pizza\nB: bar\nC: fridge\nD: market\nE: refrigerator",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify each choice to determine if it is a place where cheese can be directly purchased.",
    "Assess choice A: \"pizza.\" This typically refers to food made with cheese but not a place to purchase cheese directly.",
    "Assess choice B: \"bar.\" While some bars might serve cheese dishes or cheese plates, they are not primarily places to buy cheese.",
    "Assess choice C: \"fridge.\" A fridge is a storage place, not a location where cheese can be purchased.",
    "Assess choice D: \"market.\" Markets commonly sell various food items, including cheese. This is a strong candidate.",
    "Assess choice E: \"refrigerator.\" Similar to \"fridge,\" this is a storage container and not a purchasing location.",
    "From the assessment, choices A, B, C, and E do not qualify as valid purchasing locations for cheese.",
    "Choice D (\"market\") stands out as it signifies a place where cheese can be purchased, making it the correct answer."
