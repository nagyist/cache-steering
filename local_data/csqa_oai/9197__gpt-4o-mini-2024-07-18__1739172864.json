  "query": "Question: The snake was cold, what did it seek?\n\nChoices:\nA: warm place\nB: wooded area\nC: blanket\nD: sleeping bag\nE: tropical forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the context of the situation. The phrase \"The snake was cold\" suggests that the snake is experiencing low temperatures and is likely in need of warmth.",
    "Next, I analyze the options provided: \nA: warm place\nB: wooded area\nC: blanket\nD: sleeping bag\nE: tropical forest",
    "I consider the needs of a snake in terms of temperature regulation. Snakes are ectothermic animals, meaning they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.",
    "I evaluate option A, \"warm place.\" This is a broad option, but it directly addresses the primary need of the snake for warmth.",
    "Option B, \"wooded area,\" may not necessarily guarantee warmth, as it could include both warm and cold areas.",
    "For option C, \"blanket,\" while it could provide warmth, it is not a natural instinct for a snake to seek out man-made objects for warmth.",
    "Option D, \"sleeping bag,\" is similar to a blanket in that it's artificial and not something a snake would typically seek in the wild.",
    "Finally, I analyze option E, \"tropical forest.\" While a tropical forest is warm, it is less specific than simply finding a \"warm place,\" which could encompass various locations suitable for a snake seeking warmth.",
    "Given that the primary focus is on the snake's immediate need for warmth, the best option is A, \"warm place,\" as it encompasses any suitable location that provides the necessary warmth."
