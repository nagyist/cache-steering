  "query": "Question: His hands were shaking as he was setting cup on table, he was worried he would what the cup if he tried to drink?\n\nChoices:\nA: breaking\nB: bend over\nC: let go of\nD: careful\nE: pick up",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence describes a person whose hands are shaking, indicating a state of anxiety or nervousness.",
    "By saying he was worried, it suggests he fears something negative might happen if he attempts to drink.",
    "The context of setting a cup on the table implies he is handling a cup, and shaking hands typically lead to the fear of dropping or mishandling something.",
    "Analyzing the options, \"breaking\" doesn't fit as a complete thought in connection with his concern about drinking from the cup.",
    "\"Bend over\" also seems irrelevant since there is no indication of needing to bend over in this context of drinking.",
    "\"Let go of\" indicates the fear of losing grip on the cup while trying to drink, which is directly related to the shaking hands.",
    "\"Careful\" is more of a state of mind or behavior than an action that could finish the thought.",
    "\"Pick up\" doesn't align well with the context of his worry, as he is already setting the cup down, not picking it up.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting option based on his nervousness and the context of holding the cup is \"let go of.\""
