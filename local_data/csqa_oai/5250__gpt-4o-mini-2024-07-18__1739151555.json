  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"a walking stereotype\" suggests that the person embodies common characteristics associated with a particular type; this often relates to traits that are typically exaggerated in portrayals of certain groups.",
    "The mention of \"thick glasses\" is a common stereotype associated with intelligence or nerdiness, often implying that the person is studious or academically inclined.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, I need to find one that would complement the stereotype suggested by thick glasses.",
    "Choice A, \"sparse,\" doesn't relate well to the context; it doesn't imply any connection with intelligence or physical appearance linked to the stereotype.",
    "Choice B, \"slim,\" could describe a physical attribute, but it doesn\u2019t connect with the stereotype of an intelligent or studious person.",
    "Choice C, \"runny,\" would typically describe something fluid, like a liquid, and is unrelated to the context of personality or looks.",
    "Choice D, \"brainy,\" relates directly to intelligence and is a common description for someone who might wear thick glasses, reinforcing the stereotype of a studious person.",
    "Choice E, \"obesity,\" seems out of place when describing someone with thick glasses and does not align with the intelligent, nerdy stereotype.",
    "After evaluating all choices, the most suitable answer that aligns with the stereotype of someone with thick glasses is \"brainy,\" indicating intelligence."
