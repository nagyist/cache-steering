  "query": "Question: Little sarah didn't think that anyone should be kissing boys.  She thought that boys had what?\n\nChoices:\nA: arousal\nB: disease\nC: sweet\nD: halatosis\nE: cooties",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze Sarah's perspective towards boys. She expresses disapproval of kissing boys, indicating that she likely holds a negative view.",
    "Next, we consider the options provided. \"Arousal\" (A) relates to sexual feelings, which a young girl might not associate with boys in a derogatory way.",
    "\"Disease\" (B) implies a serious health condition, which seems too formal for a child's reasoning about kissing.",
    "\"Sweet\" (C) is a positive attribute and doesn't align with her negative perspective on kissing boys.",
    "\"Halitosis\" (D) refers to bad breath and is somewhat humorous, but unlikely to be the main concern for a child.",
    "\"Cooties\" (E) is a childish term used to express the idea that boys (or germs) are something to be avoided, particularly in the context of young girls fearing contact with boys.",
    "Given that Sarah's thoughts reflect a child's common belief in \"cooties\" as a way to express that boys are icky or undesirable, this aligns best with her view.",
    "We conclude that Sarah thinks that boys have something childish and negative associated with them, specifically the term \"cooties.\""
