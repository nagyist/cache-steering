  "query": "Question: Where would you visit a ticket booth before going on a ride?\n\nChoices:\nA: amusement park\nB: train station\nC: metro station\nD: fairgrounds\nE: museum",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the function of a ticket booth. A ticket booth is typically where you purchase tickets for entry or rides.",
    "Next, I will evaluate the context of where ticket booths are commonly found. Amusement parks and fairgrounds are known for their rides and attractions, which often require tickets purchased at a booth.",
    "Then, I will analyze the given options. \nOption A (amusement park) is a strong candidate since it typically has numerous rides that require tickets.",
    "Next, I consider option B (train station). Ticket booths here sell tickets for travel, not rides, so it\u2019s less relevant based on the context of the question.",
    "Next, option C (metro station) also primarily sells transit tickets and doesn\u2019t involve rides in a recreational sense.",
    "Now, I analyze option D (fairgrounds). Like amusement parks, they often have rides and require tickets, making it another strong contender.",
    "Finally, I review option E (museum). Museums typically have entry fees, but individual rides are not a feature, thus making it an unlikely choice.",
    "Comparing options A (amusement park) and D (fairgrounds), both fit the context of \u201crides\u201d but amusement parks are more commonly recognized for such ticket booths before riding."
