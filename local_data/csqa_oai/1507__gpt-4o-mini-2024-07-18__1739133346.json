  "query": "Question: If there are people watching a priest, what is he doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: on trial\nB: drink coffee\nC: believe in god\nD: baptise\nE: say mass",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of a priest and the activities commonly associated with them. Priests often conduct religious ceremonies and services.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. \"On trial\" (A) does not directly relate to typical priest activities when witnessed by people.",
    "Then, \"drink coffee\" (B) is also unlikely, as that is a casual activity not generally observed during a formal or religious situation.",
    "Now, look at \"believe in god\" (C). While many priests certainly do believe in God, this is more of a personal attribute than an observable action in the presence of an audience.",
    "Next, consider \"baptise\" (D). This is a common ceremony performed by priests that involves a group of witnesses, typically friends and family of the person being baptised.",
    "Finally, assess \"say mass\" (E). A mass is typically a communal service led by a priest, which would certainly attract an audience of congregants observing and participating.",
    "Between \"baptise\" and \"say mass,\" we need to determine which is more likely based on the singular action being observed. Baptisms are usually specific events, while saying mass is a broader, regular activity that's more likely to draw a larger audience over time.",
    "Given the context of watching in a potentially ongoing service, \"say mass\" (E) emerges as the most fitting and likely scenario when people are observing a priest."
