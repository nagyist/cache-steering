  "query": "Question: Where do most people keep utensils?\n\nChoices:\nA: backpack\nB: cupboard\nC: plate\nD: drawer\nE: dinner",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is typically considered a \"utensil.\" Utensils usually refer to items like forks, knives, spoons, and sometimes cooking tools.",
    "Next, think about where these utensils are commonly stored in a home setting.",
    "Utensils are generally used in the kitchen, so we should focus on kitchen storage options.",
    "Option A, \"backpack,\" is generally used for carrying books and personal items, not for storing kitchen utensils.",
    "Option B, \"cupboard,\" is a common storage location for dishes and food items, and sometimes utensils.",
    "However, option D, \"drawer,\" is specifically designed for storing utensils, making it a more likely option.",
    "Consider option C, \"plate.\" Plates are used for serving food, not for storing utensils.",
    "Option E, \"dinner,\" seems to refer to a time or event where utensils are used but does not imply a location for them.",
    "Comparing options B and D, while both may store utensils, a drawer is the more typical and specific storage area for utensils.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer for the question of where most people keep utensils is \"drawer.\""
