  "query": "Question: I went to eat in a restaurant, but I left because the person at the front wasn't what?\n\nChoices:\nA: drinking wine\nB: make reservations\nC: polite\nD: spit on me\nE: prepared to pay",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a situation where the speaker left the restaurant due to the behavior of the person at the front.",
    "The key word in the question is \"wasn't,\" indicating a negative quality or characteristic about the person at the front.",
    "Let\u2019s analyze each of the choices to see if they fit the context of why someone would leave a restaurant: \nChoice A: \"drinking wine\" - This is not a reason someone would leave a restaurant; it seems unrelated to service.",
    "Choice B: \"make reservations\" - This is impractical since whether someone else has made reservations typically would not cause you to leave; rather, it might just affect seating.",
    "Choice C: \"polite\" - If the person at the front was not polite, it would be a valid reason for the speaker to leave the restaurant since rudeness can be unwelcoming.",
    "Choice D: \"spit on me\" - This is a severe violation of personal space and would certainly cause someone to leave, but it seems overly dramatic compared to common dining experiences.",
    "Choice E: \"prepared to pay\" - This seems unrelated to the quality of service from the person at the front; one would not leave solely based on someone else's payment method.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"C: polite\" fits well as a reasonable motive for someone to leave due to poor service."
