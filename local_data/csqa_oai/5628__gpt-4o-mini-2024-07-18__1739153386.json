  "query": "Question: When starting a fire near oxygen what can happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: warmth\nB: chaos\nC: unpredictable\nD: disaster\nE: explosion",
  "steps": [
    "Starting a fire requires oxygen, which is a key element in the combustion process.",
    "Without enough oxygen, a fire cannot sustain itself; thus, having oxygen present is necessary for fire to start and maintain.",
    "If a fire is started in an environment that has an abundant supply of oxygen, it can become more intense and spread more rapidly.",
    "The presence of high levels of oxygen can significantly increase the rate of combustion, making the fire burn hotter and faster.",
    "In extreme cases, especially in confined spaces or when flammable gases are involved, a fire fueled by a high concentration of oxygen can lead to explosive situations.",
    "The outcomes of a fire in an oxygen-rich environment can vary depending on several factors such as the materials being burned and the containment of the fire.",
    "However, the most severe consequence of a fire in the presence of oxygen is the potential for an explosion or rapid fire spread in certain conditions.",
    "Considering explosive reactions typically occur in high oxygen environments during a fire, this option aligns with the potential dangers.",
    "Evaluating the other options, while they can describe some outcomes, they do not encapsulate the most severe risk related to oxygen and fire combination.",
    "Therefore, the most fitting answer that reflects a serious result of a fire near oxygen is explosion."
