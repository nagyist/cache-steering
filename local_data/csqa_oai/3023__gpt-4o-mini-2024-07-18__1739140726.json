  "query": "Question: The crab was known to use camouflage to wait for a fish to get within reach, when it was hungry it would set up shop where?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean's eleven\nB: ocean floor\nC: downtown area\nD: high school\nE: container",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the crab uses camouflage, suggesting it waits stealthily for its prey, which is a typical behavior of certain types of crabs in their natural habitat.",
    "To determine where it would \"set up shop,\" we need to consider the natural environment of crabs and where they typically hunt for food.",
    "Options like \"ocean's eleven,\" \"downtown area,\" \"high school,\" and \"container\" do not fit the natural habitat or behavior of crabs.",
    "The most relevant choice that reflects the natural setting of a crab is \"ocean floor,\" as crabs are usually found at the bottom of the ocean where they can hide and wait for fish.",
    "So, the only sensible answer that aligns with the crab's behavior and environment is the \"ocean floor.\""
