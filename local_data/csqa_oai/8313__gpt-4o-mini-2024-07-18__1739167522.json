  "query": "Question: John wanted to hunt blowfish, but he didn't want to leave America.  Where might he search?\n\nChoices:\nA: tropical sea\nB: south pacific ocean\nC: hawaiian waters\nD: sushi store\nE: fish market",
  "steps": [
    "John is interested in hunting blowfish, which are typically found in warm, tropical waters. Therefore, locations that fit this description are significant to consider.",
    "Since he doesn't want to leave America, I should examine options that pertain to U.S. territories or regions where blowfish may be present.",
    "The tropical sea generally refers to areas like the Caribbean or other tropical environments, which might not necessarily be part of the United States.",
    "The South Pacific Ocean, while it contains suitable habitats for blowfish, lies outside of U.S. jurisdiction; hence, this option is also less relevant for John's criteria.",
    "Hawaiian waters are part of the U.S. and are known for their tropical climate and diverse marine life, including blowfish. This option is promising for John's hunting aspirations.",
    "A sushi store and a fish market might provide access to blowfish for purchase, but they don't serve as hunting locations. Therefore, they don\u2019t meet John's desire to hunt.",
    "Evaluating all the options, Hawaiian waters (Option C) offers a realistic environment for John to explore, fulfilling both his desire to remain within the U.S. and his interest in hunting blowfish."
