  "query": "Question: What do all rooms facing outside have?\n\nChoices:\nA: square shape\nB: different sizes\nC: flowers\nD: doors and windows\nE: high walls",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the concept of rooms that are facing outside. These are typically spaces in a building that have exposure to the outside environment.",
    "Next, evaluate what characteristics are commonly associated with rooms that have outside exposure. They are likely to have features that allow for light and air to enter.",
    "Look at the choice of \"square shape.\" While some rooms can be square, not all rooms facing outside have to be of a specific shape. This is not a universal characteristic.",
    "Now, examine \"different sizes.\" Rooms facing outside can indeed come in various sizes, but this is not exclusive to outside-facing rooms\u2014rooms in general can be of different sizes.",
    "Consider the choice \"flowers.\" While some outside-facing rooms may have flowers, this is not a requirement or characteristic of all such rooms.",
    "Next, analyze the option \"doors and windows.\" Rooms that face outside will typically have doors and/or windows to allow access and light from the outside.",
    "Evaluate the option \"high walls.\" There is no inherent requirement for rooms facing outside to have high walls; wall height can vary independent of the room's orientation.",
    "Based on the above analysis, the characteristic that all rooms facing outside are likely to have is doors and windows, which are necessary for accessing the outside environment."
