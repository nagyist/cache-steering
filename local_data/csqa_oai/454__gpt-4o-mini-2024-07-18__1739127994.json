  "query": "Question: Where do almost all people live?\n\nChoices:\nA: football stadium\nB: apartment\nC: surface of earth\nD: car show\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify where the majority of the world's population resides.",
    "I consider the context of urban and rural living arrangements.",
    "Most people live within human-made structures, typically in urban environments like cities, towns, and villages.",
    "I analyze the options given: A (football stadium) is not a residential location, B (apartment) is a type of residence but not the sole type, C (surface of earth) encompasses all land, D (car show) is an event location, and E (house) represents another residential option.",
    "Among the options, C (surface of earth) stands out as the most comprehensive since it includes all areas where people can live, regardless of the type of dwelling.",
    "I recognize that almost all people occupy some part of the surface of the Earth since it includes everything from rural areas to urban centers.",
    "While B (apartment) and E (house) are common types of residences, they do not encompass the totality of where people live.",
    "Thus, C (surface of earth) is not only a living space but the foundational ground for all residential forms.",
    "I conclude that the best answer in this context is option C, as it accurately represents where almost all people live without needing to specify the type of dwelling."
