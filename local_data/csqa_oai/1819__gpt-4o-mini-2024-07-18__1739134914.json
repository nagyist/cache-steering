  "query": "Question: where would a good newspaper boy put a paper in the rain?\n\nChoices:\nA: library\nB: lawn\nC: trash\nD: roof\nE: front door",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where the newspaper boy typically delivers papers.",
    "Usually, a good newspaper boy aims to deliver the paper to a location where it is accessible to the homeowner.",
    "In the rain, the paper should be placed in a way that protects it from getting wet.",
    "A roof might not be the ideal place, as accessing it could be unsafe, and the paper could blow away.",
    "The library is a public place and generally wouldn\u2019t be the intended delivery location for a residential paper.",
    "Placing the paper on the lawn would expose it directly to the rain, likely making it soggy.",
    "Putting it in the trash would prevent the homeowner from receiving it, which is not ideal for a newspaper delivery.",
    "The front door, however, is a common and acceptable spot for delivering newspapers.",
    "Delivering the paper to the front door would also provide the best protection from the rain compared to other options.",
    "Thus, the best answer among the choices provided is the front door."
