  "query": "Question: Where do employees spend most of their time working?\n\nChoices:\nA: toilet\nB: corporation\nC: office\nD: meeting\nE: company",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where employees spend most of their time working. It is important to identify environments where work-related activities occur.",
    "The options provided include various locations that could be associated with work: toilet, corporation, office, meeting, and company.",
    "The option \"toilet\" (A) is generally not a place where employees work and is usually just a brief stop. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.",
    "The option \"corporation\" (B) refers to a type of organization rather than a specific location. Employees may work in a corporate setting, but this choice does not directly identify a physical place where they spend their time.",
    "The option \"meeting\" (D) indicates a time-limited event where employees might discuss work matters, but it is not a general place where they spend most of their time. This option can also be eliminated.",
    "The option \"company\" (E) also refers to an organization as a whole and is not a specific location where employees work daily.",
    "The option \"office\" (C) refers to a physical workspace where employees typically perform their daily tasks, collaborate, and spend a significant part of their work hours.",
    "Comparing the viable options, \"office\" is the most accurate representation of where employees spend most of their time working, as it is a specific, defined area dedicated to work activities.",
    "After evaluating all options, it is clear that \"office\" (C) is the correct answer, as it best fits the context of the question."
