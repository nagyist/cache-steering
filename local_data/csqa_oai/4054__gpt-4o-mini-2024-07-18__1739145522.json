  "query": "Question: You'd want marine grade steel cable aboard your what?\n\nChoices:\nA: winch\nB: ship\nC: ground\nD: construction site\nE: suspension bridge",
  "steps": [
    "Marine grade steel cable is designed to withstand harsh marine environments, including saltwater, which can cause corrosion in standard steel cables.",
    "A winch is a mechanical device used for lifting or pulling heavy loads, often used in various applications, including marine settings. Therefore, it may require marine-grade materials if it's used on a boat or ship.",
    "A ship operates in marine environments, making it essential to use materials that can resist corrosion from saltwater. Thus, having marine grade steel cables aboard a ship is crucial for safety and durability.",
    "The ground does not require marine grade steel cable as there is no exposure to marine conditions. Standard materials can be used more effectively in ground applications.",
    "At a construction site, it's typical to use general steel cables which are not exposed to marine conditions unless specifically building something meant for marine use, such as a dock or pier.",
    "When considering a suspension bridge, while marine grade steel has its uses, most bridges are not directly exposed to marine environments unless they are over water. Projects might use corrosion-resistant materials, but the term 'marine grade' specifically applies less directly.",
    "In conclusion, the most logical application for marine grade steel cable, considering the exceptionally harsh conditions, is aboard a vessel that operates in marine environments."
