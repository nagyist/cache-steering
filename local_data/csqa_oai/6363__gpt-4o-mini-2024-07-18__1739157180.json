  "steps": [
    "The problem states that Bob lost his sunglasses and is looking for new ones quickly.",
    "To get new sunglasses quickly, convenience and availability are essential factors to consider.",
    "One option is a department store; they generally have a variety of sunglasses, but it may take some time to get there and find them.",
    "Another possibility is a drugstore, which often carries basic sunglasses and might be closer than a department store.",
    "The bag is unlikely as Bob has already looked everywhere for his sunglasses, meaning that it is improbable they are in his bag.",
    "The glove compartment of a car could potentially hold a spare pair of sunglasses, but that would depend on whether Bob keeps a spare there.",
    "The shirt pocket is also unlikely for keeping sunglasses as it is usually too small and impractical for that purpose.",
    "Given the options, the drugstore and the department store are likely candidates for quick acquisition of new sunglasses.",
    "Since the drugstore is typically more accessible and likely to have sunglasses in stock without needing much searching, it stands out as the quickest option."
