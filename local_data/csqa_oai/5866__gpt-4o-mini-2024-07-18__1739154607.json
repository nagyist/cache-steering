  "query": "Question: If the though of performing makes you anxious what do you suffer from?\n\nChoices:\nA: being appreciated\nB: get attention\nC: terror\nD: stage fright\nE: fear",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the thought of performing makes someone anxious. This indicates an emotional response to the idea of performing in front of others.",
    "Anxiety in the context of performance is a common reaction and is often associated with specific situations like public speaking or performing arts.",
    "Among the given choices, we need to identify which one best aligns with the anxiety related to performing.",
    "Choice A (\"being appreciated\") does not fit because it implies a positive response rather than anxiety.",
    "Choice B (\"get attention\") similarly does not match because while getting attention can be anxiety-inducing, it is not specifically about the performance aspect.",
    "Choice C (\"terror\") suggests a high level of fear, but it\u2019s too broad and does not specifically relate to performing.",
    "Choice D (\"stage fright\") is a term specifically used to describe anxiety or panic experienced by performers in front of an audience.",
    "Choice E (\"fear\") is a general term and doesn't capture the specific anxiety related to performing.",
    "Therefore, the most precise and fitting answer that describes anxiety specifically related to performing is \"stage fright.\""
