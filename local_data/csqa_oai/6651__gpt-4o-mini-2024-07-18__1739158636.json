  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where a child's work would typically be displayed on the wall.",
    "Children often create art projects, drawings, and other forms of work that parents or teachers display.",
    "The most common place to display a child's artwork in a public or educational setting is in a classroom.",
    "While a labyrinth could be creative, it is not a standard place for displaying work.",
    "\"China\" does not relate to the context of displaying art.",
    "An \"art show\" is a possibility where children's work could be displayed, but it is less common than regular classroom displays.",
    "The \"corner\" is a location but not particularly relevant to the context of display; it can refer to an area, not a showcase for work.",
    "Considering the options, \"classroom\" stands out as the most fitting place for displaying child-created artwork."
