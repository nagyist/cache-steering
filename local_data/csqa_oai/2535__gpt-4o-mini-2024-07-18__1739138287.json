  "query": "Question: What do you have to pay when you are getting paid?\n\nChoices:\nA: paying bills\nB: you have to pay your debts\nC: satisfaction\nD: income tax\nE: sorrow",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what you have to pay when you are getting paid, which implies a financial obligation associated with receiving income.",
    "Choice D, \"income tax,\" is a common obligation that individuals must fulfill when they receive a salary or wages. This must be paid to the government.",
    "Choice A, \"paying bills,\" is a general obligation that may occur after receiving income but is not a direct requirement linked to the act of getting paid.",
    "Choice B, \"you have to pay your debts,\" may be true for some, but it is not universally applicable to everyone who receives payment.",
    "Choice C, \"satisfaction,\" does not represent a financial obligation and is subjective in nature.",
    "Choice E, \"sorrow,\" is an emotion and not a payment in any financial context.",
    "From the reasoning above, while there are several obligations one might have after getting paid, the one that is directly linked and widely applicable is the need to pay income tax."
