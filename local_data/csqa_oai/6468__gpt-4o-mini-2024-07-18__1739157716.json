  "query": "Question: The ticket booth informed riders that the train was running late, so where was the ticket booth located?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie theatre\nB: sports arena\nC: school\nD: metro station\nE: auditorium",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the location of the ticket booth, I need to analyze the context in which the ticket booth operates. The mention of a train suggests it is related to transportation.",
    "I will review each option to see which location would typically have a ticket booth for trains.",
    "Option A (movie theatre) typically has ticket booths for films, not for train services.",
    "Option B (sports arena) may have ticket booths for sports events, but it does not usually deal with train services.",
    "Option C (school) does not usually have ticket booths associated with train services.",
    "Option D (metro station) is a location primarily associated with train services, and it commonly has ticket booths for purchasing tickets or obtaining information about train schedules.",
    "Option E (auditorium) is similar to a movie theatre and would typically be associated with events rather than train services.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only option where a ticket booth for train services is most likely to be found is in the metro station."
