  "steps": [
    "The question states that Bobby found the lamp beside him when he got up. This implies he was in a location where the lamp was easily accessible and in close proximity.",
    "Considering the options provided, a lamp being \"beside\" someone suggests a personal or familiar space rather than a public or irrelevant one.",
    "Out of the given choices, both \"house\" and \"bedroom\" are personal spaces where one might find a lamp.",
    "A lamp wouldn't typically be found in a \"store\" as it wouldn't be right \"beside\" a customer in that context.",
    "An \"ocean\" is highly unlikely to have a lamp in close proximity as it is a body of water and not a living or functional space for an object like a lamp.",
    "The term \"building\" is too generic and does not specifically indicate a place where a lamp might be found beside someone.",
    "Given that Bobby got up, it is reasonable to infer he was in a \"bedroom,\" as people usually wake up in their bedrooms.",
    "The \"house\" option is also plausible, but it encompasses all rooms within it, while the \"bedroom\" specifies the most likely location where one would find a lamp close by when waking up.",
    "After considering all options, \"bedroom\" best fits the context of finding a lamp \"beside\" someone immediately upon waking."
