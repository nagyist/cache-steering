  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what the question is asking. It mentions having \"a tiny calculator\" at a time when it was considered cutting edge.",
    "Next, I need to consider what devices or items traditionally had calculators incorporated into them prior to the rise of smartphones.",
    "Looking at the options, I can eliminate \"mobile phone,\" \"office,\" and \"desktop\" right away. Mobile phones were not as common for calculators at that time, offices typically used larger computing devices, and desktops were not portable.",
    "That leaves me with \"wristwatch\" and \"briefcase.\" While calculators did exist in other formats, such as pocket size, I need to see which one is more commonly associated historically with being cutting edge.",
    "Calculators in wristwatches were a notable invention and became popular in the 1970s and 1980s. It was a novel idea to have a calculator on your wrist, making it portable.",
    "Although calculators could also be found in briefcases as separate devices or certain models integrated into tools, they were not as groundbreaking as the wristwatch.",
    "Considering the phrasing of the question\u2014\"cutting edge\"\u2014the wristwatch with a tiny calculator fits this description much better than a briefcase.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer that matches both the description of having a tiny calculator and being considered cutting edge would be the wristwatch."
