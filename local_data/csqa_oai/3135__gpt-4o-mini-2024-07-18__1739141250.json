  "query": "Question: James imported ugly cabinets because they were cheap.  They wouldn't be seen so it didn't matter what they looked like.  Where might they be installed?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: planes\nC: mexico\nD: bathroom\nE: pantry",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence mentions that the cabinets are ugly, and their appearance is not a concern because they wouldn't be seen. This suggests they are placed in a location where aesthetics are not important.",
    "A kitchen generally has cabinets that are visible and often serve as an important aspect of the overall decor. Therefore, it is less likely that the cabinets would be placed here because their appearance would matter.",
    "The option \"planes\" is unusual for cabinet installation. It is unlikely that cabinets, especially ugly ones, would be added in an aircraft context.",
    "Mexico, as a location, does not inherently suggest a specific purpose or function for the cabinets, making it an unlikely answer.",
    "Bathrooms often have cabinets or storage solutions, but because they are usually designed with a focus on aesthetics (like cabinetry appearing elegant), this does not match the context of them being ugly and not seen.",
    "A pantry, however, is typically a space for storage where the cabinets would not necessarily be seen by guests and where functionality is prioritized over aesthetics.",
    "Thus, the pantry seems to be the most reasonable and appropriate context to install ugly cabinets since they would fit the requirement of being functional without being visible."
