  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that someone wants to memorialize their favorite horse permanently.",
    "Typically, memorialization involves creating a lasting tribute or representation, such as a monument, statue, or some form of artwork.",
    "The options provided are either places (A, B, D) or items (C, E).",
    "New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Canada (options A, B, D) are locations and would not directly relate to memorializing a horse, unless it were in reference to a location of a memorial, which seems unlikely.",
    "The option 'hay' (E) does not make sense in the context of memorializing a horse as it is not a lasting tribute but rather a form of food.",
    "The only remaining option is 'engraving' (C), which is a method that could be used to create a permanent inscription or image as a tribute.",
    "Engraving can be done on various materials, like stone, metal, or wood, making it a suitable choice for memorialization.",
    "Given that memorialization typically requires something lasting and represents the essence of what is being memorialized, engraving is a reasonable conclusion.",
    "Based on the elimination of other options and logical reasoning, engraving is the most fitting answer."
