  "query": "Question: On what would you use a knob to change settings?\n\nChoices:\nA: opening doors\nB: control panel\nC: a cellphone\nD: television\nE: doorway",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a knob typically controls. Knobs are commonly used to adjust settings or preferences on devices.",
    "Next, consider the options provided. \"A: opening doors\" refers to a door handle, which may not necessarily be classified as a knob used for changing settings.",
    "Option \"B: control panel\" suggests a device where knobs are often used to modify settings, such as temperature, volume, or modes.",
    "Now look at option \"C: a cellphone\". Cellphones typically use touchscreens and buttons rather than physical knobs for settings adjustment.",
    "Examine option \"D: television\". While some older TVs may have knobs for changing channels or volume, modern TVs primarily use remote controls, touchscreen, or buttons rather than knobs.",
    "Lastly, consider option \"E: doorway\", which refers again to the entryway rather than an adjustable setting.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer for the question of a knob being used to change settings is \"B: control panel\", as it typically includes knobs designed for adjustments."
