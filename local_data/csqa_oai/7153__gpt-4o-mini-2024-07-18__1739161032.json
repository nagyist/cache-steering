  "query": "Question: He just needed a few things from the shopping center, but he could hardly get down an aisle it was so packed with what?\n\nChoices:\nA: urban area\nB: children\nC: people\nD: stores\nE: suburbs",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the sentence. The sentence refers to someone trying to navigate through a shopping center that is very crowded.",
    "Consider what might cause a shopping center to be \"packed.\" Typically, a busy shopping center would have numerous visitors.",
    "Evaluate each choice for plausibility: \n- A: urban area \u2014 this does not directly relate to what is in the aisles.\n- B: children \u2014 while children can be present, they are not the predominant cause of crowds in a shopping center.\n- C: people \u2014 this is a broad term that can encompass all shoppers and is likely the most accurate.\n- D: stores \u2014 stores occupy space but do not constitute the crowd itself.\n- E: suburbs \u2014 this refers to a type of geographical area and does not indicate crowds.",
    "The best fit based on urgency and common scenarios in shopping centers points directly to a high volume of shoppers.",
    "Cross-check: it makes logical sense to say \"packed with people\" rather than any of the other options."
