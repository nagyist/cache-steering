  "query": "Question: Before getting a divorce, what did the wife feel who was doing all the work?\n\nChoices:\nA: harder\nB: anguish\nC: bitterness\nD: tears\nE: sadness",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the emotional state of the wife who is doing all the work before a divorce.",
    "Typically, a person who feels they are bearing the burden of a relationship may experience negative emotions due to the perceived unfairness or imbalance in effort.",
    "The term \"anguish\" (choice B) suggests deep emotional pain, which might be a possible feeling she experienced due to feeling unsupported.",
    "\"Bitterness\" (choice C) implies a feeling of resentment about the situation, which is also a likely reaction for someone who feels overburdened.",
    "While \"tears\" (choice D) indicate sadness, they do not encapsulate a broader emotional state effectively, as tears are often a symptom rather than a standalone emotion.",
    "\"Sadness\" (choice E) is a decent candidate since it reflects a general feeling of unhappiness, but it may not fully capture the complexity of her emotions in this context.",
    "Comparing \"bitterness\" and \"anguish,\" I believe bitterness might resonate more with a feeling of having been treated unfairly and left to do the work alone.",
    "Thus, among the options, \"bitterness\" captures the essence of her feelings before the divorce more accurately than the others."
