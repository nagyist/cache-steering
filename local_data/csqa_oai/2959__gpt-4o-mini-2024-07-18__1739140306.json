  "steps": [
    "The question states that John refused to sleep because of Freddy, indicating a reason related to fear or anxiety.",
    "The phrase \"Nothing can hurt you\" suggests a condition under which an individual feels safe or secure.",
    "We need to identify a phrase that implies a state of safety that could be related to staying awake or being alert.",
    "Among the answer choices, options like \"being awake\" and \"stay awake\" seem to convey a similar meaning of not succumbing to sleep.",
    "\"Wakefulness\" is a noun that represents the state of being awake, while \"entertainment\" and \"vacuuming\" do not relate directly to avoiding harm.",
    "Now, let's evaluate which of the options directly conveys that you are safe while being awake or alert.",
    "\"Stay awake\" (Choice D) and \"wakefulness\" (Choice C) both imply an active effort to remain alert and not sleep.",
    "However, \"stay awake\" explicitly suggests an action taken to avoid sleep, which can be seen as directly related to the question regarding safety and harm.",
    "In contrast, \"wakefulness\" is more passive and doesn't convey the action aspect.",
    "Between the two relevant choices of D (stay awake) and C (wakefulness), \"stay awake\" is the more appropriate choice based on the context given."
