  "query": "Question: Most animals get tired, and when they do they what?\n\nChoices:\nA: bite\nB: groom\nC: procreate\nD: keep alive\nE: lie down",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general behavior of most animals when they are tired. Animals typically need rest to recover energy.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices given. \"Bite\" (A) and \"procreate\" (C) are actions that do not align with what animals typically do when they are tired.",
    "\"Keep alive\" (D) is a vague statement and does not specifically describe an action taken by animals when they are tired.",
    "\"Groom\" (B) can be an action that some animals take, but it is not a primary response to tiredness.",
    "\"Lie down\" (E) is a common and straightforward response for many animals when they become fatigued.",
    "Therefore, the choice that best represents the typical behavior of most animals when they are tired is to lie down."
