  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that the trend is surprising or unexpected, as she found it \"quite odd.\"",
    "I need to determine which of the answer choices fits best with the idea of a trend that is \"new\" and also seems odd.",
    "The phrase \"the new\" suggests something that has recently become common or prevalent in some way.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"common\" (B) and \"normal\" (D) both suggest something that is typically accepted or usual.",
    "Among those options, \"regular\" (C) also implies something that is occurring with a consistent frequency, which could relate to a trend.",
    "However, the phrase \"thing to do\" (E) rather suggests a practice or behavior rather than a direct descriptor of the trend itself.",
    "I need to weigh the implications of each of these options: \"common\" could imply widespread acceptance, while \"normal\" might suggest that it fits within expected norms, despite being seen as odd by the individual.",
    "Upon further consideration, \"normal\" feels more closely aligned with the idea of a trend becoming standard practice over time.",
    "Reflecting on the overall tone of the sentence, it appears that she finds the trend odd, but recognizes it as something that is becoming typical or accepted in society.",
    "Hence, \"normal\" (D) encapsulates the dichotomy of the trend being both strange to her yet also something that is growing increasingly ordinary."
