  "steps": [
    "A viola is a string instrument, typically part of ensembles that include other string or orchestral instruments.",
    "A string quartet consists of four instruments typically: two violins, a viola, and a cello.",
    "A string quintet consists of five instruments, which could include a viola along with other strings, but it has more than three additional instruments.",
    "A symphony generally involves a full orchestral setup which would certainly include a viola, but it doesn't specify a limitation on the number of instruments.",
    "An orchestra is a larger ensemble that includes string instruments like the viola, and thus it does meet the criteria but again does not limit the number of instruments.",
    "The option \u201cviola case\u201d is irrelevant as it does not refer to a musical context or an ensemble.",
    "Among these choices, the string quartet is the only option that specifically mentions a viola along with exactly three other instruments (the two violins and the cello).",
    "Both the symphony and orchestra options include the viola but do not satisfy the requirement of having only three other instruments specifically listed alongside it."
