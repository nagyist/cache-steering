  "query": "Question: What do waitresses refill?\n\nChoices:\nA: ball stopped\nB: coffee shop\nC: stationery shop\nD: cup\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the role of a waitress. A waitress serves food and drinks to customers.",
    "Next, think about what items a waitress would commonly need to refill during service.",
    "Drinks are a significant part of what waitresses handle; they often refill beverages for patrons.",
    "Among common beverages served in restaurants, cups filled with water, coffee, or soft drinks are typically refilled.",
    "Now, let's examine the answer choices to check which option is related to the refilling activity of a waitress.",
    "Choice A: \"ball stopped\" does not relate to anything a waitress would manage.",
    "Choice B: \"coffee shop\" is a type of establishment but not something a waitress refills directly.",
    "Choice C: \"stationery shop\" is unrelated to the role of a waitress.",
    "Choice D: \"cup\" is relevant since it can contain drinks that waitresses refill.",
    "Finally, choice E: \"restaurant\" is a place where waitresses work, but it is not something that gets directly refilled."
