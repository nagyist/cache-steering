  "query": "Question: What do two people know to be talking to each other effectively?\n\nChoices:\nA: opening one's mouth\nB: listening\nC: translator\nD: voice\nE: language",
  "steps": [
    "In order to communicate effectively, the parties involved must share a common medium for understanding.",
    "Opening one's mouth (Choice A) is a physical action but does not guarantee effective communication if the other person cannot understand what is being said.",
    "Listening (Choice B) is an important part of communication, but by itself does not ensure that a conversation is effective, since it does not account for speaking or conveying information.",
    "A translator (Choice C) can facilitate communication between parties who do not share a common language, but the presence of a translator is not a requirement for two people who are already communicating effectively.",
    "Voice (Choice D) is necessary for verbal communication but does not encompass the entire process of effective communication, which involves understanding as well.",
    "Language (Choice E) is a structured system of communication that includes words and grammar, enabling two people to understand each other effectively.",
    "Since effective communication relies on a shared understanding of language, this means that language is essential for communication rather than just a single act or tool.",
    "Considering all options, the best choice that encapsulates what two people need to know for effective communication is language."
