  "query": "Question: A business on the 110th floor is in what kind of structure?\n\nChoices:\nA: skyscraper\nB: big city\nC: park\nD: nonprofit\nE: office building",
  "steps": [
    "The business is located on the 110th floor, which suggests it is situated at a high elevation.",
    "Typically, structures that have many floors, especially over 10, are referred to as tall buildings or skyscrapers.",
    "The term \"skyscraper\" generally describes buildings that are more than 150 meters (approximately 490 feet) tall and have multiple stories.",
    "Given that the 110th floor implies a significant height, it is likely that the building qualifies as a skyscraper.",
    "The term \"big city\" is broader and does not specify a particular type of structure.",
    "Similarly, \"park\" and \"nonprofit\" do not relate to a specific physical structure type for businesses.",
    "\"Office building\" could describe the structure, but it does not capture the scale and height implicit in being on the 110th floor.",
    "Therefore, among the given choices, \"skyscraper\" is the most accurate description of a building with a business on the 110th floor."
