  "query": "Question: Where can you buy grapes directly from their growers?\n\nChoices:\nA: grocery cart\nB: kitchen\nC: fridge\nD: fruit market\nE: super market",
  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, we need to determine where one can buy grapes directly from their growers.",
    "A grocery cart is a tool used for shopping and doesn't itself sell grapes. So this choice is not valid.",
    "A kitchen is a place where food is prepared and stored, not a location to buy grapes. This option is also invalid.",
    "A fridge is an appliance for storing food, including grapes, but it does not sell them either. So this choice is not valid.",
    "A fruit market typically consists of vendors who sell fruits, including grapes, often sourced directly from local growers. This option is valid.",
    "A supermarket may sell grapes but typically sources them from distributors rather than directly from growers, making it less likely for someone to buy directly from the growers. This option is less valid compared to the fruit market.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most appropriate option for buying grapes directly from growers is the fruit market."
