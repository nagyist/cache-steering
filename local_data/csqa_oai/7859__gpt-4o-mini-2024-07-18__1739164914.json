    "First, we need to identify the context of the question, which involves eating a roast beef sandwich and spilling a sauce on a piece of furniture.",
    "Next, we consider which options provided relate to the type of sauce that is commonly associated with roast beef sandwiches.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"horseradish\" is a well-known spicy condiment that is often served with roast beef.",
    "Now let's evaluate the other options: \"texas\" doesn't refer to a sauce, \"guest room\" and \"living room\" are locations, and \"basement\" is also a location.",
