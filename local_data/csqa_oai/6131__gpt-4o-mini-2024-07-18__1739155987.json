  "query": "Question: What area are theaters typically located?\n\nChoices:\nA: shopping mall\nB: downtown area\nC: in buildings\nD: new york city\nE: populated area",
  "steps": [
    "Theaters are places where performances, movies, or other forms of entertainment are shown.",
    "To serve their purpose effectively, theaters need to be accessible to a large audience.",
    "This accessibility often requires theaters to be located in areas with high foot traffic or population density.",
    "Shopping malls often attract a lot of visitors, making them a potential location for theaters.",
    "Downtown areas usually have a concentration of businesses, restaurants, and cultural attractions, which can draw people to theaters.",
    "The option \"in buildings\" is broader and could apply to any structure, but it does not specify a location where theaters are typically found.",
    "New York City is a specific location known for its theaters, but not all theaters are located in NYC.",
    "The option \"populated area\" is relevant since theaters are often in areas with a significant number of people, contributing to their foot traffic.",
    "Comparing the potential options, both \"downtown area\" and \"populated area\" are strong candidates among the choices presented.",
    "However, \"populated area\" is more general and applies to many locations, while \"downtown area\" is specific to certain urban environments where theaters are commonly found."
