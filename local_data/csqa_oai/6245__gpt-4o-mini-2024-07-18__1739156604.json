  "query": "Question: Where might someone leave their baggage on a platform?\n\nChoices:\nA: customs\nB: train station\nC: airport carousel\nD: cruise ship\nE: airports",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the term \"baggage.\" Baggage typically refers to luggage or bags that travelers carry with them.",
    "Next, consider the context in which baggage might be left on a platform. A platform suggests a place where passengers embark or disembark from transportation.",
    "Think about where platforms are commonly found. Train stations and airports both feature platforms where passengers wait, either for boarding or disembarking.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices. Option A (customs) is not related to a platform where baggage is left; customs is the area where passengers declare goods upon entry into a country.",
    "Option B (train station) seems plausible, as it has platforms where passengers can leave their luggage temporarily while they wait for their train or while they go attend to other matters.",
    "Consider Option C (airport carousel), which refers specifically to an area where luggage arrives after a flight, not a platform where luggage can be left.",
    "Option D (cruise ship) refers to boarding a ship, which might not have a defined platform in the same way as stations do for trains or planes. It\u2019s less likely that baggage would just be left there.",
    "Evaluate Option E (airports). Airports have drop-off areas and baggage reclaim areas, but the term \"platform\" is less associated with them than with train stations.",
    "Among the choices, the train station is the most fitting for a \"platform\" where someone might leave their baggage temporarily."
