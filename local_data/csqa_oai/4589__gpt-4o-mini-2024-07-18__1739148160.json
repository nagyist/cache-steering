  "query": "Question: When musicians give exceptional performances you've seen a great what?\n\nChoices:\nA: band\nB: opera\nC: show\nD: fine tune instruments\nE: ball",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question. The phrase \"exceptional performances\" suggests a high level of artistic or entertainment quality.",
    "Consider the choices given. They should relate to an outstanding musical event. \"Band\" and \"opera\" can refer to specific kinds, while \"show\" is more general.",
    "Evaluate the choice \"A: band\". While bands can perform exceptionally, the term does not capture the breadth of performances possible in various genres.",
    "Examine choice \"B: opera\". This is specific to a musical theater form, which might not encompass all exceptional performances as musicians can perform in various settings.",
    "Consider choice \"C: show\". This term is broad and encompasses any sort of performance, including concerts, musicals, and more, which fits the context of exceptional musicianship.",
    "Analyze choice \"D: fine tune instruments\". This process is related to preparation rather than the performance itself, so it doesn't match the context of the question.",
    "Look at choice \"E: ball\". While a ball can involve music, it does not specifically relate to exceptional musical performances like concerts or shows do.",
    "Based on the above evaluations, \"show\" becomes the most suitable answer as it captures the essence of exceptional performances across multiple musical forms."
