  "query": "Question: If you hit a person with a stick, it is likely that they will do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: own object\nB: suffer pain\nC: hit you back\nD: turn blue\nE: thank god",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the action of hitting a person with a stick. Hitting someone typically causes physical harm.",
    "Next, we consider the potential reactions of a person who has just been struck. The most immediate and common reaction to being hit is experiencing pain.",
    "While there could be various responses to being hit, such as retaliating (option C) or experiencing other emotions, the physical response of pain is almost universally applicable.",
    "Now let's briefly evaluate the other options: \n- Option A (own object) does not directly relate to the action of being hit.\n- Option C (hit you back) is a possibility, but it is not guaranteed that the person would retaliate.\n- Option D (turn blue) is not a common reaction to being struck.\n- Option E (thank god) is unlikely, as most people do not feel gratitude when they are assaulted.",
    "Based on the analysis, the most probable response to being hit is suffering pain, which directly correlates to the nature of physical harm inflicted by the action."
