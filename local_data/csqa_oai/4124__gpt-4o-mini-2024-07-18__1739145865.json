  "query": "Question: I need to store my honey, where should it go?\n\nChoices:\nA: stick to fingers\nB: jar\nC: farmer's market\nD: beehive\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the properties of honey. Honey is a liquid and can be stored without spoiling for a long time if kept properly.",
    "Next, determine the most suitable storage option among the choices provided. Honey should ideally be stored in a container that protects it from contaminants and moisture.",
    "Choices such as \"stick to fingers\" and \"beehive\" are impractical because they do not provide a clean or contained environment for honey storage.",
    "The \"jar\" is a commonly recommended option for storing honey. It is airtight and easy to seal, preventing moisture from getting in.",
    "\"Farmer's market\" is not a storage option; rather, it's a place to sell or buy products.",
    "While \"house\" may seem like a viable option, it does not specify a proper container. Storing honey in an open container within a house can lead to contamination.",
    "Thus, of all the options, the \"jar\" (option B) stands out as the most suitable choice for storing honey."
