  "query": "Question: Jealousy is not uncommon when to people do what with each other?\n\nChoices:\nA: wage war\nB: compete\nC: destroy relationship\nD: compete\nE: judge",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the core aspect of jealousy in relationships. Jealousy typically arises in competitive environments or when there is a perceived threat to a relationship.",
    "Next, consider the choices provided and how they relate to jealousy. The options include actions like competing, waging war, judging, and destroying relationships.",
    "Notice that choices B and D both say \"compete,\" indicating that competition can lead to jealousy.",
    "Evaluate the implications of \"wage war.\" While this could create jealousy, it is more related to conflict than typical jealousy observed in relationships.",
    "Next, consider \"destroy relationship.\" This choice describes an outcome of jealousy rather than a situation where jealousy occurs.",
    "Examine \"judge.\" While judgment can lead to jealousy, it is not as direct as competition between individuals.",
    "Since competition inherently involves comparing oneself to others, it typically elicits feelings of jealousy.",
    "Because choices B and D are identical, and assess the principle that competition can foster jealousy, the final answer must align with this."
