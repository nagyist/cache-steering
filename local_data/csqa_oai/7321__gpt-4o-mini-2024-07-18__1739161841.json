  "query": "Question: Where can you store a book you won't need for a while nearby to fabric items you wear?\n\nChoices:\nA: closet\nB: desk\nC: library of congress\nD: classroom\nE: bookshelf",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of where fabric items such as clothes are typically stored. A common place for storing clothes is in a closet.",
    "Next, evaluate the options for where to store a book. The question specifies that the book is not needed for a while, suggesting a location that is not frequently accessed is preferable.",
    "Now, let's examine the storage options provided. A closet typically has enough space to store both books and fabric items like clothes.",
    "Next, consider the other options: a desk may not have enough space for both items; the Library of Congress is impractical for personal storage; and a classroom is more public and may not allow for personal storage.",
    "Also, a bookshelf could hold the book, but it doesn't necessarily imply proximity to the fabric items unless it is within or attached to a closet.",
    "Confirming with the context, a closet indeed serves as a dual-purpose storage area for both clothes and books, making it the best choice.",
    "Finally, review the choices again to ensure there is no better answer. The closet is the only option that explicitly allows for both a book and nearby fabric items in personal storage."
