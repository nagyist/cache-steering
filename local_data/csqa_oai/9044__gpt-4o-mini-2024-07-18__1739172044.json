  "query": "Question: John took a carboard box and emptied his closet racks into it.  He was using the box to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: hold secret\nB: store food\nC: store clothes\nD: store data\nE: hold things",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes John emptying his closet racks into a cardboard box.",
    "Closets typically contain clothing and related items, so it\u2019s reasonable to infer that the contents being placed into the box are clothing.",
    "Next, we evaluate the choices. Option A (\"hold secret\") seems unrelated to the action of emptying a closet.",
    "Option B (\"store food\") also doesn't fit, as closets are not typically used for storing food.",
    "Option C (\"store clothes\") directly correlates with the action of emptying clothes into the box.",
    "Option D (\"store data\") is irrelevant, as data does not require physical storage in a box.",
    "Option E (\"hold things\") is vague, but we need a more specific answer that relates directly to what John is doing.",
    "Considering the most relevant option based on the action described, it is clear that John is specifically storing clothes in the box."
