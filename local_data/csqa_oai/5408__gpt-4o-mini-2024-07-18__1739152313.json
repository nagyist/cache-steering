  "query": "Question: I as a person don't kill others, why do I not?\n\nChoices:\nA: experience pleasure\nB: laws\nC: value life\nD: thank god\nE: go into debt",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of the question which is asking for the reason behind not killing others. This suggests a moral or ethical viewpoint.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. Option A suggests experiencing pleasure, but killing typically does not correlate with pleasure for most people.",
    "Option B mentions laws, which is a valid reason as legal systems prohibit murder and impose punishment for it. However, laws can be broken, and people still might commit crimes despite knowing them.",
    "Now look at option C, which states \"value life\". This resonates with a moral and ethical stance and reflects a deep personal belief that upholds the sanctity of life.",
    "Option D, \"thank god\", suggests a religious or spiritual appreciation but does not present a direct reasoning for refraining from killing.",
    "Lastly, consider option E, \"go into debt\", which does not relate logically to the act of killing and seems out of context to the moral question posed.",
    "Given the analysis of the options, valuing life appears to be a fundamental reason that many individuals adhere to in their moral compass, making it a strong candidate for the answer.",
    "While laws are important, the internal value of life likely serves as a more personal and intrinsic reason for not killing others compared to external pressures such as legal consequences.",
    "Confirming this logic leads to the conclusion that the best option reflecting why a person doesn't kill others is C: value life."
