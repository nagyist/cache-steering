  "query": "Question: What does an airplane do before takeoff?\n\nChoices:\nA: crash\nB: accelerate\nC: turn around\nD: catch on fire\nE: carry freight",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what an airplane does before takeoff, we need to recall the typical procedures involved in the takeoff phase of a flight.",
    "Before takeoff, an airplane must be on the runway and prepared for departure. This usually involves taxiing to the designated takeoff area.",
    "Once at the takeoff position, the airplane must accelerate down the runway to reach the necessary speed for takeoff, commonly referred to as \"takeoff speed.\"",
    "The option \"crash\" is not a procedure that happens before takeoff, as that implies something has gone wrong.",
    "The option \"turn around\" could refer to a maneuver, but it is not a standardized procedure before takeoff unless there is a specific reason.",
    "\"Catching on fire\" is not a normal event prior to takeoff and would indicate an emergency situation.",
    "\"Carrying freight\" is a function of the airplane but does not describe an action taken before takeoff; planes typically carry passengers or cargo.",
    "Since the most common and appropriate action for an airplane before takeoff is to accelerate down the runway, we assess the options.",
    "The only choice that directly correlates to the actions airplanes perform before takeoff is \"accelerate.\""
