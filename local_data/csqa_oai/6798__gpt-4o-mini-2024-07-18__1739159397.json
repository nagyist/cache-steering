  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the context of the question regarding the presence of a telephone book in relation to a telephone.",
    "Consider the locations provided in the choices and how likely each would have a telephone book nearby.",
    "A library typically has many resources but not specifically a telephone book where phones are present.",
    "Under a chair is not a logical choice as chairs do not typically hold telephone books.",
    "A telephone booth is designed specifically for making phone calls; it is reasonable to expect a telephone book to be present there to look up numbers.",
    "A house is a location where telephones might be present along with a telephone book, but not guaranteed.",
    "Hotels often have telephones in rooms or lobbies and could provide a telephone book, but this is not as definitive as a telephone booth.",
    "Weighing the options, the telephone booth stands out since it is explicitly meant for telephone use and likely would provide all necessary information.",
    "Other options like a house or a hotel aren't as reliably associated with telephone books being nearby as a telephone booth is.",
    "Conclusion: The best answer that satisfies the condition of having a telephone book since the telephone is present is the telephone booth."
