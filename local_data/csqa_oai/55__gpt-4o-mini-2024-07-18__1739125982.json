  "query": "Question: Jim enjoyed killing people, but he did it too often and the cops found out.  What might the cops do to him?\n\nChoices:\nA: going to jail\nB: going to prison\nC: beat him up\nD: get arrested\nE: die",
  "steps": [
    "Jim has committed a serious crime, which is killing people. This action is illegal and typically leads to serious consequences.",
    "The statement mentions that the cops found out about Jim's actions. This implies that he is likely to face legal repercussions.",
    "The most common immediate action taken by law enforcement when they discover a suspect who has committed a crime is to arrest the individual.",
    "Getting arrested is often the first step in the criminal justice process. It involves detaining the person for the alleged crime.",
    "While options A (going to jail) and B (going to prison) could come into play after an arrest, the question specifically asks what the cops would do to him upon discovering his crimes.",
    "Option C (beat him up) is not a method that law enforcement is supposed to use; instead, they follow legal procedures for arresting a suspect.",
    "Option D (get arrested) directly aligns with the role of the police upon finding out about a suspect's illegal actions, as they are tasked with enforcing the law.",
    "Option E (die) is not a probable response from the cops; rather, it refers to a consequence that does not result from police action in this context.",
    "Since the most logical and immediate action the cops would take in response to discovering Jim's killings is to arrest him, option D is the most appropriate answer."
