    "The question mentions a person looking at houses, which typically implies they are engaged in a process of searching or evaluating possible options.",
    "When looking at houses, the primary motivation usually revolves around acquiring a place to live or an investment property, rather than just crossing a street or carrying something home.",
    "The available choices include owning property, which directly relates to the act of house hunting. Other options like crossing a street and bringing something home do not make sense in the context of house searching.",
    "Mortgage can be a related term since it involves financing a property, but it is not the end goal itself\u2014it's merely a means to achieving the goal of property ownership.",
    "The option \"will succeed\" is vague and does not pertain to a specific outcome of looking at houses. It is more a statement about future success rather than a concrete goal.",
    "The clearest and most direct answer in the context of someone actively looking at houses is to own property since that aligns with the objective of such an action."
