  "steps": [
    "The question describes an experience of playing basketball, specifically how the dribbles echo loudly. This tends to occur in enclosed spaces where sound can reverberate.",
    "Option A, a sporting goods store, is typically a retail environment not meant for playing basketball, making it unlikely for an echoing experience.",
    "Option B, loud, does not specify a place and also does not fit the context of the sentence.",
    "Option C, boys hands, also fails to provide a location and does not fit the context of dribbling a basketball.",
    "Option D, park, is usually an open area and would not have the same echoing sound effect as an enclosed space.",
    "Option E, gymnasium, is designed for basketball and indoor sports, where the echoing effect of dribbling would be most prominent due to the walls and ceiling.",
    "Given all the options, a gymnasium is the most fitting answer because of its structure creating echoes and its purpose for playing basketball."
