  "query": "Question: Where do nurses work with one doctor?\n\nChoices:\nA: resuscitate\nB: doctor's office\nC: hospital\nD: reception\nE: nursing home",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question. It asks where nurses typically work alongside one doctor.",
    "Next, consider the role of nurses and doctors in a healthcare setting. Nurses usually work in environments where patient care is prioritized, often alongside physicians.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the given choices: \n- A: \"resuscitate\" is an action, not a workplace.\n- B: \"doctor's office\" is a common setting where a nurse might work with one doctor.\n- C: \"hospital\" is a larger healthcare facility where multiple healthcare professionals, including nurses and doctors, work together. \n- D: \"reception\" typically refers to the front desk area, not specifically a place where nurses work.\n- E: \"nursing home\" is a facility for elderly care where nurses do work, but it doesn\u2019t specifically mention a doctor present.",
    "Among these options, both B (doctor's office) and C (hospital) are facilities where nurses could work with doctors. However, a doctor's office more directly implies a single doctor working with visiting nurses.",
    "In a hospital setting (C), while nurses definitely do work alongside doctors, the focus can often shift to team-based care involving multiple doctors rather than just one.",
    "In summary, the setting that best fits the scenario of nurses working with just one doctor specifically is the doctor's office."
