  "query": "Question: Where is a small house likely to have a table?\n\nChoices:\nA: dining room\nB: furniture store\nC: kitchen\nD: roof\nE: conference",
  "steps": [
    "A small house typically has designated areas for different activities, such as eating, cooking, and living.",
    "Tables are commonly found in areas where meals are served or where family and friends gather.",
    "The dining room is a traditional place for a table as it is specifically designed for eating meals.",
    "Another possible place for a table is the kitchen, as many small houses have kitchen tables for casual dining or food preparation.",
    "A furniture store is not a residence, so it would not be a location where a small house has a table.",
    "A roof does not serve as a functional area for placing a table.",
    "A conference setting typically refers to a meeting space that is unlikely to be found in a small house.",
    "Between the dining room and kitchen, both locations are practical for a table; however, the kitchen is more common in small houses for informal dining.",
    "Considering the casual nature of small house living, I would infer that people often use the kitchen for meals, making it a likely spot for a table.",
    "Therefore, while both the kitchen and dining room are reasonable guesses, the kitchen is the most practical choice."
