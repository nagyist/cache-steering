  "query": "Question: Where in a house might someone ring a bell?\n\nChoices:\nA: church\nB: school\nC: mailbox\nD: front door\nE: reindeer coller",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify where bells are typically used in a residential setting. A residential bell is most commonly associated with a front door.",
    "Consider the choices provided: A church generally has bells but is not a house. A school might have a bell for signaling, but it's not a typical part of a home.",
    "The mailbox usually does not feature a bell. It's primarily used for mail delivery, and while some might use a bell to signal the arrival of mail, it's not standard.",
    "A reindeer collar is not a plausible option in a typical household context; it's related to animals more than to a house.",
    "Eliminating the other choices leaves us with the front door, which is a common place for a bell, such as doorbells that visitors ring to indicate their arrival.",
    "Final verification: the front door is indeed where someone would typically expect to ring a bell in a house setting."
