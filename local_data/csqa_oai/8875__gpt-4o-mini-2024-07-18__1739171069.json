  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a method or tool through which one can hear others and also be heard by them.",
    "The option \"A: mouth\" is a possibility, as it allows one to speak and hear sounds, but it is not a tool that specifically facilitates communication.",
    "The option \"B: song\" does not fit, as it is a form of communication (music) but does not imply two-way communication where both parties can hear and be heard.",
    "The option \"C: radio\" is primarily a one-way communication device. It broadcasts sound, but the person using a radio cannot communicate back through it, making it unsuitable.",
    "The option \"D: ears\" allows one to hear, but does not provide a means to be heard by others.",
    "The option \"E: telephone\" allows for both hearing and being heard, as it is designed for two-way communication.",
    "Reviewing all options, the only choice that meets the criteria of facilitating both hearing others and being heard is the telephone."
