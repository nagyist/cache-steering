    "Silk is a fabric known for its luxurious texture and sheen, which is a significant factor when determining its common usages.",
    "One primary use for silk is in the fashion industry, where it is often used to create clothing items that require a soft, smooth texture and a high-quality feel.",
    "Considering the choices provided, options A (nightgown) and C (garments) relate to clothing that may be made from silk.",
    "While a nightgown is a specific type of garment, the term \"garments\" encompasses a wider range of clothing that silk can be used to produce.",
    "Looking at the other options: B (mulberry tree) is where silkworms get their food; D (chinatown) is a location known for many things, but not specifically related to silk products; and E (bushes) does not logically connect to silk.",
