  "query": "Question: What is likely to happen to someone driving their car too fast?\n\nChoices:\nA: use gas\nB: doze off\nC: go somewhere\nD: speed limit\nE: speeding ticket",
  "steps": [
    "First, driving too fast generally means exceeding the speed limit set for a road or area.",
    "Second, exceeding the speed limit is a violation of traffic laws, which are established for safety.",
    "Third, when someone drives too fast, they may attract the attention of law enforcement.",
    "Fourth, law enforcement officers are likely to issue a speeding ticket to someone who is caught driving over the speed limit.",
    "Fifth, a speeding ticket serves as a penalty for the law violation and is intended to discourage future speeding.",
    "Sixth, while it's possible to use more gas or reach a destination faster, those options do not directly relate to the consequences of speeding.",
    "Seventh, \"dozing off\" while driving is a separate issue related to fatigue, not necessarily linked to speeding.",
    "Eighth, while speeding may lead to getting somewhere faster, the focus of the question is on the likely consequences rather than the potential outcome of speed.",
    "Ninth, the option \"speed limit\" is not something that happens as a result of speeding; it is a regulatory measure.",
    "Tenth, of the provided options, \"speeding ticket\" is the most direct consequence of driving too fast."
