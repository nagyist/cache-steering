  "query": "Question: If a person accidentally harms another person, what happens to them?\n\nChoices:\nA: live happily\nB: work at home\nC: catch cold\nD: feel ashamed\nE: throw a party",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the emotional and psychological reactions that someone might experience after accidentally harming another person.",
    "Typically, feeling remorse or guilt is a common reaction when one realizes they have harmed someone, even if it was accidental.",
    "I will evaluate the answer choices based on this reasoning. \"Live happily\" (A) does not align with the potential feelings of guilt.",
    "Next, \"work at home\" (B) does not seem relevant in the context of emotional responses to harming someone.",
    "\"Catch cold\" (C) is a physical illness that is unrelated to the emotional state after causing harm.",
    "\"Feel ashamed\" (D) directly aligns with the likely emotional response to accidentally harming someone.",
    "Finally, \"throw a party\" (E) is unlikely since celebrating would not be appropriate after causing someone harm.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the most fitting choice that reflects the emotional consequence is \"feel ashamed.\""
