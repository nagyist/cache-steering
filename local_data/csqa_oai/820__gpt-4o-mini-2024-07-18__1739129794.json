  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"It had a beach with shallow water\" indicates a body of water that is not too deep, which typically describes lakes, ponds, or specially designed pools.",
    "The mention of \"not the ocean\" implies that it is a natural body of water rather than a man-made one. This makes options like \"swimming pool\" and \"childrens pool\" unlikely.",
    "Next, I consider the remaining options: \"pond\" and \"lake.\" Both can have shallow areas and a beach-like shore.",
    "I need to evaluate the term \"hot spot all the locals enjoyed.\" Lakes are often popular recreational spots for swimming, picnicking, and other activities, potentially more so than ponds, which can be smaller and less developed.",
    "Additionally, \"lake\" has a common use in recreational contexts where \"beach\" is also used, as many lakes have designated swimming areas with sandy shores.",
    "Ponds, on the other hand, although they can be shallow, typically do not describe a \"hot spot\" as they are often smaller and may not have the development or facilities that attract large crowds of locals.",
    "Given all of the above reasoning, the most suitable option that fits the description of having a beach-like area, being popular among locals, and being a body of water that isn\u2019t the ocean would be a \"lake.\""
