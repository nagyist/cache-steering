  "query": "Question: Where are trees likely to be protected?\n\nChoices:\nA: orchard\nB: at the tree store.\nC: countryside\nD: forest\nE: state park",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where trees are likely to be protected, we should consider locations that prioritize conservation and nature preservation.",
    "An orchard primarily focuses on the cultivation of fruit trees, which may not include protective measures for all trees.",
    "A tree store sells trees and related items; this is not a location for tree protection.",
    "The countryside can have trees and may promote some level of protection, but it is not specifically known for it.",
    "Forests naturally protect trees through their ecosystems, but they might not have active protection policies in place.",
    "State parks often have regulations and management plans aimed at preserving natural habitats and protecting trees within them.",
    "Considering all locations, state parks are specifically designed with conservation in mind, making it a strong candidate for tree protection.",
    "Forests are also a possibility, but they may lack targeted protection for individual trees compared to the active management in state parks.",
    "Therefore, while both state parks and forests provide some level of protection, state parks are unequivocally more focused on conservation efforts."
