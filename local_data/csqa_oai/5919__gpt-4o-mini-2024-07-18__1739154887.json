  "query": "Question: If someone is a mechanic, what are likely issues they will be asked to fix?\n\nChoices:\nA: machine tool\nB: oil squeaky joints\nC: oil engine\nD: machine parts\nE: servicing airplane",
  "steps": [
    "To determine likely issues a mechanic would be asked to fix, I need to first consider the primary responsibilities and specialties of a mechanic.",
    "Mechanics typically work on vehicles and their components, which includes engines, transmissions, and other systems within automobiles.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options provided to see which ones are directly related to common mechanical work.",
    "Option A, \"machine tool,\" could refer to tools used in mechanical work but isn't an issue a mechanic typically fixes.",
    "Option B, \"oil squeaky joints,\" refers to an issue related to lubrication but isn't a common phrase that accurately describes a mechanic's task.",
    "Option C, \"oil engine,\" relates specifically to engine oil, which is a common maintenance task for mechanics, involving oil changes and ensuring proper oil levels.",
    "Option D, \"machine parts,\" is vague but generally could relate to various components a mechanic might deal with. However, it's not as specific as addressing a common issue directly.",
    "Option E, \"servicing airplane,\" is specific to aviation mechanics, which is a different field from standard auto mechanics, making it unlikely to be asked of a typical mechanic.",
    "From the analysis, \"oil engine\" (Option C) clearly stands out as a common and specific task that mechanics regularly perform related to vehicles."
