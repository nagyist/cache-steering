  "query": "Question: What does someone do while going jogging?\n\nChoices:\nA: eat icecream\nB: lose weight\nC: getting tired\nD: heart rate increases\nE: heavy breathing",
  "steps": [
    "When someone goes jogging, they typically engage in a form of cardiovascular exercise.",
    "During jogging, the body requires more energy, which can lead to the burning of calories.",
    "As a result of burning calories, jogging can contribute to weight loss over time if combined with a proper diet.",
    "While jogging, physical exertion increases, causing the heart to pump more blood to supply oxygen to the muscles.",
    "This increased demand for oxygen can lead to an elevated heart rate during jogging.",
    "In addition to an increased heart rate, jogging can cause physical fatigue as the muscles work harder.",
    "As a person jogs, they often experience heavy breathing because the body is trying to take in more oxygen to meet its increased demands.",
    "Looking at the provided choices, we identify two options that directly relate to the physiological responses of jogging: increased heart rate and heavy breathing.",
    "Both heart rate increase and heavy breathing are relevant outcomes of jogging, but heavy breathing is typically more pronounced during physical exertion.",
    "Since the question asks for what typically happens while jogging, \"D: heart rate increases\" and \"E: heavy breathing\" are strong candidates, but heavy breathing is often a more immediate and noticeable effect."
