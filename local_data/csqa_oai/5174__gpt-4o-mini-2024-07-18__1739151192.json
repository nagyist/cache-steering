  "query": "Question: A person woke up in bed.  Their spouse was sleeping beside them.  They rolled over, did something, and stood.  What did they do before standing?\n\nChoices:\nA: put on shoes\nB: sit up\nC: thank god\nD: say love\nE: converse",
  "steps": [
    "To understand what the person did before standing, we need to consider the context of waking up in bed next to a sleeping spouse. It\u2019s common for someone to perform certain actions after waking up.",
    "The most logical action after rolling over in bed would be to first change their position from lying down to sitting. This is a natural movement that precedes standing.",
    "Putting on shoes is something that generally occurs after one is upright and preparing to leave the bed or the house, not immediately after rolling over.",
    "\"Thank god\" or \"say love\" would typically suggest verbal expressions, which usually happen after someone is already awake and not before standing.",
    "\"Converse\" implies a dialogue or discussion that generally wouldn't happen immediately after waking up while a spouse is still sleeping beside them.",
    "Hence, the most sensible answer is that the person would have likely sat up after rolling over before doing anything else."
