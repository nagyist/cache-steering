  "query": "Question: John buys a 5 pound block of salt. Where is he likely to keep it?\n\nChoices:\nA: shaker\nB: sea water\nC: falling down\nD: kitchen cupboard\nE: fast food restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the common uses of salt and where it is usually stored in a household setting.",
    "Salt can be used for cooking, preserving food, or seasoning, and it is most often stored in a kitchen-related area.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each answer choice in relation to where a 5-pound block of salt is likely to be kept.",
    "Choice A (shaker) describes a small container used for sprinkling salt, but it is not suitable for storing a large block of salt.",
    "Choice B (sea water) is not applicable because John has a block of salt, not a source of salt like sea water.",
    "Choice C (falling down) does not make sense in the context of storing salt, as it does not pertain to a storage location.",
    "Choice D (kitchen cupboard) seems plausible because a kitchen cupboard is a common storage area for food and cooking supplies, including salt.",
    "Choice E (fast food restaurant) is less likely since it's not a personal storage area and John would typically keep his salt at home.",
    "Therefore, after analyzing all options, the best answer for where John is likely to keep a 5-pound block of salt is in the kitchen cupboard."
