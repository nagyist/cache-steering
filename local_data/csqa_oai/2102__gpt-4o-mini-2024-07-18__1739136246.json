  "steps": [
    "We begin by identifying what is meant by \"fight off disease.\" This typically refers to the body's ability to defend itself against pathogens and illnesses.",
    "The human body has several mechanisms to fight off disease, but one of the primary systems involved in this process is the immune system.",
    "Let's consider the choices provided. Choice A, \"immune system,\" directly relates to the body's defense against diseases by producing antibodies and mobilizing cells to attack pathogens.",
    "Choice B, \"name,\" does not relate to any physical or biological process for fighting diseases; it is simply a label we use for identification.",
    "Choice C, \"one head,\" does not pertain to disease defense mechanisms; while the head contains the brain, it does not fight off disease directly.",
    "Choice D, \"grip,\" refers to the ability to hold something tightly, which is unrelated to the fight against diseases.",
    "Choice E, \"fingernails,\" may provide some physical barriers but are not a primary mechanism for fighting diseases in the body.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it is clear that the immune system (Choice A) plays a vital role in combating diseases, while all other choices do not."
