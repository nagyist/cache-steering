  "query": "Question: Most people would think killing people is what kind of act?\n\nChoices:\nA: going to jail\nB: joy\nC: terrible\nD: mistake\nE: murder",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the general perception of killing people.",
    "Most societies and cultures hold negative views on the act of killing others.",
    "The act of killing is often associated with profound moral and ethical implications.",
    "In legal terms, killing someone unlawfully is categorized as \"murder.\"",
    "However, the question seeks what people generally *think* of the act itself, not its legal implications.",
    "People typically view the act of killing as \"terrible,\" reflecting the gravity of taking a human life.",
    "While \"murder\" is a valid description of the act, it doesn't encapsulate the emotional or moral reaction to it.",
    "The options include \"going to jail,\" which is a consequence, \"joy,\" which is an unlikely reaction, and \"mistake,\" which might apply in rare circumstances, but generally does not fit killing as a perception.",
    "Considering all options, \"terrible\" captures the widespread sentiment about the act of killing in a more relatable way than the legal term \"murder.\""
