  "query": "Question: Where would you find trees that provide food?\n\nChoices:\nA: yard\nB: state park\nC: market\nD: orchard\nE: surface of earth",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the options provided to see which locations are associated with trees that provide food.",
    "Option A is \"yard.\" Many residential yards might have trees that bear fruits or nuts, so this could potentially be a place to find food-producing trees.",
    "Option B is \"state park.\" State parks can have trees, but they are typically more focused on conservation and recreation rather than providing food directly.",
    "Option C is \"market.\" Markets usually sell food but do not grow trees that provide food, so this option is not relevant.",
    "Option D is \"orchard.\" Orchards are specifically designed for growing fruit and nut trees, making this a prime location for trees that provide food.",
    "Option E is \"surface of earth.\" While this is a broad term that includes all types of environments, it does not specifically refer to trees that provide food; thus, it is too vague.",
    "Now, I will compare the relevant options, which are A (yard) and D (orchard). While yards may have edible trees, orchards are specifically cultivated for food production.",
    "Considering the clarity and specificity, orchards are the most definitive answer, as this is their dedicated purpose."
