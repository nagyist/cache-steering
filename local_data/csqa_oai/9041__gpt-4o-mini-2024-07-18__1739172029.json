  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"small screen\" typically refers to a specific medium of entertainment.",
    "In pop culture, \"the small screen\" is commonly understood to mean television, as opposed to \"the big screen,\" which refers to movies.",
    "By eliminating the options that do not correlate to television, we can narrow down our choices.",
    "Option A, opera, refers to a live theatrical performance and not a small screen medium.",
    "Option B, cell phone, is a device that can display video, but it does not specifically denote a performance medium.",
    "Option C, movies, refer to films shown in theaters, which is associated with the big screen.",
    "Option D, play, refers to a live theater performance, which is also not on the small screen.",
    "The only option left that aligns with the definition of the \"small screen\" being television is option E.",
    "Based on this reasoning, an actor on the small screen performs on television."
