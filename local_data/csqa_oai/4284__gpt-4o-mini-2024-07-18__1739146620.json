  "steps": [
    "First, consider what it means to have a penny beside a shoe. This suggests that the penny is on the ground or very close to the ground.",
    "Next, evaluate the locations provided in the choices. A piggy bank (A) is typically a place for storing coins, not a location where a penny would be found beside a shoe.",
    "A coin purse (B) is also a contained space where coins are kept and wouldn't be near a shoe unless it is open and lying on the ground, which is less common.",
    "A pocket (C) refers to a space in clothing where coins can be kept. If a penny were to fall out of a pocket, it might end up beside a shoe, but it wouldn't be naturally found there unless it was intentionally taken out.",
    "Evaluating the option \"on the table\" (D), it is unlikely for a penny to be found directly beside a shoe, as a table is generally elevated and not at ground level.",
    "Now, consider the ground (E) \u2013 it's a common place to find coins, and a penny could easily be lying beside a shoe on the ground.",
    "Among the provided options, the most plausible locations for a penny found near a shoe would be either the ground (E) or a pocket (C).",
    "However, since the phrase specifically states \"beside your shoe,\" the ground (E) makes more sense as it indicates the penny is actually on the surface next to where the shoe is, rather than in clothing.",
    "Therefore, the best choice is the ground (E), because that's where a penny is most likely to be found if it's next to a shoe."
