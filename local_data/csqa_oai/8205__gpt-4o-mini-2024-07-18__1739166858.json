  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a likely consequence of celebrating by drinking too much.",
    "When someone drinks excessively, it can lead to various short-term effects on the body.",
    "One common immediate consequence of excessive drinking is feeling tired or fatigued due to the depressant effects of alcohol.",
    "However, another very common consequence of drinking too much is experiencing hangovers, which occur as the body processes the excess alcohol.",
    "Hangovers typically involve a range of symptoms, including headache, dehydration, and general malaise.",
    "While drinking again (option A) may happen, it doesn't fit as a consequence of the previous excessive drinking but rather an action that may follow.",
    "Becoming tired (option B) is plausible, but it is more of a symptom of alcohol consumption rather than a specific consequence like a hangover.",
    "Option D, \"big head,\" is a vague description and not a medically recognized consequence of drinking too much.",
    "Being happy (option E) might be a feeling during some celebrations, but if drinking goes to excess, it is likely to lead to discomfort rather than happiness afterward.",
    "Considering these points, the most accurate and recognized consequence of excessive drinking would be hangovers."
