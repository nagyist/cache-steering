  "steps": [
    "The question describes a situation where tickets have not arrived as expected, and Sally has been waiting in line for a concert for an extended time.",
    "The tickets were supposed to arrive by 1AM, but it is now 2AM, indicating that there is a delay that has affected the situation.",
    "The fact that Sally has been waiting in line since midnight implies that the expected timeline for ticket distribution has not been adhered to, resulting in a situation where the line is not moving.",
    "We need to connect the concept of waiting in line without progress to one of the provided choices that might explain the circumstance.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"A: delays\" fits as it directly indicates that something has gone wrong with time expectations.",
    "The other choices\u2014B (frustration), C (sprinting), D (moving forward), and E (being annoyed)\u2014do not directly address the reason for why the tickets had not arrived or why the line hadn't moved.",
    "Since \"delays\" is the only option that explicitly explains the situation as related to ticket distribution not occurring on time, it stands out from the rest of the options."
