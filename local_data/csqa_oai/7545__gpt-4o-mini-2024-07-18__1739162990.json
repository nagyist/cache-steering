  "query": "Question: What is a group of bungalows in a small area?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: woods\nC: bed\nD: neighborhood\nE: suburbs",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what a bungalow is. A bungalow is typically a one- or one-and-a-half-story house that is often characterized by its broad front porch and low-pitched roof.",
    "Next, we should clarify what is meant by a \"group of bungalows in a small area.\" This implies a collection of these types of houses located closely together.",
    "Now, let's consider the answer choices. A \"park\" usually refers to a public green space, which does not align with the concept of bungalows.",
    "\"Woods\" denotes an area covered with trees which, again, is not relevant to bungalows.",
    "The answer choice \"bed\" could refer to various contexts, but it does not relate to a group of bungalows.",
    "Looking at \"neighborhood,\" it commonly describes a localized area where people live, which could certainly include clusters of bungalows.",
    "Lastly, the term \"suburbs\" generally refers to residential areas situated on the outskirts of a city, often containing various housing types, including bungalows, but it is a broader term than \"neighborhood.\"",
    "Comparing \"neighborhood\" and \"suburbs,\" \"neighborhood\" suggests a smaller and more immediate area, while \"suburbs\" encompasses a larger region.",
    "Given the specificity of the question regarding a \"small area,\" \"neighborhood\" better answers the query about the grouping of bungalows."
