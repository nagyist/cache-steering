  "query": "Question: What do you give people when they meet people?\n\nChoices:\nA: introduce yourself\nB: greeting\nC: look over\nD: friendly\nE: high five",
  "steps": [
    "To understand what one gives to people when they meet them, I need to analyze typical interactions in such situations.",
    "When meeting someone, the first action often involves acknowledging the other person, which indicates a form of communication.",
    "Common forms of acknowledgment include verbal and non-verbal actions, which often fall under terms like greeting or introducing oneself.",
    "Introducing oneself is more about providing information about who you are, rather than a direct action of offering something.",
    "A greeting, however, is typically an expression or action that serves to welcome someone or initiate a conversation.",
    "Looking over someone does not have a clear and direct connection to what you give to someone upon meeting them; it seems more passive.",
    "The term \"friendly\" describes a demeanor or attitude, not a specific action that one gives to another when meeting.",
    "A high five is a specific physical action that may happen in a friendly context but is not universal to all meet-and-greet situations.",
    "Among all the options, \"greeting\" fits best as it encapsulates what is commonly exchanged in interactions when meeting someone. It's an action given to others that signifies acknowledgment and friendliness."
