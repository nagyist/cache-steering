  "query": "Question: So as not to disrupt instruction, there were always spare pencils in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: on teachers desk\nB: cabinet\nC: classroom\nD: backpack\nE: store",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of the sentence which mentions spare pencils being available to avoid disrupting instruction.",
    "The phrase \"so as not to disrupt instruction\" suggests that the location for spare pencils should be easily accessible to students or teachers during class time.",
    "Let's evaluate the options:\n- A: \"on teachers desk\" implies a location that is primarily accessible to the teacher, which may not always help students quickly when they need a pencil.",
    "- B: \"cabinet\" could work, but if the cabinet is locked or requires permission to access, it could be disruptive to get pencils from it during a lesson.",
    "- C: \"classroom\" is a broader term that could include various locations within the classroom, making it likely that it is accessible to everyone present.",
    "- D: \"backpack\" would not be a practical location for spare pencils intended for immediate use by others, as backpacks are personal storage for individual students.",
    "- E: \"store\" is not realistic as a location for spare classroom supplies needed during instruction, as it implies going off-site to retrieve them.",
    "Based on this analysis, option C is the most suitable answer since it encompasses various potential locations within the classroom where spare pencils could be kept and quickly accessed."
