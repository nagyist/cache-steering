  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"implored he reply\" suggests that the sender strongly urged or begged the recipient to respond to her email.",
    "Imploring usually indicates a sense of urgency or importance attached to the request for a reply.",
    "Given the context, we need to consider what the recipient could have done in response to the strong request for a reply.",
    "The options presented are actions that the recipient might have taken after receiving the email.",
    "Choice A (print the email) does not directly address the act of replying and suggests only an action of printing, which doesn't imply a response.",
    "Choice B (question) implies the recipient might have asked a question, but it does not directly suggest a reply to the email.",
    "Choice C (ask) suggests interaction but similarly lacks a direct reference to replying to the email.",
    "Choice D (forward) indicates sending the email to someone else, which again does not directly correlate with replying.",
    "Choice E (ignore) is plausible; it fits the scenario that despite the sender's plea for a reply, the recipient did not respond at all.",
    "Since the phrase indicates that the urge to reply was not met, the most logical conclusion is that the recipient ignored the email altogether."
