  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that the man became more efficient at his work, which implies he learned some techniques or tricks to streamline his tasks.",
    "The phrase \"learned shortcuts to copy\" suggests that the second action would be related to a common computing task that complements copying.",
    "In most computing contexts, if one learns shortcuts for \"copy,\" the next logical function they would learn would usually be \"paste,\" as it is a direct follow-up action. Together, copying and pasting form a fundamental part of file manipulation.",
    "Reviewing the other answer choices: \nA: \"soft copy\" is unrelated to the action of shortcuts for copying.\nB: \"paste\" directly relates to copying and is the action you perform after copying.\nC: \"unique\" does not fit in the context of copying and pasting.\nD: \"ocean\" is completely irrelevant.\nE: \"creation\" does not naturally follow the context of copy and would not be considered a shortcut in work efficiency.",
    "Given this reasoning, \"paste\" is the most logical answer to follow \"copy\" in the context of learning shortcuts to increase work efficiency."
