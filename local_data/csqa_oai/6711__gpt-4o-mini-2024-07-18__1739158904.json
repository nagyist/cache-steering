  "query": "Question: If an area is not thick with resource, those resources are what?\n\nChoices:\nA: free flowing\nB: translucent\nC: sparse\nD: slender\nE: clear",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the phrase \"not thick with resource.\" This implies that the quantity or availability of resources is not abundant.",
    "Next, consider the meaning of \"sparse.\" If something is sparse, it means that it is distributed thinly or is lacking in quantity.",
    "Now, look at the other options: \"free flowing,\" \"translucent,\" \"slender,\" and \"clear.\" We need to evaluate if any of these terms can also describe something that is not abundant or thick in resources.",
    "\"Free flowing\" usually refers to a state of movement and doesn\u2019t directly relate to the density of resources.",
    "\"Translucent\" describes a property of matter concerning light, not quantity or abundance of resources.",
    "\"Slender\" indicates a thinness or narrowness, which also does not relate directly to availability of resources.",
    "\"Clear\" generally refers to visibility or purity, and it does not imply anything about the quantity of resources either.",
    "Considering all the definitions and meanings, \"sparse\" is the only term that directly correlates with the idea of not having a thick quantity of resources.",
    "Thus, the most accurate choice that reflects something that is not abundant in resources is \"sparse.\""
