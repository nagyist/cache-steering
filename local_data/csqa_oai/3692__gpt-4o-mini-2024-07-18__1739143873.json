  "query": "Question: What do tv studios use milk to mimic?\n\nChoices:\nA: liquid\nB: water\nC: fridge\nD: lactose\nE: calcium",
  "steps": [
    "I will start by analyzing the context of the question, specifically about the use of milk in television studios.",
    "TV studios often use various substances to simulate real-life elements in filming, especially when they need a visual representation of liquid.",
    "Since milk is a liquid, I need to consider what it is commonly used to mimic in productions.",
    "One common reason studios might use milk is to mimic water, as it has a similar consistency and appearance.",
    "I will evaluate the options provided to see if any align with using milk for mimicry:\n- A: liquid - is too broad because milk is already a liquid.\n- B: water - fits the context well, as milk can emulate it visually.\n- C: fridge - is not applicable in this context.\n- D: lactose - refers to a sugar found in milk, not something visualized.\n- E: calcium - also not a visual element, more of a nutrient in milk.",
    "Based on my analysis, the best interpretation of what TV studios use milk to mimic is water, as it is the most logical choice given its clear visual similarities."
