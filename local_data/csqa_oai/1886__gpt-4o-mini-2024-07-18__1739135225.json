  "query": "Question: Talking to others can make you feel better, but when the people you talk to are mean, then can cause what?\n\nChoices:\nA: dry mouth\nB: changing behavior\nC: hurt feelings\nD: communicating with others\nE: anger",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that talking to others can generally improve one's mood, but conversely, if the people being spoken to are mean, it can have negative effects.",
    "We need to analyze the choices provided in terms of what negative consequence could result from talking to mean people.",
    "Choice A: dry mouth - This is usually a physiological reaction and not directly related to talking to mean people.",
    "Choice B: changing behavior - While one might change their behavior in response to mean comments, it isn't a direct emotional reaction.",
    "Choice C: hurt feelings - This is a direct emotional consequence of talking to mean people; feeling hurt is a common reaction.",
    "Choice D: communicating with others - This does not represent a negative consequence but rather a neutral or positive action.",
    "Choice E: anger - This could also be a possible negative reaction to mean behavior, as it is common to feel angry when insulted or belittled.",
    "Between options C (hurt feelings) and E (anger), both are valid emotional responses to mean interactions; however, hurt feelings are often a more universal immediate reaction to unkindness.",
    "In conclusion, talking to mean people is more likely to lead to hurt feelings as a primary emotional response."
