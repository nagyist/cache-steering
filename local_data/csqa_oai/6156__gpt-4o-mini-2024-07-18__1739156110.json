  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a delivery of a new computer, which typically comes in a package or container.",
    "The recipient is eager to open something, indicating that it is likely something that is not directly associated with the physical location like a house or an office building.",
    "Among the choices, 'hard drive', 'house', 'office building', 'box', and 'backpack', the most common item that is delivered when receiving a new computer is a 'box'.",
    "A hard drive is a component of a computer, not the complete product being delivered, and the options of house and office building do not correlate with the excitement to open something.",
    "The term 'backpack' does not fit as computers are generally not delivered in that manner, especially a new computer.",
    "Since the new computer is most commonly delivered in a box, the term 'box' is the most appropriate answer for what the recipient could not wait to open."
