  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the question \u201cWhat always happens when you are having lunch?\u201d The word \"always\" indicates that the answer should be something that is consistently true for everyone during lunch.",
    "Next, let's examine each option to see if they qualify as something that \u201calways\u201d happens during lunch.",
    "Option A: \"talk to people\" is common during lunch, but not everyone talks to people while having lunch; some people might eat alone.",
    "Option B: \"eat food\" is likely true for lunch, as lunch is specifically a meal time designated for eating. This option seems strong.",
    "Option C: \"burp\" can happen after eating but does not necessarily occur for everyone. It could depend on individual dietary habits and preferences.",
    "Option D: \"tear a wrapper\" could happen if someone is opening packaged food, but not all lunch items come wrapped. Hence, it isn\u2019t something that always happens.",
    "Option E: \"choke\" is a possibility but is not guaranteed and is a risk rather than a certainty associated with lunch.",
    "After evaluating all options based on their consistency during lunch, it's clear that the act of eating food is universal when having lunch."
