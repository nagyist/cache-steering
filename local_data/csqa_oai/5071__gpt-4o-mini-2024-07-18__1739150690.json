  "query": "Question: The travelers came across many a toll road during their road drip through New England and other parts of where?\n\nChoices:\nA: connecticut\nB: eastern united states\nC: florida\nD: new york\nE: sea",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions travelers coming across toll roads during their road trip, specifically through New England.",
    "New England is a region in the northeastern United States that includes states such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.",
    "The phrase \"and other parts of where?\" suggests that the additional region is also known for having toll roads.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, we need to consider which areas apart from New England are known for having toll roads.",
    "Option A: Connecticut is part of New England, so it does not fit as the \"other parts.\"",
    "Option B: Eastern United States includes New England and additional areas, making it a strong candidate since it is a broader region.",
    "Option C: Florida, while not directly connected to New England, does have toll roads, but it is not relevant as an \"other part.\"",
    "Option D: New York is adjacent to New England and also has toll roads, but it again is part of the broader eastern region.",
    "Option E: \"Sea\" does not refer to a geographic region that would have toll roads.",
    "After analyzing all the options, \"eastern United States\" (Option B) stands out as the most fitting choice, as it extends beyond New England into other areas known for tolls."
