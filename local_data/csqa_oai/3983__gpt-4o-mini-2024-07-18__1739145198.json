  "query": "Question: Polly didn't know her way around, so she navigated by landmark.  She used statues, stores, and distinctive building.  Where might she be?\n\nChoices:\nA: countryside\nB: national park\nC: map\nD: neighbourhood\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes Polly using landmarks for navigation. Landmarks are typically prominent features in an area that help people orient themselves.",
    "Statues, stores, and distinctive buildings are specific types of landmarks, which suggests that she is in a populated area rather than a sparse or natural one.",
    "The countryside often lacks prominent landmarks like statues and stores, as it is more open and less developed.",
    "A national park is centered around nature and may have some landmarks, but it is not likely to have many stores or distinctive buildings as described in the scenario.",
    "A \"map\" is a tool for navigation but does not refer to a location where she might be.",
    "The term \"neighbourhood\" could imply a smaller area within a city, but it does not typically highlight distinctive landmarks such as statues or uniquely designed buildings as prominently as a city would.",
    "\"City\" usually encompasses a variety of landmarks, including statues and distinctive buildings, as well as stores, making it the most logical choice in this context.",
    "Considering Polly is navigating by using prominent landmarks, the most suitable option where such features are abundant is a city."
