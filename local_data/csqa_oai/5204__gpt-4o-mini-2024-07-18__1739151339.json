  "steps": [
    "The question asks what James put extra effort into at the fair, which implies an activity related to the fair itself.",
    "The options include activities that are not typically associated with a fair. For example, \"design software\" (B) and \"read book\" (C) do not relate to a fair context.",
    "Looking at the options, \"see exhibits\" (A) aligns well with the typical experience at a fair, where attendees usually explore various displays and attractions.",
    "The other options, such as \"use television\" (D) and \"eating dinner\" (E), also seem disconnected from the typical activities one would focus on at a fair.",
    "Since curiosity suggests an attraction to learning or experiencing new things, \"see exhibits\" (A) fits very well with that mentality.",
    "To confirm, I reflect on what it means to be curious at a fair: it would usually lead one to explore and observe the different exhibits available.",
    "Thus, I can conclude that putting extra effort into exploring exhibits would align perfectly with James\u2019s curiosity at the fair.",
    "I revisit each option one last time to ensure consistency, and it becomes clear that \"see exhibits\" remains the best choice based on the context of curiosity."
