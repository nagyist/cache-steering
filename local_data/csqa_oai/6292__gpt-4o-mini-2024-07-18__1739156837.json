  "steps": [
    "The word \"hooligans\" typically refers to unruly and disruptive individuals, often associated with sports, particularly in soccer.",
    "The use of \"roared through many chants\" suggests that the crowd was very vocal and engaged in traditional sports crowd behavior, which is common in soccer contexts.",
    "\"Smoke bombs\" are often used by fans in soccer matches to create a lively atmosphere, often seen in European soccer stadiums.",
    "While hooligans can be present at various sports events, their association is most commonly linked to soccer games.",
    "The phrase \"raucous\" helps to emphasize the noisy and chaotic atmosphere, further aligning with the behavior seen at soccer games, where passionate fan support can turn rowdy.",
    "\"Baseball stadium\" and \"football stadium\" do not typically align with the same level of disruptiveness associated with hooligan behavior.",
    "The term \"sports match\" is too vague and does not specify a particular sport where hooliganism is prevalent.",
    "Thus, among the choices provided, \"soccer game\" stands out as the most appropriate context for the described behavior and atmosphere."
