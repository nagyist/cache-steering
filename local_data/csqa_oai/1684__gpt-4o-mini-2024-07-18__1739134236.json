  "query": "Question: She was going to barbecue some kangaroo meat while camping in the outback, where was she?\n\nChoices:\nA: retail store\nB: detroit\nC: wyoming\nD: australia\nE: michigan park",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that she is going to barbecue kangaroo meat. Kangaroo is a native animal of Australia, which suggests that the activity is taking place in a location associated with kangaroos.",
    "The phrase \"while camping in the outback\" further indicates a specific environment typically found in Australia. The outback is a term used to describe the remote, less populated areas of Australia.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, we should identify which options are geographically connected to Australia.",
    "Choice A, \"retail store,\" does not specify a location and is not relevant to the question.",
    "Choice B, \"Detroit,\" is a city in the United States and has no connection to kangaroo meat or the outback.",
    "Choice C, \"Wyoming,\" is a state in the United States and also has no connection to kangaroo meat.",
    "Choice D, \"Australia,\" is directly associated with kangaroos and the outback, making it a very likely correct option.",
    "Choice E, \"Michigan park,\" is again a location in the United States and not related to the concept of camping in the Australian outback.",
    "After reviewing all the options and their geographical relevance to the context of kangaroo meat and camping in the outback, Australia emerges as the only viable option."
