  "query": "Question: Someone probably used more than one horse to make one of these?\n\nChoices:\nA: horseradish\nB: farmyard\nC: western movie\nD: canada\nE: race track",
  "steps": [
    "The question implies that something was created or produced using more than one horse.",
    "Option A: horseradish - This is a plant and does not involve horses in its production, so it is unlikely to fit.",
    "Option B: farmyard - While farmyards might have horses, they are not made from horses or require multiple horses for creation.",
    "Option C: western movie - Western movies often depict scenes with multiple horses, especially for stunts, riding, and visual appeal. They could be considered as being 'made' using many horses.",
    "Option D: canada - This is a country and does not involve any horses for its creation.",
    "Option E: race track - While race tracks are associated with horse racing, the track itself is not made from horses. It supports events but doesn't fit the implication of being 'made' by one or more horses.",
    "After evaluating all options, it is clear that option C, western movie, involves using multiple horses in its production as they are a central element in such films."
