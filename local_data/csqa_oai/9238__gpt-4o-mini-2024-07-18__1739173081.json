  "query": "Question: Where is a good place to plant an apple tree you just bought?\n\nChoices:\nA: pennsylvania\nB: across the street\nC: front yard\nD: countryside\nE: park",
  "steps": [
    "The apple tree needs certain conditions to thrive, such as sufficient sunlight, space, and good soil.",
    "Pennsylvania has a suitable climate for growing apple trees, but the specific location matters too.",
    "Being \"across the street\" may not provide the necessary conditions if the location is not suitable for planting.",
    "A \"front yard\" usually provides a controlled environment which might be a good place for the apple tree, depending on sunlight and space availability.",
    "The \"countryside\" is typically a good environment for planting trees with lots of space and fewer obstructions.",
    "A \"park\" could also provide a good environment, but it may not be practical if planting is not allowed.",
    "Comparing options, the \"front yard\" is immediately accessible, allowing for easier maintenance and monitoring.",
    "The \"countryside\" offers a favorable environment but might not be immediately accessible if the tree is just bought.",
    "I rule out \"across the street\" because it's not a defined planting area, and plants need to be placed in soil to thrive, not just parked.",
    "Considering all factors, the \"front yard\" combines accessibility and sufficient care opportunities for the newly bought apple tree."
