  "steps": [
    "Sam's parents are looking for long-term storage for his old toys, which implies that they need a place where items can be kept safely for an extended period of time.",
    "The options provided include a bed, basement, floor, and store. A bed and the floor typically do not offer suitable long-term storage solutions, as they are not specifically designed for storing items.",
    "Among the options, the basement is a common place for storing boxes and items that are not frequently used. Basements usually have enough space and are often kept dry, making them ideal for storage.",
    "The option 'store' suggests an external location, but it might not be practical for personal items like toys that need to be kept securely at home.",
    "Given that the other options (bed, floor) are less appropriate and 'store' isn't a realistic answer for keeping toys long-term in a residential scenario, 'basement' stands out as the best answer for where Sam's parents might put the boxes of toys."
