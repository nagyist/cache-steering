  "query": "Question: Though she made the cut years ago, its figurative scars would never what?\n\nChoices:\nA: joining\nB: put together\nC: stitch\nD: heal\nE: paste",
  "steps": [
    "The question uses the metaphor of \"figurative scars,\" which implies a sense of emotional or psychological hurt that remains over time.",
    "When we think about scars, we typically refer to the concept of healing; scars signify that there was once an injury, but they don't necessarily go away completely.",
    "The word \"never\" in the question suggests that whatever follows will not happen in relation to the scars.",
    "Looking through the provided choices, \"joining,\" \"put together,\" \"stitch,\" \"heal,\" and \"paste,\" we must consider which concept ties back to the idea of scars.",
    "\"Stitch\" seems more about the process of sewing something together rather than addressing the emotional weight of scars.",
    "\"Joining\" and \"put together\" also do not directly relate to the enduring nature of scars.",
    "\"Paste\" suggests an action of sticking something together, which again does not correlate to scars in the conventional emotional context.",
    "The most fitting choice here in relation to scars is \"heal.\" Scars may be present, but healing would indicate a recovery that does not fully happen.",
    "Thus, the phrase would logically complete as \"its figurative scars would never heal,\" indicating the lasting effect of the traumatic experience."
