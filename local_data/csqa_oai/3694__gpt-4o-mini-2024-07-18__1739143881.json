  "steps": [
    "Consider the likely vocabulary of an elementary-age child. They typically use simpler, more familiar words rather than complex terms.",
    "Analyze the options given: \"rubber,\" \"circular,\" \"spherical,\" \"round,\" and \"rolling down street.\" Some words are more common in everyday usage for young children.",
    "The word \"rubber\" might refer to the material of a ball, but children are more likely to identify shapes and familiar descriptors.",
    "The term \"circular\" is geometrically accurate but may not be as commonly used by young children when describing a ball.",
    "\"Spherical\" is a precise term that describes the shape of a ball, but it is likely too advanced for most elementary-age children.",
    "The word \"round\" is simple and aligns with the basic shape description of a ball that a child can readily understand.",
    "\"Rolling down street\" is a phrase and adds more context than just describing the ball itself. It's less likely to be a single descriptor that a child would use when asked to describe a ball.",
    "Evaluate the most likely word that balances simplicity and appropriateness for the context of describing a ball, which would lead to the conclusion that \"round\" fits best."
