  "steps": [
    "I need to understand why Van Gogh might fret over a painting that appeared different to him.",
    "Artists often have a specific vision for their work, and if it doesn't match that vision, they can become anxious or fearful.",
    "Van Gogh was known for his emotional connection to his art, and a painting appearing different could signify that it did not align with his artistic expectations.",
    "The choices presented involve various concepts. To identify what he might be scared of, I should consider which option relates to an emotional or aesthetic concern rather than something more literal like chickens or slashes.",
    "\u201cGreat relief\u201d suggests a positive emotion, which does not align with fretfulness.",
    "\u201cBeauty\u201d is typically something that is appreciated rather than feared; therefore, it is unlikely to be the choice.",
    "\u201cNew look\u201d can imply a deviation from his previous style or expectations, which makes it a strong candidate given the context of fretting about change.",
    "By elimination, \u201cslashes\u201d does not relate directly to emotional or aesthetic concerns in the same way that \u201cnew look\u201d does.",
    "Van Gogh's anxieties around his work often stemmed from evolving styles and whether they would be accepted or understood, indicating a fear of a \u201cnew look.\u201d",
    "Thus, I conclude that Van Gogh was scared of how his changes would be perceived, which ties directly to the notion of a \"new look.\""
