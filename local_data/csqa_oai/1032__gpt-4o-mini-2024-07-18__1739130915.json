  "query": "Question: What might a teacher do most during a week?\n\nChoices:\nA: demonstrate\nB: eat lunch\nC: time test\nD: work in school\nE: school children",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the nature of a teacher's responsibilities during a typical week. A teacher's primary role involves educational activities such as teaching and interacting with students.",
    "Consider the options provided. \"Demonstrate\" (A) suggests showing a concept which a teacher may do occasionally, but it is not comprehensive of their weekly duties.",
    "\"Eat lunch\" (B) is a necessary activity for any professional, but it does not represent a significant portion of a teacher's professional responsibilities.",
    "\"Time test\" (C) implies a specific activity that does not encompass the broad range of tasks a teacher undertakes.",
    "\"Work in school\" (D) indicates a broader concept. This could include lesson planning, grading, and interactions with students and faculty, which takes up a majority of a teacher's workweek.",
    "Finally, \"school children\" (E) is somewhat vague. While teachers do spend time with children, this does not specifically convey what they might do most during the week.",
    "After evaluating all options, \"work in school\" (D) captures the essence of a teacher's week more comprehensively than the other options."
