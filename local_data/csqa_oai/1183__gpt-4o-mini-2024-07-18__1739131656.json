  "query": "Question: A human is hitch hiking near Hoboken, where is he?\n\nChoices:\nA: new jersey\nB: homes\nC: department store\nD: near italy\nE: new orleans",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a human is hitchhiking near Hoboken.",
    "Hoboken is a city located in the state of New Jersey.",
    "The choice options include \"new jersey,\" which directly corresponds to the location of Hoboken.",
    "Other options like \"homes,\" \"department store,\" \"near italy,\" and \"new orleans\" do not logically relate to the specific place of Hoboken.",
    "Since Hoboken is well-known and located in New Jersey, the most relevant and accurate answer must be New Jersey.",
    "Verifying the relationship of the other options: \"homes\" is too vague, \"department store\" could exist anywhere, \"near italy\" is geographically incorrect, and \"new orleans\" is a different city in a different state.",
    "Therefore, the only answer that accurately reflects the location where the human is hitchhiking is \"new jersey.\""
