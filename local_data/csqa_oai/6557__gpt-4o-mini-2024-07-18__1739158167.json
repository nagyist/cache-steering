    "The word \"advantageous\" directly relates to gaining an advantage or a favorable situation.",
    "While \"excellent\" and \"exceptional\" imply high quality, they do not specifically denote a favorable position or benefit derived from a bad decision.",
    "\"Virtuous\" typically denotes moral excellence, which does not seem to apply to a situation of dumb luck resulting from a bad move.",
