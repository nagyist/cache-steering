  "steps": [
    "Malls are primarily known as shopping venues where people go to buy items.",
    "Apart from shopping, malls often serve as social spaces where people can meet and spend time together.",
    "Meeting friends is a common activity in malls as they provide a public space to gather.",
    "While purchasing and spending money are related to shopping, they are not activities in addition to going shopping; they are part of the shopping process itself.",
    "Walking is also something people do in malls, but it is generally more of a means to get from one store to another rather than an activity specific to malls.",
    "Comparing prices can happen in malls, but it is an aspect of shopping rather than a distinct activity.",
    "Considering the options, meeting friends is a social activity that is often highlighted in the context of malls.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, meeting friends stands out as a purposeful activity separate from shopping."
