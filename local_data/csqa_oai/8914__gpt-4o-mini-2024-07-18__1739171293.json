  "query": "Question: How does a human get around?\n\nChoices:\nA: homes\nB: apartment building\nC: home\nD: solar system\nE: bus",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the question, which is asking how a human typically gets around. This implies modes of transportation or methods of movement rather than locations.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices provided: A: homes, B: apartment building, C: home, D: solar system, and E: bus.",
    "Looking at choice A, \"homes\" generally refer to the places where people live, which doesn\u2019t address transportation.",
    "Choice B, \"apartment building,\" is similar and indicates a type of residence, rather than a means of getting around.",
    "Choice C, \"home,\" is also a type of dwelling and does not pertain to transportation.",
    "Choice D, \"solar system,\" is irrelevant as it refers to the astronomical context, not human movement.",
    "Finally, choice E, \"bus,\" represents a mode of public transportation and directly relates to how humans get around in urban settings or between locations.",
    "Since I\u2019m looking for the correct mode of transportation, \"bus\" is the only option that fits the criteria of the question."
