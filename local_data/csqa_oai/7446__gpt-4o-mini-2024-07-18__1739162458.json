  "query": "Question: Where might someone play with a frisbee?\n\nChoices:\nA: golf course\nB: park\nC: roof\nD: air\nE: deadhead's van",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the typical environments where recreational activities occur. Frisbee is primarily played in open, flat spaces.",
    "Next, evaluate each provided option in relation to these environments. A golf course may not be appropriate due to the presence of golf activities and the potential for damaging the course.",
    "Next, consider option B, which is a park. Parks are often designed for various recreational activities and are usually spacious, making them suitable for playing with a frisbee.",
    "Next, analyze option C, which is a roof. While it may be possible to throw a frisbee on a roof, the space is typically limited and not designed for such activities.",
    "Then, assess option D, which is simply air. Playing with a frisbee in the air is not a viable option, as one needs a surface or area to throw it.",
    "Finally, look at option E, which mentions a deadhead's van. This doesn't provide an appropriate or typical setting for playing frisbee, as it's not an open recreational space.",
    "Based on the analysis, parks provide the best environment for frisbee play, as they are spacious and designed for open activities."
