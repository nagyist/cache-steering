  "steps": [
    "The question asks why a tense person would listen to soft music.",
    "Soft music is often associated with relaxation and tranquility, which can help alleviate tension.",
    "People often use music as a means to cope with stress or anxiety by creating a calming atmosphere.",
    "Listening to soft music can lower heart rate and promote a sense of peace, making it appealing to someone who is feeling tense.",
    "The options given include relaxation, calm, hunger, deafness, and fall asleep.",
    "Options A (relaxation) and B (calm) both relate directly to the effects of soft music.",
    "While both relaxation and calm could be valid reasons for a tense person to listen to soft music, I need to determine which is more directly relevant.",
    "Relaxation typically implies a state that one actively seeks, while calm can describe the state achieved through various means, including listening to music.",
    "Given that relaxation closely aligns with the goals of a tense person when seeking out soft music, it is a strong candidate for the answer.",
    "I can discard hunger, deafness, and fall asleep as these do not logically connect with the act of listening to soft music for alleviating tension."
