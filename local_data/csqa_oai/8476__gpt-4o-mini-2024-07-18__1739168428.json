  "query": "Question: The student didn't have a dictionary at the dorm, so the student went where?\n\nChoices:\nA: library\nB: classroom\nC: shelf\nD: table\nE: encyclopedia",
  "steps": [
    "The student needs a dictionary to look up definitions or words.",
    "The student is currently in the dorm and does not have access to a dictionary there.",
    "To find a dictionary, the student would likely need to go to a place where dictionaries are commonly available.",
    "The classroom is not likely a good place to find a dictionary readily available, as they may not be provided there.",
    "The table and shelf options do not logically lead to a location where one would find a dictionary.",
    "The encyclopedia option suggests another type of reference material, but it does not specifically help in finding a dictionary.",
    "A library is a well-known place that provides access to various reference materials, including dictionaries.",
    "Therefore, if the student did not have a dictionary at the dorm, the most logical option to find one would be the library."
