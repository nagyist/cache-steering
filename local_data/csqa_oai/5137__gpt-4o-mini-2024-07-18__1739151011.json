  "query": "Question: The company didn't have any local stores.  How did they sell things?\n\nChoices:\nA: ship goods\nB: mail order\nC: own resources\nD: peddled\nE: branch out",
  "steps": [
    "The company didn't have any local stores, which implies they need an alternative method to sell their products.",
    "Options such as \"own resources\" and \"branch out\" do not directly relate to how they would sell items, as these terms describe company operations rather than sales methods.",
    "\"Peddled\" implies selling directly to consumers but does not suggest a structured method, especially without physical stores.",
    "\"Mail order\" directly suggests a method for selling products without local presence, where customers place orders to receive goods via the postal service.",
    "\"Ship goods\" could also be a sales method, but it implies they still would need to have a local or warehouse structure to ship from, which is not indicated.",
    "Evaluating the two viable options, \"mail order\" and \"ship goods,\" the former is more straightforward as it explicitly describes a sales model that caters to the absence of local stores.",
    "Additionally, \"mail order\" was a common practice for companies without a physical presence in local markets, especially historically.",
    "In conclusion, based on the clarity of correspondence with the question and considering the alternative methods available, \"mail order\" stands out as the most fitting response."
