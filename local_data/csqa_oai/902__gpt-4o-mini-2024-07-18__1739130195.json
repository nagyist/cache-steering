  "query": "Question: What should the bean bag chair sit on?\n\nChoices:\nA: house\nB: den\nC: family room\nD: wood\nE: floor",
  "steps": [
    "First, we should consider the primary function of a bean bag chair. It is a piece of furniture designed for sitting or lounging.",
    "Next, we examine where one typically uses a bean bag chair. Common locations are living spaces, such as family rooms, dens, or playrooms.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options provided.",
    "Option A, \"house,\" is too broad and not a specific location for the chair to rest on.",
    "Option B, \"den,\" could be a suitable place for a bean bag chair, but it is less common than family rooms where these chairs are often placed.",
    "Option C, \"family room,\" is a practical and common location for a bean bag chair. It is often where people gather to relax.",
    "Option D, \"wood,\" does not apply as a place for the chair since it does not represent a location where the chair would sit. It simply refers to a material.",
    "Option E, \"floor,\" is a very relevant answer because bean bag chairs are designed to sit directly on the floor.",
    "Now, we must determine if the most common, practical space for bean bag chairs is a room type or a surface.",
    "Considering the common usage, while the family room is a significant location for a bean bag chair, the most accurate answer regarding what it should sit on is indeed the floor."
