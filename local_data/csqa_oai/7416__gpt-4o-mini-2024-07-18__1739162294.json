  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the emotional response of a human when their friends \"ditch\" or abandon them.",
    "The phrase \"ditch them\" typically implies feelings of abandonment and disappointment.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided to see which aligns with feelings of being let down or disappointed.",
    "Choice A, \"let down,\" directly suggests a feeling of disappointment when friends do not show up or abandon you.",
    "Choice B, \"better himself,\" does not fit well as it does not describe a feeling related to being ditched.",
    "Choice C, \"bored,\" is not a strong emotional response typically associated with being abandoned by friends.",
    "Choice D, \"row boat,\" seems out of context and does not relate to feelings associated with friendships or abandonment.",
    "Choice E, \"turn away,\" could imply a response to feeling hurt, but it does not capture the primary feeling of disappointment as explicitly as \"let down.\"",
    "Since \"let down\" (Choice A) matches the described emotional reaction more closely than any other options, it is the most appropriate choice."
