  "query": "Question: Where are horses found with jockeys?\n\nChoices:\nA: magazines\nB: race track\nC: countryside\nD: fair\nE: kept in barn stalls",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where horses compete with jockeys, I need to consider the context in which jockeys are typically associated with horses.",
    "Jockeys are professional riders who participate in horse racing events, which means they naturally need a suitable location for races.",
    "Among the provided options, the race track stands out as a traditional venue for horse races where jockeys ride horses.",
    "Magazines (choice A) do not provide a physical location for races; they might feature stories about racing but not host actual events.",
    "The countryside (choice C) describes a general area where horses might be found but is not specific to the competitive environment with jockeys.",
    "Fair (choice D) can imply a gathering or event but does not specifically indicate a location focused on horse racing with jockeys.",
    "Keeping horses in barn stalls (choice E) denotes where horses are stored or cared for, but it does not indicate where jockeys ride or race horses.",
    "Since the race track is the only choice specifically associated with organized horse racing involving jockeys, it is the best answer."
