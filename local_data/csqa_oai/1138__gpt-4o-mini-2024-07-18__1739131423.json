  "query": "Question: If you lock your knees while standing in line, what may you experience?\n\nChoices:\nA: boredom\nB: order\nC: main\nD: fainting\nE: agitation",
  "steps": [
    "When you lock your knees while standing, you restrict blood flow to your brain due to the way blood circulates when your legs are straight and locked.",
    "This restricted blood flow can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which is detrimental to maintaining consciousness.",
    "The act of standing still for a long time, especially with locked knees, further exacerbates the situation since muscle contractions that normally help pump blood back to the heart are less effective.",
    "As blood flow to the brain decreases, one may experience dizziness or lightheadedness.",
    "If the blood flow continues to be insufficient, fainting can occur as a protective mechanism of the body to regain proper blood flow to vital organs, particularly the brain.",
    "I review the other options: boredom, order, main, and agitation. Boredom and agitation are unlikely to affect one's physical state to lead to fainting. Order is irrelevant to the physical condition, and 'main' does not connect to the scenario at all.",
    "Therefore, the only logical answer that matches this scenario, considering the physiological effects of locking knees, is fainting."
