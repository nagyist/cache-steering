  "query": "Question: In order to sneeze one must do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: inhale\nB: fart\nC: close eyes\nD: spray\nE: blow nose",
  "steps": [
    "To understand the process of sneezing, we need to establish the physiological steps that lead to a sneeze.",
    "Sneezing is typically initiated by an irritation in the nasal cavity or throat, which signals the body to expel air forcefully to relieve the irritation.",
    "One common trigger for sneezing is inhalation; when one inhales, it can bring irritants into the nasal passages.",
    "The act of inhaling itself can generate the urge to sneeze as it allows air (along with any irritants) to enter the nostrils and stimulate the sensory nerves there.",
    "Closing one's eyes is often a reflexive action that occurs during a sneeze but is not a prerequisite for the act of sneezing itself.",
    "Farting and blowing the nose are unrelated actions to the mechanism of sneezing; they don't directly facilitate the sneeze process.",
    "Spraying saliva or mucus occurs during sneezing but again is a result of the action rather than a necessary step to initiate a sneeze.",
    "Among the provided options, inhaling is the most foundational action required before a sneeze can occur.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer to what must happen to initiate a sneeze is to inhale."
