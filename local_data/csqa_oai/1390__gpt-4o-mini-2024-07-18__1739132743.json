  "query": "Question: The farmer sought an apple tree cultivar that was hardy in the western United States, where was he looking to plant it?\n\nChoices:\nA: rhode island\nB: texas\nC: new york\nD: idaho\nE: new hampshire",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that the farmer is looking for an apple tree cultivar that is hardy in the western United States. This indicates that the area of focus is specifically towards the western part of the country.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each of the answer choices to determine which of them is located in the western United States.",
    "Rhode Island, located in the northeastern US, is not considered part of the western United States. Thus, it does not fulfill the criteria.",
    "Texas, while large and geographically diverse, is primarily regarded as a southwestern state, not exclusively western. However, certain parts of Texas could be considered western. Therefore, it could still be a potential candidate.",
    "New York, similar to Rhode Island, is located in the northeastern part of the US, and therefore is not suitable for \"western\" criteria.",
    "Idaho is located in the northwestern part of the US, making it a strong candidate for a location where one might look to plant a hardy apple tree cultivar.",
    "New Hampshire is also a northeastern state, which again disqualifies it as a suitable option for the western United States.",
    "At this point, the remaining candidates are Texas and Idaho for being in the western regions. However, Idaho is more accurately characterized as entirely within the western United States compared to Texas.",
    "The final decision must consider that the question emphasizes a hardy cultivar specifically for the western US environment. Idaho more naturally fits this description."
