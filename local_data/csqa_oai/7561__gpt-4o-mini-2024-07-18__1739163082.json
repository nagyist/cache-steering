  "query": "Question: What is something that studios spend a lot of money on?\n\nChoices:\nA: movies\nB: pocket\nC: trains\nD: subway\nE: carpet",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of studios, which primarily produce visual content like films, television shows, and other forms of media.",
    "Next, analyze the choices provided. \"Movies\" (A) is directly related to a studio's primary output, which typically incurs significant costs.",
    "Now, evaluate the other options. \"Pocket\" (B) does not seem relevant to studio expenses, as it's a personal item and not a production cost.",
    "Next, \"Trains\" (C) could be a part of production, particularly for scenes requiring train travel, but this is niche and not a typical major expense.",
    "Evaluate \"Subway\" (D); like trains, it might be used in specific scenes but is not a major ticket item for studios overall.",
    "Finally, consider \"Carpet\" (E). While studios may buy carpets for studios or sets, this expense is relatively minor compared to the costs associated with movie production.",
    "After comparing all options, it becomes clear that producing \"movies\" (A) involves a wide range of expenses including actors, sets, crew, effects, and marketing, making it the most significant expense."
