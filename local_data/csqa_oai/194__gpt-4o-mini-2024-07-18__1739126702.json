  "query": "Question: What do people in the same family often share?\n\nChoices:\nA: brown hair\nB: names\nC: two eyes\nD: will\nE: brains",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking what people in the same family commonly have in common.",
    "Looking at the options, we can analyze each one for relevance to family.",
    "Option A: \"brown hair\" - While some families share hair color, not all family members will share the same color, so this is not universally true.",
    "Option B: \"names\" - Families often share last names and sometimes first names, especially in certain cultures. This is a strong contender.",
    "Option C: \"two eyes\" - This is a universal trait among humans, not specific to families, so it does not apply.",
    "Option D: \"will\" - While families can have wills, not every family member will share a will, and it is more of a legal document than a familial trait.",
    "Option E: \"brains\" - This is also a general biological fact and not specific to familial relationships.",
    "Based on this analysis, option B (\"names\") is the most relevant answer because family members often share the same last name and sometimes have similar or identical first names."
