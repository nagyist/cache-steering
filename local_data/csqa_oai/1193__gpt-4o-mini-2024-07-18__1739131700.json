  "query": "Question: Where would using a boat require navigation skills?\n\nChoices:\nA: boattail\nB: river\nC: indiana\nD: garage\nE: ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the locations where navigation skills are important for operating a boat effectively.",
    "Boating typically requires navigation skills in environments where there are currents, tides, or obstacles to avoid, which would be more common in open bodies of water.",
    "The terms presented in the options include boattail, river, Indiana, garage, and ocean.",
    "\"Boattail\" is a term related to a specific automotive design and does not refer to a location where navigation skills would be applicable.",
    "\"Garage\" is a storage space for boats and does not involve navigation or operating in water.",
    "\"Indiana\" is a state that has many rivers and lakes, but it is not exclusively a navigational water body; some areas might not require advanced navigation skills.",
    "\"River\" is a dynamic body of water where navigation skills are crucial due to changing currents, possible obstacles, and varying widths.",
    "\"Ocean\" is the vast body of saltwater where navigation skills are essential due to its size, currents, tides, and potential hazards, making it necessary for a boat operator to possess navigational abilities.",
    "Comparing \"river\" and \"ocean,\" both require navigation skills, but the ocean presents more complex navigation challenges due to its expanse and variations in conditions.",
    "Thus, while both options indicate places where navigation skills are needed, the ocean typically represents a higher necessity for such skills."
