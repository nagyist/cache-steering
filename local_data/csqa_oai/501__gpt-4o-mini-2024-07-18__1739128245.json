    "The question mentions \"a song and dance,\" which typically refers to a performance that incorporates both singing and choreography.",
    "Among the given choices, \"musical\" is the term most commonly associated with a theatrical performance featuring both songs and dance numbers.",
    "\"Bollywood\" refers to a specific film industry known for musicals, but it is not synonymous with the general term for a movie that features songs and dance.",
    "\"Record\" pertains to audio recordings and does not describe a type of movie.",
    "\"Jukebox\" usually refers to a machine that plays music but can also mean a film that features popular songs; however, it lacks the comprehensive musical aspect.",
    "\"Napster\" is a music-sharing service and is unrelated to movies or performance genres.",
    "Thus, after evaluating each option in light of the context of the question, \"musical\" best encapsulates what kind of movie it is, as it explicitly denotes a film that prominently features song and dance."
