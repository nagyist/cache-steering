  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which option is most closely related to the storage of cold food.",
    "I recall that cold food typically requires a specific environment to prevent spoilage, which usually involves low temperatures.",
    "I look at the options. Disneyland is a theme park and not a storage option.",
    "A shop could have refrigerators but isn't specifically a place dedicated solely to cold food storage.",
    "Obesity is a health condition and does not relate to food storage at all.",
    "A table is an open surface and wouldn't maintain cold temperatures; it\u2019s not used for storing food.",
    "The only remaining option that explicitly represents a means of cold storage is 'refrigerators', as they are specifically designed to store food at cold temperatures.",
    "I confirm that 'refrigerators' is the common household appliance designed for storing cold food.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it\u2019s clear that the best answer for storing cold food is 'B: refrigerators'."
