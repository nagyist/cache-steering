  "query": "Question: It was t he biggest concert in town, there wasn't an empty seat in the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: theatre\nB: building\nC: show\nD: airplane\nE: auditorium",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that it was a major concert with no empty seats, which suggests a venue related to performances or events.",
    "Options include 'theatre', 'building', 'show', 'airplane', and 'auditorium'. I will analyze each option's relevance to the context of a concert.",
    "A 'theatre' is a common venue for performances such as concerts, so it could potentially be the answer.",
    "A 'building' is too general and does not specifically relate to music performances or concerts.",
    "A 'show' is more about the event itself rather than the venue. So, it is not applicable.",
    "An 'airplane' is not a plausible setting for a concert, as it is generally not associated with performances.",
    "An 'auditorium' is a specific type of venue designed for performances, including concerts, which also fits the context of the question.",
    "Comparing 'theatre' and 'auditorium': both serve as performance venues, but 'auditorium' is often more specifically related to concerts and large gatherings when the question mentions no empty seats.",
    "Thus, the best fitting answer considering all reasoning is 'auditorium' over 'theatre' and the other options."
