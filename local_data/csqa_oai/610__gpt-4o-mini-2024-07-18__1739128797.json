  "query": "Question: When a monkey is taken away from their home they are often brought to this place where people wear white coats.\n\nChoices:\nA: rain forest\nB: research laboratory\nC: cage\nD: treetops\nE: south africa",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a monkey is taken away from its home, which implies a situation where the monkey is removed from its natural habitat.",
    "The mention of \"people wear white coats\" suggests a professional or scientific setting, where white coats are typically worn by medical or research personnel.",
    "Out of the provided options, the only place that fits the description of a professional environment where research or scientific work is conducted is a \"research laboratory.\"",
    "The other options, such as \"rain forest,\" \"cage,\" \"treetops,\" and \"south africa,\" do not fit the description of a location where people commonly wear white coats.",
    "While \"cage\" might seem relevant for housing a monkey, it does not fit the context of a place where scientists or researchers in white coats would be working.",
    "I will now evaluate each option against the criteria of a scientific facility associated with people wearing white coats.",
    "\"Rain forest\" (A) is a habitat, not a man-made facility; hence inappropriate.",
    "\"Research laboratory\" (B) fits perfectly as it indicates a scientific environment concerned with studying or researching animals.",
    "\"Cage\" (C) refers to confinement, but does not imply the presence of professionals in lab coats.",
    "\"Treetops\" (D) again refers to a natural habitat rather than a scientific environment.",
    "\"South Africa\" (E) is a geographical location, but it does not specifically address a facility where monkeys are brought when taken from their homes."
