  "query": "Question: Where is a common gathering place for adults often the football field?\n\nChoices:\nA: college campus\nB: high school\nC: sports\nD: oklahoma\nE: school campus",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a \"gathering place for adults\" means in relation to the context of a football field.",
    "Next, think about the locations associated with a football field; these could include various educational institutions or sporting events.",
    "A football field is commonly found in both high schools and colleges, as well as in certain recreational facilities and professional sports areas.",
    "Evaluate the options provided: A (college campus), B (high school), C (sports), D (Oklahoma), and E (school campus).",
    "Assess A (college campus): Many college campuses have football fields where adults gather for games and events.",
    "Assess B (high school): High schools also have football fields and adults may gather, but this primarily involves families and friends of students, rather than adults in general.",
    "Assess C (sports): The term \u201csports\u201d describes activities that involve football fields but is not a specific gathering place.",
    "Assess D (Oklahoma): While Oklahoma has football fields and teams, it doesn\u2019t directly correlate to a common gathering place.",
    "Assess E (school campus): This overlaps with the idea of high school and college campuses but is also not specific enough for just adults.",
    "Since both college campuses and high school campuses can be considered common gathering places for adults at football games, the best option that captures a more universal setting would be college campuses, acknowledging that they are places adults gather primarily for sports events."
