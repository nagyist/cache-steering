  "query": "Question: What happens to a person on stairs after getting drunk?\n\nChoices:\nA: death\nB: lower standards\nC: trip\nD: violence\nE: falling down",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the effects of alcohol on coordination and balance. Alcohol consumption typically impairs motor skills, making it difficult to navigate physical spaces.",
    "Next, evaluate the specific scenario of being on stairs. Stairs present a physical challenge that requires good balance and coordination to navigate safely.",
    "From the previous steps, one can logically deduce that someone who is drunk would likely struggle more than a sober person in maintaining their balance while using stairs.",
    "Now, look at the choices provided. \"Death\" (A) is an extreme outcome and not the most immediate result of being drunk on stairs, while \"lower standards\" (B) doesn't pertain to physical actions.",
    "The choice \"violence\" (D) does not directly connect to stumbling or falling on stairs but could be indirectly related to being drunk in general.",
    "\"Trip\" (C) and \"falling down\" (E) both imply losing balance. However, tripping can lead to falling as a consequence.",
    "Considering the phrases \"trip\" and \"falling down,\" it seems that \"falling down\" is a more serious outcome that results from a trip but is not directly synonymous.",
    "If a person trips while going up or down stairs while drunk, it is very likely that they will fall as a result.",
    "Therefore, whilst both \"trip\" and \"falling down\" are relevant, \"falling down\" can be seen as a more conclusive and serious outcome following a trip.",
    "Finally, since the question asks for what happens after a person gets drunk on stairs, falling down encompasses the result of tripping and thus seems the most appropriate answer."
