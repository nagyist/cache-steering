  "query": "Question: The back courtyard was common feature of every house in the neighborhood, where could they be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: palace\nB: poor suburbs\nC: suburbs\nD: country estate\nE: large house",
  "steps": [
    "I will analyze the term \"back courtyard\" to understand its commonality and the types of residences it may be associated with.",
    "A back courtyard is typically an outdoor area behind a house, often used for various recreational activities or gardening.",
    "I will consider which types of locations, among the choices given, would likely have a back courtyard as a common feature.",
    "Palaces generally have large grounds and courtyards, but the term \"common feature\" suggests it is more prevalent in regular housing situations rather than luxurious ones.",
    "\"Poor suburbs\" usually refer to areas with lower-income housing, which might not have well-maintained courtyards, making it less likely for back courtyards to be a common feature.",
    "\"Suburbs\" generally consist of residential homes, where back courtyards are common as they provide space for families and outdoor activities.",
    "A \"country estate\" would likely have more expansive grounds and possibly courtyards, but again, it may not be as \"common\" as in suburbia where many homes are similar in structure.",
    "A \"large house\" could denote homes with courtyards, but the definition is broader and does not imply that every large house will have one, thus making it less specific than suburbs.",
    "Considering all the above reasoning, \"suburbs\" stands out as the area where back courtyards are most likely universal among houses since they are often family-oriented residential neighborhoods."
