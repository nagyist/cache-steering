  "steps": [
    "The question refers to how sunlight behaves as it travels away from the sun and interacts with surrounding space, specifically noting that its intensity decreases as it spreads out.",
    "From basic physics, light spreads out in all directions from a source, which is a characteristic of how light behaves in space.",
    "The options presented include specific locations (like 'locked room', 'attic', and 'desk') and broader locations (like 'universe' and 'ocean').",
    "A 'locked room', 'attic', and 'desk' all imply enclosed or small spaces, where one might not consider light spreading out significantly, but rather being confined or absorbed.",
    "In contrast, 'ocean' can absorb light but doesn't reflect the concept of light spreading out into a vast area.",
    "The term 'universe' relates to the infinite expanse that is outer space, where the concept of light spreading out can be accurately applied, as it encompasses all locations and is vast.",
    "Thus, compared to the other options, 'universe' is the only choice that aligns directly with the idea of light dispersing and becoming weaker over a large area.",
    "Given that the question is asking about where light from the sun goes as it spreads out, the logical conclusion is that it spreads out into the universe."
