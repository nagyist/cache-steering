  "query": "Question: If someone is typing, what are they doing?\n\nChoices:\nA: letter\nB: indeterminate\nC: communicating\nD: communication\nE: sentences",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what someone is doing when they are typing.",
    "Typing typically involves producing text, usually on a computer or typewriter.",
    "The act of typing strongly suggests that the person is creating written content.",
    "Written content is often a form of communication with others.",
    "We can differentiate the options: \n- A (letter) refers to a specific format of writing.\n- B (indeterminate) suggests uncertainty, which doesn\u2019t apply here.\n- C (communicating) indicates the act of sharing information through written text.\n- D (communication) serves as a broader term for the exchange of information.\n- E (sentences) specifies the structure that may be typed, but doesn\u2019t capture the action itself.",
    "While \"communication\" is the overarching concept for sharing ideas, \"communicating\" directly describes the act being performed while typing.",
    "Therefore, the best match for what someone is doing when typing is \"communicating.\""
