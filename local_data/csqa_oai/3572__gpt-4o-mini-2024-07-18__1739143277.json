  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where one typically buys prescription suntan lotion, which implies a need for a non-over-the-counter product.",
    "I should consider the choices given to determine which one is most suitable for purchasing prescription medication.",
    "Choice A: beach bag does not make sense as it refers to a location one would carry items rather than a place to purchase lotion.",
    "Choice B: grocery store could have a pharmacy section, but it is not primarily known as a place for prescriptions.",
    "Choice C: pharmacy is specifically known for selling prescription medications, including skincare products recommended by a doctor.",
    "Choice D: shop is too vague and does not specifically refer to a place that deals with prescriptions.",
    "Choice E: tanning salon might sell suntan lotions but typically does not offer prescription products.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the best choice for purchasing prescription suntan lotion is a pharmacy, as it directly relates to obtaining medications."
