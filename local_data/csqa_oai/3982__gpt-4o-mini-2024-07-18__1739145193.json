  "query": "Question: Where would you buy a disk with software on it?\n\nChoices:\nA: computer hard drive\nB: computer to store data\nC: cd player\nD: computer store\nE: electronic department",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what a disk with software on it typically refers to. Usually, this means a CD, DVD, or possibly a floppy disk that contains a software program.",
    "Next, consider the appropriate location to buy such disks. A computer store would likely have a variety of software disks available for purchase.",
    "Examine the other options provided: \n- A computer hard drive is where software might be stored but is not a place to buy disks.\n- A computer to store data does not apply as it's also not a purchase location.\n- A CD player is used to play disks, but does not sell them.\n- An electronic department might sell computer-related items, but it is less specific than a computer store.",
    "Therefore, of the choices, a computer store specifically focuses on selling computers and related software, making it the most suitable answer."
