  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the common characteristics of each location listed in the choices regarding fire safety and evacuation routes.",
    "A house generally has easy access to exits on the first and second floors. However, the safety can depend on the structure and the presence of smoke alarms.",
    "In an office building, safety features such as fire alarms, sprinklers, and emergency exits are typically more sophisticated, but the risk may be higher given the larger number of people and potential obstacles.",
    "A parking space is usually an open area with limited structure, making it less likely to provide any safety in the case of fire as it wouldn't be as accessible.",
    "In a school, similar to office buildings, while safety measures are in place, schools may have many exits for evacuation, but they can also be crowded and chaotic during an emergency.",
    "In a hotel, the first and second floors often have designated fire exits and must adhere to strict building codes regarding fire safety, which can make these floors relatively safe.",
    "Considering that staying on the second floor may provide a quicker escape route to the ground if situated near the stairwell, it could be advantageous in both hotels and larger buildings.",
    "However, hotels often have systems in place for safely evacuating guests, which is a crucial factor.",
    "By comparing all options, the hotel stands out as being designed primarily for people who are temporarily staying and thus has specific safety measures in place, like fire alarms and clear exit paths.",
    "Based on the analysis, hotels provide the safest environment in terms of being on the first or second floor while away from home."
