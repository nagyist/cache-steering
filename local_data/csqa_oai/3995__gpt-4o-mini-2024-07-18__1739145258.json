  "query": "Question: Where do airplanes usually go?\n\nChoices:\nA: war\nB: aircraft carrier\nC: crash\nD: taxi\nE: sky",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the primary function of airplanes, which is to transport passengers and cargo.",
    "Identify the typical destinations for commercial flights, which include airports and other landing sites.",
    "Analyze each choice: \n- A: war - while airplanes can be used in war, this is not a typical destination for all airplanes.\n- B: aircraft carrier - this is a specific military context and not general for all airplanes.\n- C: crash - this is an unfortunate event and not a destination.\n- D: taxi - refers to land vehicles moving on the ground, not applicable to airplanes.\n- E: sky - airplanes fly in the sky as part of their normal operation.",
    "Evaluate the most suitable choice that aligns with where airplanes usually go during their flights.",
    "Conclude that \"sky\" represents the area where airplanes primarily operate as they travel from one location to another."
