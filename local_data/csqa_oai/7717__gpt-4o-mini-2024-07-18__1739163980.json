  "query": "Question: Where are you likely to receive mouthwash in a little paper cup?\n\nChoices:\nA: bottle\nB: drug store\nC: dentist's office\nD: doctor office\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context in which mouthwash is commonly distributed or provided. Mouthwash is often given in settings that emphasize oral hygiene.",
    "Next, look at the options. A \u201cbottle\u201d and \u201cbathroom\u201d don\u2019t typically involve receiving mouthwash in a paper cup; you usually use a full bottle or a container used at home.",
    "A \u201cdrug store\u201d might provide mouthwash, but they typically sell it in bottles, not in small paper cups that are designed for immediate use.",
    "\u201cDentist's office\u201d is a strong contender because patients often rinse with mouthwash during dental cleanings or procedures, and it is frequently provided in small cups.",
    "Examine \u201cdoctor office.\u201d While doctors may have oral health discussions, they are less likely to provide mouthwash, as it\u2019s not a primary focus in typical medical practices compared to dental care.",
    "Based on the analysis, the situation where you would receive mouthwash specifically in a little paper cup aligns with the practices found in a dental setting.",
    "Review all possibilities: drug stores sell items, bathrooms have products, but dentist offices specifically carry out procedures where small quantities of mouthwash are provided right before or after treatments.",
    "Make a final confirmation against all options to ensure that the dentist's office stands out as the most relevant location given the specific scenario described."
