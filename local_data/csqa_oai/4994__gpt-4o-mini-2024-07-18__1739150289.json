  "query": "Question: Tweed is a fabric I am looking to make clothing with, where should I go to buy some?\n\nChoices:\nA: clothing stores\nB: scotland\nC: eddie bauer\nD: fabric store\nE: online",
  "steps": [
    "Tweed is a specific type of fabric, traditionally associated with Scotland. Therefore, one might think of Scotland first as a potential source.",
    "Clothing stores typically sell ready-made garments and may not have a wide selection of specific fabrics like tweed. They are not the best option for purchasing fabric directly.",
    "Eddie Bauer is a clothing brand known for offering outdoor and casual wear. They might use tweed in some designs, but they do not primarily act as a fabric retailer.",
    "Fabric stores specialize in selling various types of fabrics, including tweed. This makes fabric stores a strong contender for the best place to buy tweed fabric.",
    "Shopping online can also be a viable alternative. There are many online retailers that offer a variety of fabrics, including tweed, which might also provide convenience and variety.",
    "Comparing options, clothing stores and Eddie Bauer are less likely to provide the tweed fabric itself, as they focus on finished clothing.",
    "Between a fabric store and online shopping, both options are quite promising, but fabric stores allow for hands-on inspection of the fabric, which some buyers may prefer.",
    "In conclusion, considering the specificity of the product and the most suitable places for purchasing it, a fabric store is likely the best answer."
