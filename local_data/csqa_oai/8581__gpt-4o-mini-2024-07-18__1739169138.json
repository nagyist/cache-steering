  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a location to keep a chair for tossing clothes on before going to bed.",
    "I need to consider the typical activities one does before retiring for the evening, which usually occur in a bedroom.",
    "An airport is not a suitable place to keep a chair for this purpose as it's not a personal space.",
    "The floor could technically work, but it\u2019s not an ideal or tidy option to toss clothes onto.",
    "An office is primarily used for work and isn\u2019t the right environment for tossing clothes before bed.",
    "The bedroom is where people usually change into sleepwear and it\u2019s logical to have a chair in that space for tossing clothes.",
    "Examining the choices, I find \"bedroom\" is directly related to the activity of retiring for the evening.",
    "Thus, the best location from the options provided is clearly the bedroom."
