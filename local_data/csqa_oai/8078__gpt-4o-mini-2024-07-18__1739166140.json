  "query": "Question: A cemetery surrounded by many houses and businesses is located in what area?\n\nChoices:\nA: city\nB: churchyard\nC: most cities\nD: ocean\nE: field",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a cemetery. Cemeteries are places designated for burying the dead, often established in communities for the convenience of families and friends of the deceased.",
    "Next, evaluate the description of the cemetery being surrounded by many houses and businesses. This suggests an urban or suburban environment rather than a rural one.",
    "Analyze the options provided. Option A, \"city,\" refers to an urban area, which aligns well with a cemetery surrounded by houses and businesses.",
    "Examine option B, \"churchyard.\" This typically refers to an area specifically associated with a church, which may not fit the description of being surrounded by many houses and businesses.",
    "Consider option C, \"most cities.\" While a cemetery can be found in many cities, this is less precise than just saying it is in a city.",
    "Assess option D, \"ocean.\" This is irrelevant as oceans do not contain cemeteries surrounded by houses and businesses.",
    "Review option E, \"field.\" While a cemetery could be located in a field, the description indicates a more developed area with houses and businesses.",
    "After considering all options, the best fit for a cemetery surrounded by many houses and businesses is simply \"city.\""
