  "steps": [
    "First, identify what happens to the body after exercising hard. When someone exercises, their body temperature rises, and they often sweat to cool down.",
    "Next, consider what \"cooling off too quickly\" implies. If Sarah cooled off too quickly, her body might not have adjusted properly to the temperature change, which could lead to a sensation of being too cold.",
    "In a situation where the body cools down too fast, one common response is shivering, which is a reflex to generate heat.",
    "Evaluate the choices given:\n- A: relaxation - This does not directly occur in response to cooling off; it usually comes after physical activity.\n- B: sweating - This happens during exercise as a cooling method, but not after cooling off.\n- C: shivering - This is a physiological response to cold, fitting well with cooling off too quickly.\n- D: palpitate - This refers to an irregular heartbeat and is unrelated to the body cooling off.\n- E: chills - While this is related to feeling cold, it's generally a symptom rather than an active response like shivering.",
    "Since shivering is a direct response to feeling too cold and fits the context of cooling off too quickly, it makes the most sense.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate answer to the question of what Sarah started doing as a result of cooling off too quickly is shivering."
