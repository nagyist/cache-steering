  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the primary emotion associated with feeling sad. Sadness typically relates to feelings of sorrow or loss.",
    "Next, I examine the choices provided to see which directly correlates with feeling sad.",
    "Choice A is \"sorrow,\" which is often considered a synonym for sadness and indicates a deep emotional response to a negative situation.",
    "Choice B is \"embarrassment,\" which is generally more associated with feelings of shame or self-consciousness, not directly tied to sadness.",
    "Choice C is \"pain.\" While sadness can be painful, this term is more physical or emotional distress rather than a description of the feeling itself.",
    "Choice D is \"sleepy,\" which is unrelated to any feelings of sadness and is more about fatigue or drowsiness.",
    "Choice E is \"panic,\" which indicates fear or anxiety, again not directly related to sadness.",
    "After reviewing all choices, \"sorrow\" (A) closely aligns with the feeling of sadness whereas the others do not encapsulate that emotion as directly."
