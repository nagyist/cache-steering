  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that evening is beginning to fall, suggesting that it is transitioning from day to night.",
    "Animals that are described as coming to life in the woods during this time would typically be those that are active at night.",
    "This infers that the animals prefer the nighttime environment, as evening leads into night.",
    "Since options A, C, D, and E refer to periods either during the day or very early in the morning (which is not the focus of the question), they are less likely to be correct.",
    "In contrast, option B directly relates to the aspect of night, which aligns with the behavior of nocturnal animals.",
    "Furthermore, the phrase \"coming to life\" suggests an increase in activity that typically occurs at night rather than during the preceding times of the day.",
    "Concluding, option B is the most fitting answer concerning the context provided."
