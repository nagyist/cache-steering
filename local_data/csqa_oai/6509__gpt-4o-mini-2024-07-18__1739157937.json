  "query": "Question: While in a zoological park where would you find a bald eagle?\n\nChoices:\nA: painting\nB: aviary\nC: the aquarium\nD: in washington\nE: rural area",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify where bald eagles are typically housed in a zoological park setting.",
    "Bald eagles are birds, which means they require environments that cater to their needs for space and flight.",
    "Aviaries are specifically designed spaces in zoos or parks that allow birds to fly and are suitable for displaying a variety of avian species.",
    "Aquariums, on the other hand, are designed for aquatic life, which does not accommodate eagles.",
    "The option \"painting\" is unrelated to wildlife habitats and does not make sense in this context.",
    "While \"rural area\" could be a natural habitat for bald eagles, the question specifies a zoological park, making this option irrelevant.",
    "The choice \"in washington\" could refer to their natural habitat, as bald eagles are commonly seen in the wild there, but it doesn\u2019t fit the context of a zoological park.",
    "Considering the options, the only fitting choice that aligns with where a bald eagle would be found in a zoological park is \"B: aviary\"."
