  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a human can find both clothing and electronics in the same place.",
    "A department store typically carries a wide variety of items, including clothing and electronics.",
    "A space shuttle is a type of spacecraft and would not offer clothing or electronics in a retail sense.",
    "New Jersey is a state and does not inherently suggest a location to find clothing and electronics together.",
    "An office is usually a place of work and would generally not carry clothing and electronics for retail purposes.",
    "New Orleans, like New Jersey, does not specify a location for clothing and electronics and is more known for its culture and tourism.",
    "Among the choices, the best option that meets the criteria of offering both clothing and electronics is the department store.",
    "Given that a department store is designed for this purpose and the other options do not fit, the answer is clear."
