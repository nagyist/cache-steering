  "query": "Question: Where might a person store an antibiotic to keep it out of the reach of children?\n\nChoices:\nA: stomach\nB: pharmacy\nC: prescribed\nD: medicine cabinet\nE: capsule",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the goal: The question asks where a person might store an antibiotic to prevent children from accessing it.",
    "Consider the options given and their meanings. \nA: Stomach - not a storage place, and not practical.\nB: Pharmacy - a place where antibiotics can be obtained, but not a personal storage location.\nC: Prescribed - suggests a type of antibiotic or a process, not a storage option.\nD: Medicine cabinet - a common place at home where medicines including antibiotics are stored.\nE: Capsule - refers to the form of the antibiotic, not a storage place.",
    "Evaluate each option for relevance to the storage of antibiotics in a child-safe way.",
    "The medicine cabinet is a credible choice, as it is typically used to store medications out of reach of children.",
    "Pharmacy could be an option for storing antibiotics in a general sense, but it is not practical for home storage to keep it away from children.",
    "Since capsules are just the form of the antibiotic and not a storage space, this option is not valid.",
    "Prescribed relates to the process rather than a physical location for storage.",
    "Thus, the most logical and practical choice is the medicine cabinet."
