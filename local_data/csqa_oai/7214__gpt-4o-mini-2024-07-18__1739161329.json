  "query": "Question: Where would rock be found in the desert?\n\nChoices:\nA: oasis\nB: surface of earth\nC: countryside\nD: mountains\nE: bridge",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of a desert environment. Deserts are characterized by vast, dry areas with limited vegetation and precipitation.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices provided, focusing on where rocks can be commonly found in such an arid landscape.",
    "Choice A, oasis, typically has water and vegetation, making it less likely to be an expansive area for rocks as compared to other options.",
    "Choice B, the surface of the earth, suggests that rocks could be found above ground in a desert, which is plausible given that many deserts have rocky terrain.",
    "Choice C, countryside, usually refers to a rural area that can include various terrains, but it is a broader, non-specific term and does not directly relate to deserts.",
    "Choice D, mountains, could indeed have significant rock formations, but mountains are not inherently found in desert regions; the presence of mountains is more specific to certain geographical features.",
    "Choice E, bridge, implies a man-made structure, which does not directly relate to the natural occurrence of rock in a desert context.",
    "Thus, considering all options, the most fitting choice for where rock would be found in the desert is on the surface of the earth, as rocks would likely be exposed there due to the lack of vegetation."
