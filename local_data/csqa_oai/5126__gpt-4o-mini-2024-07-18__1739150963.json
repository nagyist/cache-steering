  "steps": [
    "Identify the condition of the mustard: it has been opened.",
    "Understand that opened mustard needs to be stored properly to maintain its quality and prevent spoilage.",
    "Recall general food safety guidelines for condiments after they have been opened.",
    "Recognize that many condiments, including mustard, are recommended to be refrigerated after opening.",
    "Consider the choices provided.",
    "Evaluate option A (jar): while mustard is typically stored in a jar, this does not address the storage condition after it has been opened.",
    "Evaluate option B (hot dog): mustard on a hot dog is a serving suggestion and not a storage solution.",
    "Evaluate option C (hamburger): similar to hot dog, this represents usage rather than a storage method.",
    "Evaluate option D (fast food restaurant): indicates a place rather than a recommended storage method.",
    "Evaluate option E (refrigerator): aligns with common storage practices for opened mustard to preserve its freshness and prevent spoilage."
