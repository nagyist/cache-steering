  "query": "Question: Where are you not likely to find a bed?\n\nChoices:\nA: hotel room\nB: rest area\nC: hospital\nD: neighbor's house\nE: loft",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what a bed is and the common places where beds are typically found. Hotels usually provide beds for guests, and hospitals often have beds for patients.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice in terms of how common it is to find a bed there. A hotel room (A) is designed specifically for sleeping and will almost always have a bed.",
    "A rest area (B), typically found on highways, often has seating facilities but is not specifically designed for sleeping, meaning it is less likely to have beds.",
    "In a hospital (C), there are hospital beds for patients, which makes it likely to find beds there.",
    "A neighbor's house (D) may or may not have a bed depending on the home environment, but generally, homes do have beds.",
    "A loft (E) could also be a living space that usually contains a bed, but it varies by design.",
    "Among the choices, the rest area (B) stands out as the least likely location since it is not primarily meant for sleeping.",
    "Confirming that despite various housing options like a neighbor's house or a loft typically having beds, and hospitals specifically designed for care including beds, the rest area lacks such facilities."
