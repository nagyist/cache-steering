  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a common desire that humans have when it comes to relationships with others.",
    "Let's analyze the choices provided: A healthy relationship, a wet suit, a moving car, school, and a fight.",
    "A healthy relationship is something that most people seek in their interactions with others; it fosters connection, support, and mutual understanding.",
    "A wet suit is typically associated with water sports and does not relate to emotional or social desires.",
    "A moving car is a practical object and does not pertain to human relationships or desires.",
    "School is an educational institution; while education can involve social interaction, it is not a universal desire that encompasses a relationship aspect.",
    "A fight suggests conflict or negativity, which is contrary to what humans generally seek in relationships.",
    "Given these analyses, the option that aligns most closely with what every human typically wants from someone else is A: healthy relationship."
