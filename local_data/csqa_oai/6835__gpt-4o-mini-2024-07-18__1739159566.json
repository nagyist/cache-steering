  "query": "Question: What do you end up with after cooking?\n\nChoices:\nA: full feast\nB: cooked food\nC: having dinner\nD: get food\nE: pride",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the result of the cooking process.",
    "Cooking transforms raw ingredients into something consumable.",
    "One primary result of cooking is edible food that is ready to eat.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"cooked food\" directly reflects this transformation.",
    "A \"full feast\" implies a more elaborate situation and is not guaranteed after cooking.",
    "\"Having dinner\" suggests a time of eating, but does not specify what is eaten.",
    "\"Get food\" is vague and does not relate specifically to the act of cooking.",
    "\"Pride\" is an emotion and does not describe a physical outcome of cooking.",
    "Therefore, \"cooked food\" is the most direct and relevant answer to the question."
