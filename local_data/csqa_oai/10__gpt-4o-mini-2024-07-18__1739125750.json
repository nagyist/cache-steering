  "query": "Question: Where do you put your grapes just before checking out?\n\nChoices:\nA: mouth\nB: grocery cart\nC: super market\nD: fruit basket\nE: fruit market",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the action you take concerning grapes just before checking out.",
    "Typically, grapes are bought at a grocery store or supermarket, so understanding the context of purchasing them is essential.",
    "When checking out, it is common to place items, such as grapes, into a grocery cart since that is where you carry your items until you pay for them.",
    "Although the \"mouth\" option might seem tempting if someone is snacking, legally and socially, you typically do not consume them before the purchase.",
    "The term \"super market\" simply refers to the location rather than a place to *put* the grapes.",
    "The \"fruit basket\" option could refer to a home storage location for grapes but doesn't fit the context of the checkout process.",
    "The \"fruit market\" option also refers more to the place where fruits are sold rather than an action involving checkout.",
    "Since I have evaluated each option based on typical grocery behavior, the most logical response to where you would place the grapes just before checking out is the grocery cart."
