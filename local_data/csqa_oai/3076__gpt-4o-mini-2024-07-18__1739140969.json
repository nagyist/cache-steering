  "steps": [
    "The passage indicates that James faced temptation and made a decision regarding it.",
    "He understood that he had to choose, implying he took a definitive action against the temptation.",
    "The key phrase is that he \"decided that he wasn't going to accept temptation.\"",
    "The phrase suggests an active decision to deal with the temptation rather than passively experiencing it.",
    "\"Reject\" would imply that he actively turned away from temptation, aligning with his decision to not accept it.",
    "The other options do not fit well with the context of making a decision against temptation.",
    "\"Predetermination\" suggests something decided in advance, which does not fit with his active choice.",
    "\"Undecided\" contradicts the idea that he made a choice at all.",
    "\"Force\" implies physicality or coercion, which is not relevant to the context of temptation.",
    "\"Concluded\" suggests an ending or summary rather than an active decision-making process against temptation."
