  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the context of the question, which refers to kids finding fish in their backyards.",
    "Typically, backyards are places where one would expect to find small bodies of water such as ponds or perhaps even small streams, rather than larger bodies of water like oceans.",
    "Since option A (boat) suggests a means of transportation rather than a location for finding fish, it is unlikely to be relevant here.",
    "Option B (ocean) and option E (ocean) are similar and not suitable as oceans are usually far away from backyards.",
    "Option D (end of line) doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of finding fish, as it sounds more like a fishing terminology rather than a location regarding kids\u2019 backyards.",
    "The only suitable and logical option left is C (pond), as ponds can be small water bodies that may be present in a backyard, making them a reasonable place for kids to find fish.",
    "Since C is the only answer that aligns with the concept of finding fish in a location accessible to kids in their backyards, it stands out as the most appropriate choice."
