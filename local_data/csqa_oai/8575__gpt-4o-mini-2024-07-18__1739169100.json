  "query": "Question: Sarah knew that bob was a gentleman because he took her to a show and was stylish in his what?\n\nChoices:\nA: tuxedo\nB: big house\nC: church\nD: town\nE: movie",
  "steps": [
    "To determine why Sarah considered Bob a gentleman, I should think about the qualities associated with being a gentleman, particularly in the context of a social outing like a show.",
    "A gentleman is often characterized by his attire and how he presents himself, especially in formal or semi-formal situations. Thus, clothing is likely an important aspect of this context.",
    "The given choice options include various items: tuxedo, big house, church, town, and movie. However, only the tuxedo relates to the idea of fashion and style directly.",
    "A tuxedo is a formal outfit typically worn at events like shows, suggesting that Bob's stylish attire would align with being seen in a tuxedo.",
    "The other options (big house, church, town, movie) do not pertain to clothing or personal style. A house or a church doesn't indicate how a person dresses, and while a town or a movie can reflect social settings, they do not relate directly to personal style.",
    "Since the context of the question emphasizes Bob's attire being stylish, I can conclude that his tuxedo is the most appropriate choice."
