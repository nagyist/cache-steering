  "query": "Question: She had been applying for job for weeks with no call back, she knew she was qualified, so what did she feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: employment\nB: frustration\nC: stress\nD: working hard\nE: love",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes someone applying for jobs without any callbacks despite being qualified. This indicates a lack of response from potential employers.",
    "Not receiving callbacks after numerous applications typically leads to a feeling of disappointment or irritation for job seekers.",
    "The individual has been applying for several weeks, which signifies perseverance but also an increasing chance of discouragement over time.",
    "Having qualifications but not being recognized for them can create emotional turmoil, often resulting in frustration.",
    "While stress is a possible response to this scenario, the specific feeling of frustration more directly correlates with the experiences detailed in the scenario.",
    "We can rule out choices like 'employment' (A) since she is currently unemployed, and 'love' (E) does not relate to the job application context at all.",
    "The act of working hard (D) doesn\u2019t directly convey her feelings resulting from her job application experience.",
    "Considering the emotions typically linked with a lack of job responses, frustration (B) emerges as the most pertinent feeling."
