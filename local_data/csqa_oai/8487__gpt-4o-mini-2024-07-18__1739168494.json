  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the likely consequence of people working hard and saving their money.",
    "When people work hard, they typically earn an income, which can contribute to their financial stability.",
    "Saving money is a way to secure future financial needs and build wealth over time.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"gain wealth\" directly correlates with the actions of working hard and saving.",
    "The other options (B, C, D, E) do not logically follow from the premise of working hard and saving money.",
    "Talking to each other (B) might occur but is not a consequence of working hard and saving money.",
    "Eating plants (C) doesn't relate to financial actions or outcomes at all.",
    "Sunbathing (D) is unrelated to hard work and saving.",
    "The idea of \"making money pillars\" (E) doesn't represent a clear consequence and sounds abstract compared to gaining wealth.",
    "Since \"gain wealth\" (A) is the only choice that logically follows from the described actions, it stands out as the best answer."
