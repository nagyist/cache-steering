    "The question involves John, who is in a wheelchair and needs to get to the third floor of his apartment building.",
    "Since John is in a wheelchair, he may have difficulty using certain modes of transportation that require physical movement, such as stairs.",
    "The options given are: A: space shuttle, B: detroit, C: stairs, D: downtown, E: elevator.",
    "A space shuttle is not a viable option for getting to the third floor of an apartment building.",
    "Detroit is a city and not a location within the apartment building.",
    "Stairs would typically require climbing, which John cannot do because he is in a wheelchair.",
    "Downtown refers to a broader area and does not apply to the need to access the third floor specifically.",
    "An elevator is specifically designed to assist individuals in reaching higher floors without the need for stairs, making it accessible for wheelchair users.",
    "Therefore, the most logical and suitable option for John to use in order to reach the third floor is the elevator."
