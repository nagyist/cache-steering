  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine the context of stopping a car from being towed. This involves understanding where a coin might be used in relation to parking regulations.",
    "Next, we consider the purpose of each choice related to parking or vehicles. A piggy bank is for saving coins, a wishing well is for making wishes, a change purse holds coins, and a slot machine is for gambling. None of these can influence parking or towing.",
    "Now, let\u2019s focus on the parking meter option. A parking meter is directly related to parking regulations and requires coins to pay for parking space. If a car is parked at a meter and the time runs out, it can be towed.",
    "If a coin is placed in a parking meter, it can prolong the parking duration, thereby preventing a scenario where the car might be towed for expired parking time.",
    "The other options do not connect with the action of stopping a car from being towed in the same manner as a parking meter, which directly serves a functional purpose in parking.",
    "To conclude, the only logical choice that relates to stopping a car from being towed is placing a coin in a parking meter."
