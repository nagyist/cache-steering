  "query": "Question: If you're typing for a long time, what's a sign you should take a break?\n\nChoices:\nA: pain\nB: carpal tunnel syndrome\nC: letter\nD: thirst\nE: printed word",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of typing for a long period of time. Prolonged typing can lead to various physical signs indicating a need for a break.",
    "Next, think about the most immediate physical symptoms that could arise from extended typing. Pain is often one of the first signs that something isn\u2019t right.",
    "Then, consider the other options one by one. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a specific condition that is serious but develops over longer timeframes; it is not an immediate sign.",
    "Next, review the options: a \"letter\" does not provide a logical connection to the act of typing and the need for breaks. It\u2019s unrelated.",
    "Look at \"thirst.\" While staying hydrated is important, thirst itself is not a direct indicator of needing a break from typing specifically.",
    "Finally, compare all viable options. Pain (option A) is a direct and immediate signal to take a break, while the other options do not pertain specifically to the necessity of a break from typing."
