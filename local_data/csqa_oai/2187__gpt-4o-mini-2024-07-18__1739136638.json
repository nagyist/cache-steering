  "steps": [
    "The question mentions an \"agnostic person\" who has studied science for years. This implies that the person is engaging with scientific concepts and reasoning.",
    "Agnosticism typically refers to a belief system where a person is uncertain about the existence of a higher power or deity, implying a search for knowledge and understanding rather than blind faith.",
    "When someone who is agnostic studies science intensively, they may begin to critically analyze various beliefs and perspectives, particularly those relating to spirituality and faith.",
    "The phrase \"begin to lose\" suggests that the agnostic person's confidence in certain concepts or ideas is diminishing over time due to their scientific study.",
    "Given the context, the most likely concept that would be affected is \"faith,\" as the study of science often emphasizes empirical evidence over belief without evidence.",
    "Looking at the other choices: \n- \"A\" (astronomy) is a branch of science, which the person is likely to continue studying.\n- \"B\" (arts) does not relate closely to scientific study.\n- \"D\" (math) is also a branch of science that would not be lost through studying science.\n- \"E\" (chemistry) is another scientific field that would not be lost.",
    "By elimination, and through the logical thought process, it appears that the agnostic individual is most likely losing \"faith.\""
