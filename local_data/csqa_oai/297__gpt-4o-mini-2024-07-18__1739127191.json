  "query": "Question: Where will a bullet projectile be found during a war?\n\nChoices:\nA: battle field\nB: museum\nC: weapon\nD: canon\nE: tornado",
  "steps": [
    "First, define what a \"bullet projectile\" refers to. A bullet projectile is typically a small projectile made for use in firearms, such as pistols or rifles.",
    "Next, consider the context of the question, which is about a war scenario. This implies a focus on locations or items directly relevant to warfare.",
    "Evaluate the choices provided: A: battle field, B: museum, C: weapon, D: canon, E: tornado.",
    "Now examine choice A, \"battle field.\" A battlefield is a direct area where combat occurs, and bullet projectiles will surely be found there as they are used by soldiers.",
    "Next, assess choice B, \"museum.\" While some bullet projectiles may be displayed in a museum, they are not generally found there during active warfare.",
    "Consider choice C, \"weapon.\" A bullet projectile is an integral part of firearms, which are classified as weapons. This indicates a logical connection.",
    "Review choice D, \"canon.\" A cannon is a type of weapon that might fire projectiles, but it does not generally relate to bullets specifically, which are associated with firearms.",
    "Finally, examine choice E, \"tornado.\" A tornado is a natural phenomenon and has no relation to bullet projectiles or warfare.",
    "Based on the evaluation, while bullet projectiles can be found both on a battlefield and as part of weapons, the best answer that encompasses their presence in a wartime context is \"battle field,\" as that is where they are actively used."
