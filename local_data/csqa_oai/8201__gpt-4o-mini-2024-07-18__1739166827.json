  "steps": [
    "The question asks what elementary school students must do when they are going into class.",
    "Consider the context of entering a classroom environment. What is a common practice for students in an elementary school setting?",
    "Students often line up outside their classroom or school before entering.",
    "Think about the choices given: A mentions thinking for themselves, which is not a physical action; B refers to answering a question, which is not a requirement every time they enter; C suggests waiting in line, which is a common practice before entering; D mentions speaking a foreign language, which is not a necessary action; and E refers to crossing the road, which is situational and not applicable to all students entering the classroom.",
    "From these considerations, waiting in line (C) is the most applicable action that elementary students typically do before entering their class.",
    "No other options fit the scenario as universally as waiting in line does."
