  "steps": [
    "To determine where many stores with books can be found, I need to evaluate each option in terms of the presence of bookstores.",
    "Option A, a friend's house, generally does not have a significant number of bookstores or a variety of books to choose from.",
    "Option B, a large city, typically has multiple bookstores and may also have large retail chains that sell books, making this option a strong candidate.",
    "Option C, a gym, is primarily a place for fitness and exercise, and does not usually stock or sell books.",
    "Option D, a table, is not a location where stores are found; it's a piece of furniture and has no relevance to the question.",
    "Option E, a university, often has a bookstore, but it may not have as many retailers selling books compared to a large city.",
    "After comparing all options, the large city (Option B) stands out as it has a greater concentration of bookstores and various places that sell books than the other options."
