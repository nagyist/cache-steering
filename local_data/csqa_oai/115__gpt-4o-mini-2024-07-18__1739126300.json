  "query": "Question: They were getting together for the big game, he wasn't hosting but made sure to bring pretty of food with him over to where?\n\nChoices:\nA: picnic\nB: friend's house\nC: table\nD: space shuttle\nE: fairgrounds",
  "steps": [
    "The context suggests that a social gathering is happening to watch a game, which usually requires a setting conducive for such an event.",
    "While \"picnic\" might imply an outdoor setting, it doesn't align well with the idea of a big game which is typically hosted indoors, especially for popular sports events.",
    "\"Friend's house\" fits well because it implies a casual environment where people usually gather to watch games together.",
    "The \"table\" doesn't provide a location; it is simply an object, and it's less likely to be where he would take food over since it lacks social context.",
    "\"Space shuttle\" is an unrealistic choice in this scenario, as it does not relate to the setting of watching a game or food sharing.",
    "\"Fairgrounds\" suggests a large open space possibly for events, but again does not specifically relate to the typical indoor gathering for watching a game.",
    "We can eliminate the less likely options: A (picnic), C (table), D (space shuttle), and E (fairgrounds) based on their relevance.",
    "The most reasonable option remaining, which aligns with the social context of watching a big game while also bringing food, is B: friend's house."
