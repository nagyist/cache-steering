  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates that she had many friends already, which means she is socially connected.",
    "The phrase \"never stopped socialising\" suggests that despite having a lot of friends, she continues to engage with others.",
    "Now, we need to examine the choices provided and consider the context in which socialising would be pursued.",
    "Choice A (\"having fun\") implies that socialising is primarily intended for enjoyment. However, it doesn't specifically relate to her social interactions leading to a goal.",
    "Choice B (\"become popular\") suggests a basic intent to increase her status, which is less commonly a stated goal in social situations, especially since she already has friends.",
    "Choice C (\"become more popular\") indicates an enhanced version of popularity. It acknowledges that while she is already popular among friends, she seeks further social interaction to increase that popularity even more.",
    "Choice D (\"anxiety\") does not align with the context of the sentence, as it suggests a negative feeling rather than a goal of socialisation.",
    "Choice E (\"she cannot do that when all are for her\") is confusing and does not fit logically with the rest of the sentence.",
    "After analyzing all the choices, C (\"become more popular\") presents the best fit as it implies that her continuous socialising is aimed at further enhancing her social standing."
