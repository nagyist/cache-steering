  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what helium gas does when it is in a balloon. Helium is lighter than air, which allows the balloon to float. This characteristic means it can rise into the sky.",
    "Next, I will consider the potential destinations of a helium-filled balloon as it rises. The balloon would ascend until it reaches a limit where the surrounding air is not buoyant enough to support its weight.",
    "I should evaluate the answer choices provided: aeroplane, moon, atmosphere, laboratory, and chemistry lab. The balloon is unlikely to reach an aeroplane, as they are typically moving and would be at a lower altitude than the maximum height of a floating balloon.",
    "The moon is not a suitable answer either because a balloon cannot rise to the moon; it is far too high and requires space travel, not just buoyancy.",
    "Laboratories and chemistry labs are not the right environments for a balloon to \"rise.\" These terms refer to confined spaces where experiments take place and do not relate to vertical movement in the context of rising.",
    "The atmosphere is the gaseous layer surrounding the Earth, and as a balloon ascends, it is actually moving further into the atmosphere. This means that it can be said to rise high into the atmosphere.",
    "In summary, the answer must relate to a place where a balloon can actually rise, which means that the atmosphere is the most logical choice."
