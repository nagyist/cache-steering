  "query": "Question: Where can meat last a long time?\n\nChoices:\nA: backery\nB: ham sandwich\nC: fridge\nD: butcher shop\nE: freezer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options provided for where meat can last a long time.",
    "Evaluate 'backery' (which I assume is a typo for 'bakery') - a bakery typically stores baked goods rather than meat, so this option is not suitable.",
    "Next, look at 'ham sandwich' - while a ham sandwich contains meat, it is not a storage solution and will spoil relatively quickly, making this option invalid.",
    "Now consider 'fridge' - refrigeration can extend the shelf life of meat, but it is not the longest term compared to freezer storage, so this is a potential option.",
    "Then evaluate 'butcher shop' - while fresh meat can be found in a butcher shop, it is not a storage location for the long-term preservation of meat once purchased, so this option is not applicable.",
    "Lastly, assess 'freezer' - freezing meat will significantly extend its shelf life compared to refrigeration or other options, allowing it to last for months or even years.",
    "After evaluating each option, it's clear that the freezer is the best choice for long-term meat storage."
