  "steps": [
    "The question states that he was having a bad day and felt gloomy, indicating he was experiencing negative emotions.",
    "He turned to praying, which is commonly associated with seeking comfort or emotional support during tough times.",
    "We must consider how prayer typically affects a person's emotional state, especially in a moment of gloom.",
    "The options provided include terms that relate to emotional states or feelings.",
    "We need to identify which option reflects a positive change that prayer might inspire in someone feeling gloomy.",
    "Option A, \"religiosity,\" does not specifically relate to an emotional change but rather to a state of being religious.",
    "Option B, \"feeling better,\" is somewhat vague and does not specify what the outcome of praying is directly.",
    "Option C, \"feel better,\" could imply that the act of praying is making him feel improved, which aligns with the idea of emotional uplift.",
    "Option D, \"relief,\" suggests a reduction in distress, which is a possible outcome of prayer but doesn't explicitly express overall emotional improvement.",
    "Option E, \"safe,\" implies a sense of security, which is more about a state of safety rather than directly addressing emotional well-being.",
    "Comparing options C and D, option C seems to be the most direct response to the emotional state of feeling gloomy and highlights the potential impact of prayer."
