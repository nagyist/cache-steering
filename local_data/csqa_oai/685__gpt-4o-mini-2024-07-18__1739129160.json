  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand what civil action means. Civil action refers to a legal proceeding in which a person, or group of people, sues another party for a wrongful act or infringement of rights, typically seeking compensation or some form of legal remedy.",
    "Next, we need to identify the context of the question. The question asks about the result of instituting civil action, meaning we are looking for the outcome or consequence of taking legal action.",
    "Now, let's analyze the given choices. \nChoice A: \"bad feelings\" could be an emotional response to the civil action but is not a direct result.",
    "Choice B: \"confusion\" might occur during the legal process but is also not a primary result of civil action itself.",
    "Choice C: \"going to court\" directly relates to civil action, as initiating such an action typically leads to court proceedings to resolve the dispute.",
    "Choice D: \"hurt feelings\" could be a byproduct of the civil action, but it is not a legal or procedural outcome, making it less relevant.",
    "Choice E: \"sandwiches\" is completely unrelated to civil action and can be dismissed.",
    "Evaluating these options, the most logical and direct result of instituting civil action is that it leads to \"going to court,\" as this is the standard procedure when a civil suit is initiated."
