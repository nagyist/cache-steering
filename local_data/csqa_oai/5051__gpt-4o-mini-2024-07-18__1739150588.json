  "query": "Question: Using your hands to communicate is how you do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sign language\nB: soft\nC: cup water\nD: articulate\nE: throw lasers",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a method of communication that utilizes hands.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, \"sign language\" specifically refers to a form of communication using hand gestures and signs.",
    "\"Soft\" does not relate to communication through hands; it refers more to texture or an attribute of an object.",
    "\"Cup water\" describes a physical action rather than a communication method, so it is not relevant to the question.",
    "\u201cArticulate\u201d pertains to the clarity of speech, while the question is specifically about communicating with hands.",
    "\"Throw lasers\" is a fictional concept and does not relate to communication in any form.",
    "Based on the reasoning, \"sign language\" is the only option that directly relates to using hands for communication.",
    "The other options have either a different meaning or don't apply to the context of using hands for communication."
