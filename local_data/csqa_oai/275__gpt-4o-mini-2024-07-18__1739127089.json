  "query": "Question: Jimmy wanted a beer but his wife was an alcoholic on probation.  Where might he go?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: bridge\nC: home\nD: homeless shelter\nE: prison",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand Jimmy's desire for a beer in the context of his wife's situation. His wife being an alcoholic on probation suggests that he should make choices that do not compromise her recovery or lead to conflict in their home life.",
    "Next, I can consider his options for where he might go for a beer without putting himself or his wife in a difficult situation. He needs a place where he can consume alcohol without direct confrontation or negative consequences.",
    "I will evaluate the options:\nA: neighbor's house - This could potentially be a viable option as he might find someone who is okay with him drinking.",
    "B: bridge - This doesn't seem like a suitable or safe option for someone looking for a drink.",
    "C: home - If his wife is present, this could lead to significant conflict and isn't a viable option.",
    "D: homeless shelter - This is not a typical place to find a beer, as they generally focus on providing support rather than alcohol.",
    "E: prison - This is not a place for social drinking, and it would have severe consequences for Jimmy.",
    "After analyzing the options, I find that the neighbor's house is the most suitable location for him to go for a beer without disrupting his family life or violating his wife's probation."
