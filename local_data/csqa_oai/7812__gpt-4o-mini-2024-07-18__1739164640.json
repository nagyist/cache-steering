    "When someone decides to watch a documentary, it is typically because they have an interest in a particular subject or topic.",
    "Documentaries are often created to inform the audience about real-life events, people, or phenomena, aiming to present factual information.",
    "Unlike fictional films, documentaries do not primarily focus on entertainment value; rather, they aim to educate or provide a deeper understanding.",
    "In many cases, viewers seek documentaries to gain deeper insight into complex issues or events they may not fully understand.",
    "One of the primary motivations for watching a documentary is to acquire knowledge or factual information about a specific topic.",
    "While some people may also watch documentaries for awareness of social issues or historical events, the underlying goal is still rooted in insight.",
    "Fear is typically associated with horror films, while entertainment could be a secondary goal, but it is not the main aim for documentary viewers.",
    "The options \"like\" and \"fear\" are not relevant motivations for watching documentaries, as they do not align with the typical purpose of these films.",
    "Choosing awareness might be considered a close contender, but it ultimately serves the larger purpose of gaining insight into that awareness.",
    "Given all reasoning, the predominant outcome viewers hope for when watching a documentary is the acquisition of insight regarding the subject matter."
