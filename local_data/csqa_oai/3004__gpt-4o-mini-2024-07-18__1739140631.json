  "query": "Question: Who takes forever to pass a bill?\n\nChoices:\nA: congress\nB: wallet\nC: restaurant\nD: mail box\nE: presidents",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what it means to take a long time to pass a bill. A bill is proposed legislation that must go through a specific process to become law.",
    "Next, analyze the role of Congress in this process. Congress is responsible for proposing, debating, and voting on bills. The passage of a bill often takes a significant amount of time due to complex procedures and the need for consensus.",
    "Now, review the other options. A wallet does not have any role in the legislative process; it is simply an item used to carry money and cards.",
    "Similarly, a restaurant does not participate in passing legislation; it is a business that serves food.",
    "The mailbox is also not involved in the legislative process; it is a method of sending and receiving mail, not a decision-making entity.",
    "Finally, although presidents do influence legislation and can veto bills, they do not take the longest time to pass a bill in the same way Congress does, as Congress has to manage and finalize the legislative process.",
    "Consider all the options and their relevance to the legislative process. Congress is the only entity involved that is known to take time in passing bills."
