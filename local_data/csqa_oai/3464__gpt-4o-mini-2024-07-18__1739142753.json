  "query": "Question: It was my turn to stand watch, so where did I go for my shift?\n\nChoices:\nA: department store\nB: bathroom cabinet\nC: bedroom drawer\nD: guard tower\nE: jewellers",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"stand watch,\" which typically refers to a role involving vigilance or monitoring an area, commonly associated with security or military duties.",
    "Considering the nature of standing watch, we can eliminate options that do not imply a location for vigilance. A department store (A) is a busy retail environment, not specifically related to standing watch.",
    "The bathroom cabinet (B) and bedroom drawer (C) are both small, enclosed spaces that wouldn\u2019t serve as a suitable location for standing watch.",
    "The jewellers (E) is also a retail space, where one would likely be selling or displaying items rather than actively watching over a specified area.",
    "This leaves the guard tower (D) as the only option directly associated with the role of standing watch, as it typically signifies an elevated position for surveillance.",
    "Given that the guard tower is a structured place designed for the purpose of watching over an area, it is the most logical location for a watch shift.",
    "By the process of elimination and the context of the question, standing watch clearly relates to a security function being performed at the guard tower."
