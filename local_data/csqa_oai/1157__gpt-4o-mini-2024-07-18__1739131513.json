  "query": "Question: Where should you be careful of bees after drinking cider?\n\nChoices:\nA: sky\nB: field of flowers\nC: beehive\nD: orchard\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about where to be cautious of bees after drinking cider, indicating a situation where bees might be attracted to something.",
    "Cider is made from apples, which can be found in orchards. This means that drinking cider could be associated with being in or around an orchard.",
    "Bees are often attracted to sweet substances; cider is sweet due to the sugars in apples.",
    "In an orchard, especially if there are flowering apple trees, there is a likelihood that bees will be present, as they pollinate these flowers.",
    "While fields of flowers (B) could also attract bees, they are not specifically linked to the consumption of cider.",
    "A beehive (C) is directly related to bees, but being cautious of bees is more about the environment where they are active, rather than being cautious about the hive itself.",
    "Being in the countryside (E) might generally mean encountering nature and bees but does not specifically relate to cider.",
    "Out of all the choices, an orchard is directly linked to the context of drinking cider and the presence of bees from flowering trees.",
    "Thus, the most prudent answer that directly connects cider and the presence of bees is the orchard."
