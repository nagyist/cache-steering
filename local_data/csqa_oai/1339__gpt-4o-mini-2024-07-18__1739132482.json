  "steps": [
    "To answer the question, I need to identify what most people commonly use to carry things.",
    "\"Two eyes\" (Choice A) are primarily used for vision, not for carrying.",
    "\"Two hands\" (Choice B) are typically used to grasp and hold items, making them a viable option for carrying things.",
    "\"Two arms\" (Choice C) also contribute to carrying by supporting the hands, but they are not directly used to carry items without hands.",
    "\"Carry bags\" (Choice D) are explicitly designed for carrying, but they are objects and not something that people have to carry things.",
    "\"Ears\" (Choice E) are primarily used for hearing and do not relate to carrying at all.",
    "Looking at the most suitable option, \"two hands\" (Choice B) are the primary appendages used by people for holding and carrying items.",
    "Comparatively, while \"two arms\" (Choice C) are involved as support for the hands, they do not directly accomplish the task of carrying as effectively as hands do.",
    "I have established that the correct answer must refer to what people specifically use to carry items, rather than their body in general or specific carrying devices."
