  "query": "Question: Where did most people keep their telephone directory near the nourishment they keep in their house?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: building\nC: office\nD: boat\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider where people commonly store items related to nourishment or food in their houses. The kitchen is typically a central place for food storage and preparation.",
    "Next, think about the usage of telephone directories. They are often kept in areas where people conduct daily activities or manage household organization, which could be in close proximity to daily necessities.",
    "Now, evaluate the space of the choices given. A kitchen is not only a place for keeping food, but also a practical location for storing items that relate to household communication, like a telephone directory.",
    "Consider the other options: \n- A building is too vague and does not specify a location in relation to nourishment.\n- An office, while a possible place for a telephone directory, generally does not relate to food storage directly.\n- A boat is unlikely to be a common place for telephone directories, plus it is not typically associated with nourishment storage.\n- A library is primarily about books and information storage, not food.",
    "Conclude that the kitchen serves both as a storage space for nourishment and a location where a telephone directory could reasonably be kept for everyday use."
