  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the locations where people are likely to stand at an intersection.",
    "An intersection typically refers to a place where two or more roads meet, and it can be a location commonly used by pedestrians.",
    "Now, I will analyze each option to see which makes the most sense in relation to where people would stand.",
    "Option A: cars \u2013 This option refers to vehicles, not people. Therefore, it is not a valid choice for where people stand.",
    "Option B: city street \u2013 While this refers to an area where pedestrians may be, it is too general and does not specifically denote a standing point within an intersection context.",
    "Option C: street corner \u2013 This option specifically refers to the exact point where two streets meet. People often stand here to wait to cross or to catch public transportation.",
    "Option D: fork in road \u2013 This refers to a type of intersection but does not imply standing; typically, forks are associated with vehicles making decisions rather than pedestrians standing.",
    "Option E: at a red light \u2013 While people may stand near traffic lights, this does not encapsulate the broader concept of all standing areas at an intersection.",
    "After analyzing all options, I can conclude that people are most likely to stand at a street corner, as it is a specific location where pedestrians would commonly wait at an intersection."
