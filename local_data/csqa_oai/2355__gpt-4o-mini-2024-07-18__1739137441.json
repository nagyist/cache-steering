    "The phrase \"every genre has what\" suggests that the answer should reflect a common quality or characteristic shared across all music genres.",
    "Considering the available options, I need to think about what characteristic or quality is commonly associated with all genres of music.",
    "Option A, \"classical,\" refers to a specific genre and does not represent a universal concept applicable to all genres.",
    "Option B, \"country music,\" is also specific and does not encompass the general nature of all genres.",
    "Option C, \"hip hop,\" similarly reflects a specific genre rather than a universal attribute.",
    "Option D, \"rock,\" again is a specific genre rather than a characteristic that relates to all music.",
    "Option E, \"good music,\" suggests a subjective quality that could apply to all genres. It conveys the idea that regardless of genre, music can be appreciated for its quality.",
