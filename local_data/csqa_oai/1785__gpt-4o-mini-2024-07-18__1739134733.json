  "query": "Question: I went to a party at my friend's house in New York and everyone there shared a meal in what eating place?\n\nChoices:\nA: mall counter\nB: big city\nC: shopping area\nD: restaurant\nE: dining room",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that a meal was shared at a party in a friend's house in New York.",
    "Considering the context of a friend's house, it's likely that the meal was shared in a personal space rather than a public venue.",
    "The options provided include both informal and formal eating places.",
    "\"Dining room\" is a term typically used to describe a space within a house dedicated to eating meals, which fits the scenario best.",
    "While a \"restaurant\" could also be a place where meals are shared, the context explicitly mentions a friend's house, making \"dining room\" more appropriate.",
    "The remaining options, such as \"mall counter,\" \"big city,\" and \"shopping area,\" do not represent a specific place one would share a meal in a home setting.",
    "Therefore, in the context of a party at a friend's house, the most logical answer is \"dining room.\""
