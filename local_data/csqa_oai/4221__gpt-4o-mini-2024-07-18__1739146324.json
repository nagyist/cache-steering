  "query": "Question: The hot dogs were selling fast at intermission, where were they being sold?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: disneyland\nC: apartment\nD: cows\nE: sporting event",
  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the context of the question. It mentions \"hot dogs,\" which are commonly sold at various events or venues.",
    "Consider the phrase \"selling fast at intermission.\" This suggests an event that has a scheduled break or intermission.",
    "Assess the choices provided: \n- A: park - generally, hot dogs may be sold here, but it doesn't directly imply intermission.\n- B: disneyland - while hot dogs could be sold here, it doesn't typically have intermissions like an event.\n- C: apartment - this is unlikely as hot dogs wouldn't be sold in apartments.\n- D: cows - this doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of selling hot dogs.\n- E: sporting event - hot dogs are famously sold at sporting events, and these events often have halftimes or breaks (intermissions).",
    "Based on the reasoning, choice E (sporting event) aligns most closely with the context of selling hot dogs during an intermission.",
    "Double-checking the other options, none of them fit as well as E does, considering the context of intermission."
