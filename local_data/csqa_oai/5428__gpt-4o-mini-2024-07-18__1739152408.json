  "query": "Question: Where do you get a cheap room at a reception desk?\n\nChoices:\nA: lobby\nB: office park\nC: at hotel\nD: cellphone\nE: motel",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the question which asks about getting a cheap room specifically at a reception desk.",
    "The mention of a reception desk implies a place that provides accommodations, typically where guests check in.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices available:\n- A: lobby - This is usually a common area in a hotel or building, not a place where you can get a room.\n- B: office park - Office parks typically consist of commercial buildings and do not offer accommodation.\n- C: at hotel - Hotels have reception desks where guests can check in and book rooms, including possibly cheap rooms.\n- D: cellphone - A cellphone is a device, not a location for getting a room.\n- E: motel - Motels also offer accommodation and often have a reception desk, catering to travelers looking for inexpensive options.",
    "Between option C (hotel) and option E (motel), both can indeed offer rooms at a reception desk. However, motels are commonly associated with low-cost lodging.",
    "Determine which option aligns more closely with the idea of a \"cheap room\". Motels are generally perceived as cheaper than hotels.",
    "Although both hotels and motels can provide cheap rooms, motels specifically cater to budget-conscious travelers.",
    "Analyze whether there is any other factor that distinguishes a motel as a better answer than a hotel regarding cheap rooms. Motels typically have simpler pricing structures aimed at cost-saving customers.",
    "After thorough consideration, conclude that while both options C and E could technically answer the question, E aligns best with the idea of cheap accommodation."
