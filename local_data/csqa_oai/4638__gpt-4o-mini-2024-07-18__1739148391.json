  "query": "Question: He got tickets to go to performance of his idol, he had a lot of what for him?\n\nChoices:\nA: experience\nB: statue\nC: applaud\nD: admiration\nE: make reservations",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that \"he got tickets to go to a performance of his idol,\" which implies he is excited and enthusiastic about attending this event.",
    "When someone is going to see a performance of their idol, they typically have positive feelings towards that person or their work, commonly known as admiration.",
    "The choices provided include options that relate to emotions or actions one might associate with attending such a performance.",
    "Choice A, \"experience,\" could relate to the event but doesn't capture the emotional aspect specifically tied to the idol.",
    "Choice B, \"statue,\" is not relevant in this context, as it doesn't relate to the performance or feelings he might have.",
    "Choice C, \"applaud,\" refers to an action one might do at the performance but is not specifically something he has for his idol.",
    "Choice D, \"admiration,\" aligns perfectly with the context; it represents his feelings towards his idol, which is what the question asks about.",
    "Choice E, \"make reservations,\" is related to the logistics of attending the performance but does not answer what he has for his idol.",
    "Through the process of elimination and reasoning about the context, \"admiration\" is indeed what he has for his idol, given that he secured tickets to see them perform."
