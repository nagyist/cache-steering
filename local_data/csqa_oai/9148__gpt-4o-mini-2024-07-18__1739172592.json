  "query": "Question: What is likely to happen to a driver with an open sunroof during  rainstorm?\n\nChoices:\nA: common cold\nB: spinal injuries\nC: splats\nD: getting wet\nE: exhilaration",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves a driver with an open sunroof during a rainstorm.",
    "Rain is falling from the sky and the sunroof being open means there is an opening in the vehicle's roof.",
    "As rain falls, it will enter through the open sunroof and directly onto the driver inside the vehicle.",
    "The primary effect of rain hitting a person is that they will become wet.",
    "While other outcomes like a common cold or spinal injuries could theoretically happen, they are not direct results of being in a vehicle with an open sunroof during a rainstorm.",
    "\u201cExhilaration\u201d could be subjective, but it is not a commonplace or guaranteed reaction to getting rained on unexpectedly.",
    "The most straightforward and likely outcome for the driver in this situation is that they would get wet from the rain.",
    "Thus, among the choices provided, \"getting wet\" is the most logical conclusion to draw from this situation."
