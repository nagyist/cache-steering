  "steps": [
    "Identify what the term \"glass ceiling\" refers to in a general context.",
    "Recognize that \"glass ceiling\" is commonly used to describe an invisible barrier that prevents individuals, often women, from advancing in their careers or positions, despite their qualifications.",
    "Evaluate the choices given to see which one aligns with this understanding of \"glass ceiling.\"",
    "Choices A (building) and C (loft) do not fit, as they refer to physical structures and do not have a context of barrier or limitation.",
    "Choice B (leak) does not relate to a barrier either; it implies loss or failure in containment, which is not synonymous with the concept of the glass ceiling.",
    "Choice D (sag) conveys a physical change and does not represent an abstract limitation.",
    "Consider choice E (metaphor), which describes how the glass ceiling represents a conceptual barrier rather than a physical one.",
    "Since \"metaphor\" directly ties to the idea of the glass ceiling as an abstract obstacle, it is the most appropriate understanding of the term in context."
