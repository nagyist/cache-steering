  "query": "Question: Why would we handle glass with care ?\n\nChoices:\nA: many different colors\nB: cut vegetables\nC: break easily\nD: melt\nE: hold water",
  "steps": [
    "When considering why we would handle glass with care, we need to think about the physical properties of glass.",
    "One of the main characteristics of glass is that it is a brittle material, meaning that it can break easily when subjected to stress or impact.",
    "If glass breaks, it can create sharp shards that are dangerous and could cause injuries to individuals handling it.",
    "The potential for injury due to breakage is a significant reason for handling glass carefully.",
    "Looking at the options provided, we need to identify which of them directly relates to the need for careful handling of glass.",
    "Option A discusses colors which is not relevant to the handling of glass.",
    "Option B talks about cutting vegetables, which is also unrelated to glass handling.",
    "Option C mentions that glass can break easily, which accurately represents the reason for handling it with care.",
    "Option D refers to melting, which is not applicable to glass in most situations unless exposed to extremely high temperatures.",
    "Option E mentions holding water, which does not explain why we handle glass with care.",
    "Given the considerations above, option C is the only choice that directly explains the necessity of careful handling of glass."
