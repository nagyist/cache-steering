  "query": "Question: Yesterday there was heavy rain and there's water standing everywhere, but it's coming down hard again, and this time it's cold, what sort of storm is it now?\n\nChoices:\nA: blizzard\nB: hurricane\nC: cactus\nD: ocean\nE: drowning",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions heavy rain from yesterday, which indicates a significant weather event occurred previously.",
    "Now, the question states that it's \"coming down hard again,\" suggesting that the precipitation continues.",
    "The new rain is described as \"cold,\" indicating that the temperature is low.",
    "Given cold temperatures and heavy precipitation, we must consider what type of storms can occur under such conditions.",
    "A blizzard is characterized by heavy snowfall and cold temperatures, but since it specifically mentions rain, a blizzard would not apply here. Instead, it implies a transition toward a wintry condition.",
    "A hurricane involves strong winds and heavy rain, typically in warm temperatures, so it does not match the scenario of cold rain.",
    "C represents \"cactus,\" which does not relate in any way to the described weather conditions.",
    "D represents \"ocean,\" and while oceans can have storms, the question focuses on the immediate weather event rather than geographic features.",
    "E stands for \"drowning,\" which refers to a situation caused by water but does not describe a type of storm.",
    "Based on the conditions described (heavy rain and cold), the situation aligns most closely with the characteristics of an icy rainstorm or a winter storm, but none of the specific choices directly state this type."
