  "query": "Question: The cleanup crew would always find a hub or two during highway clean up, they always came off of a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: propeller\nB: datahub\nC: wash\nD: car wheel\nE: electric fan",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what kind of \"hub\" is being referred to in the context of a highway cleanup. Hubs can be parts of various machines or devices.",
    "Next, I should consider the choices available: propeller, datahub, wash, car wheel, and electric fan. I need to identify the one that is most commonly associated with highways and vehicles.",
    "A propeller is typically associated with boats or aircraft, and not vehicles on highways, so that's unlikely.",
    "A datahub refers to a technology concept; it doesn\u2019t fit the context of physical objects found during highway cleanups.",
    "A wash could refer to a washing area or process, but it does not fit as a mechanical part that would come off during a cleanup.",
    "A car wheel is a significant part of vehicles, and it would make sense for something related to a car (like a hub) to come off during highway use and cleanup.",
    "An electric fan is also irrelevant here, as it is not related to vehicles used on highways.",
    "At this point, the most logical choice is car wheel, as hubs can be components found at the intersection of wheels and tires.",
    "To double-check, I can restate: hubs found during highway cleanup would most likely come from components typically seen on cars, which ties directly to car wheels."
