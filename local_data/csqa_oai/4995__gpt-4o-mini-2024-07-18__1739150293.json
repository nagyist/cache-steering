  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that installers are moving rows of benches, which suggests a setting that is usually associated with seating arrangements.",
    "The potential locations from the choices include an office, church, bowling alley, building, and playground.",
    "An office typically doesn't have rows of benches, but rather desks and chairs, which makes it an unlikely choice.",
    "In a church, there are often rows of benches or pews, so moving them for carpet installation is a plausible scenario.",
    "A bowling alley may have seating, but it typically does not feature benches in rows like a church does. Instead, it might have tables and chairs but generally doesn't fit the description as closely.",
    "The term \u201cbuilding\u201d is too vague and not specific enough for the context of the question.",
    "A playground does not have benches; it's primarily an outdoor space for children to play, which makes it an unlikely setting for installing new carpet.",
    "Given all of the considerations, the most fitting option for moving rows of benches to put in new carpet is in a church."
