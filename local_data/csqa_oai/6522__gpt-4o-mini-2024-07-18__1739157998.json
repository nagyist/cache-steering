  "query": "Question: Where would you need a ladder to eat?\n\nChoices:\nA: garage\nB: hardware store\nC: apple orchard\nD: couch\nE: climbing to higher level",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine what type of space might require a ladder for eating.",
    "I think about places where food might be harvested or obtained from a height.",
    "In an apple orchard, apples are typically picked from trees, which are tall and require a ladder to reach the fruit.",
    "The other options do not involve food that would require a ladder to access.",
    "A garage and a hardware store may have food, but they are not specific places where one would typically need a ladder to eat.",
    "A couch does not require a ladder at all and is not associated with eating at heights.",
    "Climbing to a higher level could involve various places, but it is not specific enough to pinpoint where one would need a ladder specifically to eat.",
    "Thus, the apple orchard is the only specific place that clearly involves needing a ladder to obtain food, making it the best choice."
