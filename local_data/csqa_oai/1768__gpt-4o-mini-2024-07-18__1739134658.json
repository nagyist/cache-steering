  "query": "Question: Where can butter be found in small pats?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: restaurant\nC: inside a mammoth's handbag\nD: pastry\nE: fridge",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what \"small pats\" of butter refers to. Typically, small pats of butter are individual servings that are often used in dining situations.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options available to see which location would logically have small pats of butter.",
    "Option A, \"refrigerator,\" suggests a place where butter can be stored, but it is not specific about the form the butter is in.",
    "Option B, \"restaurant,\" is a potential choice. Restaurants commonly serve small pats of butter with meals, especially when serving bread.",
    "Option C, \"inside a mammoth's handbag,\" seems fantastical and unlikely. Mammoths are extinct, and their handbags wouldn't logically contain butter.",
    "Option D, \"pastry,\" suggests that butter might be in the form of ingredients for baked goods, but this does not refer to the physical form of butter as small pats.",
    "Option E, \"fridge,\" is another term for refrigerator. Like option A, it describes a storage area but does not specify the format of the butter.",
    "After evaluating the choices, the only option that makes the most sense for small pats of butter being available for immediate use is option B, \"restaurant.\""
