  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a type of building that sometimes has a basement.",
    "Many buildings can have basements, including houses, offices, churches, and shops.",
    "Next, we need to determine which type of building is occupied the most on the day after Saturday. The day after Saturday is Sunday.",
    "Offices are typically closed on Sundays, so they are less likely to be occupied on that day.",
    "Shops may also be closed on Sundays, depending on the type of shop and the local laws. However, many shops are open on Sundays, but they might not be the most occupied.",
    "Churches are often quite busy on Sundays due to worship services, community gatherings, and events.",
    "A closet is not a type of building, so it doesn't fit the criteria.",
    "An own house might also be occupied on Sunday, but it is typically occupied by the residents, not by the general public.",
    "Comparing a church and a house, the church is likely more crowded on Sundays due to community activities.",
    "Thus, the building that sometimes has a basement and is occupied the most on the day after Saturday (Sunday) is most likely a church."
