  "query": "Question: John works for a company that doesn't make anything.  It just buys, sales, and does what?\n\nChoices:\nA: own resources\nB: mail order\nC: commit crime\nD: ship goods\nE: stock shelves",
  "steps": [
    "The company is described as one that doesn't make anything, which indicates it's not a manufacturing business.",
    "Since the company is involved in buying and selling, it likely engages in some form of commerce or trade.",
    "The option \u201cA: own resources\u201d does not fit as owning resources alone does not align with the company's buying and selling activities.",
    "The option \u201cB: mail order\u201d refers specifically to selling products through postal services, which might apply but does not encompass the overall activities of buying and selling in a general sense.",
    "The option \u201cC: commit crime\u201d implies illegal activities, which is not relevant to a general description of a company involved in buying and selling.",
    "The option \u201cD: ship goods\u201d relates to the logistical aspect of selling, which could be applicable. However, it may not fully describe the buying aspect.",
    "The option \u201cE: stock shelves\u201d deals more with retail operations and does not capture the essence of buying and selling as described in the prompt.",
    "Looking at the options again, \"buying and selling\" suggests that the company is functioning in a trading capacity, which can include shipping goods as part of that process.",
    "Between \u201cD: ship goods\u201d and \u201cB: mail order,\u201d \u201cD: ship goods\u201d appears more general and aligns better with both buying and selling.",
    "Confirming all previous steps, the most fitting answer to describe what the company does, alongside buying and selling, is to ship goods."
