  "query": "Question: The car had its turn signal one, where was it stopped?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighbor's house\nB: in phoenix\nC: repair shop\nD: sidewalk\nE: street corner",
  "steps": [
    "The clue in the question is the mention of the turn signal being \"on,\" which usually indicates that the vehicle is about to make a turn or is either parked or stopped at a location where it is signaling to other drivers.",
    "If the car is actively signaling, it's likely stopped at a location where it either intends to turn or is yielding to traffic; thus, options indicating that it's parked might be less plausible.",
    "Examining the choices: A neighbor's house implies a personal stop, while \"in Phoenix\" does not specify a stopping point. A \"repair shop\" suggests a planned visit for maintenance rather than a turn signal situation.",
    "The \"sidewalk\" doesn't typically allow for vehicles to stop unless it's an emergency, implying a temporary situation rather than a planned stop.",
    "The \"street corner\" is a common place for cars to signal before making a turn, making it a strong candidate since stop signals are used here frequently.",
    "Evaluating the context of other options again: the neighbor's house and repair shop imply a stationary state without contextual turn signal relevance, while the \"street corner\" fits the scenario.",
    "Connecting \"street corner\" with the implication of needing a turn signal makes it the most logical answer. It aligns with regular driving behavior when a turn signal is activated.",
    "Thus, after evaluating all choices and the context provided, the option that fits best is the \"street corner\" where cars commonly signal their intent to turn."
