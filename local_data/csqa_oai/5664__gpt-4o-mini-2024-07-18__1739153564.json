  "query": "Question: Where would you get  a map that shows locations that can only be walked to?\n\nChoices:\nA: cafeteria\nB: classroom\nC: truck stop\nD: amusement park\nE: gas station",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what locations are typically associated with maps that show walkable areas. Such maps might be more relevant in areas where walking is the primary means of transportation.",
    "Next, I will analyze each choice for its relevance to walkable areas. Cafeterias and classrooms are typically associated with indoor facilities and may not represent geographic areas well.",
    "Truck stops, on the other hand, are places where travelers stop often for fuel and food, but they are usually located near highways and don't emphasize walking.",
    "Amusement parks are designed for pedestrian access, and they typically cater to foot traffic. A map of an amusement park would certainly highlight walkable paths and attractions.",
    "Gas stations usually facilitate vehicular access, so while you can walk to them, they are not primarily focused on walkable areas in the same way that an amusement park would be.",
    "Comparing the options, the amusement park stands out as the best choice because it is specifically designed with walkable areas and attractions that rely on pedestrian access.",
    "The cafeteria and classroom do not usually have specific maps indicating walkability, as they are contained within buildings. The truck stop primarily services vehicles, and gas stations cater more to drivers.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer is that an amusement park would provide the type of map that shows locations that can only be walked to."
