  "query": "Question: John cooled the steam. What did the steam become?\n\nChoices:\nA: condensate\nB: electric smoke\nC: smoke\nD: liquid water\nE: cold air",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves the physical process of cooling steam, which is generally a phase change of water.",
    "Steam is water in its gaseous state, and when steam is cooled, it loses energy and transitions back into a liquid state.",
    "The common term for this transition from gas (steam) back to liquid is condensation.",
    "As a result of the condensation process, the steam turns into liquid water.",
    "While \u201ccondensate\u201d may refer to the liquid formed after condensation, the term \"liquid water\" is more straightforward and commonly understood.",
    "Now I will evaluate each of the options provided in the question to find which one best describes the state of the steam after cooling.",
    "Option A: \"condensate\" could be a correct scientific term, but it is less commonly used than \"liquid water.\"",
    "Option B: \"electric smoke\" is not relevant as it is not a recognized term in this context.",
    "Option C: \"smoke\" is incorrect; smoke refers to the result of burning substances and not cooling steam.",
    "Option D: \"liquid water\" fits the description of what happens when steam is cooled, since steam condenses into water.",
    "Finally, Option E: \"cold air\" is also incorrect because it doesn\u2019t accurately describe the product of cooling steam."
