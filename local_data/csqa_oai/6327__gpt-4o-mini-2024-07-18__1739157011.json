  "steps": [
    "The question asks what a team would be doing if a winning baseball game is imminent, which implies they are on the verge of winning.",
    "Winning a game typically leads to a sense of fulfillment and happiness for the team.",
    "Among the response options, \"celebrating\" aligns most closely with the behavior of a team that is about to win.",
    "\"Pride\" and \"joy\" are emotions that may be felt, but they do not directly describe an action being taken by the team.",
    "\"Recognition\" refers to acknowledgment rather than any specific action related to winning.",
    "\"Going home\" would only occur after the game, not as a reaction to an imminent win.",
    "Since the main activity a team would engage in when a win is about to happen involves expressing joy and excitement, \"celebrating\" is the most fitting answer."
