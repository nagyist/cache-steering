  "query": "Question: You can hang laundry in the sun to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: warm room\nB: dry clothes\nC: warm house\nD: fade color\nE: brown skin",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, hanging laundry in the sun is a common method used to dry clothes naturally. The warmth from the sun helps to evaporate moisture from the fabrics.",
    "Secondly, while drying clothes, there is also some degree of fading that can happen to the colors of the fabric due to UV exposure, but this is not the primary reason why people choose to hang laundry in the sun.",
    "Additionally, one could argue about warming a house (option C) by drying clothes indoors near another heat source, but that does not directly relate to hanging laundry outside in the sun.",
    "Looking at option A, warming a room, and option C again, these are also not accurate since hanging laundry is typically done outdoors.",
    "Considering option E, while sun exposure can cause tanning of the skin, it is unrelated to the act of drying clothes.",
    "Conclusively, the best answer that aligns with the primary purpose of hanging laundry in the sun is drying clothes; thus, option B fits perfectly."
