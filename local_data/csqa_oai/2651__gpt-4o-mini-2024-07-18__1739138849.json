  "query": "Question: What type of structure has doorways that are connected to vehicles?\n\nChoices:\nA: airport\nB: castle\nC: library\nD: every building\nE: zoo",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options given. The question asks for a structure with doorways that connect directly to vehicles.",
    "Next, we consider each choice. An \"airport\" is designed to accommodate planes and passengers, with direct connections from terminals to vehicles like buses and taxis.",
    "Then, we analyze the \"castle.\" While castles may have gates for drawbridges or vehicles, they are primarily historical structures not commonly associated with modern vehicle access.",
    "Next, we look at the \"library.\" Libraries typically do not have direct connections to vehicles, aside from parking lots, which do not constitute a doorway connection.",
    "Now, we consider \"every building.\" This is too broad as not all buildings are designed for vehicles to have direct access through doorways.",
    "Lastly, we examine the \"zoo.\" Zoos do have parking lots and can have service vehicles, but they do not commonly allow general vehicle access through doorways like an airport does.",
    "Considering the above analyses, the only option that consistently has doorways connecting to vehicles is the \"airport.\""
