  "query": "Question: If you rent a condominium in a glove-shaped state where are you?\n\nChoices:\nA: great lake state\nB: michigan\nC: community\nD: towels\nE: complex",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies a \"glove-shaped state,\" which is often a reference to the outline of Michigan.",
    "The phrase \"glove-shaped\" refers to the fact that Michigan's Lower Peninsula resembles a glove when viewed on a map.",
    "The question mentions renting a condominium, which is typically done in states or areas with housing units rather than in abstract concepts like \"community\" or \"towels.\"",
    "The available answer options include both specific locations (A: great lake state, B: michigan) and abstract concepts (C: community, D: towels, E: complex).",
    "Answer A refers to Michigan as one of the Great Lakes states, but does not directly answer where one is while renting a condominium.",
    "Answer B, \"michigan,\" directly identifies the state where the condominium rental would take place, given the context of the question.",
    "Answers C, D, and E (community, towels, and complex) do not relate logically to the geographical location of renting a condominium in the context provided.",
    "Based on the reasoning that Michigan is the state referred to as glove-shaped and is where the rental would occur, B is the most accurate choice.",
    "I can confirm that Michigan is indeed known for its glove-like shape and it is a state where you can rent a condominium."
