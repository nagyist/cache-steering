  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the initial action a person must take to sort a pile of stuff.",
    "Sorting typically involves organizing and categorizing items, which requires an understanding of what needs to be sorted initially.",
    "Among the provided options, I will analyze which option relates most directly to the action of sorting.",
    "Option A, \"control computer,\" does not relate to sorting physical items and is irrelevant in this context.",
    "Option B, \"go on vacation,\" has no relation to sorting; it implies an absence rather than an action related to sorting.",
    "Option C, \"cross street,\" is also irrelevant, as it does not pertain to the task of sorting.",
    "Option D, \"gain weight,\" is unrelated to the task of sorting any items and has no logical connection to the process.",
    "Option E, \"separate things,\" directly relates to the process of sorting because sorting involves separating different items into categories or groups.",
    "Since \"separate things\" is directly related to the action required to start the sorting process, it is the most appropriate choice."
