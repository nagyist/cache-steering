  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the objective: Sally wants to keep her saltshaker somewhere that is easy to find but also out of the way.",
    "The dinner table is typically a high-traffic area where items are used frequently, so it might not be considered \u201cout of the way\u201d.",
    "A table setting is also part of a dining area and would thus not meet the criteria of being out of the way, as items are often set there for meals.",
    "Her own kitchen could be a possibility, but it is a broad term and does not specifically indicate a place that fits both criteria well.",
    "The kitchen counter is often a busy area as well, similar to the dinner table and not out of the way.",
    "Finally, a cabinet would be a place that is typically used for storage. It is definitely out of the way and can still be accessed easily when needed.",
    "Given the criteria of being easy to find but out of the way, the cabinet stands out as the best option."
