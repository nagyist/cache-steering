  "steps": [
    "The elephant swam with its trunk above the water, which implies that it was likely able to breathe while swimming.",
    "When swimming, an elephant can keep its trunk above the water, allowing it to take in air regularly.",
    "Among the choices provided, options A (experience sadness), C (remember everything), and E (forget nothing) do not relate directly to the action of swimming.",
    "Option B (choke) is also unlikely since the trunk is above water, thus preventing the elephant from swallowing water.",
    "The only choice that directly relates to the ability of the elephant while swimming with its trunk above water is D (breathe)."
