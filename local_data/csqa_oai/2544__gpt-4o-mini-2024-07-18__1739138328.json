  "query": "Question: Ficus are in the family Moraceae, and is part of what much broader spectrum?\n\nChoices:\nA: science class\nB: garden\nC: flowerpot\nD: arboretum\nE: plant kingdom",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about Ficus and its classification within a broader context.",
    "Ficus belongs to the family Moraceae, which is a classification within botany.",
    "To determine what broader spectrum Ficus is part of, we need to look at its place in the taxonomy of plants.",
    "In biological classification, family is a relatively narrow grouping, and it falls under the category of order, class, and eventually kingdom.",
    "The ultimate classification level in botany is the plant kingdom, which includes all plants.",
    "Ficus, being a type of plant, is clearly part of the plant kingdom.",
    "The options provided include various contexts (science class, garden, flowerpot, arboretum, and plant kingdom).",
    "Among these options, only \"plant kingdom\" accurately describes the broadest classification to which Ficus belongs.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the necessary answer refers to the kingdom level of taxonomy."
