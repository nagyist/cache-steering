  "query": "Question: The entrance hall had the host standing inside, what was the host?\n\nChoices:\nA: palace\nB: school\nC: person\nD: yoda\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the identity of \"the host\" that is standing inside the entrance hall.",
    "The term \"host\" typically refers to a person who receives or entertains guests.",
    "Considering the context of standing in an entrance hall, it aligns more closely with a person rather than a building or an entity.",
    "Option A, \"palace,\" refers to a type of building and cannot be a host.",
    "Option B, \"school,\" is also a type of institution, not a host in the context given.",
    "Option D, \"yoda,\" is a character from fiction, but may not be relevant unless specified as a host in a certain event.",
    "Option E, \"house,\" is another structure and, similarly to \"palace\" and \"school,\u201d cannot serve as a host.",
    "The most logical interpretation is that \"the host\" is indeed a person who is welcoming guests in the entrance hall.",
    "Since \"person\" is explicitly given as an option, I verify that it matches the concept of a host.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer must be the choice that corresponds to \"host\" being a person."
