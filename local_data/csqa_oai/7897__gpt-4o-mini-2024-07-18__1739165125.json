  "steps": [
    "I begin by identifying what types of entertainment activities can be watched on a screen.",
    "Movies are a common form of entertainment that are specifically designed to be watched on screens, such as in cinemas or on TV.",
    "A casino is not typically associated with watching entertainment on a screen; it is primarily a place for gambling.",
    "Theatre generally refers to live performances, which may not directly involve screens, although some theaters may use screens for performances.",
    "A show usually refers to a performance that can be televised or streamed, which aligns with watching something on a screen.",
    "Comedy can also be presented in shows or movies, and there are comedy specials made for screen viewing as well.",
    "Among the choices, both A (movie), D (show), and E (comedy) are specific forms of entertainment that can be viewed on a screen.",
    "However, A (movie) is far more directly related to the experience of viewing something on a screen than the other options.",
    "After considering the relevance of each option to the context of entertainment seen on a screen, the best and most straightforward answer is A (movie)."
