  "steps": [
    "First, identify what type of items are typically sold at sporting goods stores. These stores typically offer athletic wear, equipment for various sports, and related accessories.",
    "Next, examine the options provided. The options include \u201ctown\u201d, \u201ccity\u201d, \u201cretail shopping district\u201d, \u201cbaseball\u201d, and \u201cjerseys\u201d.",
    "Assess the relevance of each option to \"uniform tops.\" Options A (town) and B (city) do not pertain to any type of athletic or sporting clothing.",
    "Option C (retail shopping district) describes a location rather than a type of clothing or uniform top, so it can also be eliminated.",
    "Now, consider options D (baseball) and E (jerseys). Both are related to sporting apparel.",
    "Determine which option directly corresponds to a type of uniform top available at a sporting goods store. \"Baseball\" (D) refers specifically to one sport, while \"jerseys\" (E) can encompass various sports, including baseball, basketball, and football.",
    "Since the term \"jerseys\" (E) is broader and includes various types of uniform tops that can be purchased for multiple sports, it is likely the better answer in this context.",
    "Therefore, the final conclusion is that the most appropriate answer choice for uniform tops sold at a sporting goods store is \"jerseys.\""
