  "query": "Question: As they left his house he insured them that it was okay they could come to the party too because it was taking place where?\n\nChoices:\nA: friend's house\nB: home\nC: patio\nD: fraternity house\nE: boat",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that someone is reassuring others that they can attend a party.",
    "The reassurance is about the location of the party, which is implied to be somewhere valid and acceptable to the speakers.",
    "Each of the choices suggests a possible location for the party.",
    "\"Friend's house\" suggests a casual and friendly gathering, which could align with the context.",
    "\"Home\" is vague and could refer to many scenarios, making it less likely as a specific answer.",
    "\"Patio\" indicates an outdoor gathering which is possible but less common for parties in general.",
    "\"Fraternity house\" implies a college party but may not fit the context unless specific information was given indicating a campus setting.",
    "\"Boat\" is unconventional for a typical gathering unless explicitly stated, which is absent here.",
    "Considering the context, \"friend's house\" seems to be the most appropriate and likely location where social gatherings typically happen comfortably.",
    "I will compare friend\u2019s house to the other plausible options and find that it generally fits casual party scenarios well, aligning with the reassurance aspect in the question."
