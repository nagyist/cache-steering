  "steps": [
    "The question involves sending a piece of mail, which implies that there is an action related to mailing something.",
    "To send mail, one typically needs to go to a location where mail can be sent or dropped off.",
    "Option A (table) is not a logical place to send mail as it is a piece of furniture and does not relate to mailing.",
    "Option C (neighbor's house) may be an option if one is sending something to a neighbor, but it does not address the act of mailing in the traditional sense.",
    "Option D (railway station) could be a location for sending packages, but it is not a standard location for mailing letters or small parcels.",
    "Option E (fridge) is irrelevant as it is an appliance for storing food and has no connection to mail.",
    "Option B (post office) is the most logical choice, as it is specifically designed for sending mail and handling postal services.",
    "The question asks where the speaker went to send mail, so the most appropriate answer is the post office."
