  "query": "Question: Where would you find a welcome mat in a house?\n\nChoices:\nA: floors\nB: desert\nC: school\nD: doorway\nE: bathroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what a welcome mat is typically used for in a house. It's usually placed to greet guests.",
    "Next, I think about the common locations within a house where a mat might be found. A welcome mat would often be located at the entrance.",
    "By considering the entrance to a house, I realize that the most logical location for a welcome mat is at the doorway, where people enter.",
    "I can eliminate other options: \"A: floors\" is too general and doesn't specify where on the floors; \"B: desert\" is not relevant; \"C: school\" doesn't fit a household context; and \"E: bathroom\" is not a typical place for a welcome mat.",
    "Thus, the best answer must relate specifically to the function of a welcome mat within a residential setting."
