  "steps": [
    "To determine where a human can go on Sunday, I need to evaluate common activities and places associated with Sundays.",
    "Sundays are often considered a day of rest or leisure for many people, so typical destinations include places of worship, family gatherings, and outings.",
    "A: Jail is not a typical recreational destination for a human on Sunday unless they are visiting someone or involved in judicial duties.",
    "B: Love is an abstract concept rather than a physical destination, making it less applicable as a place one can \"go\".",
    "C: Restaurants are popular Sunday outing destinations; many people go to brunch or dinner at restaurants on Sundays.",
    "D: Church is a traditional place people attend on Sundays for worship and community, making it a significant option.",
    "E: Homes are places where people live, and they can certainly stay home on Sunday, but it's not an \"out\" destination unless visiting someone else.",
    "Now I need to determine which out of these choices is the most standard or common activity associated with Sundays.",
    "Both restaurants and churches are valid destinations. However, church attendance is more universally recognized as a Sunday activity in many cultures.",
    "Considering that going to the restaurant is also a common Sunday activity, I note both options (C and D) could be part of a Sunday for many people.",
    "Ultimately, the question asks where a human can go, which accepts multiple answers but gives preference to significant cultural practices associated with Sunday."
