  "query": "Question: Even when one of the slaves dropped dead on the line the rest were forced to keep what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being\nB: working\nC: alive\nD: jumping\nE: breathing",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates a scenario where slaves are subjected to harsh conditions, emphasizing the need to continue despite suffering or death.",
    "The phrase \"the rest were forced to keep\" suggests that the remaining slaves had to continue performing their duties or tasks in response to an event (the death of one slave).",
    "Among the choices, \"working\" aligns with the context of forced labor. It implies that despite one slave dropping dead, the remaining ones had no choice but to continue their labor.",
    "The other options: \"being,\" \"alive,\" \"jumping,\" and \"breathing.\" While \"alive\" and \"breathing\" are relevant in a dire context, they do not reflect an action that the slaves were 'forced' to keep doing. Instead, they are states of existence.",
    "\u201cJumping\u201d does not fit the context as it does not relate to the forced labor scenario that is being described.",
    "Therefore, \"working\" is the most fitting answer since it directly relates to the action required of the slaves in the face of adversity."
