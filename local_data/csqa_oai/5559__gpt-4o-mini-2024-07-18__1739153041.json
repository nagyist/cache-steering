  "query": "Question: The roadway  led away from town and towards what?\n\nChoices:\nA: neighborhood\nB: city\nC: environment\nD: metropolis\nE: countryside",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the direction the roadway leads towards, which is away from town.",
    "Typically, when a roadway leads away from a town, it tends to head towards areas that are less urbanized or more natural.",
    "The options given include different types of locations: a neighborhood (A), city (B), environment (C), metropolis (D), and countryside (E).",
    "A neighborhood (A) and a city (B) both suggest urban areas, which are not consistent with the idea of a roadway leading away from town.",
    "A metropolis (D) also implies a large urban center, which is still not fitting for \"away from town.\"",
    "The term environment (C) is quite broad and could refer to natural settings, but it does not specifically indicate a rural area.",
    "The term countryside (E) most specifically refers to rural areas or open land that typically lie outside urban environments, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Considering that the roadway is moving away from the more densely populated town, the countryside (E) is indeed the most logical conclusion.",
    "Thus, out of all the options, \"countryside\" is the only one that strongly aligns with what one would expect to find when going away from a town."
