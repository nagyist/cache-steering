  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the context of the statement. It mentions that \"he never got in trouble,\" which suggests positive conduct or behavior.",
    "Next, we consider what kind of recognition or certificate is typically awarded for positive behavior. This is often associated with \"good behavior\" or similar.",
    "Looking at the answer choices, we note that \"D: being good\" and \"E: good behavior\" both relate to positive conduct.",
    "However, \"E: good behavior\" is a more specific term and is commonly used in contexts where certificates or awards are given for not misbehaving or for exemplary behavior.",
    "In contrast, \"D: being good\" is a broader term and may not be the exact terminology used in certificates.",
    "Now, we compare \"good behavior\" with the other options in relation to the context. \"A: safe\" and \"B: park\" do not relate to behavioral recognition. \"C: calm\" is also not applicable in this context.",
    "Thus, the strongest candidate that fits the situation and is commonly associated with receiving a certificate for positive actions is \"E: good behavior.\""
