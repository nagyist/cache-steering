  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a child can learn about the adventures of a talking monkey.",
    "A talking monkey is typically a character found in stories, myths, or books rather than in real life.",
    "Option A (rain forest) is a natural habitat but does not specifically suggest a source of stories or adventures.",
    "Option B (tropical areas) is also a habitat description and similar to option A, does not indicate a specific learning source.",
    "Option C (pet store) implies a place where animals are sold, and it wouldn\u2019t typically offer stories or adventures of animals.",
    "Option D (library) is a place where books are stored, which could include stories and literature about adventures, including those of a talking monkey.",
    "Option E (story book) directly indicates a source of stories that would likely contain adventures, including those featuring a talking monkey.",
    "Between options D (library) and E (story book), option E is more specific to the context of the adventures of a talking monkey.",
    "Thus, the best answer that directly relates to learning about the adventures of a talking monkey is option E (story book)."
