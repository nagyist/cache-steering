  "query": "Question: The helm is not something you wear on your head. Rather, it moves the masts on what?\n\nChoices:\nA: sailing vessel\nB: paddleboat\nC: ship\nD: motorboat\nE: tugboat",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the helm is not something to wear, which indicates that it is an object related to navigation or control on a vessel.",
    "The term \"helm\" refers to the apparatus for steering a ship or other vessel, which includes the wheel and any associated mechanisms.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices provided. Option A, \"sailing vessel,\" includes any type of boat that is operated primarily with sails, which often require a helm for steering.",
    "Option B, \"paddleboat,\" uses a different mechanism for propulsion (paddles) and does not typically involve a traditional helm for steering.",
    "Option C, \"ship,\" is a broad category that includes many types of watercraft and does require a helm for navigation.",
    "Option D, \"motorboat,\" is propelled by an engine, but still typically has a helm for steering control.",
    "Option E, \"tugboat,\" is a specific type of boat designed to tow or push larger vessels; it also uses a helm for steering.",
    "Through analysis, options A, C, D, and E involve forms of navigation that would typically utilize a helm.",
    "However, the mention of \"masts\" can be particularly associated with sailing vessels, which leads back to option A.",
    "Since the helm in question is specifically stated to move masts, a sailing vessel is the most fitting choice, as it directly involves the manipulation of masts with sails."
