  "query": "Question: Where would you put things in a paper bag?\n\nChoices:\nA: synagogue\nB: classroom\nC: grocery store\nD: lunchbox\nE: front porch",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the context of putting things in a paper bag. A paper bag is generally associated with transporting or storing items.",
    "Next, I will consider the choices. A synagogue typically doesn\u2019t involve the use of paper bags for storage or transport, so it's not a suitable option.",
    "Then, looking at a classroom, while I might carry supplies to a classroom in a paper bag, it doesn\u2019t seem like the primary use of a paper bag.",
    "For a grocery store, paper bags are commonly used to hold groceries or food items after shopping, which is a typical and relevant situation for using a paper bag.",
    "Next, I will consider a lunchbox. A lunchbox is used to transport food, but it is typically a more rigid and structured container than a paper bag. While paper bags can be used for lunch, they are less common than lunchboxes.",
    "Lastly, the front porch does not align well with the concept of putting things in a paper bag as it is generally a location rather than a situation involving storage or transport.",
    "Given these considerations, the most suitable location for putting things in a paper bag is at the grocery store, where they are frequently used."
