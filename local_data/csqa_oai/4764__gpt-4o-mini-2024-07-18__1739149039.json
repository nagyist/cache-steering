  "query": "Question: Where do you use condoms?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: dick\nC: bedroom\nD: medicine chest\nE: bed",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the primary purpose of condoms, which is to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections during sexual intercourse.",
    "Next, I analyze the environment where condoms are typically used for their intended purpose.",
    "In a sexual context, the most common location for intercourse is in the bedroom.",
    "While condoms could theoretically be found in a medicine chest, as a storage place, that is not where they are used.",
    "At the supermarket, condoms can be bought, but they are not used there.",
    "The option \"dick\" is not a location where condoms are used; rather, it would be the external organ that condoms cover.",
    "Looking at other choices, \u201cbed\u201d is a potential area, but it is vague compared to \"bedroom,\" which clearly indicates a specific context.",
    "Based on this, I conclude that the best answer encompassing the location where condoms are used during their intended purpose is the \"bedroom.\""
