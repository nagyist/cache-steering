  "query": "Question: What do marine life use to shelter themselves from a shark?\n\nChoices:\nA: coral reef\nB: television program\nC: pacific ocean\nD: open ocean\nE: seaweed",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the key concept in the question: marine life sheltering from sharks.",
    "Next, consider the various options provided for shelter that marine life might use.",
    "Option A is the coral reef, which is known to provide habitat and protection for many types of marine life, as it has complex structures that can hide them from predators.",
    "Option B, a television program, is irrelevant to marine life and cannot provide any shelter.",
    "Option C, the Pacific Ocean, is a large area of water, but it doesn't provide specific structures for shelter.",
    "Option D, the open ocean, also lacks specific shelters like reefs or vegetation; rather, it is relatively barren and less protective against predators.",
    "Option E, seaweed, provides some level of shelter but is not as effective as coral reefs, which offer more comprehensive hiding places.",
    "Thus, among all the options, the most suitable and effective shelter for marine life from sharks would be the coral reef.",
    "After considering all options and analyzing their relevance to the question, it becomes clear that the coral reef (option A) is the best answer."
