  "query": "Question: He explained the differences between a town and township, the latter of which were common in which of the fifty?\n\nChoices:\nA: valley\nB: michigan\nC: train station\nD: executive suites.\nE: state",
  "steps": [
    "First, I analyze the question, which is asking about the commonality of townships in one of the fifty states.",
    "Next, I consider the characteristics of townships, which are often subdivisions of counties and have distinct governmental frameworks.",
    "I recall that certain states, particularly in the Midwest, have a historical prevalence of townships due to factors such as land distribution and settlement patterns.",
    "I specifically think about Michigan, which is known for its townships and has many of them as part of its local government structure.",
    "Now, I review the answer choices to see if any correspond to the characteristics of townships.",
    "Choice A, \"valley,\" does not represent a state or a governmental division.",
    "Choice C, \"train station,\" is unrelated to townships or governmental divisions.",
    "Choice D, \"executive suites,\" also does not relate to townships or state governance.",
    "Choice E, \"state,\" is too vague as it does not specify which state but is an indication that we are discussing a state level.",
    "Thus, my analysis points to Michigan as the state where townships are quite prevalent."
