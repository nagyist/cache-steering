  "query": "Question: What would you need at least two computers to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: share files\nB: cost money\nC: multitask\nD: do work\nE: do arithmetic",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze each option to see what requires at least two computers.",
    "Option A, \"share files,\" typically requires at least two devices to transfer files back and forth.",
    "Option B, \"cost money,\" is not dependent on the number of computers; it pertains to expenses in general.",
    "Option C, \"multitask,\" can usually be done on a single computer by running multiple programs at once.",
    "Option D, \"do work,\" can be accomplished on a single computer as well; multiple computers aren't necessary for this.",
    "Option E, \"do arithmetic,\" can clearly be done on any single computer or device without needing another.",
    "Now comparing the options that truly require two computers, only A stands out, as sharing files inherently implies communication and interaction between at least two computers.",
    "I will confirm that option A necessitates at least two computers, as single-computer setups do not facilitate file sharing.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the only listed activity requiring two computers is file sharing."
