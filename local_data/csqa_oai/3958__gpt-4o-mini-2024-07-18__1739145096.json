  "query": "Question: When doing housework, what would be most useful to clean the patio?\n\nChoices:\nA: mop\nB: mobility\nC: vacuuming\nD: toothbrush\nE: broom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what cleaning a patio typically involves. Patios usually accumulate dirt, dust, leaves, and other debris.",
    "Next, I should evaluate what cleaning tool would be effective for outdoor surfaces like those found on a patio.",
    "A mop is generally used for indoor floors, which may not be suitable for the rougher surface of a patio. So, option A can be dismissed.",
    "Option B, mobility, is not a cleaning tool; it refers to the ease of moving around, so it is not applicable.",
    "Option C, vacuuming, may not be effective outdoors unless it is a special outdoor vacuum designed for patios. Standard vacuum cleaners may struggle with larger debris or have limited outdoor suitability.",
    "A toothbrush, as stated in option D, is ineffective for cleaning large outdoor areas like a patio. It is too small and would take an impractically long time.",
    "Now, evaluating option E, a broom is commonly used for sweeping outdoor areas, making it very effective for removing dirt, leaves, and other debris from a patio.",
    "Considering the analysis, the broom (option E) is the best tool available among the ones listed specifically for cleaning a patio."
