  "query": "Question: Where in your pants would you keep a kleenex?\n\nChoices:\nA: pocket\nB: box\nC: blow nose\nD: purse\nE: bag",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the context of the question, which is about keeping a tissue (Kleenex) in pants.",
    "Consider the options provided: pocket, box, blow nose, purse, and bag.",
    "Evaluate option A (pocket): Pockets are a common place to store small items like tissues, making this a reasonable answer.",
    "Evaluate option B (box): A box is not typically part of pants and is not a suitable location for keeping a tissue while wearing pants.",
    "Evaluate option C (blow nose): This option does not pertain to storing a tissue in pants but rather describes an action using the tissue.",
    "Evaluate option D (purse): A purse is not part of pants; it\u2019s an accessory carried separately, thus not a relevant answer.",
    "Evaluate option E (bag): Similar to a purse, a bag is not part of pants and is not relevant for keeping a tissue within pants.",
    "Since option A (pocket) is the only option directly relevant to the question of where in pants to keep a tissue, this is likely the most logical answer."
