  "query": "Question: If someone rents a room where would the passageway to it be located?\n\nChoices:\nA: hotel\nB: cave\nC: jungle\nD: maze\nE: freeway",
  "steps": [
    "First, I think about what a room is and where it usually exists. A room is typically a form of accommodation found in buildings designed for staying or living temporarily.",
    "Next, I analyze the options provided. A hotel is a place specifically designed for people to rent rooms, making it a strong candidate for where a passageway could lead to a room.",
    "I consider the other options as well. A cave is a natural formation and typically does not have rooms that can be rented in the traditional sense.",
    "A jungle is a wild area filled with dense vegetation; while cabins or lodges could be found, they are not typically described as rooms that can be rented in the way hotels are.",
    "A maze might have rooms, but it is not a conventional place for renting accommodation, as it's more of a navigational puzzle than a lodging space.",
    "A freeway is a type of road intended for traveling, and it does not contain rooms at all, so it cannot be where a passageway to a rented room would be located.",
    "After evaluating all the options, it becomes clear that the most logical answer is a hotel, as it is a common place where rooms are rented, with clear passageways to access those rooms."
