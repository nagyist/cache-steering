  "query": "Question: Two basketball teams were on the court playing ball. The first team had over 100 points while the second team trailed by more than 50. It was almost certain that the second team would do what to the game?\n\nChoices:\nA: competition\nB: lose\nC: throwing\nD: having fun\nE: running",
  "steps": [
    "The first team has over 100 points, which indicates they are performing very well offensively.",
    "The second team is trailing by more than 50 points, which means they have scored significantly fewer points compared to the first team.",
    "Given the large point deficit (over 50 points), it is highly unlikely for the second team to make a successful comeback.",
    "In basketball, being this far behind usually leads to the conclusion that the second team is likely going to lose the game, barring an extraordinary turnaround.",
    "The question asks what is \"almost certain\" to happen to the second team considering their current situation.",
    "Out of the provided options, \"lose\" directly reflects the outcome associated with being so far behind in points.",
    "The other options (competition, throwing, having fun, running) do not directly indicate the probable consequence of being in a losing position.",
    "Thus, the most logical conclusion based on the reasoning is that the second team would lose the game."
