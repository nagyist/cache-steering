    "To address the issue of a dog biting nearby people, it\u2019s essential to first understand that controlling the dog's behavior is key to preventing bites.",
    "One effective way to manage a dog's movements and interactions with others is to use physical restraints when necessary.",
    "Among the options given, a leash is a device specifically designed for controlling dogs in public and ensuring they do not reach people too closely, which helps prevent biting.",
    "Other options, such as a rope (A), might not be ideal as they may not provide the same quick-release or control as a proper leash.",
    "A porch (B) and front door (D) are physical locations, and while they provide some separation from people, they do not actively prevent a dog from biting if the dog is outside.",
    "A backyard (E) similarly restricts a dog to an enclosed space, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem when the dog is in the presence of other individuals.",
    "In summary, the most direct and effective means of preventing a dog from biting nearby people in any given setting is to use a leash (C), as it provides immediate control and regulation of the dog's behavior."
