  "query": "Question: There is plenty of noise when you're at what celebration featuring food and games?\n\nChoices:\nA: factory\nB: there will be no food allowed in the theatre.\nC: transmission\nD: big city\nE: carnival",
  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a celebration that prominently includes food and games.",
    "Looking at the options, \"carnival\" typically is known for being a festive event with various activities, including games and food stalls.",
    "On the other hand, options like \"factory\" and \"theatre\" do not typically involve celebrations, nor are they associated with food and games.",
    "\"Transmission\" does not fit the context of a celebration featuring food and games as it refers to the act of sending something from one place to another and is usually not celebratory.",
    "Lastly, \"big city\" could imply various activities but does not specifically connote a celebration that includes food and games.",
    "Thus, \"carnival\" is the only option that fits the description of a noisy celebration featuring food and games."
