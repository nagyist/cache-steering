  "query": "Question: The children were running late for school, after eating breakfast they left behind their what?\n\nChoices:\nA: being satisfied\nB: dirty dishes\nC: bad breath\nD: blue bus\nE: gas",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the children were running late for school and implies that they were in a rush after breakfast.",
    "When children eat breakfast, there are often dishes involved that need to be cleaned after the meal.",
    "Out of the given choices, \"dirty dishes\" logically fits as something that could be left behind when rushing to school.",
    "\"Being satisfied\" is an emotional state and doesn\u2019t fit the context of something physical that could be left behind.",
    "\"Bad breath\" is a consequence of eating but is not a physical object that could be left behind.",
    "\"A blue bus\" does not relate to the context of breakfast and is unlikely something they would leave behind as it denotes a mode of transport, not an item at home.",
    "\"Gas\" is a product of digestion and doesn't apply to the context of something they could leave behind after breakfast.",
    "Therefore, the only choice that makes sense in the context of late children after breakfast is \"dirty dishes.\""
