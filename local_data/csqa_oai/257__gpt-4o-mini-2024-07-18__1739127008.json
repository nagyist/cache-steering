  "query": "Question: I'm at a restaurant ans want a glass of milk, how do I find out if they serve that?\n\nChoices:\nA: accompaniment to meal\nB: waitress\nC: cafeteria\nD: home\nE: menu",
  "steps": [
    "To find out if a restaurant serves something, it is common to first check a physical or digital resource available at the restaurant.",
    "One of the most straightforward methods is to look at the menu, as it typically lists all available beverages.",
    "If the menu does not specify if they serve milk, you could then ask the staff for clarification.",
    "A waitress is usually readily available in a restaurant and can confirm whether milk is served.",
    "Evaluating the choices presented, the option \"E: menu\" is the best first step since it may directly indicate the availability of milk without needing to ask.",
    "However, \"B: waitress\" is the next best option if the menu does not provide an answer.",
    "We can conclude that checking the menu is a quick way to satisfy the inquiry about milk servings.",
    "Since the menu is often the first resource to check before asking any staff, it holds primary importance in this context."
