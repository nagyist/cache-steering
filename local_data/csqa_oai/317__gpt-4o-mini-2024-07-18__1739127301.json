  "steps": [
    "The statement describes an \"obsessive man\" who frequently washes his hands, suggesting a behavior that might lead to negative consequences if excessive.",
    "The act of washing hands excessively may lead to physical side effects due to overexposure to water and soap.",
    "Irritation of the skin is a common consequence of frequently washing hands, as it can strip moisture and natural oils from the skin.",
    "Looking at the other options: \n- \"use soap\" (A) doesn't fit as a consequence of excessive washing.\n- \"cleanliness\" (C) is a positive outcome of washing but wouldn\u2019t typically result from doing it too much.\n- \"thinking\" (D) is unrelated and doesn't represent a physical condition that would result from hand washing.\n- \"wet towel\" (E) also does not describe a condition or consequence related to skin or health.",
    "Thus, the only option that represents a negative physical consequence of excessive hand washing is \"irritation\" (B)."
