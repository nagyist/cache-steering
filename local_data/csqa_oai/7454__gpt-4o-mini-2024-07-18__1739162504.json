  "query": "Question: What would you use to find out if there will be a cloud in the sky?\n\nChoices:\nA: night or day\nB: atmosphere\nC: car\nD: murky liquid\nE: weather report",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which option is directly relevant to predicting cloud formation in the sky.",
    "Option A (night or day) does not provide any information about clouds; it only indicates the time of day.",
    "Option B (atmosphere) is significant because clouds form in the atmosphere, but it does not directly inform whether there will be clouds at a given time.",
    "Option C (car) is completely irrelevant to weather forecasting or cloud observation.",
    "Option D (murky liquid) does not relate to cloud prediction and seems to have no connection to the sky or weather.",
    "Option E (weather report) is specifically designed to provide information regarding current and forecasted weather conditions, including cloud coverage.",
    "Upon reviewing all options, option E is the only one that can inform me about the presence of clouds.",
    "Therefore, the best choice for determining if there will be clouds in the sky is the weather report."
