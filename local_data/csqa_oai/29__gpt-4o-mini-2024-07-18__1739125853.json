    "The question involves preparing for a football game and mentions preventing glare.",
    "Glare is typically associated with screens or reflective surfaces, not physical locations or spaces.",
    "The most common surfaces where glare would be a concern during a televised football game are screens like televisions or projectors.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"television\" stands out as the only device that requires cleaning to prevent glare.",
    "The choices \"attic,\" \"corner,\" and \"ground\" do not relate to glare, as they are not reflective surfaces.",
