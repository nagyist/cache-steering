  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the appropriate location to keep musical instruments while traveling.",
    "Option A: \"music shop\" refers to a place where instruments are sold and repaired, not where one would keep them while traveling.",
    "Option B: \"laboratory\" typically relates to scientific work and experiments, and is not relevant to storing musical instruments.",
    "Option C: \"case\" suggests a container specifically designed for transporting instruments safely. This aligns directly with the question.",
    "Option D: \"operating room\" is a medical facility where surgeries are conducted, and is unrelated to musical instruments.",
    "Option E: \"shed\" could function as storage but is not specifically designed for instruments, making it less suitable than a case.",
