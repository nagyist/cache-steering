  "query": "Question: Where could you find a barbershop that is not in a separate building from other stores?\n\nChoices:\nA: hair salon\nB: small town\nC: shopping mall\nD: village\nE: city",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what is meant by a barbershop that is not in a separate building. This implies that the barbershop shares a building with other retail or service establishments.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the options provided to see which might commonly feature barbershops that are integrated with other businesses.",
    "A hair salon (Option A) could theoretically be in a shared space with a barbershop, but it does not guarantee that a barbershop is present at the same location. It is more focused on hairstyling for women.",
    "A small town (Option B) may or may not have barbershops in separate buildings or as part of other establishments. Additionally, small towns typically have fewer total businesses, impacting the likelihood of shared space.",
    "A shopping mall (Option C) usually has a variety of stores and services under one roof, making it a high probability location for a barbershop to exist within a shared building environment.",
    "A village (Option D) could have a barbershop, but similar to a small town, it may have separate stand-alone stores that do not share spaces with other retailers.",
    "A city (Option E) might contain areas where barbershops are located alongside other types of retail; however, cities often have many standalone buildings as well.",
    "Given the analysis, the choice that most clearly fits the criterion of containing a barbershop that shares a building with other stores is the shopping mall."
