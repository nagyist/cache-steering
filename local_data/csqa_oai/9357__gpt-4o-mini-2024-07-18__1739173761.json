  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a location where a crowded motorway is likely to be.",
    "A motorway is a type of road designed for fast-moving traffic, often found in urban or suburban areas, and is generally crowded during peak hours.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options one by one to find the best fit.",
    "Option A: \"Europe\" is too broad of a location. While Europe has many motorways, it does not specify a particularly crowded one.",
    "Option B: \"City\" suggests a high likelihood of crowded roads as urban areas typically experience heavy traffic.",
    "Option C: \"England\" is also a specific location within Europe that has a well-developed network of motorways. It pertains to a specific region within a larger context.",
    "Option D: \"Garage\" is not relevant as a garage refers to a parking structure and is not a motorway.",
    "Option E: \"New Jersey\" is a specific place known for congested roads, but again it is limited to one state rather than a broader concept like \u201ccity\u201d or the infrastructure of \u201cEngland\u201d.",
    "Both \"city\" and \"England\" could be correct, but \"city\" is more universally applicable for crowded motorways.",
    "Considering all the insights, \u201ccity\u201d represents the general type of environment most likely to have crowded motorways."
