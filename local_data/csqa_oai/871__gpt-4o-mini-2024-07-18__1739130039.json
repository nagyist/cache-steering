  "steps": [
    "The harpsichord is a musical instrument known for its distinctive sound and its historical significance in classical music.",
    "To determine where one is likely to hear a harpsichord, we can consider typical settings where classical instruments are performed.",
    "A concert hall is a venue specifically designed for performances, including orchestras and classical music, where harpsichords may be featured in baroque music performances.",
    "A museum could also have a harpsichord on display, or perhaps a historical performance may take place, but it is not primarily a venue for regular musical performances.",
    "In a band setting, while various instruments can be played, harpsichords are not commonly used in modern bands.",
    "A rubber band is simply an elastic band and has nothing to do with music or instruments.",
    "While both a concert hall and a museum might feature a harpsichord, the primary context for hearing it in performance is more associated with a concert hall.",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that the best option where one is most likely to hear a harpsichord is in a concert hall."
