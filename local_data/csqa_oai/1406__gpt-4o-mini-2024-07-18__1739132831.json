  "steps": [
    "The question states that Samantha had to stay on the waitlist until someone else did something that created space for her to join the game.",
    "We need to identify an action that would free up a spot in the game, allowing Samantha to join.",
    "Looking at the choices, we can see that \"opt out\" and \"leave\" seem relevant, as both imply that another player would be exiting the game.",
    "The choices \"separate,\" \"split apart,\" and \"opt out\" do not clearly suggest that a player is definitively leaving the game, but they could be interpreted in various ways.",
    "Between the options, \"opt out\" generally means that a player chooses not to participate anymore, which aligns closely with the idea of creating space.",
    "The option \"leave\" is also a potential match, as it suggests a player physically exiting the game, which would also free up space for Samantha.",
    "Since \"opt out\" is explicitly an action a player can take that leads to freeing up a spot, while \"leave\" can be interpreted in both literal and more casual senses, we need to consider the nuances.",
    "However, \"leave\" can mean quitting or departing, which fits better with the context of needing to create space for someone waiting.",
    "Both \"opt out\" and \"leave\" could be valid actions, but \"leave\" is clearer about someone exiting the game.",
    "Given that the actions \"opt out\" and \"leave\" are both options, but \"leave\" is more directly about creating immediate space, I will select \"leave\" as the definitive action being described."
