  "query": "Question: There is rain outside, what happens to the stuff left outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: wet ground\nB: start to fall\nC: grow\nD: wet soil\nE: wet things",
  "steps": [
    "First, when it rains, the water falls from the sky and interacts with the objects left outside.",
    "Next, the rainwater will primarily come into contact with surfaces such as the ground, plants, and any other items that are exposed.",
    "The most immediate effect of rain on the ground is that it becomes wet. Therefore, wet ground is a likely outcome.",
    "Additionally, items that are outside, like leaves or furniture, will also become wet from the rain.",
    "Wet soil is another possibility since rain directly impacts soil, but it is a subset of the broader category of wet ground.",
    "If we consider the rain's effect on either soil or other items, we can observe that everything exposed will have water on it, leading to them being wet.",
    "\"Wet things\" is a general way to describe any exposed items affected by the rain, including plants, soil, and objects.",
    "Looking at the choices provided, \"wet ground\" (A) and \"wet soil\" (D) are both specific cases of the broader category of \"wet things\" (E).",
    "Since \"wet things\" encompasses all types of wet surfaces and materials, it seems to cover all possible outcomes of rain.",
    "Therefore, while multiple answers are correct, \"wet things\" captures the most comprehensive result of rain affecting various items outside."
