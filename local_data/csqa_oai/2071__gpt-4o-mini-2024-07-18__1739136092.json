  "query": "Question: Someone with a disability caused by a stroke looses what in the left side?\n\nChoices:\nA: competence\nB: obesity\nC: qualification\nD: potential\nE: strength",
  "steps": [
    "A stroke can affect different parts of the brain, leading to various disabilities depending on the area that is affected. The left hemisphere of the brain generally controls the right side of the body.",
    "When a stroke occurs in the left side of the brain, it typically results in motor impairments on the right side of the body, including potential strength loss.",
    "The term \"strength\" refers to the ability to exert force, which is a common impairment for individuals affected by a stroke.",
    "While terms like competence, qualification, and potential can be relevant in a more abstract sense, they do not directly refer to physical impairments associated with stroke.",
    "Obesity is a condition that may stem from other health issues but is not directly lost as a result of a stroke, especially in the context of left or right side impairments.",
    "Thus, among the provided options, \"strength\" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly correlates with muscle and motor functions affected by a stroke in the left hemisphere."
