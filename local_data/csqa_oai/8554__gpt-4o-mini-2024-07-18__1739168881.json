  "query": "Question: He always wanted to be a farmer, but he never moved to the country and was what his whole life?\n\nChoices:\nA: farm land\nB: pod person\nC: industrial\nD: city dweller\nE: business man",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the initial statement: \"He always wanted to be a farmer.\" This indicates that his desire is related to farming or rural life.",
    "Next, we note that he \"never moved to the country,\" which suggests that despite his desire to be a farmer, he remained in an urban or non-rural environment.",
    "We now consider the phrase \"was what his whole life.\" This implies he took on a role or identity that is contradictory to his desire to be a farmer due to his choice to stay in an urban location.",
    "Reviewing the answer choices:\n- A: farm land \u2013 doesn\u2019t fit as this refers to land rather than a person.\n- B: pod person \u2013 is not relevant to farming or expected lifestyle.\n- C: industrial \u2013 could imply working in an industrial sector, not clearly indicative of rural farming.\n- D: city dweller \u2013 directly reflects someone living in an urban area, contrasting with his desire to farm.\n- E: business man \u2013 could also fit, but it seems less specific than city dweller regarding his life choices in the context given.",
    "Of the choices, \"city dweller\" most clearly encapsulates the idea of someone who lives in the city, which is in opposition to his desire to be a farmer and acknowledges his lifestyle choice.",
    "Choosing between C and D, while 'industrial' could represent a career path, 'city dweller' directly addresses his lifestyle and his decision to stay out of the country."
