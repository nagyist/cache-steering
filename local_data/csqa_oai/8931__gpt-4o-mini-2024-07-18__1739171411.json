  "query": "Question: Billy likes eating breakfast in bed, but he doesn't do it often.  He likes his clean sheets too much. Why doesn't he eat breakfast in bed that often?\n\nChoices:\nA: pleasure\nB: indigestion\nC: convenience\nD: spills\nE: feel guilty",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the scenario. Billy enjoys eating breakfast in bed but does not do it often due to a specific reason mentioned in the statement.",
    "The statement indicates that Billy does not eat breakfast in bed frequently because he \"likes his clean sheets too much.\" This suggests that he is concerned about keeping his sheets clean.",
    "We now evaluate the answer choices to see which one aligns with the reason given for Billy's reluctance to eat in bed.",
    "Choice A, \"pleasure,\" does not explain his hesitation; it rather implies he enjoys it.",
    "Choice B, \"indigestion,\" is unrelated to his reason for avoiding breakfast in bed.",
    "Choice C, \"convenience,\" does not touch on the cleanliness aspect mentioned and instead focuses on ease of doing something.",
    "Choice D, \"spills,\" directly relates to the concern about cleanliness. Spills could lead to dirty sheets, which aligns with why he values his clean sheets.",
    "Choice E, \"feel guilty,\" does not connect to the specific issue of keeping sheets clean and does not resonate with the reasoning provided.",
    "Among the choices, D (\"spills\") directly links to the concern about cleanliness, suggesting that mess would lead to dirty sheets. Thus, this covers the major reason why Billy avoids eating breakfast in bed."
