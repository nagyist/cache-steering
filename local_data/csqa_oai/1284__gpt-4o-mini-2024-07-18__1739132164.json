  "steps": [
    "The question asks where kids gather in the entrance hall at the request of teachers.",
    "Typically, teachers request students to meet in a specific location for various activities, such as classes, announcements, or events.",
    "Among the provided options, schools are commonly designed to have an entrance hall or lobby area where students can gather.",
    "A house is a private residence, and it is unlikely for teachers to gather kids in a house.",
    "A person cannot be a location where kids gather; it refers to an individual rather than a place.",
    "A palace is generally a large and grand building for royalty, which is not a typical setting for teachers and students to meet.",
    "A hospital is a healthcare facility, and although it might sometimes have waiting areas, it is not a place where teachers would gather kids.",
    "From the reasoning above, the only viable option for gathering kids at the request of teachers is the school, as it serves as a formal educational environment."
