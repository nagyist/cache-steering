  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that some people \"add up to something,\" implying that they contribute positively or achieve meaningful results in their lives.",
    "Conversely, it states that \"others put in no effort,\" which suggests that these individuals do not make contributions or achieve anything significant.",
    "The phrase \"ending with what result?\" asks for a conclusion regarding the consequence of not putting in effort.",
    "Considering the phrase \"amount to nothing\" seems to reflect the lack of effort leading to an absence of tangible results or achievements.",
    "The other options: \"talking loudly,\" \"mathematics,\" \"learn from each other,\" and \"state facts,\" do not logically connect to the idea of failing to put in effort leading to a lack of significant outcomes.",
    "\"Talking loudly\" does not directly relate to effort or results; it is more about communication style.",
    "\"Mathematics\" does not fit as a result of effort or lack thereof; it is simply a field of study.",
    "\"Learn from each other\" implies collaboration and effort, which contradicts the idea of putting in no effort.",
    "\"State facts\" also does not connect to the concept of effort and consequential results; it is about conveying information rather than outcomes.",
    "Thus, the most fitting and logical answer to the question, focusing on the lack of effort resulting in a consequence, is \"amount to nothing.\""
