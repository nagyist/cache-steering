  "query": "Question: Where would you put sunglasses if you do not have a shirt but want to bring the sunglasses with you?\n\nChoices:\nA: in shoes\nB: bag\nC: shirt pocket\nD: drugstore\nE: glove compartment of car",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the options available for placing the sunglasses. The options are: in shoes, bag, shirt pocket, drugstore, and glove compartment of car.",
    "Next, consider that you're not wearing a shirt, so using a shirt pocket is not feasible.",
    "Now, evaluate the practicality of placing sunglasses in shoes. While it is possible, it may not be the best option, as shoes can be dirty or not have enough space.",
    "Next, consider the option of placing the sunglasses in a bag. A bag offers a secure space and is a common choice for carrying personal items.",
    "Also consider the drugstore option. This would not be a suitable choice, as it is a location rather than a storage option for items you want to bring with you.",
    "Now, think about the glove compartment of a car. This option could work if you are in a car, but it does not convey carrying the sunglasses with you while out.",
    "Therefore, the best option for carrying sunglasses without a shirt is to put them in the bag. This ensures they are easily accessible and protected."
