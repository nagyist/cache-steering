  "query": "Question: Where might a jellyfish get cold?\n\nChoices:\nA: atlantic ocean\nB: salt water\nC: pacific ocean\nD: hypermarket\nE: store",
  "steps": [
    "Consider where jellyfish typically reside. They are found in seas and oceans, specifically in marine environments.",
    "Evaluate the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, which generally has colder regions, particularly in the north.",
    "Evaluate the temperature of the Pacific Ocean, which also has cold areas, especially in the northern and deep parts.",
    "Examine the choices that are not suitable. Options B (salt water), D (hypermarket), and E (store) do not represent natural habitats where jellyfish could be cold.",
    "Comparing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, both can be considered habitats where jellyfish can experience cold temperatures.",
    "However, the question specifies \"where might a jellyfish get cold,\" suggesting it refers to a specific location rather than a type of water.",
    "Thus, the Pacific Ocean (C) is mentioned as one of the choices and has well-known cold areas, making it a suitable habitat for jellyfish.",
    "Although both oceans could work, the question requires us to choose one, and since both options are valid, I'll choose the first one mentioned which is Atlantic Ocean."
