  "query": "Question: James had trouble learning the French language because he never had any what to it?\n\nChoices:\nA: attempt\nB: exposure\nC: study\nD: effort\nE: thought",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about what James lacked that prevented him from learning the French language.",
    "The options provided are: attempt, exposure, study, effort, and thought. Each option implies a different aspect of learning.",
    "\u201cAttempt\u201d suggests he didn't try to learn it, which seems less relevant in this context.",
    "\u201cExposure\u201d implies he wasn\u2019t regularly in contact with the language, which could significantly hinder learning.",
    "\u201cStudy\u201d suggests he didn\u2019t engage in formal learning, but one can learn a language in various informal ways.",
    "\u201cEffort\u201d indicates he may not have put in hard work, but effort alone doesn't guarantee learning if there is no exposure or study.",
    "\u201cThought\u201d doesn\u2019t logically fit as a necessary component for learning a language.",
    "Evaluating the strongest implications, \"exposure\" seems crucial since language learning typically requires immersion in the language environment.",
    "While \u201cstudy\u201d is important, if James had no exposure at all, then formal study would likely be ineffective.",
    "In conclusion, the most fitting answer regarding what he lacked is exposure."
