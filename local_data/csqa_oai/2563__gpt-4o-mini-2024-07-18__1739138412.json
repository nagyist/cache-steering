  "query": "Question: If I wanted to get some oxygen, what will I get it from?\n\nChoices:\nA: the sky\nB: air\nC: earth\nD: space shuttle\nE: water",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a source of oxygen.",
    "Oxygen is a chemical element that is abundant in the environment.",
    "One of the most common sources of oxygen for humans is the air we breathe.",
    "The air consists primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, with oxygen making up about 21% of the atmosphere.",
    "The sky itself can be misleading as it refers to the expanse above us, which contains air.",
    "While water (H2O) contains oxygen, we are looking for a direct source, and we typically think of air as the immediate source.",
    "The earth does contain oxygen in various forms, such as in water and minerals, but the question points towards a ready source for breathing.",
    "A space shuttle does not provide a source of oxygen in a natural sense; it is a man-made vehicle used for space travel.",
    "Comparing the choices, the most straightforward source to get oxygen is directly from the air.",
    "Therefore, the best answer to the question is B, as it directly refers to the air we breathe which contains oxygen."
