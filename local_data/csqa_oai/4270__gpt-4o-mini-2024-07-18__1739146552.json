  "query": "Question: A person walked into a church that was located near a store.  Where might the church be?\n\nChoices:\nA: hidden\nB: synagogue\nC: street corner\nD: fairy tale\nE: hospital",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that a church is located near a store, suggesting that the church is in a place that is accessible and likely in a populated area.",
    "The options presented range from physical locations to abstract or non-physical concepts. We need to look for a realistic physical location corresponding to a church.",
    "Option A, \"hidden,\" seems unlikely because a church near a store would not commonly be hidden.",
    "Option B, \"synagogue,\" would represent a different type of place of worship rather than a church.",
    "Option C, \"street corner,\" is a plausible location for a church to be situated near a store, as many churches are found at intersections in towns or cities.",
    "Option D, \"fairy tale,\" does not represent a real-world location and is not relevant to the context of churches and stores.",
    "Option E, \"hospital,\" while a physical location, does not fit the context of being near a store like a church would.",
    "After evaluating all options, the most logical conclusion is that a church might be located at a street corner, which often provides visibility and accessibility to both church-goers and people visiting nearby stores."
