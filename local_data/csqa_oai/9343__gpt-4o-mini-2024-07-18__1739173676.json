  "query": "Question: Where could there be many couch, all with people sitting on them?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: rest area\nC: apartment\nD: neighbor's house\nE: waiting room",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the nature of each option. A restaurant typically has tables and chairs rather than couches.",
    "Next, a rest area might have some couches, but it's generally less likely to have many couches filled with people.",
    "An apartment could certainly have multiple couches, especially if it has a large living room and multiple people living there.",
    "A neighbor's house could also have multiple couches, but it's less probable to assume that many people are sitting on couches there compared to a more communal setting.",
    "A waiting room is designed for short-term use, often containing several chairs and possibly a couple of couches. It's common for people to sit there while waiting.",
    "Now let's summarize: \n- A restaurant is unlikely to have many couches with people on them.\n- A rest area could have some couches but not necessarily filled with people.\n- An apartment can definitely have multiple couches, especially if shared by several residents.\n- A neighbor's house could have couches, but it's not a setting with many different people at once.\n- A waiting room can have various couches and generally has more people in it, as it's a public space visited by many.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the most appropriate answer that fits the description of having many couches all with people sitting on them would be the waiting room."
