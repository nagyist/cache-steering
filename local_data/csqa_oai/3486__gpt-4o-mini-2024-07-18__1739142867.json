  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes John putting something on a night table, which implies he is in a room that has furniture typical of a bedroom.",
    "John forgot about the item in the morning because it was unfamiliar. This suggests that he was not in his usual or familiar environment.",
    "If he was in jail, it is unlikely there would be a night table, as jails typically do not have such furniture for inmates.",
    "Being at home is also unlikely since it implies familiarity, and he would not forget something that was personal or common to him.",
    "A furniture store would not typically have a night table set up for individuals to sleep or leave personal items on, as it is a retail space.",
    "A hallway does not fit the description either, as a hallway is typically a passageway and does not contain furniture items like a night table.",
    "The most plausible option left is a hotel, where it is common for guests to encounter unfamiliar surroundings and items, leading them to possibly forget their belongings.",
    "In a hotel, the presence of a night table is common in guest rooms, and since it was unfamiliar to him, it fits that he could have stayed there temporarily.",
    "Thus, considering all options and the nature of the night table's context, the most logical conclusion is that John was in a hotel."
