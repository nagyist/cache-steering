  "query": "Question: What professional space is likely to have an air conditioner?\n\nChoices:\nA: office building\nB: texas\nC: house\nD: humid\nE: warm climates",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a professional space, which generally refers to a work environment or a business location.",
    "All of the options presented should be evaluated for their relevance to being a professional space.",
    "Option A, \"office building,\" is clearly a professional space commonly found in various industries where people work.",
    "Option B, \"texas,\" is a state and not specifically a professional space, although it has many office buildings within it.",
    "Option C, \"house,\" generally refers to a residential space rather than a professional one.",
    "Option D, \"humid,\" describes a climate condition rather than a specific location or space.",
    "Option E, \"warm climates,\" again refers to a broader environmental condition rather than a specific professional space.",
    "So based on the evaluation, \"office building\" is the most likely space to have air conditioning due to the need for climate control in work environments."
