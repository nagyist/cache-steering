  "query": "Question: The idiots in the front row would not stop banging on the glass, there's always at least one of them at a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar\nB: sporting event\nC: internet cafe\nD: garage sale\nE: hockey game",
  "steps": [
    "First, I notice that the context is about a situation where people are behaving annoyingly by banging on the glass, which suggests a setting where viewing something important is happening behind a barrier of glass.",
    "Next, I consider the choices individually to find a fitting context. \"Bar\" (A) typically does not involve glass barriers in a way that relates to banging on them.",
    "For \"sporting event\" (B), it is plausible that there could be fans in attendance banging on glass as they try to cheer their team, but this option is too broad and can potentially relate to various sports.",
    "\"Internet cafe\" (C) does not convey a situation where banging on glass would be a common occurrence, as they typically do not have significant barriers separating customers from what might be happening outside.",
    "Next, I consider \"garage sale\" (D), which seems unlikely since it usually takes place outdoors and there are no glass barriers involved.",
    "Now I evaluate \"hockey game\" (E). Hockey games are known for having glass barriers around the rink, and it's common for fans in the front rows to bang on the glass to engage with players or celebrate moments in the game.",
    "Considering all the options, \"hockey game\" is the most specific and relevant context for the phrase describing annoying behavior towards glass. It matches the description perfectly.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer, given the specific setting implied by the question, is E."
