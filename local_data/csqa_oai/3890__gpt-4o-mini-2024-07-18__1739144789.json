  "query": "Question: WHere are baseball stadiums typically located?\n\nChoices:\nA: urban areas\nB: other countries\nC: san francisco\nD: phoenix\nE: chicago",
  "steps": [
    "Baseball stadiums are typically found in places where there are enough fans to support the team, which is usually in populated areas.",
    "Urban areas generally have higher populations and more accessibility, making them ideal locations for stadiums.",
    "While baseball stadiums can be found in other countries, the majority of MLB stadiums are located in the United States, particularly in urban settings.",
    "The options given include specific cities (C: San Francisco, D: Phoenix, E: Chicago) and a general location (A: urban areas).",
    "Choosing a specific city does not encompass the general trend of stadium locations, but 'urban areas' reflects the broader concept.",
    "Thus, the generalization of urban areas would apply to most baseball stadiums rather than any individual city mentioned in the options.",
    "San Francisco, Phoenix, and Chicago are notable cities, but they are examples within the broader category of urban locations.",
    "Considering the question asks for the typical location, the best option remains 'urban areas' as it covers all large cities collectively."
