  "query": "Question: What would you have if you poured water on yourself?\n\nChoices:\nA: thin blood\nB: room temperature\nC: start melting\nD: spring forth\nE: wet clothes",
  "steps": [
    "When you pour water on yourself, the immediate effect is to get wet.",
    "The water interacts directly with your clothing and skin, resulting in moisture.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"thin blood\" does not relate to the action of pouring water on oneself.",
    "The term \"room temperature\" refers to the temperature of the surroundings but doesn't specifically describe the effect of pouring water on yourself.",
    "\"Start melting\" implies a change that doesn't apply to humans or clothing when poured with water.",
    "\"Spring forth\" suggests an action of emerging but doesn\u2019t directly connect to the act of getting wet.",
    "The only option that directly corresponds to pouring water on oneself is \"wet clothes.\"",
    "Thus, based on the action and its effect, the most appropriate answer is \"wet clothes.\""
