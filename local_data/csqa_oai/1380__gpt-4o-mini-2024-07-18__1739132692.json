  "query": "Question: If you see cars with a light blinking on the driver's side what does that indicate they will do?\n\nChoices:\nA: slow down\nB: go forward\nC: get to town\nD: turn left\nE: turn right",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the light in question is blinking on the driver's side of the car.",
    "In most countries, the driver's side corresponds to the left side of the vehicle when considering the driver's perspective.",
    "When a vehicle has its turn signal blinking on the driver's side, it usually indicates the driver's intention to change direction.",
    "Specifically, a blinking light on the driver's side typically suggests that the driver intends to turn left.",
    "This interpretation is standard in driving rules and signals recognized in many regions.",
    "Thus, we can rule out the options that do not correspond to turning left based on the given indicator.",
    "The options A (slow down), B (go forward), C (get to town), and E (turn right) do not accurately describe the action indicated by a left-side turn signal.",
    "Since the only option that fits the scenario of a left-side signal indicator is D (turn left), this must be the correct answer."
