  "query": "Question: When you feed food to animals, you are at a petting?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: zoo\nC: spoon\nD: restaurant\nE: bowl",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify what a petting is related to. When we think about feeding food to animals, the setting typically involves animals being present for interaction.",
    "Second, we consider where animals are commonly found and interacted with. A zoo is a place where animals are displayed, and people often feed or interact with them.",
    "Third, we analyze the options given. A kitchen is not a place for feeding animals directly, so option A can be eliminated.",
    "Fourth, a spoon (option C) is a tool for feeding but does not represent a location or event related to feeding animals.",
    "Fifth, a restaurant (option D) is primarily for human dining, not for feeding animals in a petting situation.",
    "Sixth, a bowl (option E) is an object and not a location for feeding animals in the context of a petting event.",
    "Seventh, considering the context of \"petting,\" we remember that petting zoos specifically allow people to feed and interact with domesticated animals.",
    "Eighth, the term \"petting\" directly relates to a petting zoo, where feeding animals is common.",
    "Ninth, all other options (A, C, D, E) do not fit the scenario of feeding animals in a petting context.",
    "Tenth, after reviewing the reasoning, the most appropriate answer that fits the context of feeding animals in a \"petting\" setting is the zoo."
