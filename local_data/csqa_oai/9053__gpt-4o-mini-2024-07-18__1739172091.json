  "query": "Question: What dirty method of getting from one place to another in large cities may not allow you to see daylight?\n\nChoices:\nA: ground\nB: subway\nC: over bridge\nD: street\nE: race track",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a method of transportation that is typically found in large cities.",
    "The phrase \"may not allow you to see daylight\" suggests a mode of transport that is underground or enclosed.",
    "\"Ground\" (Choice A) implies being on the surface, which contradicts the idea of not seeing daylight.",
    "\"Over bridge\" (Choice C) is associated with being above ground and thus likely to see daylight.",
    "\"Street\" (Choice D) refers to ground-level transportation, meaning it is also likely to expose you to daylight.",
    "\"Race track\" (Choice E) usually pertains to auto or bicycle racing on a designated path, which also does not fit the description of a dirty method of transport in a city context.",
    "Next, I consider \"subway\" (Choice B), which is an underground train system commonly used in large cities, fitting well with the idea of not seeing daylight.",
    "Since the question specifically mentions a \"dirty method,\" subways can often be considered dirty or less clean than other modes of transport.",
    "After analyzing each option, \"subway\" stands out as the best answer based on the criteria provided."
