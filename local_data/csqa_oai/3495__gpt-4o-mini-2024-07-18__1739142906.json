  "steps": [
    "To ensure safety while driving at night, it's important to be alert and capable of making quick decisions.",
    "Being awake is critical to maintaining focus on the road, as fatigue can impair reaction times and overall awareness.",
    "Choosing 'distraction' (option C) is not appropriate, as distractions are detrimental to safe driving.",
    "Although having a car (option A) or vehicle (option B) is necessary for driving, the question emphasizes a condition for safe driving at night rather than just having a means of transport.",
    "Napping (option E) is also counterproductive for nighttime driving, as it implies that the driver is not awake or alert.",
    "Thus, the most relevant option that ensures safety when driving at night is maintaining wakefulness and alertness."
