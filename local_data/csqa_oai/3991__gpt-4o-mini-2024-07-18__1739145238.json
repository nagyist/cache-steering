  "steps": [
    "To determine where you might find dirt related to a gutter and rubber hitting it regularly, first consider the functions of a gutter. Gutters are typically found in places where water drainage is needed, such as streets or race tracks.",
    "Rubber hitting a surface regularly suggests a place where tires frequently interact with the ground. This could indicate a road or track where vehicles are present.",
    "A race track often has rubber tires on it due to the presence of racing vehicles which leave tire marks and can kick up dirt. However, a race track may not have conventional gutters in the same way that streets do.",
    "Streets have gutters to channel water away from the road surface. They frequently encounter rubber from cars, bicycles, and other vehicles, making them a plausible candidate.",
    "Considering the context of \u201cdirt,\u201d dirt can accumulate in both race tracks and streets, but it's more commonly associated with streets where everyday vehicles pass.",
    "Comparing the streets to other options like 'bed', 'subway', and 'ground', we note that a bed does not typically have rubber hitting it, a subway may not have dirt visible due to being underground, and 'ground' is too vague.",
    "The gutter function and the regular encounter of rubber aligns most clearly with a street, where both elements co-exist frequently.",
    "Thus, after considering all the options and the context of gutter and rubber, the most suitable location is a street."
