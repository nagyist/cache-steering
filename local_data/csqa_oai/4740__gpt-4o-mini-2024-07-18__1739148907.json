  "query": "Question: What do you need to do on your face to watch film?\n\nChoices:\nA: open eyes\nB: wear glasses\nC: go to movies\nD: have eyes\nE: relax",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what needs to be done on the face to watch a film.",
    "Watching a film primarily involves observing the screen, which requires the ability to see.",
    "To see, one needs to have functioning eyes; therefore, \"having eyes\" is essential.",
    "However, the phrase \u201cto watch film\u201d implies active participation, which differs from merely having eyes.",
    "Opening the eyes is an active step that allows a person to see the film, as closed eyes would prevent viewing.",
    "Wearing glasses is conditional; some may need glasses to see, but not everyone does, making it a less universal answer.",
    "Going to the movies is related to the context of watching films but does not describe an action performed on the face.",
    "The option \"relax\" does not directly relate to the physical ability to see but may be part of the experience of watching a film.",
    "Among the choices, \"open eyes\" most directly denotes an action performed on the face necessary for viewing a film.",
    "Thus, while \"having eyes\" is important, actively \"opening\" them specifically relates to the action needed for watching a film."
