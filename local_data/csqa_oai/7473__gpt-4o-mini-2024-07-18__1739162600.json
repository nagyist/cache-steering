  "query": "Question: Where could you be most likely to find containers with hydrogen?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: chemistry lab\nC: ocean\nD: universe\nE: barrel",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the environments where hydrogen is commonly found. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option D (universe) suggests a vast scale, as hydrogen is indeed the predominant element in the universe.",
    "Review the context of the other options. Option A (air) contains hydrogen, but in relatively low concentrations, making it less likely to find pure containers of hydrogen there.",
    "Examine Option B (chemistry lab). A chemistry lab may store hydrogen gas in controlled environments for experiments, thus making it a plausible answer.",
    "Now, consider Option C (ocean). The ocean contains water (H2O), which includes hydrogen, but again this is not in a container form and not pure hydrogen.",
    "Look at Option E (barrel). A barrel could potentially hold hydrogen in a contained format, but this is very context-dependent and doesn't imply abundance.",
    "Weigh the options based on the likelihood of encountering pure hydrogen in containers. A chemistry lab is designed for chemical storage, making it a strong candidate.",
    "However, the universe, while it contains hydrogen gas abundantly, does not imply a physical container; it is dispersed in space.",
    "Comparing the likelihood of finding hydrogen in a chemistry lab versus the universe indicates that although both could contain hydrogen, a chemistry lab offers a direct scenario of encountering containers specifically designed for that purpose.",
    "Thus, after considering the relevancy of the environments and the nature of the containers, the most probable answer is B (chemistry lab)."
