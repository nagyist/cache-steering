  "query": "Question: Where do you buy a glass of wine?\n\nChoices:\nA: art show\nB: basement\nC: bar\nD: church\nE: basement",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of where it is typical to buy a glass of wine.",
    "Typically, wine is sold in places that serve alcoholic beverages or provide dining experiences, rather than in unusual or non-traditional settings.",
    "I can rule out options like \"basement\" (B and E) since it is not a standard venue for purchasing food or drinks; a basement is generally a private space.",
    "Next, \"art show\" (A) may have some availability of wine, but it is not a primary location where one would go specifically to buy a glass of wine.",
    "\"Church\" (D) is not a place where one typically purchases wine; although wine may be offered in religious ceremonies, it is not a commercial setting for buying wine.",
    "Looking at the remaining option, \"bar\" (C) is quite clearly a venue specifically designed for serving alcoholic beverages, including wine.",
    "Therefore, a bar is definitely where you would go to purchase a glass of wine, given the common associations and functions of each place listed."
