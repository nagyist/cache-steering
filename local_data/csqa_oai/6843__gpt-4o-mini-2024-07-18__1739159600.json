  "query": "Question: Sam was a student at Elmhurst elementary .  She was late when the bell rang so she ran in the hall trying to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: go to high school\nB: answer question\nC: charming\nD: go to class\nE: try to get",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario involves Sam being late for school when the bell rang, which indicates she needs to get to her classroom quickly.",
    "Since the bell typically signals the start of a class or session, it's logical that her goal is to make it to class before it starts.",
    "The options presented are somewhat ambiguous, but only one option directly aligns with the common behavior of a student trying to reach their destination when late.",
    "Option A (go to high school) does not make sense as she is at an elementary school.",
    "Option B (answer question) is not applicable in the context of being late; she's not focused on answering questions but rather on getting to class.",
    "Option C (charming) seems irrelevant to the situation of running in the hallways; it doesn't relate to the immediate action of a student in distress over being late.",
    "Option D (go to class) makes the most sense. It directly addresses what students typically aim to do when they're late.",
    "Option E (try to get) is incomplete and does not specify what she is trying to get, making it a vague choice.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the best answer that fits the situation is Option D: go to class."
