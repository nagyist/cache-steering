  "steps": [
    "The question asks what happens at the end of the day after the sun has risen.",
    "The natural phenomenon that occurs at the end of the day is commonly referred to in relation to the sun's position in the sky.",
    "When the sun's position changes from high in the sky to a lower position, it is indicative of the end of day.",
    "One of the most common terms associated with the sun's transition at the end of the day is \"sunset.\"",
    "Looking at the options provided, option E directly refers to \"sun set,\" which describes the event that occurs when the sun goes below the horizon at the end of the day.",
    "The other options (A: deep dive, B: fall, C: lower, D: below) do not specifically describe the event that occurs at the end of the day like option E does.",
    "Thus, among the options given, \"sun set\" is the most accurate and relevant answer to what happens after the sun has risen at the end of the day."
