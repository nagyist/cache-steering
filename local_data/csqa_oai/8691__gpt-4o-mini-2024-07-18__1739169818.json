    "The question is asking about the emotions or feelings someone might experience while struggling to write a term paper.",
    "Writing a term paper can involve complex processes such as research, structuring arguments, and adhering to deadlines, which can be challenging.",
    "When faced with difficulty in completing such tasks, it's common for individuals to experience negative emotions.",
    "\u201cErrors\u201d (A) refers to mistakes that might occur during writing but does not capture a feeling or emotional response.",
    "\u201cFrustration\u201d (B) is a potential emotional response when progress is difficult or results are unsatisfactory, which is very likely in the context of writing a term paper.",
    "\u201cIlliteracy\u201d (C) suggests a complete inability to read or write and is more an indicator of skill level than an emotional response.",
    "\u201cAnxiety\u201d (D) could also be a reasonable emotional response, as the pressure of deadlines and the importance of the paper can cause stress.",
    "\u201cHeadaches\u201d (E) refer to a physical symptom rather than a direct emotional feeling; they may result from stress but are not an emotion in themselves.",
    "Considering the context, both \"frustration\" and \"anxiety\" seem plausible, but frustration specifically relates to the direct struggle of writing.",
    "Evaluating all options, the most appropriate emotional response for someone struggling with their writing would be \u201cfrustration.\u201d"
