  "query": "Question: What country can a marmot be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: american forest\nB: north america\nC: switzerland\nD: northern climates\nE: new zealand",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what a marmot is and its general habitat.",
    "Marmots are large ground squirrels that inhabit mountainous regions and are often found in burrows.",
    "Determine the general geographic distribution of marmots.",
    "Marmots are primarily found in North America and parts of Europe, particularly in mountainous areas.",
    "Evaluate the provided options in relation to the marmot's habitat.",
    "Option A (American forest) is a possibility, but it is not specific enough since marmots typically prefer alpine or mountainous environments.",
    "Option B (North America) is a broad category and does include areas where marmots can be found, particularly in the Rocky Mountains.",
    "Option C (Switzerland) is notable for its mountainous terrain, which is suitable for marmots; they are indeed found in the Swiss Alps.",
    "Option D (Northern climates) is too vague and does not specifically indicate where marmots are found, even though they do inhabit cooler regions.",
    "Option E (New Zealand) is incorrect as marmots are not native to and do not inhabit New Zealand.",
    "Considering the above evaluations, the best answers are C (Switzerland) and B (North America), but since Switzerland is a specific location where marmots are known to thrive, it stands out as a clear answer."
