  "query": "Question: He is at a field hospital, where is he likely to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: most cities\nB: local town\nC: military base\nD: detroit\nE: urban area",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what a field hospital is typically used for. Field hospitals are often temporary medical facilities set up to provide care in situations such as military conflicts, natural disasters, or large scale emergencies.",
    "Next, we consider the context in which field hospitals are commonly found. They are often located close to the site of an emergency or military operation, rather than in urban or suburban areas.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the answer choices with this definition in mind. \nA: \"most cities\" seems too permanent and conventional for the nature of a field hospital. \nB: \"local town\" might be plausible but lacks the urgency or context typically associated with a field hospital setup. \nC: \"military base\" is directly relevant because military bases often deal with combat situations and emergencies and may set up field hospitals on or near their premises. \nD: \"Detroit\" is a specific city, which does not align with the typical use case for field hospitals on a broader perspective. \nE: \"urban area\" is too general and does not necessarily imply the presence of a field hospital.",
    "Given the evaluations, \"military base\" (C) stands out as the most logical and relevant option due to the nature of field hospitals being associated with military operations.",
    "Lastly, I confirm that field hospitals are indeed most likely associated with military bases compared to cities or local towns where they might not be urgently required."
