  "query": "Question: Sally bought bubblegum. Where might she have gotten it?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: theater\nC: street\nD: pocket\nE: church",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider common places where people typically buy bubblegum. Supermarkets are general retail stores that stock a wide range of products, including snacks and candy.",
    "Next, theaters often sell snacks to customers during movies, and bubblegum can be a common choice among snacks available for purchase.",
    "The streets can also be a possibility if there are vendors selling gum, or if Sally bought it from a convenience store nearby.",
    "A pocket usually wouldn't be a place where one would get bubblegum, as it implies possession rather than acquisition.",
    "Churches typically do not sell candy or snacks like bubblegum, making it an unlikely place for Sally to have gotten it.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices: \n- A: Supermarket - very likely.\n- B: Theater - likely as well.\n- C: Street - possible depending on the availability of vendors.\n- D: Pocket - unlikely as it does not represent a purchasing location.\n- E: Church - unlikely as it's not a place for buying snacks.",
    "Considering the commonality and accessibility of these locations, the supermarket remains a strong contender, as does the theater.",
    "The street is plausible too, but less common compared to the first two options.",
    "Between the high-traffic, commonly visited places (supermarket and theater), it is clear that Sally most likely got her bubblegum from the supermarket."
