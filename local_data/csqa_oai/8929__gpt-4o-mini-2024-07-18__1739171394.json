    "The man is in a lobby, which typically serves as an entrance area in a building.",
    "Lobbies usually have staff available to assist visitors, particularly in office or commercial buildings.",
    "The most common staff member found in a lobby who would be able to provide directions is a receptionist.",
    "The other options (the sun, office building, business plan, large building) do not represent individuals or services that could provide directions.",
    "Since the question specifies that he is seeking directions, it implies that he needs help from a person rather than an object or concept.",
    "Thus, the receptionist stands out as the appropriate choice for someone who would help with directions."
