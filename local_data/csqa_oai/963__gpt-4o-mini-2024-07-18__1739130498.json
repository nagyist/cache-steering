  "steps": [
    "The explorers are delighted to find a central passage, which suggests they have uncovered something significant and valuable.",
    "Considering the context of exploration, \"ancient buried\" typically points towards historical artifacts or locations that are of great archaeological or historical importance.",
    "The options available include a public building, tomb, arena, large building, and treasure. Out of these, some are more closely associated with being buried versus just covered up or obscured.",
    "A 'tomb' generally implies something that is intentionally built to house the remains of an individual or individuals, and such structures are often buried or hidden over time.",
    "While a 'public building' could also be considered, it does not have the same connotation of being buried or ancient as a tomb does.",
    "An 'arena' is typically a place for public events and is less likely to be buried than a structure specifically built for internment.",
    "A 'large building' is quite vague and could refer to many things, but again, does not hold the same connection to burial as a tomb would.",
    "'Treasure' suggests valuable items, but it does not fit the context of a \"buried\" structure; treasures can be buried in various contexts, but are not usually structures themselves.",
    "After considering these points, the option 'tomb' stands out as the most logical and likely discovery, given the description of being \"ancient\" and \"buried.\""
