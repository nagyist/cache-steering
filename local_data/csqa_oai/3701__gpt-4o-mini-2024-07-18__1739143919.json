  "query": "Question: If your cake is still unbaked, where should you put it?\n\nChoices:\nA: oven\nB: refrigerator\nC: bakery\nD: birthday party\nE: trash",
  "steps": [
    "The cake is unbaked, which means it has not yet gone through the baking process and needs to be baked to become a cake.",
    "The primary place where cakes are baked is the oven. Therefore, I should consider the oven as a suitable choice for unbaked cake.",
    "The refrigerator is generally used for storing cakes once they are baked or for cooling ingredients, but not specifically for baking.",
    "A bakery is a place where cakes are made, but it implies that the cake should be made there, not stored.",
    "A birthday party would typically involve serving a cake that is already baked, rather than placing an unbaked cake there.",
    "Trash would be considered if the cake was spoiled or if there was a mistake in preparation, not if it's simply unbaked.",
    "Considering all the options, the most appropriate place for an unbaked cake is the oven, as that is where it needs to go to turn into a baked cake."
