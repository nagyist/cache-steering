  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that her dream was to own a house in the countryside, indicating she desires space and possibly a more tranquil environment.",
    "The phrase \"cramped apartment\" suggests a stark contrast to a spacious house, indicating that the area she currently lives in is likely urban or densely populated.",
    "The choices provided include various types of living environments, such as \"street,\" \"ghetto,\" \"residential area,\" \"subdivision,\" and \"city.\"",
    "\"Street\" is too vague and does not refer to a specific kind of living space or area.",
    "\"Ghetto\" implies an impoverished urban area, which doesn't necessarily reflect the aspirations of owning a house in the countryside; it carries more negative connotations.",
    "\"Residential area\" could suggest a neighborhood primarily made up of homes, but it's not specific enough compared to other options.",
    "\"Subdivision\" typically refers to a section of a larger residential area that may include houses, but it still falls short of the aspiration toward countryside living.",
    "The option \"city\" denotes a densely populated urban area, which aligns with the concept of living in a cramped apartment versus a spacious countryside house.",
    "Given the context of longing for a spacious countryside while currently living in a restricted setting, \"city\" captures this juxtaposition accurately."
