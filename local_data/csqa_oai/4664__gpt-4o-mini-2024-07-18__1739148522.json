  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that he hated having meetings while eating, specifically referring to unpleasant sounds like somebody eating.",
    "The emphasis is on the noise or disruption caused during meetings when food is involved.",
    "The options provided should relate to activities that could potentially be disruptive during a meeting.",
    "Option A (drinking) could produce sounds, but is less likely to be problematic than other options like talking.",
    "Option B (sit) is not an activity that typically produces a disruptive sound during a meeting.",
    "Option C (talk) is a common occurrence during meetings and can certainly be disruptive, particularly when combined with the sounds of eating.",
    "Option D (dancing) is not relevant in the context of a meeting, as it typically wouldn't occur during one.",
    "Option E (being sociable) is a broader term and may not directly imply something as specific as sound disruption.",
    "Therefore, among the relevant options, talking is the activity most likely to cause annoyance during a meal in a meeting context, along with eating."
