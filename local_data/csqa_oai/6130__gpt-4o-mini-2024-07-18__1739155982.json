  "query": "Question: What does someone committing perjury likely to have?\n\nChoices:\nA: miscarriage of justice\nB: guilt\nC: testify\nD: lies\nE: truth",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define perjury. Perjury is the act of lying or making statements that are intentionally false while under oath, typically in a legal proceeding.",
    "Since perjury involves lying, it implies that the person has intentionally provided false information instead of truthful information.",
    "Given the nature of perjury, the person committing perjury is likely to be aware that they are not speaking the truth, which relates to having guilt about their actions.",
    "Option A, \"miscarriage of justice,\" refers to a failure in the judicial system but does not directly apply to the individual committing perjury.",
    "Option B, \"guilt,\" fits well since a person who commits perjury is often aware that they are lying and may feel guilty about it.",
    "Option C, \"testify,\" refers to the act of giving evidence and does not directly relate to the consequences of perjury itself.",
    "Option D, \"lies,\" also aligns with the act of perjury since it inherently involves providing false statements.",
    "Option E, \"truth,\" is the opposite of what is represented in perjury; thus, it is not applicable to someone committing perjury.",
    "To summarize, the best answers related to someone committing perjury are guilt (B) and lies (D). However, the more direct consequence and emotional state linked to committing perjury is guilt."
