  "query": "Question: What might you feel if you're meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time?\n\nChoices:\nA: cheer\nB: joy\nC: talk\nD: anticipation\nE: excitement",
  "steps": [
    "When meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time, it is common to feel a positive emotional response due to the anticipation of rekindling the relationship.",
    "The emotional response can manifest as happiness or enthusiasm about reconnecting, which suggests feelings of joy and excitement.",
    "Cheer generally refers to a light-hearted mood or spirit, which might be present but doesn\u2019t encapsulate the depth of feelings one might have in this situation.",
    "The term \"talk\" primarily refers to an action rather than an emotional response, making it less likely to be a primary feeling in this context.",
    "Anticipation signifies looking forward to the event and can be a part of the feelings experienced prior to meeting, but it may not fully describe the emotional experience during the meeting.",
    "Excitement, on the other hand, suggests a heightened emotional state which is common when expecting to reconnect with someone special after a long time.",
    "After considering the emotional spectrum, joy and excitement are both linked to the positive experience of meeting this friend.",
    "Between joy and excitement, excitement is often more intense and could be the primary feeling when anticipating an enjoyable reunion.",
    "Finally, since the question focuses on feelings specifically related to the reunion itself, excitement best captures the emotional essence of such a meeting."
