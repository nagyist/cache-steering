  "query": "Question: Where are people most likely to ride a bicycle beside canals?\n\nChoices:\nA: university\nB: netherlands\nC: schoolyard\nD: road\nE: garage",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the context of riding bicycles beside canals. Canals are often associated with specific geographic areas.",
    "Next, I consider where it is common for people to ride bicycles. Traditionally, canals might be found in countries with a strong cycling culture.",
    "The Netherlands is well-known for having an extensive network of canals and a significant biking culture, making it an ideal location for cycling beside canals.",
    "I also think about the other options: \n- University: While there may be bike riding here, it is not specifically linked to canals.\n- Schoolyard: This generally applies to children and does not correlate with riding beside canals.\n- Road: People may ride here, but it does not specify the scenic context of canals.\n- Garage: This is a storage place and unrelated to cycling outside.",
    "Given the strong ties between the Netherlands and both canals and cycling, it emerges as the most logical choice among the options provided.",
    "Revisiting the other options confirms none of them hold primary relevance in the context of cycling beside canals."
