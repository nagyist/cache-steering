  "query": "Question: The teacher is answering questions, why?\n\nChoices:\nA: people will understand\nB: embarassment\nC: children will learn\nD: teaching\nE: helping",
  "steps": [
    "The teacher is in a position to impart knowledge and clarify doubts for the students. This suggests a purpose behind answering questions.",
    "One probable reason for answering questions is to promote understanding among the students. This would align with choice A.",
    "However, understanding alone does not encapsulate the broader goal of teaching, which is to enhance learning. This ties into choice C, which suggests children will learn.",
    "Choice D, \"teaching,\" could also be relevant, since answering questions is a fundamental part of teaching. Yet, it does not directly specify the outcome of the act.",
    "Choice E, \"helping,\" is related to the act of answering questions, but it lacks specificity regarding the educational context.",
    "I need to evaluate which choice most directly connects the act of answering questions with its educational objective.",
    "While understanding and helping are important, the primary purpose of answering questions in a teaching context is for children to learn.",
    "Therefore, choice C is the most aligned with the teacher's goal of answering questions, as it emphasizes the educational outcome."
