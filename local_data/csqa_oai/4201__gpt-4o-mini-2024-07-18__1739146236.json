  "query": "Question: Where are things sometimes organized by a card catalog?\n\nChoices:\nA: store\nB: recipe book\nC: kitchen\nD: easy browsing\nE: library",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what a card catalog is and where it is commonly used. A card catalog is a method of organizing information, typically using physical cards that represent books or materials in a library.",
    "Next, I consider the provided options. The option 'store' does not typically use a card catalog system for organization. Stores might have inventory systems but not a card catalog.",
    "Looking at 'recipe book,' it suggests a collection of recipes. However, a recipe book is usually organized by chapters or sections rather than a card catalog format.",
    "I then examine 'kitchen'. While a kitchen may have recipes, it does not use a card catalog system to organize them. It is more about the physical space for cooking.",
    "Next, I analyze 'easy browsing'. This phrase could relate to how information is accessed. However, it does not directly hint at the use of a card catalog specifically.",
    "Now, I focus on 'library'. Libraries are well-known for utilizing card catalogs (historically) to organize books and resources, allowing users to easily locate information.",
    "Based on my assessments, the most logical conclusion is that card catalogs are primarily associated with libraries.",
    "Finally, I confirm that among all the options, \u2018library\u2019 is the one that directly uses a card catalog for organization purposes."
