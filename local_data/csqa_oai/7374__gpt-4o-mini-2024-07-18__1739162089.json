  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a reason why someone would be unable to walk in a line after consuming alcohol.",
    "Alcohol affects motor skills and coordination, causing a loss of balance and difficulty in movements.",
    "When someone is heavily intoxicated, their body may exhibit symptoms such as stumbling due to impaired coordination.",
    "The option \"A: pass out\" suggests a complete loss of consciousness, which doesn\u2019t directly relate to attempting to walk in a line.",
    "\"B: fever\" is not relevant as it does not connect to the effects of alcohol consumption.",
    "\"D: forgetfulness\" may occur, but forgetting how to walk in a straight line is less directly related than physical impairments.",
    "\"E: death\" is an extreme outcome and not a direct cause of stumbling; it also is not relevant for walking in a line.",
    "The most direct and common consequence of drinking alcohol that leads to difficulty walking in a line is stumbling.",
    "Stumbling is caused by a lack of coordination, which is a typical symptom of intoxication."
