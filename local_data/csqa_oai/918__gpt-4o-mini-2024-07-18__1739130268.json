  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a location associated with an apple tree that contains something forbidden.",
    "In biblical terms, the tree that contained something forbidden is identified as the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil found in the Garden of Eden.",
    "The Garden of Eden is a well-known locale from the Bible where Adam and Eve are said to have lived and where they were tempted by the forbidden fruit from the apple tree.",
    "Next, I should consider the answer choices given and determine if they limit or point towards the Garden of Eden in relation to the forbidden apple tree.",
    "The choice \"E: garden of eden\" directly corresponds to the location described in the question, as it is explicitly linked to the forbidden fruit narrative from the Bible.",
    "All other options (A, B, C, D) either refer to real places (North Carolina, Washington State, Great Outdoors) or do not relate to the apple tree narrative (C: nil).",
    "Since \"garden of eden\" is the correct biblical reference for the apple tree with something forbidden, I can conclude with confidence."
