  "query": "Question: Sally waited in the rain with another person.  Both of them were waiting to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: make wine\nB: cross street\nC: wear jeans\nD: take bus\nE: take taxi",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the situation: waiting in the rain typically suggests that the individuals are anticipating some form of transportation or activity that would allow them to get out of the rain.",
    "Next, analyze each choice for its likelihood given that Sally is outside in the rain. Choice A (make wine) is unlikely, as it usually requires a facility and cannot be done while waiting in the rain.",
    "Choice B (cross street) is possible, but if they are waiting, it implies they might not be ready to cross immediately. Also, people generally do not wait in the rain to simply cross a street.",
    "Choice C (wear jeans) is unrelated to the context of waiting, as they likely have already decided on what they are wearing.",
    "Evaluating Choice D (take bus), it is plausible that Sally and the other person are waiting for a bus shelter or stop to avoid the rain while waiting for public transport.",
    "Finally, consider Choice E (take taxi). While this is also possible, taxis are typically called or hailed and would not require as much waiting time compared to a bus.",
    "After weighing the options, D (take bus) seems the most logical as buses are typically associated with waiting, especially in inclement weather like rain, and it allows both individuals to remain somewhat sheltered until the bus arrives."
