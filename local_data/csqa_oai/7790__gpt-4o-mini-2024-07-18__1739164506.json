  "query": "Question: Studying is the most effective what to get what?\n\nChoices:\nA: increasing knowledge\nB: money\nC: higher intelligence\nD: better grades\nE: inspiration",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the relationship between studying and the outcomes it produces.",
    "Studying is generally associated with learning and acquiring new information.",
    "One key outcome of studying is increasing one's knowledge about various subjects.",
    "Another possible outcome of studying is achieving better performance on assessments, which typically leads to better grades.",
    "In addition, studying may enhance cognitive abilities, potentially leading to higher intelligence.",
    "We also need to consider that studying can inspire creativity and new ideas, contributing to inspiration.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options: \nA (increasing knowledge) directly relates to the goal of studying.\nB (money) is not a direct result of studying unless linked to specific qualifications or career paths.\nC (higher intelligence) may result but is not commonly emphasized as the main outcome of studying.\nD (better grades) is a very direct and typical result of effective studying.\nE (inspiration) can occur but is less defined than knowledge or grades in connection with studying.",
    "Between increasing knowledge, better grades, and higher intelligence, we see that studying is most conventionally viewed as effective for achieving better grades.",
    "Considering all of the reasoning, the most direct and assertive connection to the purpose of studying is to achieve better grades in educational contexts."
