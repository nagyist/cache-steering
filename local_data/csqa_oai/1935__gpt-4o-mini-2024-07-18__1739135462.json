    "To have lunch, the first thing I need to consider is whether I have the actual food to eat.",
    "Next, I can acknowledge that I need to consume food, which is the act of eating.",
    "However, before consuming food, it is essential to acquire it somehow\u2014either by purchasing it, preparing it, or having it already available.",
    "The act of stopping work may be necessary depending on my current situation, as I need time to eat lunch.",
    "Spending money might also be relevant if I do not already have food and need to buy it.",
    "Lastly, preparing food is sometimes required if I have ingredients but nothing ready to eat yet.",
