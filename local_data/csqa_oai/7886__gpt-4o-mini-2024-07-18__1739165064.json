  "query": "Question: What would happen to airplanes before they start falling down?\n\nChoices:\nA: stall\nB: taxi\nC: crash\nD: slow down\nE: halt",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the events that occur to airplanes before they start falling down.",
    "To \"fall down,\" an airplane typically must be in a state of distress or lose lift, often indicative of an aerodynamic problem such as stalling.",
    "A stall occurs when an airplane exceeds its critical angle of attack, which means the wings are not producing enough lift, causing the aircraft to lose altitude.",
    "Taxiing refers to the movement of an airplane on the ground, not in the air, so it wouldn't happen before a fall in flight.",
    "Crashing is the result of an airplane falling, rather than a precursor to that event.",
    "Slowing down can occur prior to a stall, but it doesn't necessarily lead to falling unless it reaches a critical point where lift is lost.",
    "Halting implies coming to a complete stop, which is not applicable for an airplane in mid-flight.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most logical answer is \"stall,\" as it directly precedes the scenario of an airplane falling."
