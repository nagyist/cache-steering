  "query": "Question: After the guy is successful in cashing in his check, what does he feel?\n\nChoices:\nA: sad\nB: quitting\nC: extra money\nD: great joy\nE: leave",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the feeling of a guy after successfully cashing in his check.",
    "Cashing in a check typically means receiving money, suggesting a sense of financial achievement or relief.",
    "Among the answer choices, \"extra money\" (C) denotes a factual state, while \"great joy\" (D) could be an emotional response.",
    "Considering the common emotional responses associated with receiving money, \"great joy\" (D) seems more appropriate than simply feeling like he has \"extra money\" (C).",
    "\"Sad\" (A) or \"quitting\" (B) do not logically follow from the act of cashing in a check. They imply negative outcomes or feelings that do not relate to the action taken.",
    "\"Leave\" (E) is an action but does not convey a feeling, which is what the question is specifically asking about.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer that reflects an emotional response to the successful transaction is \"great joy\" (D)."

  "solution": "D"
