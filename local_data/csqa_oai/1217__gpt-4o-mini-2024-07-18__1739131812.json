  "steps": [
    "To begin reading, one needs a starting point or material to read from.",
    "Written material is essential as it provides the content that is being read.",
    "Without written material, there would be nothing to read, making it impossible to start the reading process.",
    "While concentrating, memory, and acculturation might enhance reading, they are not strictly necessary to begin the act of reading.",
    "Concentration (E) is important for comprehension but not for starting to read itself.",
    "Memory (D) can aid in understanding but is not a prerequisite for starting to read.",
    "Acculturation (C) may influence what is understood but is not necessary to start reading.",
    "Thus, the only requirement to begin reading is the presence of written material."
