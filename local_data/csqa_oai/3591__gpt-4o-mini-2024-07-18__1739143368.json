  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the concept of cloning the mammoth and its implications on our understanding of time and history.",
    "Cloning a mammoth would mean bringing back a species that is currently extinct.",
    "If a mammoth were to be successfully cloned, it would exist in the present time alongside current living species.",
    "This brings the mammoth from the past into the present, impacting its status in terms of history.",
    "The choices provided relate to different terms associated with time periods and historical contexts.",
    "\"Ancient history\" refers to times far in the past, while \"recent\" pertains to a more modern timeframe.",
    "If a mammoth is cloned, it would no longer belong to \"ancient history\" but rather become part of contemporary presence or discussion.",
    "The term \"ancient times\" similarly indicates a time long ago, and the mammoth would no longer fit into that category if it were living again.",
    "On the other hand, \"storybook\" seems to imply fiction or mythology rather than historical significance.",
    "The term that aligns best with the notion of changing historical classification due to cloning is \"ancient history.\""
