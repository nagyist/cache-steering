  "query": "Question: Sarah knew she was committing perjury, so there was a lot of what feeling between her and the prosecutor?\n\nChoices:\nA: arrest\nB: tension\nC: shame\nD: attraction\nE: embarrassment",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Sarah was aware she was committing perjury, which indicates a deliberate act of dishonesty under oath.",
    "Considering the nature of perjury, it is likely that Sarah felt an emotional response given the seriousness of committing such an act.",
    "The prosecutor represents the legal authority and is responsible for upholding the truth in court, which creates a dynamic where Sarah's dishonesty would create conflict.",
    "Feelings that could arise in such a scenario might include tension or embarrassment, but the question specifically asks for the feeling \"between her and the prosecutor.\"",
    "Tension could arise from the conflict of interest between Sarah's dishonesty and the prosecutor's role in seeking the truth.",
    "While shame and embarrassment may also be felt by Sarah, they are more internal feelings rather than something that would create a dynamic \"between\" her and the prosecutor.",
    "Attraction seems unlikely in this context, given the negative situation involving legal consequences.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate feeling that exists in the situation, especially relating to the prosecutor's presence and role, would be tension."
