  "query": "Question: Someone who doesn't care about about someone else and wishes them to fail has what feeling towards them?\n\nChoices:\nA: unfeeling\nB: negligence\nC: antipathy\nD: indifferent\nE: rapport",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the feelings someone may have towards another person when they don't care about them and wish for their failure.",
    "To start, let's break down the choices one by one to determine which fits best based on the description given.",
    "Choice A: \"unfeeling\" suggests a lack of emotion, which could imply indifference but doesn't specifically denote wishing someone to fail.",
    "Choice B: \"negligence\" refers to a failure to care or pay attention, which doesn\u2019t necessarily imply wishing ill upon someone.",
    "Choice C: \"antipathy\" means a deep-seated feeling of aversion or dislike, which aligns well with the notion of wanting someone to fail.",
    "Choice D: \"indifferent\" indicates a lack of interest or concern, but it does not inherently imply a desire for someone to fail.",
    "Choice E: \"rapport\" is a positive relationship or connection with someone, which is in direct contrast to the feeling of wishing someone to fail.",
    "Given the context, antipathy (C) fits perfectly as it denotes a strong dislike or hostility towards someone, thus correlating with the desire for that person's failure.",
    "Therefore, I can conclude that the choice representing a lack of care combined with wishing someone to fail is best encapsulated by antipathy."
