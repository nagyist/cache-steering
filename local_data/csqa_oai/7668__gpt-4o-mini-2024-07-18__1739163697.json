  "query": "Question: What is a genius likely to be in all subjects?\n\nChoices:\nA: virtuous\nB: exceptional\nC: ordinary\nD: advantageous\nE: sufficient",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the term \"genius.\" Generally, a genius is someone who exhibits exceptional intellectual or creative power or other natural ability.",
    "Next, we consider what \"likely to be in all subjects\" means. It implies the individual possesses traits that are common across various fields of knowledge or skill.",
    "Now, let's evaluate each of the answer choices in relation to \"genius\" and its implication of exceptional skills.",
    "Choice A: \"virtuous\" refers to having high moral standards. While a genius can be virtuous, it does not inherently apply to all subjects of expertise.",
    "Choice B: \"exceptional\" means being unusually good or outstanding. This aligns well with the definition of a genius as they are often recognized for their extraordinary abilities.",
    "Choice C: \"ordinary\" suggests a lack of distinctive features, which contradicts the concept of genius as someone who stands out.",
    "Choice D: \"advantageous\" implies being in a beneficial position. While having a genius might provide advantages, this does not capture the essence of what a genius is likely to be across all subjects.",
    "Choice E: \"sufficient\" suggests being adequate, but this term does not reflect the exceptional capabilities associated with a genius, thus it does not apply universally.",
    "After evaluating all answer choices, the term \"exceptional\" stands out as the best description of what a genius would likely be across all subjects."
