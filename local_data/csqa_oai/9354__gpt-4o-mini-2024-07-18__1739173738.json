  "query": "Question: It was tradition for the team to enter what through the central passage?\n\nChoices:\nA: access rooms\nB: arena\nC: public building\nD: access carrers\nE: tomb",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the context of the question, which mentions \"the team\" entering something through a \"central passage.\" This implies a space or structure that is significant and possibly ceremonial.",
    "Next, I will consider the options provided. \n- A: access rooms - This seems too mundane and is less likely to have a ceremonial aspect.\n- B: arena - An arena could fit the description, especially if the team was entering for a public event.\n- C: public building - This is too vague and could refer to many places with no specific context.\n- D: access carrers - This option doesn't make sense grammatically or contextually.\n- E: tomb - Entering a tomb feels less likely for a \"team\" in a traditional sense unless for a specific rite or ceremony.",
    "I will weigh the most plausible options, which seem to be B (arena) and E (tomb). \nAn arena is typically a place where teams compete, and the entry could be significant, aligning with traditional ceremonies or events. A tomb, however, seems more somber and not associated with a team entering in a celebratory or traditional context.",
    "Next, I will further analyze \"arena.\" An arena is a classical place for events, sports, or gatherings, which aligns with the idea of a \"team\" entering through a passage.",
    "Considering the nature of the event that involves a team, it is more likely to involve a public or competitive gathering, such as in an arena, rather than a tomb.",
    "After thorough consideration of all options along with their contextual relevance, I conclude that \"arena\" makes the most sense as it fits the scenario of a team entering through a passage for an event."
