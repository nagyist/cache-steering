  "query": "Question: Where can you find gamblers who watch four legged animals?\n\nChoices:\nA: race track\nB: casino\nC: enjoy horse races\nD: bar\nE: building",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions \"gamblers who watch four legged animals,\" which suggests that the type of gambling pertains to events involving animals that have four legs, such as horses.",
    "When considering where horse racing takes place, a race track is specifically designed for this purpose, making it a logical location for gamblers watching horse races.",
    "A casino, while being a place for gambling, primarily involves games and not necessarily the observation of four-legged animals, so it may not be the best fit for this question.",
    "The option \"enjoy horse races\" implies a general activity rather than a physical location, so it cannot be considered a place where gamblers gather specifically.",
    "A bar could have patrons who bet on different activities, but it's not specifically associated with watching four-legged animals, making it an unlikely choice.",
    "The term \"building\" is too vague and does not specifically denote a location where gamblers would gather to watch four-legged animals.",
    "With this reasoning, the most suitable choice for where you can find gamblers watching four-legged animals is the race track, as it directly involves horse racing."
