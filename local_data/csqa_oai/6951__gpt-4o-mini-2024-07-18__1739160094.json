  "query": "Question: Where would you put a fire extinguisher if there is only one floor in your house and you cannot cook food in your house?\n\nChoices:\nA: kitchen\nB: garage\nC: outside\nD: house\nE: stairwell",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that there is only one floor in the house, meaning all areas are accessible without needing to navigate stairs.",
    "It specifies that you cannot cook food in your house, which implies that the kitchen may not be a primary concern for fire hazards.",
    "Typically, fire extinguishers are placed in locations where potential hazards are most likely to occur.",
    "Since cooking is not taking place in the house, the most hazardous area would not be the kitchen.",
    "The garage is also often a place where flammable materials may be stored (like gasoline or tools), making it a wise location for a fire extinguisher.",
    "Placing a fire extinguisher outside would not be practical, as it might not be accessible during a fire emergency in the house.",
    "Placing it in the house is ambiguous, as it does not specify a particular area; the house as a general term does not provide enough specificity.",
    "The option of the stairwell is irrelevant since there are no stairs in a single-floor house.",
    "Considering the above reasons, the most logical choice is the garage, as it is likely to contain items that could catch fire."
