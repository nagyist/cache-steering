  "steps": [
    "First, identify the main types of establishments that may sell crab, shrimp, and fish dinners.",
    "Seafood restaurants would typically sell crab, shrimp, and fish, which are popular seafood items.",
    "Consider the choices provided: A: tidepools (not a restaurant), B: stew pot (potentially a cooking method, not a specific place), C: red lobster (a well-known seafood restaurant chain), D: dennys (a diner chain, mainly serving American cuisine), E: boss's office (not a dining establishment).",
    "Evaluate the only choice that is a recognized seafood restaurant known for serving crab, shrimp, and fish.",
    "Red Lobster is widely known as a chain that specializes in seafood and offers menus with crab, shrimp, and fish.",
    "While Denny's serves various foods, including some seafood, it is not primarily known for seafood like Red Lobster.",
    "Eliminate options A, B, D, and E since they do not directly provide crab, shrimp, and fish meals across many locations in the U.S.",
    "C: Red Lobster remains the most appropriate answer based on recognition and specialty in seafood dining."
