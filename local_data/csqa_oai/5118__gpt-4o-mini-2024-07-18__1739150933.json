  "query": "Question: The pacific northwest is a beautiful region, especially just below the northern border in where?\n\nChoices:\nA: oregon\nB: united states\nC: washington\nD: idaho\nE: british columbia",
  "steps": [
    "Identify where the Pacific Northwest region is located. The Pacific Northwest generally encompasses areas in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada.",
    "Determine which states are often included in the Pacific Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and sometimes Idaho are recognized as part of the Pacific Northwest.",
    "Consider the specific wording of the question, which asks for a location \"just below the northern border.\" This indicates looking for a location that is close to the Canadian border.",
    "Evaluating the states: Washington is bordered to the north by Canada, while Oregon is further south. Idaho is also south of Canadian borders, and while British Columbia is just north of Washington and Idaho, it is not part of the United States.",
    "Between Washington and Oregon, Washington is the most northern state in the contiguous U.S. in the Pacific Northwest region.",
    "Since the question asks specifically about the region just below the northern border and within the United States, we confirm that Washington meets this requirement.",
    "Review all options in relation to their geographic positions. Washington is directly below Canada, fulfilling the criteria of being just below the northern border.",
    "Reassess the choices: \nA: Oregon is south of Washington.\nB: United States is too broad.\nC: Washington is directly below Canada.\nD: Idaho is also south but does not directly border Canada.\nE: British Columbia is not a U.S. state.",
    "Confirming again, the correct option under the criteria specified by the question is Washington, which is directly below the northern border of Canada."
