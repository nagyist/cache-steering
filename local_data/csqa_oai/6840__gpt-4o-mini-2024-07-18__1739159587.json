  "steps": [
    "To determine where one is likely to find a mathematical rule, we first consider what a mathematical rule generally consists of. Mathematical rules are typically defined structures, formulas, or guidelines used in mathematics to solve problems or understand concepts.",
    "Next, we examine the choices provided to see which context is most relevant to mathematics. A textbook is specifically designed to teach and explain mathematical concepts, including various mathematical rules.",
    "Looking at option B, a family situation, it is uncommon to find mathematical rules explicitly stated within personal or family dynamics, as this context does not primarily focus on mathematics.",
    "Choice C, \"everything,\" is very broad and does not specifically relate to mathematics; while one could argue mathematical principles apply to many aspects, it does not indicate a specific place where rules are written or defined.",
    "In options D and E, the bible and a lawbook, respectively, neither are primarily concerned with mathematics in the same way that a textbook is. A lawbook may contain logical rules, but they are legal rules, not mathematical rules.",
    "The most relevant and suitable choice for finding a mathematical rule is a textbook, as it is the primary educational resource devoted to explaining and illustrating mathematics.",
    "Reviewing all the choices, A (textbook) stands out clearly compared to the other options, making it the most likely place to find mathematical rules."
