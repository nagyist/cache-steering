  "query": "Question: During the seated interview the hiring agent hired the man on the spot, he got a contract and pen out of the what right on the spot?\n\nChoices:\nA: other mans pocket\nB: friend's house\nC: desk drawer\nD: office supply store\nE: briefcase",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the hiring agent hired the man on the spot, indicating that the decision was made quickly and with immediacy.",
    "The agent provided a contract and pen for the man to sign right after making the hiring decision.",
    "The logical question is where the agent could have sourced the contract and pen from instantly during the interview.",
    "An \"other man's pocket\" seems unlikely, as it is not a professional or standard practice to take supplies from someone else's personal items during a business transaction.",
    "A \"friend's house\" also seems impractical because it would require leaving the interview location to retrieve the items, which goes against the idea of a quick hiring process.",
    "An \"office supply store\" would again not provide immediate access, as the store would be off-site and the interaction would require time to visit.",
    "A \"briefcase\" could potentially hold the necessary items, but it would not guarantee access to a contract.",
    "A \"desk drawer\" is the most plausible option, as it implies that the agent has immediate access to both a contract and pen that are stored nearby in the office, ready for use.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the desk drawer is the most likely source for the contract and pen, considering the context of the hiring process occurring onsite."
