  "query": "Question: Where are floors kept clean for holy purposes?\n\nChoices:\nA: restaurant\nB: basement\nC: all buildings\nD: carpet\nE: synagogue",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze the context of \"clean for holy purposes.\" This suggests a place of worship or a location where religious rituals are conducted.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each answer choice in relation to its connection with holy purposes.",
    "Choice A, \"restaurant,\" is typically not associated with holy purposes. While cleanliness is important, it is not specifically for religious or holy reasons.",
    "Choice B, \"basement,\" does not imply any religious significance or holiness. Basements are usually practical spaces without spiritual connotations.",
    "Choice C, \"all buildings,\" is too broad. While cleanliness is generally desired in all buildings, not all buildings are designated for holy purposes.",
    "Choice D, \"carpet,\" refers to a material, not a location. Although carpets can be part of a holy place, they themselves are not a specific location that is kept clean for holy purposes.",
    "Choice E, \"synagogue,\" is a place of worship for Jewish people, where cleanliness would indeed be maintained for religious and holy purposes.",
    "Having analyzed all options, the only choice that specifically relates to a location where floors are kept clean for holy purposes is \"synagogue.\""
