  "steps": [
    "When a person is punched in the nose, it can be a painful and shocking experience, which typically triggers an emotional and physiological response.",
    "One common response to pain, particularly in the face, is tearing up. This is often a reflexive action to discomfort or injury.",
    "The body may react to the injury by producing tears, which is a way to lubricate the eyes and also serve as a mechanism to express emotional distress.",
    "The choices provided include various outcomes that do not directly correlate with being punched in the nose except for one that references the eyes directly.",
    "\"Fill with tears\" suggests that the eyes will begin to produce tears as a response to the pain, which aligns with the physiological response to being hurt.",
    "Other options like \"see work,\" \"glass over,\" \"see light,\" and \"dry out\" either do not apply to the situation or are unlikely responses from being punched in the nose.",
    "Given the context and the options, the most reasonable outcome from the injury is that the eyes will \"fill with tears.\""
