  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that people could walk on and that could have a steel cable attached to it.",
    "Let's analyze each choice one by one.",
    "Choice A: rowboat. While people can be on a rowboat, it is not something that typically has a steel cable attached to it.",
    "Choice B: ground. People can walk on the ground, but ground itself does not have steel cables attached.",
    "Choice C: suspension bridge. People can walk on a suspension bridge, and it is specifically designed with steel cables that support the bridge structure and hold it up.",
    "Choice D: ship. While people can walk on a ship, it typically does not have a steel cable attached in the same context as a bridge might.",
    "Choice E: building. People can walk in and around a building, but buildings are not typically associated with having steel cables attached in a significant structural role like a bridge does.",
    "From the analysis above, the only suitable option where people can walk and which also has an association with steel cables is the suspension bridge."
