  "steps": [
    "The question states that James's yard had many well-kept rose bushes, which indicates that he is likely skilled in gardening or plant care.",
    "I need to identify which option relates to the skill James possesses regarding the care of his rose bushes.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"backyard\" (A) and \"plants\" (B) refer to locations or objects rather than a skill.",
    "\"Beautiful garden\" (D) and \"kew gardens\" (E) again refer to places and do not directly describe a person's skill.",
    "The option \"garder\" (C) seems to be a typographical error for \"gardener,\" which would directly indicate someone skilled in gardening.",
    "Given that the context is about maintaining rose bushes, the most appropriate choice should be related to the expertise in caring for plants.",
    "Thus, despite the possible typographical error, \"garder\" strongly suggests the intended word \"gardener.\"",
    "Hence, James being described as a talented \"garder\" aligns with the context of his well-kept rose bushes.",
    "Conclusively, the correct answer option that relates to James's ability in this context is \"C.\""
