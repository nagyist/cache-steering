  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the host lit up\" suggests that the host was excited or happy about something happening.",
    "The doorbell ringing typically indicates that someone has arrived at the host's home.",
    "The host's excitement implies that this arrival is anticipated or welcomed.",
    "\"Expect company\" directly correlates with the idea that the host was looking forward to someone coming over.",
    "\"Welcome guests\" is another choice that aligns with the notion of being friendly and greeting arriving visitors.",
    "While both \"expect company\" and \"welcome guests\" fit, \"expect company\" relates more to the anticipation of the doorbell ringing.",
    "Conversely, \"welcome guests\" pertains more to the action taken after the company has arrived.",
    "The scenario suggests that the immediate reaction to the doorbell is anticipation of company, reinforcing the idea of a host's expectations.",
    "Although both \"expect company\" and \"welcome guests\" are plausible, we need to choose the option that most directly relates to the ringing of the doorbell.",
    "Given the context, the best answer that reflects the host's emotions as the doorbell rings is \"expect company.\""
