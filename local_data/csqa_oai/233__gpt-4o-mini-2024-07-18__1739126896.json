  "query": "Question: Bob thought that his Pokemon cards were common and worthless, but he was wrong about them. They were really what?\n\nChoices:\nA: personal\nB: special\nC: shiny\nD: rare\nE: irregular",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that Bob believed his Pokemon cards were common and worthless, but that belief was incorrect. This suggests that the cards had more value than he perceived.",
    "To understand what the cards were really, we can analyze the options given. \"Personal\" (A) suggests emotional value, but does not imply monetary or collectible worth.",
    "\"Special\" (B) could imply some unique characteristics or significance, but it does not specifically denote rarity or collectibility.",
    "\"Shiny\" (C) refers to a specific type of Pokemon card that has a reflective surface, but again does not inherently tie to overall value in the context of collectible cards.",
    "\"Irregular\" (E) indicates some form of abnormality, which does not correlate with value; it might even suggest a flaw in a collectible context.",
    "\"Rare\" (D) suggests a limited quantity or high demand, directly indicating that the cards would be valuable, contradicting Bob's initial belief.",
    "Since the premise states that Bob was wrong about the cards being common and worthless, the most logical conclusion is that they are indeed rare.",
    "Finally, among all the options, \"rare\" directly connects to the notion of increased value and exclusivity, solidifying it as the answer."
