  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the main functions and typical settings of a house.",
    "Tables are commonly used for various activities, such as eating, working, or socializing.",
    "The living room is often used for relaxation and social gatherings but may have smaller tables for drinks or snacks.",
    "The kitchen often has a table, mainly for quick meals or food preparation, but it may not be the primary area for a dining table.",
    "The dining room is specifically designated for having meals, making it the most likely place to have a large dining table.",
    "A conference setting doesn't typically exist in a residential house, making it irrelevant.",
    "A \"demonstration\" space, while it could accommodate tables, is more likely in a non-residential setup or staging environment.",
    "Given the function of a dining room, it can be concluded that it is designed for dining, which involves tables.",
    "Comparing the likelihood of tables in the living room, kitchen, and dining room, the dining room stands out as the most probable location for a table dedicated to meals."
