    "A dryer, specifically a hand dryer, is often found in public restrooms and is designed for this purpose.",
    "A roof is not relevant as it is part of a building structure and not used for drying hands.",
    "A swimming pool could theoretically have a drying effect if someone leaves, but it is not practical for drying hands.",
    "A gym typically contains exercise equipment and is not directly related to drying hands in a home bathroom setting.",
