  "query": "Question: Playing tennis requires at least one opponent, a ball, and a what?\n\nChoices:\nA: skill\nB: big money\nC: time\nD: tennis racket\nE: legs",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what is essential to play tennis alongside an opponent and a ball, I will consider commonly recognized necessities for the sport.",
    "Tennis is typically played with a racket, which is used to hit the ball. Therefore, a tennis racket is a critical component of the game.",
    "While skill and time may enhance the experience of playing tennis, they are not strictly necessary for the act of playing. Anyone can play regardless of their skill level, and games can happen at any time.",
    "Big money is not required to play tennis as many players may participate informally or at lower-level competitions without significant costs.",
    "Legs are certainly beneficial for movement during the game, but they are not a specific \"equipment\" requirement like a racket is.",
    "Since a tennis racket is the only item that is fundamentally necessary to hit the ball, it stands out as the correct answer.",
    "I can also validate the other options: skill is subjective, big money is not a requirement, time is flexible, and legs are advantageous but not mandatory.",
    "Thus, out of the given options, only a tennis racket is indispensable for playing tennis in combination with a ball and an opponent."
