  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of taking a long walk. When walking for an extended period, carrying unnecessary items can be cumbersome.",
    "Next, evaluate the practicality of each storage option listed in the choices.",
    "A suitcase is typically used for travel and would be too large and heavy to carry while walking.",
    "A department store is a place to buy clothing, not an option for storing clothing while on a walk.",
    "A mall is also a shopping destination rather than a storage solution or place for keeping clothing during a walk.",
    "A purse, while suitable for carrying personal items, is not designed for clothing storage and tends to be small.",
    "A backpack is specifically meant for carrying various items, including clothing, and is comfortable to wear during a long walk.",
    "Considering all options, the backpack stands out as the most practical choice for storing clothing while walking."
