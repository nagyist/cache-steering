  "query": "Question: Sarah's birds died because she didn't poke holes in the jar and they needed to do what?\n\nChoices:\nA: pick berries\nB: sky\nC: reproduce\nD: roof\nE: breathe",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the situation where Sarah's birds died in a jar. The main function of the jar in this context would likely be to contain the birds for some purpose.",
    "Next, analyze the implications of not having holes in the jar. Without holes, the air supply inside the jar would be limited or completely cut off.",
    "Recognize that being enclosed in a jar without air would lead to suffocation for the birds, as they need to breathe oxygen to survive.",
    "Evaluate the choices given to determine which one aligns with the need for air. The option that directly refers to the necessity for air is labeled as 'breathe'.",
    "Check other options for relevance: \n- 'pick berries' does not pertain to the immediate needs of birds in a jar.\n- 'sky' is not directly applicable.\n- 'reproduce' relates to a biological function but is not an immediate issue caused by being in a jar.\n- 'roof' is unrelated to the situation at hand.",
    "Reconfirm that in this scenario, the primary reason for the birds' death attributed to the lack of holes in the jar is the inability to breathe.",
    "Conclude that the most relevant answer to what the birds needed to do in order to survive is to breathe."
