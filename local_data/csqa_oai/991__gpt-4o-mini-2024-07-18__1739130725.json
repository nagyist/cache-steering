    "The question states that a snake prefers warm, sunny weather. This suggests that its ideal habitat would be a place that has these climatic conditions.",
    "Let's analyze each of the answer choices in relation to warm, sunny weather.",
    "A: Pet shops typically have controlled environments and do not represent natural habitats for snakes in terms of weather preferences.",
    "B: New Mexico is located in the southwestern United States and is known for its warm, sunny climate, especially considering desert landscapes and significant sunlight throughout the year.",
    "C: The White House, while a historical building, is located in Washington D.C., which experiences varied weather but is not known for warm, sunny weather consistently.",
    "D: The Arctic is characterized by extreme cold and is the opposite of a warm, sunny environment, making it an unlikely choice for a snake's preference.",
    "E: The Garden of Eden is a biblical reference and does not correspond to a specific geographical location with defined weather; hence its relevance is ambiguous.",
    "From the analysis, New Mexico stands out as a location that matches the criteria of a warm, sunny environment where a snake would likely prefer to live."
