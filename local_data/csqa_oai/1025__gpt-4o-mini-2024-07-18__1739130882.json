  "query": "Question: What meal would you find on your serving dish in the evening?\n\nChoices:\nA: brunch\nB: dinner\nC: fast food restaurant\nD: appear appetizing\nE: plate",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify the time of day referenced in the question, which is \"evening.\"",
    "Next, I will consider what meals are typically served in the evening.",
    "The main meal served during the evening is usually referred to as \"dinner.\"",
    "Now, I will evaluate the options provided:\n- A (brunch) is a meal typically eaten in late morning to early afternoon.\n- B (dinner) aligns with an evening meal.\n- C (fast food restaurant) does not specify a particular meal but rather a location.\n- D (appear appetizing) describes an aesthetic quality and not a meal.\n- E (plate) is a dining item and not a meal itself.",
    "Since out of the options, only B refers explicitly to a meal that is traditionally consumed in the evening, it stands out.",
    "I will confirm that \"dinner\" is indeed considered the primary evening meal in many cultures.",
    "Thus, based on the analysis and elimination of other options, I will choose B as the best answer."
