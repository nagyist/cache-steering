  "query": "Question: If you yell when a person starts to go in another direction, what are they likely to do?\n\nChoices:\nA: thank god\nB: turn around\nC: work hard\nD: walk away\nE: do a backflip",
  "steps": [
    "We need to assess the action of yelling when someone is moving in a different direction.",
    "Yelling is generally used to attract someone's attention or to signal them about something important.",
    "If a person is already moving away from something or someone, they may perceive yelling as a reason to stop or reconsider their current action.",
    "Out of the provided choices, we need to evaluate which response is most logical when someone is yelled at.",
    "Choice A (\"thank god\") does not correlate with the action of yelling; it is not a typical reaction in this context.",
    "Choice B (\"turn around\") seems like a reasonable response, as someone would likely redirect their movement to find out why they are being yelled at.",
    "Choice C (\"work hard\") is unrelated to the context of being yelled at while moving in another direction.",
    "Choice D (\"walk away\") contradicts the action of redirecting attention when someone yells; walking away typically suggests ignoring the yell.",
    "Choice E (\"do a backflip\") is an absurd response to being yelled at and is unlikely to be a reaction.",
    "Based on the logical deduction of the reactions to being yelled at, the most appropriate choice is to turn around."
