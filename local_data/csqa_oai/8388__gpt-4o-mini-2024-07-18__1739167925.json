  "query": "Question: The broadcast studio had a booth set up for interviews, the host sat down and adjusted his what so the audience could hear?\n\nChoices:\nA: large room\nB: microphone\nC: guest speaker\nD: radio station\nE: television station",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that the host is preparing for interviews in a broadcast studio, which suggests that proper audio equipment is crucial for the audience to hear clearly.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"microphone\" stands out as the specific equipment related to capturing sound, which is essential in a broadcasting context.",
    "The term \"large room\" does not pertain to audio or broadcasting equipment and does not fit the context of needing to adjust something for sound.",
    "\"Guest speaker\" could refer to another person being interviewed but does not relate to what the host is adjusting for the audience to hear.",
    "\"Radio station\" and \"television station\" are types of broadcast organizations, not items the host would adjust for audience clarity.",
    "Since the context is about sound and broadcasting, and the only relevant item that requires adjustment for clarity is a microphone, it strongly supports the answer.",
    "Thus, the most logical answer among the choices, directly relating to the need for the audience to hear the host clearly, is the microphone which the host would adjust."
