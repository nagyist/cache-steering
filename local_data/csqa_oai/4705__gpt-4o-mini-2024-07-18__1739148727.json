  "query": "Question: The mom told her son to stay in bed instead of going to school, what did she likely say afterwards?\n\nChoices:\nA: more rest\nB: rest more\nC: were sick\nD: drink water\nE: you're sick",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider why the mom would tell her son to stay in bed. It likely indicates that he may not be feeling well, which would lead to needing rest.",
    "Next, if the mom told her son to stay in bed, she would want to reassure him or explain why it\u2019s important to do so. This would typically relate to his health.",
    "Among the choices, some options suggest general advice (A: more rest, B: rest more) while others imply a specific condition (C: were sick, D: drink water, E: you're sick).",
    "Choices A and B suggest actions to take but don't directly address the situation's reason.",
    "Choice D, \"drink water,\" is practical but again doesn't directly address why he should stay in bed.",
    "Choices C and E specifically address the condition of health. Choosing between them, E (\"you're sick\") directly ties to the implication of staying in bed because the son is sick.",
    "C (\"were sick\") does not fit grammatically in the context of what the mom might say after telling her son to stay in bed.",
    "E (\"you're sick\") confirms the reason for being told to stay in bed, making it a likely follow-up statement from the mom.",
    "After analyzing all options, E remains the most coherent and contextual response to indicate to the son why he must stay in bed."
