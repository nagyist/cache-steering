  "query": "Question: If people are disappointed by something they aren't entitled to, what must they do?\n\nChoices:\nA: like ice cream\nB: dance well\nC: believe in god\nD: make a wish\nE: lower expectations",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what it means to be disappointed by something. Disappointment usually arises when there is a conflict between expectations and reality.",
    "Next, if individuals feel disappointed about something they are not entitled to, it indicates that they expected something that was not rightfully theirs.",
    "Since they are not entitled to it, their expectation may be unreasonable, contributing to their disappointment.",
    "To address such disappointment, people might need to reassess or readjust their expectations.",
    "Lowering expectations appears to be a reasonable strategy for handling disappointment, especially in situations where one lacks a legitimate claim to an outcome.",
    "Next, I will compare this reasoning with the answer choices to find the best match.",
    "Choice A, \"like ice cream,\" seems unrelated to managing disappointment.",
    "Choice B, \"dance well,\" does not directly relate to the context of disappointment and entitlement.",
    "Choice C, \"believe in god,\" is also not necessarily linked to adjusting expectations about entitlements.",
    "Choice D, \"make a wish,\" while somewhat related to hope, does not address the root of disappointment from unfulfilled entitlements.",
    "Choice E, \"lower expectations,\" fits perfectly as it suggests a direct way to alleviate disappointment by adjusting one's view on what they can expect in a situation of non-entitlement."
