  "steps": [
    "To determine the best vehicle for moving cargo at a low price when time is not a concern, we need to consider the cost-effectiveness of different transportation methods.",
    "Trains are generally known for their efficiency in moving large volumes of cargo over land, while maintaining relatively low costs. They can transport a substantial amount of goods at lower prices compared to other vehicles.",
    "Boats and ships can carry large amounts of cargo as well, particularly over long distances. However, boats are typically used for smaller or coastal routes, while larger ships can be optimal but may be costlier depending on the cargo type and distance.",
    "Airplanes are the fastest option for transporting cargo, but they are also the most expensive. Given that the question specifies that time isn't an issue, this makes airplanes less feasible for low-cost transport.",
    "The term \"ship's hold\" refers to the space within a ship used for cargo; it isn't a mode of transportation by itself. As such, we can disregard this option since we are seeking a vehicle.",
    "Now, comparing the remaining options: train, boat, and airplane. Trains generally offer a balance of cost and capacity for overland transportation, while boats (especially larger cargo ships) can be very low-cost for maritime transport.",
    "Given cargo movement at low prices often utilizes transportation methods that benefit from economies of scale, large cargo ships would likely provide the most cost-effective solution over long distances, particularly on international routes.",
    "Since both trains and large ships can be viable for cost-effective long-distance transport, and considering the emphasis on moving cargo at low costs without time constraints, ships may have an edge due to their ability to carry large volumes at low rates.",
    "After analyzing all aspects carefully, the most cost-effective and suitable vehicle for moving cargo at low prices, when time is not an issue, would be a boat (or a ship)."
