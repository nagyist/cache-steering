  "query": "Question: What was used to cut through royal necks in the French Revolution?\n\nChoices:\nA: knives\nB: shoulder\nC: giblets\nD: guillotine\nE: bottle",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the historical context of the French Revolution and what instruments were used for executions.",
    "I recall that during the French Revolution, executions were frequent and usually public, targeting the aristocracy and royalty.",
    "I remember the guillotine being a significant symbol of the revolution, specifically designed for carrying out executions quickly and efficiently.",
    "Next, I will eliminate choices that are not relevant to the method of execution:\n- A: knives are general cutting tools but not specifically associated with the method of execution used against royals.\n- B: shoulder does not relate to cutting or execution.\n- C: giblets refers to edible internal organs, which is irrelevant in this context.\n- E: bottle is also unrelated.",
    "The only remaining choice that specifically relates to the method of execution during the French Revolution is D: guillotine.",
    "The guillotine was designed to be a more humane execution device, suitable for the mass executions that occurred during that time.",
    "It is historically accurate to conclude that the guillotine was the primary instrument used for cutting through the necks of royals during the French Revolution."
