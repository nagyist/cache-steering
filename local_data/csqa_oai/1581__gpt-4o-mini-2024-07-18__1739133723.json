  "query": "Question: When deciding how to shop cereal, what decision to most cereal manufacturers make?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: box\nC: fridge\nD: cupboard\nE: mouth",
  "steps": [
    "I need to consider the context of cereal storage as it relates to common practices among cereal manufacturers.",
    "Cereal is typically sold in a box, which is the standard packaging for cereal products.",
    "The box protects the cereal from moisture and damage, and ensures it retains freshness during shelf life.",
    "Other options such as 'cabinet' and 'cupboard' refer to storage locations rather than packaging.",
    "The option 'fridge' is less common as most cereals are not kept in the refrigerator; they are stored at room temperature.",
    "'Mouth' does not relate to the decision manufacturers make about how to package cereal.",
    "Therefore, the most logical choice in terms of how cereal manufacturers decide to package their product is in a box."
