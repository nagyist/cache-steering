  "query": "Question: Where would you find a sign and a long line of cars behind it?\n\nChoices:\nA: texas\nB: city\nC: street corner\nD: roadblock\nE: bus stop",
  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze where a sign would typically be located alongside a long line of cars.",
    "A sign could be found in various places, but the context suggests it must be a location that affects traffic, so I should consider the purpose of the sign.",
    "A roadblock is a possibility where a sign would indicate that cars must stop, and thus there could be a long line of cars waiting behind it.",
    "However, a street corner could also have a sign, such as a stop sign or directional sign, where traffic accumulates waiting for a signal to proceed.",
    "In a busy city environment (choice B), signage and a long line of cars can also be common, but it doesn't specifically point to a traffic-related issue as effectively as a roadblock or street corner.",
    "Choices A (Texas) and E (bus stop) feel less probable since a bus stop wouldn\u2019t typically have an issue with waiting cars; rather, it is designed for momentary stops.",
    "Now, I compare roadblock and street corner. A roadblock signifies a deliberate stop due to construction, an accident, or similar, while a street corner may simply denote traffic at intersection points.",
    "The wording \"long line of cars\" leans more toward a situation where cars are forced to stop due to some obstruction, which aligns more with a roadblock.",
    "Thus, I conclude that the most fitting choice, taking into account where a sign and a line of cars would be commonly found, is D: roadblock."
