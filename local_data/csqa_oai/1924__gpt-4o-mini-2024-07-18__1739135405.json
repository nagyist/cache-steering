  "query": "Question: They were marked up in price but he didn't want to go to the department store, so he just got a disposable razor where?\n\nChoices:\nA: hotel room\nB: garbage\nC: supermarket\nD: medicine cabinet\nE: restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "The statement mentions that he did not want to go to the department store, which implies he is looking for an alternative location to purchase a disposable razor.",
    "Typically, disposable razors are found in places where personal grooming products are sold. Common locations include supermarkets, drugstores, and convenience stores.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"supermarket\" stands out as a common place for purchasing various personal care items, including disposable razors.",
    "The other options need to be analyzed for their likelihood of having disposable razors available. \"Hotel room\" could contain razors, but they are generally not for sale. \"Garbage\" does not make sense in this context as no purchase would occur there. \"Medicine cabinet\" may contain personal items but is not a location where one would buy a razor. \"Restaurant\" is not a relevant place to find disposable razors either.",
    "Therefore, the \"supermarket\" is the most plausible choice for where he would buy a disposable razor since it is a typical retail environment for such items."
