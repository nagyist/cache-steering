    "If the person you love does not love you back, this can lead to feelings of sadness or disappointment because your feelings are not reciprocated.",
    "Typically, unrequited love leads to what is often described as heartache, indicating emotional pain and distress.",
    "One might initially feel satisfaction or happiness from loving someone, but that feeling can quickly diminish when it is not mutual.",
    "Peace is usually associated with feeling content or at ease, which is unlikely in a situation of unrequited love.",
