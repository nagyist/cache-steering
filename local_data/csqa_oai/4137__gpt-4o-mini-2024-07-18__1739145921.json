  "query": "Question: Where would you expect to see a coach in Europe or South America?\n\nChoices:\nA: play football\nB: sporting event\nC: at a laundry mat.\nD: soccer game\nE: hockey game",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the primary roles and contexts in which a coach would be found, particularly focusing on sports common in Europe and South America.",
    "Coaches are typically involved in training and directing teams in various sports. In Europe and South America, football (or soccer) is a dominant sport.",
    "Looking at the options, A (\"play football\") suggests that a coach would be actively playing the game, which is not their role.",
    "B (\"sporting event\") is very general and could include various contexts; however, it does not specifically define where a coach would typically be found.",
    "D (\"soccer game\") directly relates to where a coach would be, as they are often present at games to direct the team and implement strategies during matches.",
    "E (\"hockey game\") is less relevant in Europe and South America, where hockey is not as prominent compared to football/soccer.",
    "Comparing D with A, B, and E, D aligns directly with the common function of a coach.",
    "Since the question specifies Europe or South America, where football is the key sport, D is the most accurate choice for where to expect a coach."
