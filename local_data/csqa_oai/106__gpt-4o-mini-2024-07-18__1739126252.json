  "query": "Question: Where would you find a bee gathering pollen?\n\nChoices:\nA: united states\nB: sky\nC: court\nD: field of flowers\nE: orchard",
  "steps": [
    "To determine where a bee would gather pollen, we should think about the natural behavior and habitat of bees.",
    "Bees primarily gather pollen from flowers, as they rely on flowering plants for nutrition.",
    "Therefore, an environment abundant with flowers or flowering plants would be an ideal location for bees to gather pollen.",
    "The option \"united states\" refers to a geographic location which is too broad, as bees can be found in many places where flowers grow.",
    "The option \"sky\" does not provide a suitable habitat since bees do not gather pollen in the air.",
    "The option \"court\" does not relate to the natural environment of bees.",
    "The option \"field of flowers\" indicates a specific area rich in flowering plants, which is perfect for bees to gather pollen.",
    "The option \"orchard\" may also contain flowering plants; however, it is more specific and may not be as common as fields where a variety of flowers bloom.",
    "Comparing the options, a \"field of flowers\" offers the most direct and plentiful source of pollen for bees."
