  "query": "Question: A frigid family wanted to buy a heater, so where did they have it installed?\n\nChoices:\nA: automobile\nB: city hall\nC: house\nD: public building\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the context of the question. The term \"frigid family\" suggests that the family is experiencing cold temperatures and requires warmth.",
    "Next, consider the purpose of a heater, which is to provide warmth in a living environment.",
    "Examine the choices provided. \"Automobile\" is not a logical place for a heater installation relevant to a frigid family seeking comfort.",
    "Evaluate \"city hall\" as a location for a heater installation. While it may have heating, it is not a place where a family would typically seek warmth for personal comfort.",
    "Consider \"public building\" in a similar vein as city hall. These are not family residences, so it would not be appropriate for a family looking to warm their personal space.",
    "Next, look at \"office.\" Although offices may have heaters, they are not personal living spaces conducive to a family seeking to create a warm home environment.",
    "Finally, evaluate \"house.\" This is a typical residence where a family would install a heater to ensure a comfortable living space.",
    "Conclude that the most logical choice for where a frigid family would have a heater installed is in their house, as that corresponds with the intent of maintaining warmth."
