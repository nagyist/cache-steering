  "query": "Question: What is likely long on a cat?\n\nChoices:\nA: eyes\nB: whiskers\nC: four legs\nD: life\nE: sharp claws",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what characteristics are commonly associated with cats.",
    "Cats are known to have certain physical attributes that define their anatomy.",
    "One of the options is \"eyes.\" Cats do have eyes, but all living creatures have them, so it's not unique to being long.",
    "Next, we consider \"whiskers.\" Cats do have whiskers that can be long, but this is a feature that varies in length and is not consistently long across all cats.",
    "Now, let's look at \"four legs.\" This is a structural characteristic of cats, but it is not descriptive of length.",
    "Next, \"life\" refers to the lifespan of a cat, which can be long, but this is not a physical trait.",
    "The option \"sharp claws\" is indeed a characteristic of cats, but claws aren't necessarily referred to as long; they vary by the individual cat and their grooming habits.",
    "Considering the analysis, \"life\" suggests longevity, which can be interpreted as a cat having a long life expectancy compared to many other animals.",
    "However, assessing all options again, I determine that \"whiskers\" are often particularly long and notable features of cats, hence they stand out.",
    "After re-evaluating the most relevant answer in context to the phrase \"long on a cat,\" \"whiskers\" fits best, as they are notably longer compared to other cat attributes."
