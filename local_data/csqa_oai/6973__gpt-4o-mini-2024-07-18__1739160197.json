  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which option is commonly associated with high rises.",
    "A warehouse typically has large doors for receiving goods and is not primarily made of windows. This option is unlikely.",
    "A friend's house is not generally categorized as a high rise; it is usually a single-family dwelling. This option does not fit the context.",
    "A building, particularly in urban settings, often refers to high rises which frequently have a large number of windows. This option seems plausible.",
    "A space shuttle is a spacecraft and does not fit the definition of a high rise; hence, it is not relevant.",
    "A wall can have windows but is not described as a high rise itself. Therefore, this option does not apply.",
    "Checking the definition of a high rise confirms that it is typically a tall building, often with multiple floors, which aligns with the characteristics of a \"building.\"",
    "Evaluating the context of the question, the term \"high rise\" is most closely associated with various types of buildings, especially within urban landscapes.",
    "I have considered all provided options and reasons for their likelihood of matching the criteria of being made of windows."
