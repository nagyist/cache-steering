  "query": "Question: What can be the end result of waging war?\n\nChoices:\nA: people dying\nB: heartache\nC: killing people\nD: evil\nE: suffering",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the overall impact of war on individuals and society. Wars often involve conflict between groups, leading to various adverse outcomes.",
    "Next, evaluate the direct consequences of war. The most immediate and visible outcome is the loss of life, with military personnel and civilians affected.",
    "Then, reflect on the emotional and psychological ramifications of war. Heartache is a significant part of the experience for those who lose loved ones or face trauma.",
    "After that, analyze the broader consequences of war, such as social and economic instability, which can lead to societal suffering over time.",
    "Consider the term \"killing people.\" It is a raw and direct consequence of warfare, emphasizing the act of taking lives and contributing to the casualty figure.",
    "Now, address the concept of \"evil.\" While war can involve acts considered evil, it is a more subjective interpretation compared to tangible outcomes.",
    "Assess the choice \"suffering.\" This encompasses a wide range of experiences, including emotional, physical, and psychological distress suffered by war victims and their families.",
    "Examine the connections between the choices. Options A (people dying), C (killing people), and E (suffering) can all be seen as direct outcomes of war.",
    "Conclude which outcomes are most direct and observable. While heartache and evil play roles, the most evident and uncontestable outcomes focus on loss of life and suffering.",
    "Determine the final answer by prioritizing the options based on their direct relation to the consequences of war. The option that encompasses the essence of the war's brutality is \"killing people,\" but \"people dying\" also emphasizes the casualty aspect."
