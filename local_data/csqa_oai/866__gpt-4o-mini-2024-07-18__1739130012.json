  "query": "Question: Where would you read a passage but not write it?\n\nChoices:\nA: diary\nB: city\nC: bible\nD: graffiti\nE: labyrinth",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the question. It asks for a place where one can read a passage but not write it. This suggests that the location should allow for reading but should not permit writing in any form.",
    "Next, we will consider each option in turn to evaluate whether it fits the criteria.",
    "Option A: diary. A diary is a personal journal where one both reads and writes entries. This option does not fit because writing is an integral part of using a diary.",
    "Option B: city. A city is a large place where one can certainly read literature or signage, but it is not a defined location for only reading passages. This option is too broad and doesn't specifically align with the reading-only aspect.",
    "Option C: bible. The Bible is a religious text that individuals read, but traditionally, it is not a text that people write upon. In many contexts, it\u2019s a book valued for its content rather than a space for writing.",
    "Option D: graffiti. Graffiti is a form of visual art where people write on surfaces, so this option doesn't fit the requirement since it's primarily about writing rather than just reading.",
    "Option E: labyrinth. A labyrinth is a complex and intricate maze structure. While one could theoretically read something while navigating a labyrinth, it does not inherently suggest a place where one reads text specifically.",
    "Having evaluated all the options, Option C (bible) stands out since it allows for reading but does not include writing as a common practice."
