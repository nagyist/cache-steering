  "query": "Question: You can find an anemone living in what kind of fluid?\n\nChoices:\nA: tide pool\nB: dictionary\nC: sea water\nD: south pacific\nE: movie scene",
  "steps": [
    "An anemone is a type of marine animal, specifically a member of the phylum Cnidaria.",
    "Anemones are generally found in aquatic environments, particularly in the ocean.",
    "To determine the right fluid, we need to identify which of the choices represent a natural habitat for an anemone.",
    "A tide pool is a coastal rock pool that is filled with seawater, which can contain various marine organisms, including anemones.",
    "Sea water is the natural habitat of all marine life, including anemones, since they are aquatic organisms.",
    "The South Pacific is a region of the ocean, not a fluid, but it hosts marine life, including anemones.",
    "A dictionary is a book and does not represent a fluid at all; hence it cannot be a habitat for an anemone.",
    "A movie scene is a representation or depiction; it doesn't relate to a physical fluid that could support the living environment of an anemone.",
    "Now, among the options, both a tide pool and sea water are related to the habitat of an anemone.",
    "However, \"sea water\" is the best answer as it universally encompasses the habitat for anemones, while \"tide pool\" is a specific type of sea water."
