    "The question states it was the first time they met their new niece, implying a gathering of family members.",
    "The phrase \"good to have everybody together\" suggests a social event or gathering where family members come together.",
    "Among the choices provided, \"family reunion\" specifically indicates an event designed for family members to gather, which aligns with the context of the scenario.",
    "The other options do not adequately represent a gathering. For example:\n- A: brother's house refers to a location but not an event.\n- B: family picture book is a collection of photos, not a gathering.\n- C: family tree is a diagram showing family relationships, not an event.\n- E: book alone does not indicate any social aspect.",
