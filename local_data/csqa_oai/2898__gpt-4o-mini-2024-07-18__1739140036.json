  "steps": [
    "A cube is a three-dimensional shape with six square faces.",
    "These six faces consist of a top face, a bottom face, and four side faces.",
    "The question asks what else a cube has beyond the top, bottom, and two sides.",
    "If two sides are already mentioned, it implies that there are two more sides that have not been mentioned: the front side and the back side.",
    "Therefore, the correct option should include the remaining sides that complete the cubic structure.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the answer choices given:",
    "A: corner - is a point of intersection in the cube but not a face.",
    "B: in between - this is vague and does not correspond to a specific cube feature.",
    "C: center - this refers to the point within the cube but not an external face.",
    "D: front back - identifies the two remaining sides of the cube not previously mentioned (given that two sides were specified).",
    "E: one side - does not clarify anything additional since it refers to a single side.",
    "D is the clear choice as it refers to the remaining faces not mentioned initially."
