    "Consider the context and significance of meetings among cardinals. They often gather to make significant decisions or conduct elections, notably in the process of electing a new pope.",
    "The term that describes a meeting of cardinals for the purpose of electing a pope is known as a \"conclave.\"",
    "Now, evaluate the other choices to see if they fit the context of cardinals and their activities.",
