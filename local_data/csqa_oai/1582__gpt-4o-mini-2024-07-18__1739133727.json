    "The question asks for the location of the U.S. federal government.",
    "I will evaluate the choices one by one to identify the correct answer.",
    "Choice A: Washington D.C. is known as the capital of the United States and is where the federal government is located.",
    "Choice B: Canada is a separate country and does not host the U.S. federal government.",
    "Choice C: The term \"country\" is too broad; it refers to a nation but does not specify the location of the federal government.",
    "Choice D: The Capitol Building is a specific building within Washington D.C. where Congress meets, but it doesn't encompass the entire federal government.",
    "Choice E: \"Democracy\" refers to a system of government and is not a physical location.",
    "Among the choices, Washington D.C. (Choice A) clearly identifies the precise location of the U.S. federal government.",
