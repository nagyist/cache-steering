  "query": "Question: If a person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, where might they stop?\n\nChoices:\nA: gas station\nB: grocery store\nC: friend's house\nD: supermarket\nE: fast food restaurant",
  "steps": [
    "The question specifies that a person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, indicating a preference for drive-thru or drive-up options.",
    "I will analyze each option based on their likelihood of offering coffee without the need to exit the vehicle.",
    "Option A: gas station - Many gas stations have convenience stores attached that often offer coffee, and they frequently have drive-thru service as well.",
    "Option B: grocery store - While some grocery stores might have coffee counters, typically, one would have to park and go inside to get coffee.",
    "Option C: friend's house - This option suggests visiting a friend's residence, which likely would require leaving the car.",
    "Option D: supermarket - Similar to a grocery store, supermarkets generally require customers to enter the store to purchase coffee.",
    "Option E: fast food restaurant - Many fast food chains offer coffee and have convenient drive-thru options, making it easy for someone to get coffee without leaving their car.",
    "Comparing the viable options, both the gas station and fast food restaurant provide the possibility of obtaining coffee without exiting the car.",
    "However, fast food restaurants are much more recognizable for their coffee offerings and have established drive-thru services dedicated to beverage orders.",
    "Thus, while both options A and E are possible, option E stands out as the most common scenario."
