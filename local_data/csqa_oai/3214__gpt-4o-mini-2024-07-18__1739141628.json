  "query": "Question: He looked up for a certain star, it was the one that helped him spot the rest of the what?\n\nChoices:\nA: solar system\nB: night sky\nC: hollywood\nD: constellation\nE: red carpet",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what the phrase \"helped him spot the rest\" could refer to. Since he is looking for a specific star, it's likely he is interpreting a broader context related to astronomy or navigation.",
    "Next, considering that stars are often part of larger groupings, I should consider common terms that describe collections of stars. A \"constellation\" directly refers to a recognized arrangement of stars in the night sky.",
    "I should also evaluate the other options to see if they make sense in the context of spotting stars. \"Solar system\" pertains to our sun and its planets but doesn't directly relate to spotting stars in a singular context.",
    "The term \"night sky\" also relates to the general view of stars but isn't specific enough to imply a star being used as a reference for identifying others.",
    "\"Hollywood\" and \"red carpet\" are terms related to the film industry and have no direct connection to astronomy or the night sky.",
    "Given the elimination of options A, B, C, and E, I focus back on option D, \"constellation,\" which fits the criteria better as there are various stars within a constellation that one can spot based on identifying a key star.",
    "Thus, since the context involves spotting multiple stars and \"constellation\" is a common term associated with a group of stars, it follows logically that he looked for one star that would assist in identifying many others.",
    "In summary, option D is the only choice that directly relates to the act of spotting multiple stars through a significant key star."
