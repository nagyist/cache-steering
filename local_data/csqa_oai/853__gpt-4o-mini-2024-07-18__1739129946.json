    "The question asks about something that can help you at a bus station.",
    "A bus station typically provides information and services related to public transportation.",
    "Maps are often found at bus stations to assist travelers in finding their way to different destinations.",
    "The other options need to be evaluated in terms of their relevance to helping someone at a bus station.",
    "Option A (city centre) is a location, not something that can help you at the bus station.",
    "Option B (lottery ticket) is unrelated to transportation or helping travelers and serves no purpose in that context.",
    "Option D (street) is a general term for a road; while important, it does not provide assistance in a direct way.",
    "Option E (busy city) describes an environment and does not provide specific assistance.",
    "Given the analysis, the only option that directly provides help in navigation and understanding transportation options at a bus station is maps."
