  "query": "Question: What happens when you try to help someone but make it worse?\n\nChoices:\nA: succeed\nB: do nothing\nC: anticipate\nD: hinder\nE: hurting",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what it means to help someone. Helping involves actions intended to improve a situation or aid someone in need.",
    "Next, I need to identify the implications of making a situation worse when trying to help. This suggests that the intended positive action has had a negative outcome.",
    "I should consider the options available in the choices provided. Succeeding (A) implies a positive outcome, which contradicts the idea of making things worse.",
    "Doing nothing (B) suggests inaction, which doesn't align with the idea of trying to help\u2014there is an effort to assist.",
    "Anticipate (C) suggests foreseeing a situation but doesn't directly relate to the outcome of trying to help and failing.",
    "The term hinder (D) implies obstructing or making progress more difficult, which fits well with the idea of attempting to assist but then causing setbacks or complications.",
    "Hurting (E) focuses more on causing emotional or physical pain; while it could be relevant, it doesn't encompass the broader concept of simply making a situation worse due to well-meaning actions.",
    "Based on the definitions and implications, hinder (D) is the most accurate choice because it reflects the impact of trying to help someone but ending up complicating their situation."
