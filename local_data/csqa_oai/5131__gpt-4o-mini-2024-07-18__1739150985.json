  "steps": [
    "The context indicates that the engineer is presenting something to his bosses, which implies a formal setting.",
    "In such a context, it is common to present a new invention through a structured format that showcases its features or functionality, which suggests the need for demonstration.",
    "Looking at the choices, \"demonstration\" directly aligns with the concept of showing how a product works, while other options do not fit the context as well.",
    "\"Stage\" typically refers to a physical space or platform, which does not apply directly to the action the engineer is taking.",
    "\"Record sound\" is unrelated to the idea of presenting a product and would imply an entirely different activity.",
    "\"Parade\" suggests a public display or celebration, which is also not suitable in the context of a presentation to bosses.",
    "Lastly, \"conference\" refers to a meeting or gathering, which does not specify the action of presenting a product and is more about the event itself.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"demonstration\" is the only term that accurately describes what the engineer is doing with the new invention."
