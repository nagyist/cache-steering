  "query": "Question: What is something that the public can go to which involves a committee?\n\nChoices:\nA: business\nB: city council meeting\nC: temple\nD: office building\nE: boardroom",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what the question is asking. It wants to know of an event or location that involves a committee and is open to the public.",
    "Next, examining the choices: A business is typically a private entity and does not inherently involve a committee that the public can attend.",
    "Looking at option B, a city council meeting is a public gathering where a committee (the city council) makes decisions and discusses community issues. This aligns with the question's criteria.",
    "Now, considering option C, a temple may involve committees for its governance or decision-making but is not specifically focused on public meetings as part of a committee structure.",
    "For option D, an office building generally contains businesses or private offices and does not imply public attendance for committee activities.",
    "In option E, a boardroom might involve committees, but it is typically a private space not freely open to the public for attendance.",
    "Having analyzed all the options, the only choice that clearly involves a committee and allows for public attendance is the city council meeting.",
    "Since I have evaluated all the options thoroughly, I can confidently conclude that the answer is B."
