  "query": "Question: When going to sleep what noise does a human make?\n\nChoices:\nA: loss of consciousness\nB: relaxation\nC: snoring\nD: dreaming\nE: talking",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks specifically about a noise that a human makes when going to sleep.",
    "First, I will analyze the choices to see which ones involve noises.",
    "A: \"loss of consciousness\" does not refer to any sound but rather a state of being. It can be eliminated.",
    "B: \"relaxation\" describes a state of being or feeling, not a sound. It can also be eliminated.",
    "C: \"snoring\" is a sound that many people make when they sleep, and it can occur when someone goes to sleep.",
    "D: \"dreaming\" is a mental process that typically occurs during sleep, but it does not inherently involve making a noise.",
    "E: \"talking\" can occur in sleep (like sleep talking), but it's less common than snoring.",
    "Now, I will compare the likelihood of snoring and talking as noises made when going to sleep.",
    "Considering that snoring is quite common and frequently associated with sleep, it is a strong candidate.",
    "While sleep talking might also occur, it is not nearly as prevalent as snoring when it comes to sounds made during sleep."
