  "query": "Question: Where can I find a steakhouse with a view of corn fields?\n\nChoices:\nA: nebraska\nB: new york\nC: mexico\nD: home\nE: utah",
  "steps": [
    "To find a steakhouse with a view of corn fields, I need to consider which locations are known for corn production.",
    "Nebraska is a major agricultural state and is famous for its corn production, making it a likely candidate for steakhouses with views of corn fields.",
    "New York, while it has agricultural areas, is not particularly known for vast corn fields like the Midwest.",
    "Mexico typically has different types of agriculture and steakhouses, but corn fields are not as common as in the U.S.",
    "\"Home\" is a vague choice that could apply to anyone, but without specific context, it's not a solid option.",
    "Utah has some agricultural areas, but it is not known primarily for corn production like Nebraska.",
    "Since Nebraska is synonymous with corn fields and has many steakhouses, it stands out as the best answer.",
    "I should compare the viability of the other options before concluding.",
    "New York, Mexico, and Utah do not present strong evidence for a steakhouse with a view of corn fields compared to Nebraska.",
    "Thus, I conclude that Nebraska is the most appropriate choice for a steakhouse with a view of corn fields."
