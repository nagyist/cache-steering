  "query": "Question: What do people who are speech therapists do?\n\nChoices:\nA: make music\nB: believe in god\nC: give speeches\nD: complete sentences\nE: build houses",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify what a speech therapist is and their role in society. Speech therapists, also known as speech-language pathologists, are professionals who assess, diagnose, and treat speech and language disorders.",
    "Next, I evaluate the possible answers to see which one aligns with the responsibilities of speech therapists.",
    "Option A: \"make music\" does not relate to the primary functions of a speech therapist, as music creation is not within their typical job description.",
    "Option B: \"believe in god\" is a personal belief and does not pertain to the profession of speech therapy.",
    "Option C: \"give speeches\" implies a focus on public speaking which is not the main concern for speech therapists; they aim to improve communication, not just deliver speeches.",
    "Option D: \"complete sentences\" is more relevant since speech therapists often work on language development and correcting sentence structure in their clients. This directly relates to their role of aiding in communication.",
    "Option E: \"build houses\" is entirely unrelated to the work of speech therapists, who do not engage in construction or similar fields.",
    "Based on the analysis, option D aligns most closely with the duties of speech therapists, as they often assist their clients in developing the skills needed to complete sentences and communicate effectively."
