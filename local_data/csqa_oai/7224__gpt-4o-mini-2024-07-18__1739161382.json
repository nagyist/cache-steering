  "steps": [
    "First, consider what activities children typically engage in with cards.",
    "Playing games is a common activity associated with cards, such as Go Fish, Uno, or Poker.",
    "Evaluate the other options to determine if they are directly related to activities involving cards.",
    "Option A (play with toys) is not specific to cards and is more generalized.",
    "Option B (play ball) does not relate to cards at all and is a completely different activity.",
    "Option C (hear stories) does not correspond to any action typically associated with cards.",
    "Option E (do homework) is also not related to cards; homework usually involves writing or reading, not playing with cards.",
    "Since option D (play games) directly relates to the use of cards and is a common activity, it stands out as the most plausible choice."
