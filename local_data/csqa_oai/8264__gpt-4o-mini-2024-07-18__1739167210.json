  "query": "Question: Where is a good place for a person to put green beans?\n\nChoices:\nA: can\nB: plate\nC: mouth\nD: spoon\nE: farmer's market",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of each option in relation to green beans. A \"can\" is often used for storage or preservation of food, including vegetables like green beans.",
    "Next, evaluate a \"plate.\" A plate is typically used to serve food, making it a possible choice for green beans when they are ready to be eaten.",
    "Now, think about the \"mouth.\" The mouth is where food is consumed. Green beans, when cooked or prepared, can be eaten directly.",
    "The \"spoon\" is generally used as an eating utensil. It can hold food like green beans, but it's more about conveying food to the mouth rather than a place to put green beans directly.",
    "Lastly, the \"farmer's market\" is a location where green beans might be bought or sold, but it is not a place to physically put green beans for storage or consumption.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the best place to put green beans when considering their end use (eating them) is the mouth."
