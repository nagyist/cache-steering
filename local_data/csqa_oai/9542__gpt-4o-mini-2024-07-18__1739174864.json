  "query": "Question: When someone is not living anymore they?\n\nChoices:\nA: trying to stay happy\nB: seeing\nC: die\nD: experiencing\nE: expire",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking what happens when someone is not living anymore.",
    "The options provided include activities or states of being that relate to life and death.",
    "Option A (\"trying to stay happy\") implies a state of being that is associated with living, so it does not fit the context.",
    "Option B (\"seeing\") also implies the ability to perceive, which is associated with being alive, so it is not a suitable answer.",
    "Option C (\"die\") directly addresses the cessation of life, fitting well with the concept of not living anymore.",
    "Option D (\"experiencing\") similarly suggests the presence of life and perception, hence it is not aligned with the state of not living.",
    "Option E (\"expire\") is another term that means to come to an end, often used in the context of life; however, \"die\" is a more straightforward term when referring to the state of being not alive.",
    "Comparing options C (\"die\") and E (\"expire\"), \"die\" is a more commonly understood and used term when discussing the end of life.",
    "Therefore, \"die\" is the most appropriate choice for describing the state of no longer living."
