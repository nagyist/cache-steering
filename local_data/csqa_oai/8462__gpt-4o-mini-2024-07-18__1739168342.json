  "query": "Question: When a play starts in an auditorium, what tends to fade out?\n\nChoices:\nA: lights\nB: theater\nC: other people\nD: crowd\nE: high school",
  "steps": [
    "When a play starts in an auditorium, there is typically a change in the atmosphere as the performance is about to begin.",
    "In this context, the lights are often dimmed or turned off to focus attention on the stage and the performance.",
    "Fading out the lights creates an immersive environment for the audience and signals the start of the show.",
    "While other elements like the theater\u2019s general noise level or audience chatter might also decrease, the most common and visually significant action taken at the start of a play is to dim the lights.",
    "I will review the answer choices: \n- A: lights - aligns with the common practice of dimming.\n- B: theater - does not fade out; it remains the same.\n- C: other people - they may become quieter but don\u2019t fade out literally.\n- D: crowd - similar reasoning; they may quiet down, but not fade visually.\n- E: high school - not relevant to the context.",
    "Given this analysis, the most appropriate answer is that the lights tend to fade out when a play starts in an auditorium."
