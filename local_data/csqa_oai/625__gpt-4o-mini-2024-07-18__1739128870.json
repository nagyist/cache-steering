  "steps": [
    "The scenario states that there weren't enough chairs for everyone, indicating a situation where people need to sit together, typically during a gathering or assembly.",
    "Among the choices provided, the term 'meeting' implies a group of people coming together, and it is common for meetings to require seating arrangements for attendees.",
    "The other options (bookstore, building, office, and coffeehouse) do not directly imply a necessity for a group to need chairs simultaneously in the same way that a meeting would.",
    "Therefore, if there aren't enough chairs, it is likely that the meeting would need to be delayed or rescheduled until sufficient seating can be arranged.",
    "Assessing the other options: a bookstore, building, office, and coffeehouse could continue operating without requiring a specific meeting format, hence they would not be delayed in the same manner as a meeting.",
    "In summary, the most reasonable outcome given the lack of chairs is that the meeting would have to be delayed until there are enough chairs."
