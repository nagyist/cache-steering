  "query": "Question: The workers passed through the lobby, what building were they in?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera\nB: office building\nC: receptionist\nD: hotel\nE: business plan",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the workers passed through the lobby, which suggests the presence of a common area typically found in buildings that receive visitors.",
    "Options A (opera) and D (hotel) both commonly feature a lobby, but an opera house's lobby wouldn't typically involve workers passing through in a regular context.",
    "Option B (office building) is also a strong candidate since many office buildings have lobbies where employees and visitors enter and exit.",
    "Option C (receptionist) is not a building but a role, so it can be disregarded.",
    "Option E (business plan) is irrelevant as it refers to a document and not a physical space, so it can also be disregarded.",
    "Considering the nature of a lobby, both office buildings and hotels fit, but the mention of \"workers\" leans more towards an office building context, as it implies a workplace.",
    "Additionally, hotels typically cater to guests and visitors rather than workers in an employment sense.",
    "Therefore, the most logical answer, considering the context of where workers might pass through a lobby, is B (office building)."
