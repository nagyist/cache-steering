  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"the ancient longest wall\" refers to the Great Wall of China, which is renowned for its historical significance and length.",
    "Since the lizard lived at the base of this wall, it indicates a geographical location connected to the Great Wall.",
    "The Great Wall is located entirely within China, which means the lizard likely lived in China.",
    "Options A (forrest), B (desert), C (tropics), and E (garden) do not correspond to the known location of the Great Wall, as they refer to different types of environments that are not specifically tied to the wall.",
    "The only option that directly relates to the Great Wall of China is D.",
    "Thus, we can conclude that the correct answer, based on the information provided and common knowledge of geography, is that the lizard lived in China."
