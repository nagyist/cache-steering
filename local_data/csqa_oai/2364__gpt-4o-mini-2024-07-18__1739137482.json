  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about what structure utilizes wood framing as its essential support system or skeleton.",
    "Wood framing is commonly used in construction, particularly for structural support in various types of buildings.",
    "Option A: \"building\" is a broad category that certainly includes houses, offices, and other structures.",
    "Option B: \"closet\" refers to a smaller, specific interior space, which can be part of a building but does not encompass the broader context of wood framing.",
    "Option C: \"ship\" typically does not use wood framing in the context of skeletons as modern ships are constructed more with steel and fiberglass frameworks.",
    "Option D: \"foundation\" refers to the base structure that supports a building but is not what wood framing is the skeleton for.",
    "Option E: \"aircraft\" primarily utilizes materials like aluminum and carbon fiber for its structure, rather than traditional wood framing.",
    "Evaluating all options, \"building\" stands out as it is the most direct and appropriate choice since wood framing is indeed the skeleton for constructing buildings."
