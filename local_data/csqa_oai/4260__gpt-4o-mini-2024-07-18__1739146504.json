  "query": "Question: Where can you see a mountain in your own home?\n\nChoices:\nA: park\nB: switzerland\nC: pennsylvania\nD: picture\nE: canada",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It asks where you can see a mountain 'in your own home'.",
    "Next, I should analyze the options given to determine if they are locations that can be seen in a home environment.",
    "Option A: 'park' is an outdoor location and not something that can be seen from within a home.",
    "Option B: 'switzerland' is a country known for its mountains, but it cannot be seen in a home because it is too far away.",
    "Option C: 'pennsylvania' is also a state, and while it has mountains, visiting it would still not mean seeing them 'in your own home'.",
    "Option D: 'picture' is different, as you can have pictures of mountains hung up or displayed in your home.",
    "Option E: 'canada' like switzerland, is a country with mountains, but again, it is not visible from a home.",
    "Now, comparing all the options, 'picture' stands out as the only option that can literally be seen within your home.",
    "Therefore, the final answer must be option D, where you can see a mountain in the form of a picture."
