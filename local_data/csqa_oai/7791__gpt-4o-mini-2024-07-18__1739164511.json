  "steps": [
    "To determine what a portable light source is called, we must consider the definition of a portable light source. This means it should be something that can be easily moved and used to provide light.",
    "Next, let's look at the options provided: A) books, B) flashlight, C) house, D) falling down, E) hallway.",
    "We can evaluate each option. \"Books\" do not provide light and are not a source of illumination.",
    "The term \"flashlight\" is commonly used to refer to a handheld device that uses batteries to produce light. It meets the criteria of being portable and a light source.",
    "Now, looking at \"house,\" it is a structure that typically contains multiple light sources but is not portable by nature.",
    "Next, \"falling down\" does not correlate with a light source or anything portable.",
    "Finally, \"hallway\" is also a location that may have lights but is not a portable light source itself.",
    "The only option that clearly describes a portable light source is \"flashlight.\""
