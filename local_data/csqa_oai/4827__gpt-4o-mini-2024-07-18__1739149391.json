  "query": "Question: Where can you watch a performance like a symphony?\n\nChoices:\nA: movie\nB: theatre\nC: gymnasium\nD: circus\nE: concert hall",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a symphony performance typically involves and where it is usually held.",
    "A symphony is a musical composition often performed by an orchestra, which typically has specific venues designed for such performances.",
    "The most common place to watch a symphony is a concert hall, which is specifically built for musical performances and has the necessary acoustics.",
    "I should compare this venue with the options provided: movie, theatre, gymnasium, circus, and concert hall.",
    "A movie is for watching films, not live musical performances, so it is not a suitable choice.",
    "A theatre is primarily for plays and dramatic performances, although it may host musicals. However, it is not the ideal venue for a traditional symphony.",
    "A gymnasium is typically for sports and physical activities; it is not designed for symphony performances either.",
    "A circus features performances involving acrobatics and animal acts, which again do not include symphony orchestras.",
    "The only option left that directly correlates with a symphony performance is the concert hall, which matches the typical venue for listening to such music.",
    "Thus, the answer is clear as this is the only venue explicitly associated with symphonic performances."
