  "query": "Question: Where do you keep computer speakers?\n\nChoices:\nA: produce sounds\nB: roof\nC: conference\nD: desktop\nE: concert",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of computer speakers. They are designed to produce sound and enhance audio output from a computer.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided options. The choices must logically relate to where computer speakers can be kept.",
    "Look at option A: \"produce sounds.\" This describes the function of the speakers, not a physical location.",
    "Now, consider option B: \"roof.\" This is an unusual and impractical place to keep computer speakers, as speakers are not typically located on roofs.",
    "Examine option C: \"conference.\" While speakers might be used during conferences, it doesn't indicate a storage location for the speakers when they are not in use.",
    "Now, look at option D: \"desktop.\" This is a common and practical place where computer speakers can be kept, especially for personal or office computers.",
    "Finally, consider option E: \"concert.\" Similar to conference, while speakers are used at concerts, this does not denote a location for personal computer speakers.",
    "Based on the evaluation, the most logical and appropriate option for where you keep computer speakers is \"desktop.\""
