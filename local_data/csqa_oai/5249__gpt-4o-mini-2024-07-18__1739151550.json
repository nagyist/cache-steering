  "query": "Question: Neuroepithelium is found in a few places, you're using which one to read this text if you're human?\n\nChoices:\nA: glasses\nB: nasal cavity\nC: tastebud\nD: inner ear\nE: retina",
  "steps": [
    "Neuroepithelium is a specialized type of epithelium that has sensory functions.",
    "One of the main functions of neuroepithelium is to facilitate the detection of specific stimuli, such as taste, smell, and sound.",
    "The options provided include various anatomical locations where neuroepithelium is present. It is important to identify which one relates to reading text.",
    "Glasses (Option A) do not contain neuroepithelium; they are optical devices to correct vision.",
    "Nasal cavity (Option B) contains neuroepithelium related to the sense of smell, but is not directly involved in reading text.",
    "Tastebuds (Option C) have neuroepithelium that detects taste, which is not related to reading.",
    "Inner ear (Option D) contains neuroepithelium related to hearing and equilibrium, also not related to reading text.",
    "Retina (Option E) contains photoreceptor cells (a type of neuroepithelium) that are responsible for vision, which is directly related to seeing and reading.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the correct answer must be related to reading, which would involve visual processing, making the retina the most relevant structure."
