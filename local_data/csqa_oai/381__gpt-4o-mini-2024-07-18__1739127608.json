  "query": "Question: Where would you find people gathered near liquid in a workplace?\n\nChoices:\nA: water cooler\nB: opera\nC: hospital\nD: hockey game\nE: beach",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what is meant by \"liquid\" in a workplace context. In workplaces, the most common liquids are beverages, water, or liquids related to specific functions (like medical or athletic).",
    "Next, we assess the options one by one to see where liquid would be present in a typical workplace setting and where people might gather.",
    "Option A: Water cooler. This is a common spot in offices where employees gather to get drinking water and chat, so it fits the criteria well.",
    "Option B: Opera. While this involves people and possibly refreshments, it is not a workplace setting. Instead, it is a form of entertainment.",
    "Option C: Hospital. Hospitals do have many areas where liquids are present, but people generally do not gather in a social sense like they would at a water cooler.",
    "Option D: Hockey game. This setting involves people gathered, but it's not a workplace; it's more of a recreational event or entertainment venue.",
    "Option E: Beach. While people do gather near liquid (the ocean), this is not a workplace.",
    "Looking at the options again, the best fit for a workplace where people gather around liquid is the water cooler, as this is a specific area designed for this purpose in many office environments."
