  "steps": [
    "To determine where the electronics store benefited from customers walking from the food kiosks, I need to think about common locations where both stores and food kiosks exist together.",
    "Electronics stores often are located in places with high foot traffic, such as malls or shopping centers, rather than in isolated areas.",
    "A strip mall typically has a variety of stores and might have food kiosks, but the term \"kiosks\" often implies smaller, movable food vendors, which are more common in larger shopping areas.",
    "I know that food kiosks are frequently found in shopping malls, where people shop and eat. This proximity can naturally lead customers to an electronics store.",
    "The term \"building\" is too vague and does not specifically indicate a shopping setting.",
    "A zoo might have food kiosks but is less likely to have an electronics store directly benefiting from zoo visitors.",
    "Buying batteries (choice B) does not describe a location; it is a specific product choice.",
    "Given that the options A, B, C, and D do not logically connect food kiosks with an electronics store, \u201cshopping mall\u201d is the only choice that illustrates a location where both are likely to exist together.",
    "Therefore, the best answer that shows where the electronics store benefited from foot traffic originating from food kiosks would be E: shopping mall."
