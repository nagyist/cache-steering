  "query": "Question: His friend insisted that he must, but his conscience stopped him as he knew that he what?\n\nChoices:\nA: unnecessary\nB: optional\nC: will not\nD: need not\nE: should not",
  "steps": [
    "The sentence indicates a conflict between what his friend insisted and what his conscience told him.",
    "The phrase \"must\" from the friend's insistence suggests a strong obligation or necessity.",
    "The use of \"stopped him\" indicates a feeling of hesitation or reluctance due to an inner moral compass or conscience.",
    "The word \"knew\" implies that he has a clear understanding of his own moral stance in this situation.",
    "Considering the choices, we need to identify which option reflects a moral decision that aligns with the idea of his conscience guiding him against his friend's urging.",
    "Option A \"unnecessary\" does not fit well because it doesn't directly relate to a moral decision or obligation.",
    "Option B \"optional\" also doesn't resonate with the idea of a moral conflict, as it suggests no obligation.",
    "Option C \"will not\" conveys a future tense decision, but it lacks the moral implication of what he perceives his conscience is telling him.",
    "Option D \"need not\" suggests a lack of obligation but is less forceful than what could be indicated by \"should not.\"",
    "Option E \"should not\" directly implies a moral reasoning and fits well with \"his conscience stopped him,\" suggesting he feels he has a moral reason to refrain from acting on his friend's insistence."
