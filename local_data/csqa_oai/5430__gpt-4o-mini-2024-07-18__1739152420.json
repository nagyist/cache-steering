  "query": "Question: The weasel was sifting through garbage, where did it look for it?\n\nChoices:\nA: chicken coop\nB: law office\nC: dog house\nD: hollow log\nE: backyards",
  "steps": [
    "The weasel is known to be a scavenger, often looking for food in areas where it might find scraps or leftovers.",
    "Garbage typically contains food remnants, so it would be logical for the weasel to be looking for something to eat.",
    "Now, I need to evaluate each of the choices to determine where a weasel would most likely find food.",
    "A chicken coop could be a possibility, as it might attract other animals or have food spills.",
    "A law office is an unlikely place for a weasel to find food, as it is not a typical location for food scraps.",
    "A dog house might have some leftover dog food or scraps, so it could be a reasonable choice.",
    "A hollow log is another natural place where a weasel might forage for insects or other small animals, but it wouldn't necessarily have food remnants typical of garbage.",
    "Backyards often have garbage bins or food spills from outdoor activities, making it a very plausible choice for a scavenging weasel.",
    "Among the options, backyards (E) appear most fitting due to the availability of garbage and food remnants, followed by the dog house (C).",
    "After carefully considering all the options, \"E: backyards\" seems the most probable location for the weasel looking for food in garbage."
