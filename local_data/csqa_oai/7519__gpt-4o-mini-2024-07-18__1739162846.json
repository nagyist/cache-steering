  "query": "Question: Which state still has wild bald eagles?\n\nChoices:\nA: canada\nB: cliff\nC: mountains\nD: captivity\nE: utah",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to consider the natural habitat of bald eagles. Bald eagles prefer areas near large bodies of open water with abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.",
    "Next, we should look at the choices given: A (Canada), B (cliff), C (mountains), D (captivity), and E (Utah).",
    "Canada is known for having a vast wilderness and numerous lakes, making it a prime habitat for wild bald eagles.",
    "Cliffs may provide perching opportunities, but they are not an adequate representation of a habitat where wild bald eagles can thrive, as they need access to water and food.",
    "Mountains can be suitable habitats if they are near water, but they do not guarantee the presence of wild bald eagles.",
    "Captivity indicates that the eagles are not living in the wild, so this choice does not apply to the question of where wild bald eagles exist.",
    "Now, considering Utah, it is a state that has suitable habitats for bald eagles, especially around its lakes and rivers.",
    "Comparing Canada and Utah, both are viable options, but the question specifies that we are looking for a state. Canada is a country, not a state.",
    "Therefore, out of the choices provided, Utah is the only valid answer that denotes a location known for wild bald eagles."
