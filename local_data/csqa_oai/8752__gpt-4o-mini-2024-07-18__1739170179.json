  "query": "Question: What east coast city is known for their pizzerias?\n\nChoices:\nA: capital cities\nB: mall\nC: populated area\nD: new york\nE: chicago",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which of the given choices is an east coast city.",
    "New York is a city located on the east coast of the United States.",
    "Chicago, while known for its pizza, is located in the Midwest and not on the east coast.",
    "The options \"capital cities\" and \"mall\" do not refer to specific cities, which are necessary to answer the question.",
    "I'm looking for the city particularly known for its pizzerias in the context of the choices given, and New York is famously known for its pizza.",
    "I re-evaluate the remaining options: \"populated area\" is also too broad and not specific to any city.",
    "Thus, the only specific city that fits the description as an east coast city known for pizzerias is New York.",
    "I conclude that the best answer aligning with the east coast and known for its pizzerias is New York City."
