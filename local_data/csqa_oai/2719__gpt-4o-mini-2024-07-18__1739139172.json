  "query": "Question: Jane goes out the door to find outside a bright object, what is she looking for?\n\nChoices:\nA: moon\nB: ground\nC: sun\nD: nature\nE: sky",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what a \"bright object\" might refer to in a general outdoor context.",
    "The options provided include the moon, ground, sun, nature, and sky. Among these, the moon and sun are celestial bodies that can appear bright in the sky.",
    "The ground typically does not emit light and nature is more of a concept than a specific bright object, so they can likely be eliminated as possibilities.",
    "The sky itself, while it can appear bright due to the sun or other luminous objects, is not a singular bright object.",
    "Comparing the moon and the sun, the sun is known to be extremely bright and is often the main source of brightness during the day.",
    "The moon, while it can reflect sunlight and appear bright at night, would not be something Jane would find outside during daytime.",
    "Given that Jane goes out the door, it is plausible that she is going outside during the day, further supporting that she is looking for the sun.",
    "The remaining most logical conclusion is that she is looking for the sun, as it is the primary bright object in the sky during the day."
