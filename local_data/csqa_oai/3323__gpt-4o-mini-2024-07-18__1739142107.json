  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a person who has an expensive writing instrument and wants to ensure its safety.",
    "Given the options, we need to consider where he would logically store an expensive item to prevent loss.",
    "Option A, \"writer's hand,\" suggests that he would carry the instrument with him, but this increases the risk of losing it.",
    "Option B, \"desk drawer,\" implies a secure place within the office environment, providing protection from loss.",
    "Option C, \"pawn shop,\" is unlikely because it suggests he would sell the item, which contradicts his desire to keep it safe.",
    "Option D, \"pocket,\" also suggests carrying it, similar to Option A, which increases the chance of misplacing it.",
    "Option E, \"classroom,\" doesn't fit the context of keeping it safe in an office environment.",
    "Considering all options, the most logical choice for securely storing a writing instrument in an office setting is a desk drawer."
