  "steps": [
    "The individual has been jobless for 6 months, indicating a prolonged search for employment which is often a stressful experience.",
    "After a long period of unemployment, receiving an interview can instigate a mix of emotions, including hope, anxiety, and stress.",
    "Nausea (A) is often associated with physical symptoms of anxiety rather than a direct emotional response to job searching or interviews.",
    "Rejection (B) is more of a feeling that comes after applying and not receiving any callbacks or after the interview if it doesn't go well, not generally before or during an interview.",
    "Feeling the effects of hard work (C) can occur after actively seeking out jobs, but it doesn't specifically relate to the interview scenario itself.",
    "Frustration (D) can arise from being jobless, especially after such a long duration, but the interview can instill a sense of hope, reducing frustration momentarily.",
    "Stress (E) is a common emotional response to the job application process, particularly after being unemployed for an extended time, as the pressure mounts to secure a position.",
    "Given that he has finally received an interview, the stress of the situation would be palpable during this critical time, especially when considering the implications it has for his circumstances.",
    "After analyzing the emotions involved with joblessness and the apprehensions linked to job interviewing, stress stands out as the most relevant feeling he likely experiences."
