  "query": "Question: In architecture, where are all buildings found?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: inside\nC: all buildings\nD: restaurant\nE: synagogue",
  "steps": [
    "I will evaluate the options provided to find a location where all buildings can be logically found.",
    "Option A, \"table,\" is not a location where buildings can be found; buildings are generally much larger than a table.",
    "Option B, \"inside,\" suggests a location but is too vague and does not specifically address where all buildings are found.",
    "Option C, \"all buildings,\" seems to imply that buildings exist within their own category, suggesting that the answer may be tautological.",
    "Option D, \"restaurant,\" is a specific type of building and does not encompass all buildings in general.",
    "Option E, \"synagogue,\" similarly refers to a specific type of building and thus does not represent where all buildings are found.",
    "Given the reasoning, the answer that best fits the question of where buildings are found is option C, as it reflects the inclusive aspect of the category of buildings themselves."
