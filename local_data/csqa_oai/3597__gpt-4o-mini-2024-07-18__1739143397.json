  "query": "Question: Where is the best place to keep personal lettuce?\n\nChoices:\nA: supermarket\nB: farmer's market\nC: pantry\nD: refrigerator\nE: salad",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the nature of lettuce. Lettuce is a leafy green vegetable that wilt and spoil quickly if not stored properly.",
    "Next, we should think about the conditions that are ideal for keeping lettuce fresh. Lettuce requires cool and moist conditions to maintain its crispness and nutrients.",
    "Considering the choices given, a supermarket typically sells fresh produce but is not a storage place for personal lettuce.",
    "Similarly, a farmer's market is a selling place for fresh produce but not intended for storage either.",
    "The pantry is generally a dry and room temperature area, which is not suitable for storing most vegetables, especially lettuce, as it can lead to wilting and spoilage.",
    "On the other hand, a refrigerator is designed to keep food fresh for an extended period by providing cold temperatures, which are perfect for storing vegetables like lettuce.",
    "Finally, the option \"salad\" refers to a dish made from lettuce and other ingredients, not a storage solution. Hence, it is not a viable option for keeping personal lettuce."
