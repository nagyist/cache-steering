  "steps": [
    "To determine where a basement is likely to be small, we need to analyze the characteristics of each choice in relation to the typical construction and design norms for basements.",
    "Churches generally have large congregations and may require larger spaces, which would likely mean a larger basement to accommodate various activities and storage needs.",
    "A closet is a small space designed for storage, often found within rooms. It typically does not have a basement, as basements are larger areas below a structure, not small storage spaces within.",
    "In a typical own house, especially smaller houses or townhouses, basements can be smaller, particularly if the house has a smaller footprint. Many homes have basements that are just practical for storage rather than large.",
    "Office buildings can range in size but often have larger basements for facilities such as storage, mechanical systems, or parking. Therefore, they are less likely to have small basements.",
    "Art galleries tend to be designed with space for displaying artwork and may have larger basements for storage or maintenance, which likely makes their basements larger rather than smaller.",
    "The comparison shows that while churches, office buildings, and art galleries may have larger basements due to their needs, a typical house may have smaller basements due to the size of the structure.",
    "The closet, while small, does not really qualify for \"basement\" space, as it is not the same type of area.",
    "Considering all options, the own house stands out as the most likely place to have a smaller basement compared to others."
