  "query": "Question: Something that holds food or other items is called what?\n\nChoices:\nA: container\nB: kitchen\nC: backpack\nD: jar\nE: bowl",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for something that holds food or other items.",
    "A \"container\" is a general term for anything that can hold items or substances.",
    "A \"kitchen\" refers to a room where cooking takes place, so it does not directly hold items.",
    "A \"backpack\" is primarily for carrying items but is not specifically designed for food.",
    "A \"jar\" is a type of container typically used to hold food items, such as preserves or spices.",
    "A \"bowl\" is also a container that specifically holds food, such as soup or salad.",
    "Among the options, both \"jar\" and \"bowl\" are specific types of containers used for holding food, whereas \"container\" is a broader term.",
    "Since the question is looking for something that holds food or items, \"container\" is the most encompassing answer that fits both food and other items.",
    "While \"jar\" and \"bowl\" are valid, they are more specific types of containers. The answer should prioritize the most general term that holds food or items."
