  "query": "Question: What do people make with crab?\n\nChoices:\nA: delicious meal\nB: chinese market\nC: fish market\nD: aquarium\nE: tidal flats",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what crabs are commonly used for. They are a type of seafood consumed in many cultures around the world.",
    "Next, analyze the choices given. Choice A mentions a \"delicious meal,\" which suggests a culinary use for crabs.",
    "Then, examine choice B, \"Chinese market.\" While crabs may be sold at such markets, this does not directly align with what people make with crabs.",
    "Now, consider choice C, \"fish market.\" This also suggests a place where crabs can be found but does not indicate making anything with them.",
    "Moving on to choice D, \"aquarium.\" While crabs may be kept in aquariums, they are not made into anything there.",
    "Finally, look at choice E, \"tidal flats.\" This refers to a habitat where crabs may be found but does not relate to what people make with crabs.",
    "After reviewing all the options, it's clear that the most fitting answer based on the context provided is choice A, as crabs are primarily made into meals (e.g., crab cakes, crab boil)."
