  "steps": [
    "The question refers to a school dress code that is strict for girls, which implies that there are specific clothing requirements in place.",
    "The provided choices include a variety of clothing options: pants, trousers, pant, long skirt, and naked.",
    "First, let's consider choices A (pants) and B (trousers). In many contexts, these terms are often used interchangeably, so either could align with a strict dress code.",
    "Next, choice C (pant) is typically not used in the plural demarcation of pants; it is usually referred to as pants or trousers.",
    "Now, let's evaluate choice D (long skirt). A long skirt could fit within a strict dress code as it provides coverage while still being appropriate for a school setting.",
    "Choice E (naked) is clearly not a viable option for a school dress code, as it goes against the basic standards of dressing.",
    "Considering the implications of \"strict\" in the dress code, it suggests that the clothing options are not just casual wear. Therefore, a long skirt (D) or pants (A) seem more aligned with the expectations.",
    "Based on the traditional dress codes in schools, long skirts are often specifically mentioned as acceptable attire, especially in stricter environments.",
    "Since \"pant\" is grammatically incorrect in the context and both \"pants\" and \"long skirt\" are plausible, I'll weigh their likelihood against typical dress code rules.",
    "Ultimately, the presence of \"long skirt\" in the options signifies a specific expectation that tends to be more prevalent in strict dress codes compared to the generic term \"pants.\""
