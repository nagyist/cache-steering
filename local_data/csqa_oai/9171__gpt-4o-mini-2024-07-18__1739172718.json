  "query": "Question: Where would bacteria be contained?\n\nChoices:\nA: finger\nB: ground\nC: septic tank\nD: mouth\nE: petri dish",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what bacteria are. Bacteria are microscopic organisms that can be found in a variety of environments.",
    "Next, we can think about the environments listed in the options and whether they are suitable for bacteria to thrive in or be contained.",
    "Option A: \"finger\" - while bacteria can be present on the skin of fingers, it is not a suitable place for them to be contained in a controlled manner.",
    "Option B: \"ground\" - various types of bacteria naturally exist in soil, but similar to option A, it is not a specific containment.",
    "Option C: \"septic tank\" - this is a designed environment specifically for the containment and treatment of waste, where bacteria play a crucial role in breaking down solid waste.",
    "Option D: \"mouth\" - bacteria do exist in the mouth, but it is not a containment in the same sense as a septic tank would be, and it's not a controlled environment.",
    "Option E: \"petri dish\" - bacteria can be cultured in a petri dish, which is a controlled environment used in laboratories to study them.",
    "Considering all the options, both the septic tank and the petri dish are controlled environments for bacteria. However, the septic tank is more specifically designed for containing bacteria as part of its function.",
    "Now, let's evaluate our conclusion. Since we want a location specifically where bacteria are not only present but contained as part of a system, the septic tank is the best choice."
