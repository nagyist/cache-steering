  "steps": [
    "The statement describes a golfer who maintained a calm exterior while finishing his shots, indicating he was composed on the outside.",
    "However, the statement implies that internally, he experienced a different state of being, suggesting a contrast between outward calmness and inner feelings.",
    "The golfer knew he had won, which typically evokes strong positive emotions such as joy and exhilaration, rather than negative feelings.",
    "Among the provided choices, \"excited\" matches the implication of a positive emotional state about winning, as it conveys enthusiasm and happiness.",
    "Other options like \"wild,\" \"frenzied,\" \"frantic,\" and \"agitated\" suggest negative or chaotic feelings, which do not align with the context of winning.",
    "Since the golfer finished his shots calmly but felt something intense inside due to the win, \"excited\" is the most appropriate choice to describe this internal state."
