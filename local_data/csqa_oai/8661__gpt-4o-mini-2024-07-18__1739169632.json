  "steps": [
    "An amphitheater is a large, open-air venue used for performances and events. This structure is typically designed to accommodate large audiences.",
    "The name \"amphitheater\" is derived from Greek and Latin origins, indicating its historical use in ancient cultures, particularly for theatrical performances and public spectacles.",
    "Given its traditional design, an amphitheater often features a circular or oval shape with tiered seating, which allows for better visibility for the audience.",
    "The open-air aspect of many amphitheaters suggests that they are usually constructed outdoors, an important distinguishing feature from traditional indoor theaters.",
    "Analyzing the options provided, choices such as \"inside\" (A) and \"park\" (E) imply a specific location, while \"Greece\" (B) specifically refers to a geographical region rather than the environmental characteristic.",
    "The choice \"experiencing performance art\" (C) describes the activity that occurs within an amphitheater but does not specifically indicate the environmental context.",
    "The most relevant choice regarding the environment in which an amphitheater typically exists is \"outside\" (D), since amphitheaters are predominantly found outdoors.",
    "While \"experiencing performance art\" could theoretically happen in an amphitheater, it isn't directly describing the environment itself.",
    "Therefore, the best choice that accurately describes the environment of an amphitheater is \"outside\" (D) rather than the other options which don't convey this aspect clearly."
