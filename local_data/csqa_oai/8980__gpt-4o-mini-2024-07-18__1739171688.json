  "query": "Question: What do people do when they feel a lot of excitement?\n\nChoices:\nA: eat\nB: go somewhere\nC: dance\nD: express information\nE: play hockey",
  "steps": [
    "When people feel excitement, they often seek physical outlets for that energy.",
    "Dancing is a common way for people to express their excitement through movement and rhythm.",
    "Option A (eat) is less likely as eating typically doesn't convey excitement.",
    "Option B (go somewhere) could be a possibility, but it depends on the context of the excitement.",
    "Option D (express information) is vague and doesn\u2019t specifically point to a strong action related to excitement.",
    "Option E (play hockey) might only apply to specific contexts (like an event) and is not a general way to express excitement.",
    "Therefore, out of all the options, dancing (C) stands out as the most direct and universally recognized expression of excitement."
