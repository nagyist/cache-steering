  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which option directly relates to playing music.",
    "Option A, \"opera,\" involves music but is primarily a form of theatrical performance rather than a medium exclusively for playing music.",
    "Option B, \"movie,\" usually involves a combination of visual and auditory elements but is not specifically designed for music.",
    "Option C, \"theatre,\" is similar to opera in that it involves performances but does not have an exclusive role in playing music.",
    "Option D, \"elevator,\" is not related to music at all; it is a mode of transport.",
    "Option E, \"cassettes,\" directly refers to a medium that plays recorded music.",
    "Since I am looking for something specifically used for playing music, \"cassettes\" clearly fits as they are designed for storing and playing back music recordings.",
    "The other options do not serve the primary purpose of playing music, while cassettes do."
