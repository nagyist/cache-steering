  "steps": [
    "The question states that Mary was singing because she wasn't happy.",
    "Since she wasn't happy, it indicates she might be expressing her emotions through singing.",
    "Typically, when people sing to cope with negative emotions, they might be trying to improve their mood or change how they feel.",
    "The options given provide different contexts for her action of singing amidst her unhappiness.",
    "Options A (being heard) and D (change in mood) relate to emotional expressions in singing but need to be evaluated further.",
    "Option B (sore throats) and C (hoarse voice) suggest physical reasons for singing, which don't relate to her emotional state.",
    "D (change in mood) directly relates to her intention of singing while feeling unhappy.",
    "Comparing D (change in mood) with A (being heard), it's more plausible that her singing serves as a means to improve her emotional state rather than merely seeking attention.",
    "Given that she is unhappy, it follows she would seek a change in her mood rather than simply being heard or addressing a physical ailment.",
    "Thus, the best reasoning leads us to conclude that Mary was singing to change her mood."
