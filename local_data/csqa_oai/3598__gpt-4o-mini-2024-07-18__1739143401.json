  "query": "Question: Where would sunshine be likely to fall on a plant that a person owns?\n\nChoices:\nA: street\nB: windowsill\nC: disneyland\nD: grow lights\nE: summer",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the locations mentioned in the choices where sunlight is often present.",
    "The \"street\" may have sunlight but it is not a location where a plant is typically kept.",
    "The \"windowsill\" is often used by people to place their plants as it receives sunlight from the window.",
    "\"Disneyland\" is a theme park and although it has outdoor areas, it is not a common place where a person would own a plant.",
    "\"Grow lights\" are artificial lights used to simulate sunlight for plant growth, but they do not represent a natural location where sunlight would fall.",
    "\"Summer\" refers to a season but does not specify a location where a plant would reside or receive sunlight.",
    "Based on my analysis, the most logical choice for where sunshine is likely to fall on a plant that a person owns is the \"windowsill\"."
