  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what having lunch too many times might mean. This likely refers to overeating during lunch periods.",
    "Next, I think about the consequences of overeating. One major health consequence is weight gain.",
    "Weight gain can contribute to obesity, which is a significant health issue in many societies.",
    "Now, let's review the given options. A: \"you die\" is an extreme outcome and unlikely to be a direct result of merely having lunch too many times.",
    "Option B: \"obesity\" is a probable outcome of consistently overeating at lunch. This aligns with my earlier thought.",
    "Option C: \"feeling satisfied\" and D: \"feel full\" seem more temporary feelings rather than long-term consequences.",
    "Option E: \"digestion\" can be affected by overeating, but it is not a direct result like obesity is.",
