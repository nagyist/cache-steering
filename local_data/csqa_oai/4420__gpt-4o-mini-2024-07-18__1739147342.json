  "query": "Question: Suzie waited in a room covered with posters of celeberties and robots.  She liked this place, but she wished it was better decorated.  Where might she be?\n\nChoices:\nA: white house\nB: school\nC: friend's house\nD: museum\nE: apartment",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions that Suzie is in a room decorated with posters of celebrities and robots. This suggests a personal or informal setting rather than a formal one.",
    "Considering the options, the White House (A) is unlikely as it typically maintains a formal decor with historical significance rather than posters.",
    "A school (B) usually has educational decor, not personal posters, so it's also unlikely that Suzie is in a school.",
    "A museum (D) would have displays and exhibits, not personal decoration like posters of celebrities or robots.",
    "An apartment (E) could reasonably have such decorations, assuming it's someone\u2019s personal space with their choice of decor.",
    "This leaves the friend's house (C) as another potential choice. Friends often have casual spaces with personal decoration, including posters.",
    "Comparing the friend\u2019s house and apartment possibilities, both could be valid, but \u201cfriend's house\u201d implies a social or casual environment which aligns well with Suzie's context of enjoying the space but wishing for more decoration.",
    "However, the apartment option (E) is quite generic while the friend's house (C) is specific to a personal connection, which is often associated with poster decorations.",
    "Thus, the most fitting answer is where Suzie might be having posters that can reflect personal interests, making the friend's house the strong leading candidate."
