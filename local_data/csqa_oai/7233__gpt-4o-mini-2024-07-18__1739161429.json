  "query": "Question: Where might a snake drop from?\n\nChoices:\nA: tree\nB: pet shops\nC: feild\nD: tropical forest\nE: cage",
  "steps": [
    "Consider where snakes typically inhabit. They are often found in trees, in the wild, and in controlled environments like cages.",
    "Analyze the choices provided. \"Tree\" is a natural habitat for some snakes that are arboreal.",
    "\"Pet shops\" do not represent a natural environment; snakes do not drop from pet shops, as they are usually contained.",
    "\"Field\" could refer to a grassy area where snakes might be found, but it's less likely for a snake to drop from this location.",
    "\"Tropical forest\" is a habitat where many snakes live and could potentially fall from trees in that environment.",
    "\"Cage\" would refer to a controlled space where snakes could be held, but it wouldn't be somewhere they would \"drop from\" in a natural sense.",
    "\"Tree\" and \"tropical forest\" both suggest natural spaces where snakes could drop from, but \"tree\" is more specific and relevant to dropping.",
    "Based on the analysis, \"tree\" is a highly likely place for a snake to drop from, as they can fall from their arboreal habitats.",
    "Comparing \"tree\" and \"tropical forest,\" while both are valid, \"tree\" is more direct."
