  "query": "Question: The police had been stumped for years, the grieving family hired a private investigator in a hope to what?\n\nChoices:\nA: notice physical evidence\nB: arrest criminal\nC: gather evidence\nD: discover truth\nE: gathering facts",
  "steps": [
    "The police had been struggling to solve the case for years, which implies a significant lack of progress or closure in the investigation.",
    "The grieving family, feeling helpless and frustrated, decided to take action by hiring a private investigator. This indicates they are looking for a solution that the police have not been able to provide.",
    "The context suggests that the family's motivation behind hiring a private investigator is likely linked to uncovering information or insights that could lead to an understanding of what happened to their loved one.",
    "Options that reflect the idea of uncovering, understanding, or revealing something about the case should be prioritized.",
    "Considering the options: \n- A (notice physical evidence) suggests a very narrow focus.\n- B (arrest criminal) assumes the investigator would have the authority to arrest, which typically is not the case.\n- C (gather evidence) is still about collecting information but not necessarily the truth per se.\n- D (discover truth) directly aligns with the family's grief and desire for resolution.\n- E (gathering facts) is similar but about facts rather than deeper truths.",
    "The term \u201ctruth\u201d in option D suggests a deeper resolution and understanding of resolved questions surrounding the case\u2014something a grieving family would deeply desire.",
    "Reflecting upon these interpretations, \"discover truth\" (D) encapsulates the hope and urgency behind hiring a private investigator the most compellingly."
