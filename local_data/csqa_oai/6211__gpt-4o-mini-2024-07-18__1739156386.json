  "query": "Question: Sally was watching from near the orchestra pit as the players came on stage.  What sort of building is she in?\n\nChoices:\nA: opera house\nB: butt\nC: auditorium\nD: music hall\nE: theatre",
  "steps": [
    "The mention of Sally watching from near the orchestra pit indicates that there is a performance happening, which suggests a venue designed for live performances.",
    "Orchestra pits are typically found in venues for musical or theatrical performances where live music accompanies the acting or singing.",
    "Now, I can consider the options provided. An \"opera house\" specifically hosts operatic performances, often involving orchestras and singers.",
    "A \"butt\" does not fit as it is not a type of building associated with performances.",
    "An \"auditorium\" is a general term for a large room or building designed for an audience to gather, but it does not specifically convey the type of performance or context.",
    "A \"music hall\" is a venue specifically for music performances and could also fit, but it generally doesn\u2019t specifically refer to theatrical performances.",
    "A \"theatre,\" however, encompasses venues for a variety of performances, including plays and musicals, and typically has an orchestra pit.",
    "Considering all the options, while both the \"opera house\" and \"theatre\" could potentially fit, the context suggests a dramatic performance rather than strictly operatic.",
    "Thus, the most suitable choice given the context of Sally watching from near the orchestra pit is likely \"theatre,\" as it combines both music and theatrical performance features."
