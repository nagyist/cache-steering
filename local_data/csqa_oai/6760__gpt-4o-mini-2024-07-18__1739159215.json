  "query": "Question: When is an electric storm likely to occur?\n\nChoices:\nA: summer\nB: weather report\nC: america\nD: hot\nE: tropics",
  "steps": [
    "I will first consider the conditions generally associated with electric storms, which often include warm, humid air and atmospheric instability.",
    "Next, I will analyze each of the choices to see which aligns best with these conditions.",
    "Choice A, summer, is known to produce hot and humid weather, which can create conditions conducive to electric storms. Thus, this choice is plausible.",
    "Choice B, weather report, does not fit as a condition or season but rather a way of anticipating storms. Therefore, this choice is less relevant.",
    "Choice C, America, is a geographical location. While electric storms can occur in America, it does not directly indicate when they would be likely to occur, making this choice less applicable.",
    "Choice D, hot, refers to temperature but is too vague to determine a specific time for electric storms without additional context like humidity.",
    "Choice E, tropics, is known for high humidity and warm temperatures, which are ideal for electric storms. This choice is very relevant but somewhat more specific than summer.",
    "I will compare the strength of the choices: summer and tropics are both strong contenders. However, summer applies more widely across different regions, not just the tropics.",
    "I decide that summer would likely be the broader answer since electric storms can occur during summer seasons in various regions worldwide."
