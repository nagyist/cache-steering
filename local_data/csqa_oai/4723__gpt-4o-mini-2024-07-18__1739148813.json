  "query": "Question: The man was sick of secular consumerism, what life did he seek instead?\n\nChoices:\nA: eternal\nB: married life\nC: religious\nD: monastic\nE: unpredictable",
  "steps": [
    "The phrase \"sick of secular consumerism\" indicates a desire to move away from materialistic and worldly interests.",
    "The term \"secular\" refers to a non-religious, worldly lifestyle, suggesting that he seeks something spiritually fulfilling.",
    "Options related to spirituality or a deeper meaning of life should be prioritized, particularly those that denote a rejection of mundane materialism.",
    "\"Religious\" (C) encompasses a broad range of spiritual beliefs and practices, which might appeal to someone disillusioned by consumer culture.",
    "\"Monastic\" (D) specifically refers to a lifestyle focused on spiritual practices, often solitary or in a community dedicated to asceticism and away from worldly distractions.",
    "Both \"religious\" and \"monastic\" options are viable, but \"monastic\" implies a stricter adherence to renouncing worldly life.",
    "Considering the context, he is likely seeking a complete rejection of secular values, which aligns closely with monastic life as opposed to simply being \"religious.\"",
    "Therefore, the most suitable answer should reflect the most extreme form of rejecting consumerism, which is often represented by a monastic lifestyle.",
    "I will compare the terms \"religious\" and \"monastic\" again to confirm: \"monastic\" directly leads to a life dedicated to spiritual goals, whereas \"religious\" could be more general and not necessarily imply a departure from worldly life."
