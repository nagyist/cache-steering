  "query": "Question: Where is a snake unlikely to be welcome?\n\nChoices:\nA: hollow log\nB: arid climate\nC: petting zoo\nD: ocean\nE: tropical forest",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the environments provided in the answer choices to determine where snakes are commonly found and where they might not be welcome.",
    "Choice A, \"hollow log,\" is a common habitat for snakes. They can easily hide and nest there, so a snake is likely to be welcome in this setting.",
    "Choice B, \"arid climate,\" refers to dry environments where some snakes thrive, such as deserts. While snakes can live here, they are not necessarily unwelcome, but their presence is expected.",
    "Choice C, \"petting zoo,\" is aimed at children and family-friendly interactions with animals. Snakes are typically not standard petting zoo animals, as they can be perceived as dangerous or unappealing to many visitors.",
    "Choice D, \"ocean,\" is a habitat limited to sea snakes, which do live in the ocean. Still, the general presence of a snake in an ocean setting is unusual compared to other natural habitats, but it doesn\u2019t imply unwelcomeness.",
    "Choice E, \"tropical forest,\" is another common habitat for many species of snakes. This setting is rich in biodiversity and is a typical environment for snakes to be found, suggesting they would be welcome.",
    "Based on the analysis, it seems that in a petting zoo (Choice C), snakes are least likely to be welcomed due to the nature of such environments focusing on more domesticated or familiar animals."
