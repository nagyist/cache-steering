  "query": "Question: Where can you find many a squirrel outside of the city?\n\nChoices:\nA: forest\nB: yard\nC: street\nD: park\nE: desert",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the habitat where squirrels are commonly found. Squirrels are generally associated with areas that provide enough food and shelter.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option A, \"forest,\" is a natural environment where squirrels thrive due to the availability of trees, nuts, and fruits.",
    "Option B, \"yard,\" can also have squirrels, especially in residential areas, but it is not as expansive as a forest.",
    "Option C, \"street,\" is less suitable for squirrels because it is an urban setting with vehicles and fewer trees.",
    "Option D, \"park,\" could be a possible location, as parks often have trees and greenery that attract squirrels.",
    "Option E, \"desert,\" is not suitable for squirrels since it lacks the necessary resources for them to survive.",
    "Now, comparing the remaining viable options (A: forest, B: yard, D: park), the forest is the most natural habitat for squirrels as it typically contains a larger ecosystem supporting them.",
    "While both yards and parks can have squirrels, forests provide the best conditions and highest likelihood of many squirrels being present outside of urban areas."
