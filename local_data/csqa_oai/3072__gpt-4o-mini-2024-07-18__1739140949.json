  "query": "Question: Where could I eat a chocolate cake?\n\nChoices:\nA: mouth\nB: restaurant\nC: supermarket\nD: school\nE: box",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the context of eating a chocolate cake, which typically involves a setting where food is consumed.",
    "Next, we evaluate the choices provided to determine viable options for eating a chocolate cake.",
    "Choice A, \"mouth,\" is where the cake would eventually end up, but it is not a location for obtaining or consuming cake in the traditional sense.",
    "Choice B, \"restaurant,\" is a place where food, including chocolate cake, is prepared and served to customers, making it a strong candidate.",
    "Choice C, \"supermarket,\" sells food and may have chocolate cake available for purchase; however, it is not a conventional eating location.",
    "Choice D, \"school,\" may serve chocolate cake during certain events or in cafeterias, but it is not specifically known for this purpose.",
    "Choice E, \"box,\" could refer to a storage container for the cake but does not serve as a place to eat the cake.",
    "Considering the above evaluations, the most suitable choice for a location explicitly intended for eating chocolate cake is the restaurant."
