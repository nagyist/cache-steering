  "query": "Question: John wrote a religions tract and decided to give them away.  He felt that he should go somewhere where he could reach a large and diverse group from many places.  Where is he likely to distribute his tracts?\n\nChoices:\nA: public place\nB: airport\nC: subway car\nD: shopping mall\nE: laundromat",
  "steps": [
    "John wants to reach a large and diverse group, which suggests that the location should have many people from different backgrounds and places.",
    "A public place could accommodate large crowds, but it might not guarantee a diverse demographic.",
    "An airport is a location where many travelers from various regions converge, making it highly diverse.",
    "A subway car also hosts diverse individuals commuting, but the number of people may vary and might be constricted compared to more open areas.",
    "A shopping mall attracts a mix of people shopping for various reasons, usually providing an opportunity for diverse interactions.",
    "A laundromat typically has a more localized and less diverse group of people and may not reach a large crowd effectively.",
    "Among the options, the airport stands out for its potential to reach many people from different regions in one place.",
    "While subways can also be effective, the mobility of individuals is lower compared to an airport where people are stationary while awaiting flights.",
    "Ultimately, the distinctive characteristic of an airport as a hub for travelers from around the world makes it the best choice for John's objective."
