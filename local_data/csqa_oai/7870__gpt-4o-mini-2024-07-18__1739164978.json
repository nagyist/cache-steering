  "query": "Question: Where is cheese likely to be dangerous for some creatures?\n\nChoices:\nA: refrigerator\nB: mouse trap\nC: fridge\nD: outside\nE: plate",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify situations where cheese could pose a danger to certain creatures, specifically rodents like mice.",
    "I consider where traps for mice are typically used, as they are designed to catch them using bait such as cheese.",
    "Mouse traps are likely found in various areas where food is stored or accessed, which includes the kitchen.",
    "In the kitchen, cheese could be placed near or on a mouse trap, making it a dangerous scenario for the mice.",
    "I note that while cheese can be found in a refrigerator (C), a mouse trap (B) is specifically designed to utilize cheese as bait to catch mice and would be a dangerous place for them.",
    "The other options, such as outside (D), a plate (E), and refrigerator (A), do not correspond with the specific risk posed by cheese to these creatures in the same targeted context as the mouse trap.",
    "Therefore, the most direct answer to the question, considering the danger specifically for mice, is the mouse trap."
