  "query": "Question: What would a rock form in nature above the treeline?\n\nChoices:\nA: surface of earth\nB: pit\nC: bridge\nD: mountains\nE: minerals",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a natural formation that occurs above the treeline, which typically refers to areas where trees can no longer grow due to harsh environmental conditions, such as altitude and climate.",
    "At high altitudes, rocky landscapes are common due to erosion, geological uplift, and other factors that shape the earth\u2019s surface.",
    "Looking at the options provided, \"surface of earth\" is too vague and doesn't specifically relate to a rock formation above the treeline.",
    "A \"pit\" does not naturally form in mountainous or alpine regions; it's more associated with mining or excavation.",
    "A \"bridge\" might be man-made or result from erosion in specific cases, but it is not a typical natural rock formation associated with areas above the treeline.",
    "\"Mountains,\" however, are very characteristic of regions that exist above the treeline and typically consist of rock and other geological materials.",
    "\"Minerals\" can certainly be found above the treeline, but they don't refer to a formation; instead, they refer to the individual components that make up rocks.",
    "Therefore, the option that best describes a natural formation specifically consisting of rock above the treeline is \u201cmountains.\u201d"
