  "steps": [
    "The question states that people come from different walks of life, implying diversity.",
    "The core of the question asks what we all share despite our differences.",
    "Choice A mentions \"innocent until proven guilty,\" which is more of a legal principle rather than a universal truth about all people.",
    "Choice B simply states \"different,\" which acknowledges diversity but does not capture what unites everyone.",
    "Choice C states \"human,\" which signifies that despite our varied backgrounds, we all belong to the same species and share fundamental traits and experiences.",
    "Choice D mentions \"hurt,\" which is a feeling that some may experience, but it is not universally applicable to all individuals.",
    "Choice E states \"independent,\" which suggests autonomy, but not all individuals share this trait and it doesn't address a universal quality.",
    "Among all choices, Option C \"human\" is the most inclusive term that reflects a shared identity among all people regardless of their differences."
