  "query": "Question: The producer told them to take out the scene with full nudity, this was because PG-13 only allowed for what kind of nudity?\n\nChoices:\nA: close fitting\nB: tight\nC: empty\nD: incomplete\nE: partial",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the guidelines surrounding PG-13 ratings. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) establishes that PG-13 films may contain some nudity but not explicit or full nudity.",
    "Next, I should consider the term \"full nudity.\" In the context of film ratings, \"full nudity\" typically refers to complete nakedness without any covering.",
    "Now, I need to identify what type of nudity is allowable under the PG-13 rating. Since the guidelines suggest that nudity can be present but must be less explicit, I will focus on terms that imply less exposure.",
    "Among the options, \"partial\" nudity typically refers to nudity where some parts of the body are covered or not fully exposed, fitting within the PG-13 guidelines.",
    "The other options such as \"close fitting,\" \"tight,\" \"empty,\" and \"incomplete\" do not accurately describe the type of nudity permissible under PG-13 standards.",
    "I will now confirm that \"partial nudity\" is the correct term used in various film rating guides for nudity that is less than fully exposed and hence acceptable for PG-13.",
    "Considering the definitions and the context provided, it seems clear that \"partial\" is the only option that aligns with the PG-13 restrictions regarding nudity."
