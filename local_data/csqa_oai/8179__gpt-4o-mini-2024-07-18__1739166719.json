    "Inflation can lead to various economic consequences that can disrupt a country's financial health.",
    "Economic instability is a recognized risk that can arise from high inflation, as it creates uncertainty in the market.",
    "Governments and central banks often implement measures to control inflation to maintain economic stability and ensure predictable growth.",
    "While rising interest rates can be a tool used to combat inflation, it is simply one of many factors and not the primary motivation.",
    "Other choices like \"war,\" \"not noticeable,\" and \"problems\" do not directly relate to the main concern of managing inflation.",
