  "query": "Question: What does killing people not usually lead to?\n\nChoices:\nA: joy\nB: vengeance\nC: going to jail\nD: anguish\nE: happiness",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the implications of killing people. Killing is a grave act that typically results in severe emotional and legal consequences.",
    "Next, analyze the emotional responses usually associated with the act of killing. It often leads to a range of feelings such as anguish or sorrow, both for the one who commits the act and for others affected by it.",
    "Now, evaluate the potential outcomes in terms of social and legal repercussions. Killing someone typically leads to legal consequences, including arrest and incarceration, which relates directly to choice C: going to jail.",
    "Look at the concepts of joy and happiness in relation to killing. It's unlikely that killing someone would lead to genuine joy or happiness, as these emotions are generally antithetical to the act of taking a life.",
    "However, vengeance can sometimes be a motive or result of killing, suggesting that this is not a leading outcome that stands apart from the act itself.",
    "As for the answer choices, joy, anguish, and vengeance can be seen as emotional responses to killing, while going to jail is a legal consequence.",
    "Given the context, it's noteworthy that killing people does not usually lead to joy or happiness.",
    "Among the answer choices, the one that stands out as not a typical result of killing is joy or happiness.",
    "Revising the choices once again, joy (A) and happiness (E) both imply positive emotions which are not usually the outcome of such a severe action; however, based on the answer format required, it\u2019s consistent to look for the option least connected to the act of killing.",
    "Thus, the best choice highlighting what killing people does not usually lead to is joy (A), since it represents an emotion that is typically absent in the context of such a catastrophic act."
