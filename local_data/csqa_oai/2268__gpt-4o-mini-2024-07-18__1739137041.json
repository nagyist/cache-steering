  "query": "Question: Care not to burn you hand on the handle of what small high-walled vessel?\n\nChoices:\nA: brush\nB: carry object\nC: walking stick\nD: umbrella\nE: saucepan",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions a \"small high-walled vessel,\" which implies a container that holds something.",
    "The phrase \"care not to burn your hand\" suggests that the vessel can heat up, indicating it is used for cooking or contains hot substances.",
    "Now, let's analyze the choices provided:\n- A: Brush - This is not a vessel nor does it typically get hot.\n- B: Carry object - This is too vague and doesn't refer to a specific vessel.\n- C: Walking stick - This is a support tool, not a vessel.\n- D: Umbrella - This is used for protection from rain but is not a vessel.\n- E: Saucepan - This is definitely a vessel used for cooking and can become hot.",
    "Among the choices, the saucepan is the only one that is a small high-walled vessel used for cooking, and you can indeed burn your hand on its handle if it is heated.",
    "To confirm, a saucepan is specifically designed for stovetop cooking where handles can become very hot."
