  "query": "Question: Where can a person drink alcohol as they slice a steak?\n\nChoices:\nA: pub\nB: chemistry lab\nC: manual\nD: supermarket\nE: restaurants",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify places where it is common to eat a steak.",
    "Restaurants are known for serving meals, including steak, and they typically provide a dining experience with various beverages.",
    "Pubs often serve food, including steak, and alcohol, but they primarily focus on drinking rather than formal dining.",
    "A chemistry lab is not a place for eating or drinking alcohol; it's an environment for scientific work.",
    "A supermarket may provide options for purchasing steaks and alcohol, but it\u2019s not a place where one would typically eat or drink at the same time.",
    "The term \"manual\" seems out of context since it does not correlate with a location for consuming food or drinks.",
    "Now we can compare the two most relevant options: pubs and restaurants.",
    "While both pubs and restaurants serve food and drink, restaurants offer a more formal dining experience where one could slice a steak while drinking alcohol.",
    "Thus, the most suitable answer regarding a place where one can drink alcohol as they slice a steak is a restaurant."
