  "query": "Question: Where is the cub's baseball stadium?\n\nChoices:\nA: chicago\nB: phoenix\nC: san francisco\nD: boston\nE: urban areas",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify which city has a baseball team referred to as \"the cub.\" Typically, \"the cub\" refers to the Chicago Cubs, a Major League Baseball team.",
    "Since the team name includes \"Cubs,\" it suggests a strong association with Chicago, as they are based there. Thus, I will focus on Chicago as a potential answer.",
    "Now I will consider the other options: Phoenix, San Francisco, Boston, and Urban areas.",
    "Phoenix is known for the Arizona Diamondbacks, not associated with \"the cub.\" Therefore, it can be eliminated.",
    "San Francisco is represented by the San Francisco Giants, not the Cubs, so this option can also be eliminated.",
    "Boston has the Boston Red Sox, which again, does not relate to the Cubs, allowing me to eliminate this choice as well.",
    "Urban areas is too general to refer to a specific stadium and does not directly connect with the term \"the cub.\" Hence, this option is also eliminated.",
    "After eliminating the other locations, it is clear that the only location that matches the criteria of having a \"cub's baseball stadium\" belongs to Chicago.",
    "To conclude, confirming that the Chicago Cubs play at Wrigley Field, I can confidently state that the correct answer is related to Chicago as the location of \"the cub's baseball stadium.\""
