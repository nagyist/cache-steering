  "query": "Question: Where do you put a bowl after it is used?\n\nChoices:\nA: cupboard\nB: restaurant\nC: cabinet\nD: trash\nE: dishwasher",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll consider the usual process after using a bowl for a meal. Typically, a bowl that has been used would need to be cleaned before being put away.",
    "Next, I analyze where a dirty bowl is usually placed for cleaning. This is often in the dishwasher or at a sink for hand washing.",
    "Among the options, \"E: dishwasher\" is the most logical choice for where you put a used bowl right after using it, as it signifies immediate action for cleaning.",
    "Now, I check the other options. \"A: cupboard\" and \"C: cabinet\" are places for storing clean bowls, not used ones. \"B: restaurant\" is irrelevant in this context as it does not pertain to where a bowl is placed after use. \"D: trash\" would only be applicable if the bowl were disposable, which isn't indicated.",
    "Considering all the reasoning, the best answer reflects the immediate action taken after using a bowl, which is to place it in the dishwasher."
