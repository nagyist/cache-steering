  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider what a job typically involves. A job is often a place where one engages in work-related activities.",
    "Next, a workplace is commonly understood to be a dedicated environment for performing job tasks, such as an office or factory.",
    "Now, while jobs can also be performed in homes, this usually refers to remote work or home businesses, which is not as common as traditional workplaces.",
    "A store may have jobs, like sales or management positions, but it is usually not where all jobs are performed. It's a specific type of workplace.",
    "Schools employ people as teachers or administrative staff, but these roles represent a subset of jobs rather than the broader concept of where jobs might be done.",
    "Parks can have jobs related to maintenance or recreation, but the term 'job' encompasses more than just those specific roles.",
    "Given the context and the options provided, the most inclusive and widely applicable setting for jobs is a workplace."
