  "query": "Question: Where might you find a map on an outside wall?\n\nChoices:\nA: posession\nB: suitcase\nC: rest area\nD: bus station\nE: atlas",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the nature of the question which asks where a map might be found on an outside wall. This indicates a public place or a location where people could easily access information.",
    "Now, let's examine each of the choices provided.",
    "Choice A: \"possession\" does not fit because it refers to ownership and doesn't imply a physical place where maps are displayed.",
    "Choice B: \"suitcase\" is also an inappropriate choice since a suitcase is a personal item and would not have a map on an outside wall.",
    "Choice C: \"rest area\" could be a viable option. Rest areas are often equipped with information displays, including maps, and they do have outside walls.",
    "Choice D: \"bus station\" is another promising option. Bus stations often have information like transit maps posted on their walls, and many have outside areas where this could be relevant.",
    "Choice E: \"atlas\" typically refers to a book of maps, which would not be found on an outside wall.",
    "Comparing both choices C and D, it is possible to see maps at both locations. However, rest areas traditionally serve travelers and can provide regional information maps, making it a likely primary candidate.",
    "While bus stations may have external displays, they are not typically just maps but often involve schedules or route information; therefore, it feels slightly less likely than a rest area that caters to travelers needing regional maps.",
    "Thus, I conclude that given an outside wall, the best fit for a place where you might find a map is at a rest area."
