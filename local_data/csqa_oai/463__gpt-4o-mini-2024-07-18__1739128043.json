  "query": "Question: Where could you find some large pieces of paper that are not for sale?\n\nChoices:\nA: cabinet\nB: computer printer\nC: suitcase\nD: office supply store\nE: artist's studio",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is meant by \"large pieces of paper that are not for sale.\" This indicates that the location should have large paper but it shouldn't be available for purchase.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options one by one. \nOption A: \"cabinet\" could potentially have large paper inside, depending on the type of cabinet, but it's not a common location for large paper.",
    "Next, option B: \"computer printer\" typically uses standard-sized paper that is intended for printing documents. It would not commonly house large pieces of paper.",
    "Now, considering option C: \"suitcase\" is a possibility since large pieces of paper could be packed inside for transportation, but they aren\u2019t for sale within the suitcase.",
    "Moving on to option D: \"office supply store,\" this option has large pieces of paper for sale, which contradicts the requirement that the paper is not for sale. So, this option cannot be correct.",
    "Finally, option E: \"artist's studio\" is a strong candidate. Artists often use large sheets of paper for their work and it\u2019s very likely that they have large pieces of paper on hand that are not available for sale as they are part of their personal supplies.",
    "Comparing the most relevant options, \"suitcase\" could theoretically hold large pieces of paper, but it doesn\u2019t identify a place where large paper would typically be found. \nOn the other hand, \"artist's studio\" directly aligns with having large pieces of paper not intended for sale, as they would be part of the artist's materials."
