  "steps": [
    "First, I interpret the question as asking for the closest location of a sofa that is not in my own residence.",
    "Next, I analyze the provided choices to determine their proximity.",
    "Choice A, \"neighbor's house,\" suggests the closest sofa could be in a neighboring home, which is typically nearby.",
    "Choice B, \"person's living room,\" is vague but implies a sofa located in another person's living area. However, \"person\" is non-specific.",
    "Choice C, \"livingroom,\" again does not specify a location and sounds like a general term rather than a specific place.",
    "Choice D, \"white house,\" refers to a prominent, distant location known to many but not likely close to any individual's residence.",
    "Choice E, \"home,\" implies a general sense of a home but does not specify a location other than my own residence.",
    "Comparing the closeness of these options, \"neighbor's house\" would likely have a sofa much closer than any ambiguous \"person's living room\" or the \"white house.\"",
    "Since neighbors typically live in close proximity to one another, I conclude that the closest sofa that isn\u2019t in my residence is likely at the neighbor's house."
