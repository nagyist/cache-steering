  "query": "Question: Soldiers who have been killing people during what experience what when they return home?\n\nChoices:\nA: hate\nB: suicidal thoughts\nC: murder\nD: get killed\nE: feel remorse",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the psychological impacts of soldiers who have been involved in killing during combat. This often leads to various mental health issues.",
    "One of the most common issues is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest in depression, anxiety, and flashbacks.",
    "Among those who have killed in combat, feelings of guilt and sorrow can arise due to the actions they took during their service.",
    "These feelings can be categorized as remorse, which is a strong emotional response to the actions that have led to harm against others.",
    "While suicidality and other negative emotions may be prevalent, option E, feeling remorse, directly relates to the direct impact of their actions.",
    "Suicidal thoughts (option B) are indeed a concern but stem from various mental health issues, not solely from the act of killing itself.",
    "Options C, D, and A involve negative outcomes that may not be as universal or direct as the feelings of remorse that many soldiers report.",
    "Considering all of the above, the option that most directly addresses the emotional state directly after returning home from such experiences is E: feel remorse."
