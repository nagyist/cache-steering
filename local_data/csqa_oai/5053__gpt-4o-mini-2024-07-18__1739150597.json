  "query": "Question: What did Einstein determine that energy is made of?\n\nChoices:\nA: weakness\nB: play sports\nC: entropy\nD: mass\nE: matter",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand Einstein's contributions to physics, particularly his theories related to energy and mass.",
    "Einstein is famously known for his mass-energy equivalence principle, encapsulated in the equation E=mc\u00b2.",
    "This equation indicates that energy (E) is equivalent to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared, suggesting a direct relationship between energy and mass.",
    "Now, I should analyze the given answer choices for relevance to Einstein's work.",
    "Looking at the options, A: weakness and B: play sports do not relate to Einstein\u2019s theories at all.",
    "C: entropy relates to thermodynamics, but it is not directly linked to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.",
    "D: mass is directly mentioned in the context of E=mc\u00b2, indicating that mass can be converted into energy.",
    "E: matter is also relevant, as mass is a property of matter, but it's broader and not specific to Einstein's determination about energy.",
    "After reviewing the options, the most accurate answer related to Einstein\u2019s findings is D: mass, as that is the substance that can be converted into energy according to his theory."
