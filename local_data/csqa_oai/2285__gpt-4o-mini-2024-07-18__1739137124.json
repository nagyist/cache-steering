  "query": "Question: The employees were complaining about lack of air conditioning, so where did the boss decide to install it?\n\nChoices:\nA: on the tables\nB: movie theatre\nC: offices\nD: car\nE: house",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that employees are complaining about a lack of air conditioning.",
    "This implies that the employees need a cooler environment in their workspaces.",
    "The choices presented include various locations where air conditioning could be installed.",
    "Choosing 'on the tables' (Option A) seems impractical since air conditioning units need more space and specific locations to function effectively.",
    "The 'movie theatre' (Option B) is not relevant since it is not the workplace of the employees involved in the complaint.",
    "Next, 'car' (Option D) and 'house' (Option E) are also not logical choices as they do not pertain to an office environment where employees work.",
    "This leads to the conclusion that the most sensible option for addressing the employees' complaints about air conditioning would be their actual work environment.",
    "Upon analyzing the choices, 'offices' (Option C) stands out as the most appropriate location for the installation of air conditioning.",
    "Therefore, installing air conditioning in the offices directly resolves the employees' issue at hand."
