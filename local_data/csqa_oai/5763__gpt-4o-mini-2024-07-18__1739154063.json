  "query": "Question: The automaton wanted to save money like normal humans, what did it need to learn about?\n\nChoices:\nA: museum\nB: banking\nC: science fiction plot\nD: lab\nE: computer work",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the automaton wants to save money like normal humans. This implies it needs to understand financial systems and practices that are used by humans to manage their money.",
    "Among the options provided, \"banking\" is directly related to saving money, as it deals with financial institutions where individuals can save, invest, and manage their finances.",
    "Examining the other options: \n- \"museum\" is related to culture and history, not financial management.\n- \"science fiction plot\" does not pertain to practical money matters or saving.\n- \"lab\" refers to a place for experiments and research, which does not directly relate to saving money.\n- \"computer work\" may involve financial software but is too broad and not specifically about saving money.",
    "Based on the evidence gathered, \"banking\" stands out as the only relevant choice that focuses specifically on the processes involved in saving money.",
    "Therefore, the automaton needs to learn about banking in order to effectively save money like normal humans do."
