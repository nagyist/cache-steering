  "query": "Question: Jim was looking for a container cup to put something in.  Where might he have looked?\n\nChoices:\nA: person's hand\nB: sink\nC: dispenser\nD: kitchen cupboard\nE: drink from",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where Jim might have looked for a container cup. This implies we need to think about common places where such cups might be found.",
    "Option A is \"person's hand.\" While a person can hold a cup, it is not a place one typically looks for a cup. Therefore, this option is unlikely.",
    "Option B is \"sink.\" A sink is usually associated with washing dishes, but it's not a common place to find cups unless they are being rinsed. This makes it a less likely choice.",
    "Option C is \"dispenser.\" While some dispensers might hold cups (like those for disposable cups), it is generally less common. Moreover, it does not seem like a primary place to look.",
    "Option D is \"kitchen cupboard.\" Cupboards in kitchens are very typical places where one would store and easily access cups. This seems like a highly likely location.",
    "Option E is \"drink from.\" This option refers to the act of using a cup rather than a place to find one. Therefore, it is not relevant to the question.",
    "After evaluating each option, \"kitchen cupboard\" stands out as the most logical place where Jim would look for a container cup."
