  "query": "Question: What kind of performance can be viewed on a DVD?\n\nChoices:\nA: concert hall\nB: circus\nC: movie\nD: theatre\nE: singing",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what type of performance can be viewed on a DVD. Therefore, I need to consider the common types of performances that are typically available on DVD.",
    "A DVD can contain various types of visual media. I will assess each option provided.",
    "Option A is \"concert hall.\" There are indeed many concert DVDs available featuring performances from concert halls, so this option is plausible.",
    "Option B is \"circus.\" While there are DVDs of circus performances, they are less common compared to other options. But it is still possible.",
    "Option C is \"movie.\" Movies are one of the primary formats that are distributed on DVD. This option is very likely.",
    "Option D is \"theatre.\" There are DVDs of theatrical performances, which can include plays and musicals, so this option is also plausible.",
    "Option E is \"singing.\" While singing performances can be featured on DVDs, this option is too broad as it could refer to any music-related video rather than a type of performance on its own.",
    "Considering the commonality and the type of content typically viewed on DVDs, \"movie\" stands out as the most definitive answer as it represents a popular genre of DVDs.",
    "I will also consider that concerts and theatre performances are more specific subsets of performances rather than a general category like \"movie.\"",
    "Final confirmation shows that while all options could technically fit, \"movie\" encapsulates the most widely recognized form of performance available on DVD."
