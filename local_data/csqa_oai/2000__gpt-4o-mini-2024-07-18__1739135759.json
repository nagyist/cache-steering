  "query": "Question: What does a child want to do after school?\n\nChoices:\nA: wave goodbye\nB: play video games\nC: ask many questions\nD: clean street\nE: become adult",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, consider the typical activities a child engages in after school. Children are generally seen as energetic and wanting to unwind from their day at school.",
    "Next, analyze the options provided. Waving goodbye (A) is usually a brief action that might occur when leaving school, not something they \"want to do\" after a long day.",
    "Looking at option B, playing video games is a common pastime that many children enjoy and might actively look forward to after their school day.",
    "Option C, asking many questions, suggests a curiosity that could reflect a child\u2019s engagement with new ideas rather than a specific activity they want to do for enjoyment.",
    "Option D, cleaning the street, seems less likely as children typically do not wish to perform chores or community work as a first choice following school.",
    "Lastly, option E, becoming an adult, is an aspiration that children may have but does not reflect a direct activity they want to do after school.",
    "Considering the analysis, the option that aligns most closely with a child's typical desire after school is B, play video games, as it is a fun activity that many children look forward to."
