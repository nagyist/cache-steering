  "query": "Question: If somebody likes temperatures cool, they might have more than one electric fan where?\n\nChoices:\nA: home\nB: hardware store\nC: home\nD: hot room\nE: office",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that someone likes cool temperatures, which suggests they might want to stay comfortable in warm conditions.",
    "Electric fans are devices used to create airflow, primarily to help cool down spaces when temperatures are warm.",
    "If a person likes cool temperatures, it is logical to think they would set up fans in places where they spend a lot of time and may experience heat.",
    "The options provided include various locations: home, hardware store, hot room, and office.",
    "Setting up more than one electric fan is most likely in personal spaces where comfort is essential, such as one's home.",
    "A hardware store does not make sense, as it is a place to purchase fans, not to use them for personal comfort.",
    "A hot room could warrant a fan as well, but it does not suggest the placement of multiple fans, nor does it align with the idea of enjoying cool temperatures.",
    "An office could also potentially have more than one fan, especially if it is a warm environment, but this is less common than a home setting.",
    "Considering the context of the question and typical environment usage, home is the most probable answer for where someone would have multiple electric fans."
