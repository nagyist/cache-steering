  "steps": [
    "To address the question, we first need to identify what children might envy or wish to be. The mention of \"bliss\" indicates a carefree, joyful state often associated with childhood.",
    "Next, we consider the premise that some children wish to be something else in order to \"do anything they want.\" This suggests a desire for greater freedom or autonomy typically not afforded to children.",
    "We will analyze each choice to see which might fit children's desires for freedom and the ability to do things without restrictions.",
    "Choice A: \"old people\" typically have a lot of life experience, but they are generally associated with restrictions due to health and responsibilities, which may not be what children aspire to be.",
    "Choice B: \"parents\" might have some level of freedom, but they also have responsibilities and are often limited by their roles, so this may not be ideal for children wishing for total freedom.",
    "Choice C: \"the president\" symbolizes power and authority, which allows for significant decision-making and role influence. However, it comes with great responsibility, which could be seen as limiting.",
    "Choice D: \"grown ups\" refers to adults in general, who handle responsibilities as well. They might have more freedom than children, but still have obligations that restrict complete freedom.",
    "Choice E: \"play with toys\" seems irrelevant here, as it does not represent a different state of being but rather a childhood activity, the opposite of what the children are wishing to become.",
    "Considering the reasoning, \"grown ups\" (Choice D) captures the essence of what children often desire, meaning more autonomy or activities typical of adults without the responsibilities that usually come with adulthood."
