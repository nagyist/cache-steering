  "query": "Question: Where is an expressway likely to be crowded?\n\nChoices:\nA: country\nB: canada\nC: michigan\nD: michigan\nE: large city",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what an expressway is and where it is typically located. Expressways are major highways designed for high-speed traffic and are commonly found in urban areas or close to them.",
    "Analyze the options provided. Since we are looking for a likely scenario where an expressway would be crowded, we should focus on locations that typically have high traffic volumes.",
    "Option A, \"country,\" might refer to rural areas where expressways are less likely to be crowded, especially compared to urban or suburban areas.",
    "Option B, \"canada,\" is a country and encompasses both urban and rural areas, but it is not specific enough to determine crowding on an expressway.",
    "Options C and D are both \"michigan.\" Since they are the same, they do not need separate consideration; Michigan is known to have urban areas with expressways that can experience heavy traffic.",
    "Option E, \"large city,\" suggests an urban area where expressways are indeed likely to be crowded due to population density and commercial activity.",
    "Now compare the generality of some options. \"Large city\" could apply to any major urban area, whereas Michigan is a specific location that includes large cities.",
    "Overall, while both Michigan (due to its urban areas) and large cities in general can experience crowded expressways, \"large city\" is broader and accounts for multiple locations.",
    "Crowding on expressways is often most pronounced in or around large cities, as they are hubs of transportation and economic activity."
