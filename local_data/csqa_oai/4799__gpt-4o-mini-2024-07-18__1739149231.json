  "query": "Question: What happens at the first opening of a business if it's not succesful?\n\nChoices:\nA: making money\nB: grand opening\nC: wealth\nD: lose money\nE: get rich",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the outcome of a business's initial opening if it isn't successful.",
    "A successful opening would typically involve making money, but the question specifies the opposite scenario where the opening is not successful.",
    "Looking at the choices, 'loss of money' would be a logical consequence of an unsuccessful opening.",
    "The option 'making money' (A) does not apply since the question states the business is not successful.",
    "'Grand opening' (B) is an event rather than an outcome; it doesn't relate to success or failure.",
    "'Wealth' (C) would imply financial success or growth, which contradicts the scenario of an unsuccessful opening.",
    "'Get rich' (E) also indicates financial success, which again does not correlate with an unsuccessful opening.",
    "Thus, the only option left that describes the outcome of an unsuccessful business opening is 'lose money' (D)."
