  "steps": [
    "To determine what context fits with the phrase \"next to the drums and guitar,\" we should consider what typically features both of these instruments together.",
    "Drums and guitars are commonly associated with popular music groups or ensembles, especially in a live performance setting.",
    "An \"orchestra\" usually includes string instruments, woodwinds, and brass, and does not typically feature drums and electric guitars prominently.",
    "A \"music store\" or \"piano store\" would not be associated with a live performance but rather a place to buy instruments, which does not match the context of looking goofy onstage.",
    "The option \"eating\" is not relevant to the context of musical performance.",
    "Given these considerations, the most fitting answer is \"band,\" as bands traditionally consist of musicians performing together, which includes guitars and drums."
