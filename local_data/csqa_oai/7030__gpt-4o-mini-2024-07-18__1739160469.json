  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the place where John couldn't find beavers.",
    "Beavers are typically found in areas with plenty of water and vegetation, such as forests or wetlands.",
    "I need to consider which of the options provided makes the most sense for the habitat of beavers.",
    "Option A: America has several regions where beavers are prevalent, so it doesn't explain why he couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Option B: Australia is not a natural habitat for beavers, as they are native to North America and some parts of Europe.",
    "Option C: The countryside generally refers to rural areas that may have suitable habitats for beavers, so it doesn't clarify why there are none.",
    "Option D: A dictionary is not a physical location for beavers, so it is irrelevant.",
    "Option E: Woodlands are a natural environment for beavers, meaning they are likely to be present in such locations.",
    "Since John looked for beavers and couldn't find any, the implication is that he lived in a place where beavers don't typically exist.",
    "Among the options, 'Australia' is the only place that explains the absence of beavers, as they do not naturally inhabit that continent."
