  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which of the given options is known for having many lakes.",
    "Option A, \"state park,\" is broad and doesn't specify a location known for many lakes. State parks can be anywhere and some may or may not have lakes.",
    "Option B, \"mountains,\" can sometimes have lakes, but it is not specifically known for a large number of lakes. Mountainous areas are often more associated with rivers and streams.",
    "Option C, \"countryside,\" refers to rural areas that may have some lakes, but it also is too general and may not be particularly known for a significant number of lakes.",
    "Option D, \"dead sea,\" refers to a single body of water, which is actually known for being a salt lake rather than many lakes.",
    "Now, I consider option E, \"Michigan.\" Michigan is famously known for its numerous lakes, including the Great Lakes and many smaller lakes within the state.",
    "Comparing all options, Michigan stands out as the location specifically recognized for having \"many a lake.\"",
    "I will conclude that the best answer to the question is option E, as it is well-documented that Michigan has a high concentration of lakes."
