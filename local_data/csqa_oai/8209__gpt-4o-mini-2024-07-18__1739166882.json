  "steps": [
    "The question asks what single race a horse must win to reach a championship goal. This implies there is a specific race that serves as a qualifier or gateway to a more prestigious event or title.",
    "The Kentucky Derby is one of the most famous horse races in the United States and is often seen as a qualifier for further championship events, particularly the Triple Crown.",
    "The term \"Triple Crown\" refers to a series of races that includes the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. Winning the Kentucky Derby is the first step towards attempting to win the Triple Crown.",
    "The phrase \"race track\" refers to a location rather than an actual race, which does not answer the question about a specific race needed to win.",
    "\"Painting\" is unrelated to horse racing and championship goals, thus it can also be disregarded.",
    "While options A (charriott) and D (painting) can be immediately excluded, option E (Triple Crown) is not a specific race, but rather a collection of races. It would not fit the criteria for a single race that must be won.",
    "Thus, the clear choice for a single specific race that leads to a championship goal is the Kentucky Derby.",
    "Therefore, the answer to the question is the Kentucky Derby, as it is critically linked to pursuing championship titles like the Triple Crown."
