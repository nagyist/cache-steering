  "query": "Question: Older stars collect in groups called what on the outer regions of a galaxy?\n\nChoices:\nA: night sky\nB: black hole\nC: globular cluster\nD: press conference\nE: heavens",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the context of the question, which is about the structures or groups formed by older stars in galaxies.",
    "Next, recall the different terms used in astronomy that relate to the grouping of stars.",
    "Consider each option provided: \n- A: night sky => This refers to the view of the sky at night and not a group of stars.\n- B: black hole => This is a region in space with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.\n- C: globular cluster => This is a spherical collection of stars, which often contains older stars and is found in the outer regions of a galaxy.\n- D: press conference => This pertains to a media event and is irrelevant to astronomy.\n- E: heavens => This is a general term referring to the sky or universe but does not specify a group of stars.",
    "Based on the analysis, globular clusters are known to be clusters of older stars and match the described conditions in the question.",
    "Verify that a globular cluster indeed consists predominantly of older stars and is characteristic of the outer regions of galaxies.",
    "None of the other options align with the specification of older star groups, reinforcing that the answer must be globular cluster.",
    "Conclude that the clear and correct answer is option C."
