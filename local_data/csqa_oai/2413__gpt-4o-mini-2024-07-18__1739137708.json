  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about where noise takes the form of static in a radio. A radio broadcasts audio signals, which can sometimes be disrupted or interfered with, leading to static noise.",
    "Among the choices provided, \u201ctransmission\u201d refers to the process of sending information, in this case, radio signals. This is the most relevant option because static is commonly linked to the interruption in the transmission of these signals.",
    "The other options (classroom, movie theatre, car, bowling alley) are all physical environments where radios might be used, but they do not specifically relate to the concept of static in radio transmission.",
    "Classrooms, movie theatres, cars, and bowling alleys may all have their own types of noise, but they do not capture the essence of the relationship between radio static and signal transmission.",
    "I need to ensure that \"transmission\" is the most appropriate choice by ruling out the others. All other choices are environments and not related to the concept of radio transmission and its inherent noise.",
    "By comparing \u201ctransmission\u201d directly with the other options, it stands out as the only term that directly deals with radio signal and static interference."
