  "steps": [
    "I need to evaluate the statement about seeing dishes in the context of glass. The term \"glass\" typically refers to a transparent material that allows for visibility.",
    "Next, I consider the options provided in the context of where glass might be present and where dishes might be seen.",
    "A dishwasher usually has a front door that is sometimes glass, but it is not typically used for viewing dishes; it's more for cleaning them.",
    "A window is made of glass and allows you to see outside, but it does not apply to seeing dishes within a household context.",
    "A cabinet may have glass doors; if it does, one could see dishes stored inside easily. Cabinets are commonly used for storing dishes.",
    "A table does not typically have any glass elements that allow for seeing dishes unless specifically designed, which is uncommon.",
    "A shelf may also be made of glass, but it is not as common to refer to it directly for seeing dishes as cabinets are.",
    "Given that the statement emphasizes seeing dishes through glass, the most suitable option that combines both aspects is a cabinet.",
    "I will now analyze the other options. The window does not relate to dishes, the dishwasher focuses on cleaning rather than viewing, the shelf might not specifically emphasize dishes, and the table is least likely to involve glass, making the cabinet the best answer."
