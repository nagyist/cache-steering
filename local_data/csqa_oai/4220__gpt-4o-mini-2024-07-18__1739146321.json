  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the consequences of remembering a terrible event.",
    "When someone remembers a terrible event, they may experience emotional distress or negative feelings.",
    "These negative feelings can manifest in various ways, such as anxiety, sadness, or even physical reactions.",
    "Considering the options provided, we must identify the most likely emotional or psychological consequences of recalling a traumatic experience.",
    "Option A (problems) is broad and could encompass many issues, but it doesn't specify emotional responses.",
    "Option B (inspiration) seems unlikely since recalling a terrible event generally does not inspire positive feelings or thoughts.",
    "Option C (going to a therapist) could be a response to the negative emotions caused by remembering a terrible event but is not a direct emotional outcome.",
    "Option D (crying) is a possible immediate emotional response to recalling distressing memories but is not as general as other choices.",
    "Option E (trauma) seems highly relevant because recalling a terrible event can indeed trigger memories of initial trauma or increase feelings of trauma.",
    "Weighing all the options, trauma (Option E) captures the essence of what remembering a terrible event could invoke more accurately than the others."
