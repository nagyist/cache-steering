  "query": "Question: What could water turn into?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: humidifier\nC: ice cube\nD: drip\nE: skating rink",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the different states of water. Water can exist in solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam) forms.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice to see if it represents a possible transformation or state of water.",
    "Option A, \"ocean\", does not represent a transformation of water but rather a large body of water.",
    "Option B, \"humidifier\", refers to a device that adds moisture to the air, not a transformation of water itself.",
    "Option C, \"ice cube\", is a solid state of water, which indicates a direct transformation of water when it freezes.",
    "Option D, \"drip\" refers to a form of water in its liquid state, but it doesn't denote a transformation.",
    "Option E, \"skating rink\", implies a surface made of ice, which is a form of water but does not specifically describe a transformation.",
    "From analyzing each option, \"ice cube\" is the only answer that directly represents a physical change of water from liquid to solid.",
    "To confirm, when water is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), it freezes into ice\u2014supporting that an \"ice cube\" is indeed a form that water can turn into."
