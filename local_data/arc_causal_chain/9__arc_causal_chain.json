Which best explains how this occurred?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earthquake activity folded the rock layers.\nB: Volcanic eruptions destroyed a rock layer.\nC: Erosion removed several layers of rock.\nD: Weathering changed the layering of the rocks.",

    "steps": [
        "If older rock is found above younger rock, then something must have disturbed the natural order. If earthquakes can fold rock layers, then this could flip the order. Therefore, earthquake activity best explains this situation."
