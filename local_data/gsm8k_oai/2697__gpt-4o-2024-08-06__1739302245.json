  "query": "Shelly makes braided keychains for her friends at school. Each keychain takes 12 inches of thread to braid. This year, she made six friends in classes and half that number from after-school clubs. She wants to make each of them a keychain. How many inches of thread does Shelly need?",
  "steps": [
    "Shelly made six friends in her classes.",
    "Half of six is the number of friends she made in after-school clubs.",
    "Half of six is 3, so she made 3 friends in after-school clubs.",
    "Total number of friends she made = number of friends from classes + number of friends from after-school clubs.",
    "Total friends = 6 + 3.",
    "Total friends = 9.",
    "Each keychain takes 12 inches of thread.",
    "To find the total amount of thread needed, multiply the number of friends (9) by the amount of thread per keychain (12 inches).",
    "Total thread needed = 9 friends \u00d7 12 inches/friend.",
    "Total thread needed = 108 inches."
