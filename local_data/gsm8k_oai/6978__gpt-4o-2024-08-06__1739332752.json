  "query": "There are 4 wolves out hunting for the pack. The pack contains 16 additional wolves. Each wolf needs to eat 8 pounds of meat a day and the wolves won't hunt again for five days. If each deer contains 200 pounds of meat, how many deer does each wolf need to kill?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many wolves are in the pack in total.",
    "There are 4 wolves hunting plus 16 additional wolves in the pack.",
    "This means there are 4 + 16 = 20 wolves in total.",
    "Each wolf needs to eat 8 pounds of meat per day.",
    "The wolves won't hunt again for five days.",
    "Each wolf, therefore, needs 8 pounds/day * 5 days = 40 pounds of meat for the period.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much meat the entire pack needs.",
    "There are 20 wolves and each needs 40 pounds of meat.",
    "So, the total amount of meat needed is 20 wolves * 40 pounds = 800 pounds of meat.",
    "Each deer provides 200 pounds of meat.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many deer the wolves need to kill to get 800 pounds of meat.",
    "The number of deer needed is 800 pounds / 200 pounds per deer = 4 deer.",
    "Now, to find out how many deer each hunting wolf needs to kill, I divide the total number of deer by the number of hunting wolves.",
    "There are 4 wolves hunting and 4 deer needed, so each hunting wolf needs to kill 4 deer / 4 wolves = 1 deer."
