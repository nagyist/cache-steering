  "query": "Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?",
  "steps": [
    "Emus have 1 head and 2 legs each.",
    "This means each emu contributes a total of 3 (1 head + 2 legs) to the total count of heads and legs.",
    "Farmer Brown's flock has a total of 60 heads and legs.",
    "Since each emu contributes 3 to the heads and legs count, I need to divide the total number by 3.",
    "Dividing 60 (total heads and legs) by 3 gives 20.",
    "This means there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock."

  "solution": "20"
