  "query": "A squirrel had stashed 210 acorns to last him the three winter months. It divided the pile into thirds, one for each month, and then took some from each third, leaving 60 acorns for each winter month. The squirrel combined the ones it took to eat in the first cold month of spring before plants were in bloom again. How many acorns does the squirrel have to eat at the beginning of spring?",
  "steps": [
    "The squirrel initially stashed 210 acorns for the winter.",
    "The squirrel divided the 210 acorns into thirds, meaning it allocated 210 / 3 = 70 acorns per month.",
    "The squirrel then left 60 acorns for each month, meaning it took 70 - 60 = 10 acorns from each monthly portion.",
    "Since there are three months and the squirrel took 10 acorns from each month, it collected 10 * 3 = 30 acorns in total.",
    "These are the acorns the squirrel has to eat at the beginning of spring."
