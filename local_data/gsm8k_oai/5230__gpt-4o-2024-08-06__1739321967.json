  "query": "Tara's parents gave her $90 for her birthday. Not wanting to spend it, Tara put the money in a new bank account that gains 10% interest annually. If she doesn't withdraw the money at all, how much will she have after a year?",
  "steps": [
    "Tara starts with $90 in her new bank account.",
    "The annual interest rate for her account is 10%.",
    "To calculate the interest earned in a year, I need to find 10% of $90.",
    "10% of $90 is calculated as \\(0.10 \\times 90 = 9\\).",
    "Tara will earn $9 in interest over one year.",
    "To find the total amount in the account after a year, I need to add the interest to the initial amount.",
    "The initial amount is $90 and the interest is $9, so the total is \\(90 + 9 = 99\\)."
