  "query": "A single kabob stick has 4 cubes of beef. A slab of beef that costs $25 can be cut into 80 cubes. How much must Simon spend to make 40 kabob sticks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cubes of beef are needed for one kabob stick.",
    "Each kabob stick requires 4 cubes of beef.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of cubes of beef needed for 40 kabob sticks.",
    "The number of cubes needed is 40 sticks * 4 cubes per stick = 160 cubes.",
    "I know that one slab of beef can be cut into 80 cubes.",
    "I need to determine how many slabs of beef are needed to get at least 160 cubes.",
    "To get the number of slabs needed, divide the total cubes required by the number of cubes per slab: 160 cubes / 80 cubes per slab = 2 slabs.",
    "Now, I calculate the total cost to purchase these slabs of beef.",
    "Each slab costs $25, so the cost for 2 slabs is 2 slabs * $25 per slab = $50."

  "solution": "50"
