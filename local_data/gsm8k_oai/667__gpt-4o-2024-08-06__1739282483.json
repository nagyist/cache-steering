  "query": "Madison takes her dog to the dog park. Counting Madison's dog, half the dogs have spots and 1/5 have pointy ears. If 15 dogs have spots, how many have pointy ears?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm given that half of the dogs have spots, and 1/5 have pointy ears.",
    "It is stated that 15 dogs have spots.",
    "Since 15 dogs with spots represent half of the total dogs, I need to find the total number of dogs.",
    "Since half of the dogs have spots, this implies that the total number of dogs is twice the number of dogs with spots.",
    "So, I calculate the total number of dogs as 15 (spots) * 2 = 30.",
    "I'm also told that 1/5 of the dogs have pointy ears.",
    "To find out how many dogs have pointy ears, I calculate 1/5 of the total number of dogs.",
    "1/5 of 30 dogs is calculated as 30 / 5 = 6.",
    "Therefore, 6 dogs have pointy ears."
