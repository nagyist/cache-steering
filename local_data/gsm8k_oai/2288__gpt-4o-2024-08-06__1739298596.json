  "query": "Brittany, Alex, and Jamy all share 600 marbles divided between them in the ratio 3:5:7. If Brittany gives Alex half of her marbles, what's the total number of marbles that Alex has?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find how the 600 marbles are divided between Brittany, Alex, and Jamy according to the ratio 3:5:7.",
    "The total parts of the ratio is 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 parts.",
    "Each part is worth 600 marbles / 15 parts = 40 marbles per part.",
    "Brittany has 3 parts, so Brittany has 3 * 40 = 120 marbles.",
    "Alex has 5 parts, so Alex has 5 * 40 = 200 marbles.",
    "Jamy has 7 parts, so Jamy has 7 * 40 = 280 marbles.",
    "Brittany gives Alex half of her marbles, which is half of 120 marbles.",
    "Half of Brittany\u2019s marbles is 120 / 2 = 60 marbles.",
    "Now, I need to add these 60 marbles to Alex\u2019s original 200 marbles.",
    "Alex now has 200 original marbles + 60 marbles from Brittany = 260 marbles."

  "solution": "260"
