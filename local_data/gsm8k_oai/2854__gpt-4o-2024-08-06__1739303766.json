  "query": "Javier exercised for 50 minutes every day for one week. Sanda exercised for 90 minutes on each of three days. How many minutes did Javier and Sanda exercise in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many minutes Javier exercised in a week.",
    "Javier exercised for 50 minutes every day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "I will multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days: 50 minutes/day * 7 days.",
    "50 * 7 = 350. Javier exercised for 350 minutes in total.",
    "Next, I will find out how many minutes Sanda exercised.",
    "Sanda exercised for 90 minutes on each of three days.",
    "I will multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days: 90 minutes/day * 3 days.",
    "90 * 3 = 270. Sanda exercised for 270 minutes in total.",
    "Now, I add the total minutes Javier and Sanda exercised to find the combined total.",
    "350 (Javier's total) + 270 (Sanda's total) = 620."

  "solution": "620"
