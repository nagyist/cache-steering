  "query": "Edmonton is 220 kilometers north of Red Deer. Calgary is 110 kilometers south of Red Deer. If you travel at 110 kilometers per hour, how long will it take to get from Edmonton to Calgary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total distance from Edmonton to Calgary. The problem states that Edmonton is 220 kilometers north of Red Deer and Calgary is 110 kilometers south of Red Deer.",
    "To find the total distance from Edmonton to Calgary, I need to add the distance from Edmonton to Red Deer and the distance from Red Deer to Calgary.",
    "The distance from Edmonton to Red Deer is 220 kilometers.",
    "The distance from Red Deer to Calgary is 110 kilometers.",
    "Adding these distances, I get 220 kilometers + 110 kilometers = 330 kilometers.",
    "Now, I know that the total distance from Edmonton to Calgary is 330 kilometers.",
    "Next, I need to determine the time it takes to travel this distance at a speed of 110 kilometers per hour.",
    "The formula for time is distance divided by speed. So, I will divide the total distance by the speed: 330 kilometers / 110 kilometers per hour.",
    "Performing the division: 330 / 110 = 3.",
    "Therefore, it will take 3 hours to travel from Edmonton to Calgary at a speed of 110 kilometers per hour."
