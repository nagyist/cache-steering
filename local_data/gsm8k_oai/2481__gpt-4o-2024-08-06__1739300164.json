  "steps": [
    "Mr. Wong harvested a total of 560 mangoes.",
    "He sold half of the mangoes at the market.",
    "To find out how many mangoes he sold, I need to calculate half of 560.",
    "Half of 560 is calculated as 560 divided by 2.",
    "560 divided by 2 equals 280.",
    "So, Mr. Wong sold 280 mangoes at the market.",

    "There are 8 neighbors to distribute the remaining mangoes among.",
    "To find out how many mangoes each neighbor receives, I need to divide 280 by 8.",
    "280 divided by 8 equals 35."
