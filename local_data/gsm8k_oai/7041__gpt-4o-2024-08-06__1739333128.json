  "query": "Elida has 5 letters while Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has. What's 10 times the average number of letters in both names?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many letters are in Adrianna's name.",
    "Elida has 5 letters.",
    "Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has.",
    "Twice the number of letters Elida has is 2 * 5 = 10.",
    "Adrianna has 2 less than 10, so she has 10 - 2 = 8 letters.",
    "Now, I need to find the average number of letters in both names.",
    "Elida has 5 letters and Adrianna has 8 letters.",
    "The total number of letters in both names is 5 + 8 = 13.",
    "There are 2 names, so the average number of letters is 13 / 2 = 6.5.",
    "Now, I need to find 10 times the average number of letters.",
    "10 times the average number of letters is 10 * 6.5 = 65."
