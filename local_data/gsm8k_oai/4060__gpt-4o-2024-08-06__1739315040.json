  "query": "There is a square playground that has a side length of 12 meters. There is a maintenance building on the playground that measures 8 meters by 5 meters. How many square meters of the playground is not covered by the maintenance building?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the square playground.",
    "The area of a square is given by side length squared.",
    "The side length of the playground is 12 meters.",
    "The area of the playground is 12 meters * 12 meters.",
    "The area of the playground is 144 square meters.",
    "Next, I need to find the area of the maintenance building.",
    "The maintenance building is 8 meters by 5 meters.",
    "I calculate the area by multiplying the length and the width.",
    "The area of the maintenance building is 8 meters * 5 meters.",
    "The area of the maintenance building is 40 square meters.",
    "Now, to find the area of the playground not covered by the building, I subtract the building's area from the playground's area.",
    "I subtract 40 square meters from 144 square meters.",
    "144 - 40 equals 104.",
    "The area of the playground not covered by the building is 104 square meters."
