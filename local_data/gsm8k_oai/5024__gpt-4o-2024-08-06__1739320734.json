  "query": "John trains for ultramarathons.  He starts only able to run 8 hours straight but eventually increases that by 75%.  He also increases his speed of 8 mph by 4 mph.  How far can he run now?",
  "steps": [
    "John starts by being able to run for 8 hours straight.",
    "He increases his running time by 75%.",
    "75% of 8 hours is calculated by multiplying 8 by 0.75, which equals 6 hours.",
    "Adding this to the original 8 hours, he can now run for 14 hours straight.",
    "John's initial speed is 8 mph.",
    "He increases his speed by 4 mph.",
    "Adding 4 mph to the original speed of 8 mph, he can now run at 12 mph.",
    "To find out how far he can run, we multiply the time he can run by his speed.",
    "Multiplying 14 hours by 12 mph gives us 168 miles."

  "solution": "168"
