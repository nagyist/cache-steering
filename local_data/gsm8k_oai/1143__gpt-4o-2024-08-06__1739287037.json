  "query": "The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.",
  "steps": [
    "I know the price of each wooden toy is $20.",
    "Kendra bought two wooden toys.",
    "I need to calculate the total cost of the wooden toys by multiplying the number of toys by the price of each toy.",
    "2 wooden toys \u00d7 $20 per toy = $40",
    "I know the price of each hat is $10.",
    "Kendra bought three hats.",
    "I need to calculate the total cost of the hats by multiplying the number of hats by the price of each hat.",
    "3 hats \u00d7 $10 per hat = $30",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount Kendra spent at the store.",
    "Total spent = Cost of wooden toys + Cost of hats",
    "Total spent = $40 + $30",
    "Total spent = $70",
    "Kendra went to the store with a $100 bill.",
    "I need to calculate the change Kendra received by subtracting the total amount spent from the amount of money she had initially.",
    "Change = Initial amount - Total spent",
    "Change = $100 - $70",
    "Change = $30"
