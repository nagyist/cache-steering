  "query": "There are 20 students in a class. Only one-fourth of the students stayed in the classroom while the rest went to the playground. Of those who went to the playground, one-third are boys. How many girls are there on the playground from this class?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of students in the class is 20.",
    "One-fourth of the students stayed in the classroom. To find this number, divide 20 by 4.",
    "20 divided by 4 equals 5 students stayed in the classroom.",
    "To find out how many students went to the playground, subtract the number of students who stayed in the classroom from the total number of students.",
    "20 minus 5 equals 15 students went to the playground.",
    "Now, of those who went to the playground, one-third are boys. To find the number of boys, divide 15 by 3.",
    "15 divided by 3 equals 5 boys went to the playground.",
    "To find the number of girls on the playground, subtract the number of boys from the total number of students on the playground.",
    "15 minus 5 equals 10 girls went to the playground."
