  "query": "Timmy plans to ride a skateboard ramp that is 50 feet high. He knows he needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top. He measures his speed on three trial runs and goes 36, 34, and 38 mph. How much faster does he have to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the average speed of Timmy's three trial runs.",
    "The speeds from the trial runs are 36 mph, 34 mph, and 38 mph.",
    "I add these speeds together: 36 + 34 + 38 = 108 mph.",
    "Now, I divide by the number of trial runs to get the average speed: 108 mph / 3 = 36 mph.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much faster Timmy needs to go compared to his average speed to meet the 40 mph requirement.",
    "Timmy's target speed is 40 mph and his average speed is 36 mph.",
    "I subtract the average speed from the target speed: 40 mph - 36 mph = 4 mph.",
    "Therefore, Timmy needs to go 4 mph faster than his average trial speed to reach the required speed of 40 mph."
