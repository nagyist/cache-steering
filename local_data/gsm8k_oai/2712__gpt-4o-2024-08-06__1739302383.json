  "query": "Caprice is taking piano lessons. Her mother pays the teacher $10 for every half-hour of teaching her daughter. If Caprice is taking one lesson per week, and the lesson lasts 1 hour, how much money would the teacher earn in 5 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how much Caprice's mother pays for a 1-hour lesson.",
    "Caprice's mother pays $10 for every half-hour of teaching.",
    "Since the lesson lasts 1 hour, this consists of two half-hour sessions.",
    "So, for a 1-hour lesson, the cost would be $10 per half-hour multiplied by 2 half-hours.",
    "This means $10 * 2 = $20 is paid for each 1-hour lesson.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much the teacher earns in 5 weeks.",
    "Caprice takes one lesson per week, and each lesson costs $20.",
    "Over 5 weeks, the total cost is $20 per lesson multiplied by 5 lessons.",
    "So, $20 * 5 = $100.",
    "The teacher earns $100 in 5 weeks."

  "solution": "100"
