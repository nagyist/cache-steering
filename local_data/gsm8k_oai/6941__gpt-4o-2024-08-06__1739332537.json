  "query": "Last Sunday, Logan went to church and realized that the number of children present was 80. If there were 60 male adults, and the total number of people in the church was 200, how many female adults were present?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of adults in the church.",
    "The total number of people in the church was 200, and the total number of children was 80.",
    "To find the total number of adults, I subtract the number of children from the total number of people: 200 - 80.",
    "200 - 80 = 120. Therefore, there are 120 adults in the church.",
    "Next, I know there are 60 male adults.",
    "To find the number of female adults, I subtract the number of male adults from the total number of adults: 120 - 60.",
    "120 - 60 = 60."
