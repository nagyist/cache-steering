  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total income from selling chocolate cookies.",
    "The problem states that each chocolate cookie is sold for $1.",
    "I sold 220 chocolate cookies.",
    "To find the total income from chocolate cookies, I multiply the number of chocolate cookies (220) by the price per chocolate cookie ($1).",

    "Now, I will calculate the total income from selling vanilla cookies.",
    "The problem states that each vanilla cookie is sold for $2.",
    "I sold 70 vanilla cookies.",
    "To find the total income from vanilla cookies, I multiply the number of vanilla cookies (70) by the price per vanilla cookie ($2).",
    "70 cookies multiplied by $2 equals $140.",
    "To find the total income from both types of cookies, I need to add the income from chocolate cookies and the income from vanilla cookies.",
