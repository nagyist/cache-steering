  "query": "A family bought a 24 pack of bottled water. They drank 1/3 of them on the first day and 1/2 of what was left after the first day on the second day. How many bottles of water remain after 2 days?",
  "steps": [
    "The family started with 24 bottles of water.",
    "On the first day, they drank 1/3 of the 24 bottles.",
    "To calculate 1/3 of 24, I divide 24 by 3, which equals 8.",
    "So, they drank 8 bottles on the first day.",
    "After the first day, they have 24 - 8 = 16 bottles left.",
    "On the second day, they drank 1/2 of the remaining 16 bottles.",
    "To calculate 1/2 of 16, I divide 16 by 2, which equals 8.",
    "So, they drank 8 more bottles on the second day.",
    "After the second day, they have 16 - 8 = 8 bottles remaining."
