  "query": "A tank with a capacity of 8000 gallons is 3/4 full. Daxton empty's the tank by 40% of the total volume of water in the tank to water his vegetable farm. He then fills the tank with 30% of the volume of water remaining in the tank. Calculate the final volume of water in the tank.",
  "steps": [
    "The tank has a capacity of 8000 gallons.",
    "It is currently 3/4 full.",
    "I need to calculate the initial volume of water in the tank.",
    "3/4 of 8000 gallons is calculated by multiplying 8000 by 0.75.",
    "8000 * 0.75 = 6000 gallons.",
    "The tank initially contains 6000 gallons of water.",
    "Daxton empties the tank by 40% of the total volume of water in the tank.",
    "40% of 6000 gallons is calculated by multiplying 6000 by 0.40.",
    "6000 * 0.40 = 2400 gallons.",
    "Daxton removes 2400 gallons of water from the tank.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the remaining volume of water in the tank after 2400 gallons are removed.",
    "The initial volume was 6000 gallons. After removing 2400 gallons, the remaining volume is 6000 - 2400 = 3600 gallons.",
    "Daxton then fills the tank with 30% of the volume of water remaining in the tank.",
    "30% of 3600 gallons is calculated by multiplying 3600 by 0.30.",
    "3600 * 0.30 = 1080 gallons.",
    "Daxton adds 1080 gallons of water to the tank.",
    "I need to calculate the final volume of water in the tank.",
    "The remaining volume was 3600 gallons. Adding 1080 gallons results in a total of 3600 + 1080 = 4680 gallons."
