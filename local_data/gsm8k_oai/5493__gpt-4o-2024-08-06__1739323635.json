  "query": "Christina's age will be half of 80 years in five years to come. If Oscar will be 3/5 times as old as Christina is now in 15 years, calculate Oscar's age now.",
  "steps": [
    "Christina's age in five years will be half of 80 years.",
    "Half of 80 years is 40 years.",
    "So, Christina will be 40 years old in five years.",
    "Currently, Christina's age is 40 - 5 = 35 years.",
    "Oscar will be 3/5 times Christina's current age (35 years) in 15 years.",
    "3/5 of Christina's current age is: 3/5 * 35 = 21 years.",
    "So, in 15 years, Oscar will be 21 years old.",
    "Oscar's current age is 21 - 15 = 6 years."
