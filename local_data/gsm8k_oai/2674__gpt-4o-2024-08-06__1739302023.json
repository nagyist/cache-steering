  "query": "Daisy is a poodle puppy who loves to play with her dog toys. She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?",
  "steps": [
    "On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys.",
    "On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some.",
    "Daisy's owner bought her 3 more dog toys on Tuesday.",
    "At the end of Tuesday, Daisy had 3 (from before) + 3 (bought) = 6 dog toys.",
    "On Wednesday, all of Daisy's 6 dog toys were missing.",
    "Daisy's owner bought her 5 more dog toys on Wednesday.",
    "Including the 5 new dog toys, Daisy had 0 (missing) + 5 (bought) = 5 dog toys on Wednesday.",
    "Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, which include the old ones from Monday and Tuesday, as well as the new toys bought on Wednesday.",
    "The total number of dog toys Daisy originally had on Monday was 5.",
    "The total number of dog toys bought was 3 on Tuesday and 5 on Wednesday.",
    "Adding up all the dog toys: 5 (from Monday) + 3 (bought Tuesday) + 5 (bought Wednesday) = 13 dog toys."
