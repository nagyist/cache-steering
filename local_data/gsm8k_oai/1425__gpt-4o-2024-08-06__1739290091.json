  "query": "Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour.",
    "Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour.",
    "Betty took a two-hour break, which means she didn't make any cupcakes during those two hours.",
    "First, let's calculate how many hours Betty was actually productive after her break. Since she worked for 5 hours in total and took a 2-hour break, she was productive for 5 - 2 = 3 hours.",
    "In 3 hours, Betty would make 10 cupcakes/hour * 3 hours = 30 cupcakes.",
    "Dora, on the other hand, worked uninterrupted for the entire 5 hours.",
    "In 5 hours, Dora would make 8 cupcakes/hour * 5 hours = 40 cupcakes.",
    "Now, let's find the difference in the number of cupcakes made. Dora made 40 cupcakes and Betty made 30 cupcakes.",
    "The difference between the number of cupcakes made by Dora and Betty is 40 - 30 = 10 cupcakes."
