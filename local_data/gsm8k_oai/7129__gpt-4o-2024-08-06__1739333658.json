  "query": "Mary was working on a research paper and already had borrowed 5 books from the library.  3 books weren't helpful so she returned those and checked out 5 more books.  3 days later, she went back to the library and returned 2 of those books and checked out 7 more books.  How many books does Mary currently have checked out of the library?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary initially borrowed 5 books from the library.",
    "She returned 3 books, so she had 5 - 3 = 2 books remaining.",
    "She checked out 5 more books, so she had 2 + 5 = 7 books.",
    "3 days later, Mary returned 2 books. So, she had 7 - 2 = 5 books left.",
    "She then checked out 7 more books, resulting in 5 + 7 = 12 books in total."
  ],
  "solution": "12"
