  "steps": [
    "Kenny played basketball for 10 hours.",
    "Kenny ran for twice as long as he played basketball.",
    "Since he played basketball for 10 hours, he ran for 10 * 2 hours.",
    "10 * 2 = 20, so Kenny ran for 20 hours.",
    "Kenny practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran.",
    "Since he ran for 20 hours, he practiced on the trumpet for 20 * 2 hours.",
    "20 * 2 = 40, so Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours."
