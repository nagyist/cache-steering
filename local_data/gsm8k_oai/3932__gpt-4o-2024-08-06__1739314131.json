  "query": "There is a lot of dust in Susie's house. It takes her 2 hours to vacuum the whole house. She can vacuum each room in 20 minutes. How many rooms does she have in her house?",
  "steps": [
    "Susie's entire house takes 2 hours to vacuum.",
    "I need to convert the total time from hours to minutes to make it comparable to the time taken per room.",
    "2 hours is the same as 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Each room takes 20 minutes to vacuum.",
    "To find the number of rooms, I need to divide the total time by the time it takes to vacuum each room.",
    "120 minutes divided by 20 minutes per room equals 6 rooms."
