  "query": "Conor can chop 12 eggplants, 9 carrots, and 8 potatoes in a day. If he works 4 times a week, how many vegetables can he chop?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of vegetables Conor can chop in a day.",
    "Conor can chop 12 eggplants, 9 carrots, and 8 potatoes in a day.",
    "To find the total, add the number of each type of vegetable he can chop: 12 + 9 + 8.",
    "12 + 9 equals 21.",
    "21 + 8 equals 29.",
    "So, Conor can chop 29 vegetables in a day.",
    "Next, calculate how many vegetables he can chop if he works 4 times a week.",
    "Multiply the number of vegetables he can chop in a day by the number of times he works in a week: 29 vegetables per day times 4 days per week.",
    "29 times 4 equals 116.",
