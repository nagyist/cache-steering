  "steps": [
    "Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot per day.",
    "There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag.",
    "Therefore, Harris uses 1 carrot each day, requiring him to use 1/5 of a bag each day.",
    "To determine how many bags of carrots Harris needs in one year, I need to find out how many days are in a year.",
    "There are typically 365 days in a year.",
    "So, Harris will use 365 carrots in a year.",
    "Since there are 5 carrots in a bag, then Harris will need 365 / 5 = 73 bags of carrots in one year.",
    "Each bag costs $2.00.",
    "So, the total cost for 73 bags of carrots is 73 \u00d7 $2.00.",
    "73 \u00d7 $2.00 = $146.00."
  ],
  "solution": "146"
