  "query": "John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes.  How many times does he use the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the duration of the movie in minutes.",
    "A 2.5-hour movie is 2.5 x 60 = 150 minutes long.",
    "Next, I need to determine how often John uses the bathroom.",
    "John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes.",
    "To find how many times he uses the bathroom during the movie, I need to divide the total movie time by the interval at which he uses the bathroom.",
    "150 minutes / 50 minutes per use = 3.",
    "I should double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.",
    "2.5 hours equals 150 minutes, which checks out.",
    "150 minutes divided by 50 minutes per use is indeed 3."
