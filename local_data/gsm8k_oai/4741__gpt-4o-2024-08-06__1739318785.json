    "Carson counts 6 clouds that look like funny animals.",
    "His little brother counts three times as many clouds that look like dragons.",
    "Three times 6 is calculated by multiplying 6 by 3.",
    "6 times 3 equals 18, so his little brother counts 18 clouds.",
    "To find the total number of clouds counted by both, add Carson's 6 clouds to his brother's 18 clouds.",
    "6 plus 18 equals 24."
