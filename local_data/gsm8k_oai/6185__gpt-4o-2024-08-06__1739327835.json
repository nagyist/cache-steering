  "query": "A factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour. It also produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour. How many products did the factory produce for 5 days if it works 9 hours a day?",
  "steps": [
    "The factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour.",
    "It produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators, so it produces 90 + 70 = 160 coolers per hour.",
    "The total number of products produced per hour is the sum of refrigerators and coolers: 90 refrigerators + 160 coolers = 250 products per hour.",
    "The factory works 9 hours a day.",
    "The number of products produced in one day is 9 hours * 250 products/hour = 2250 products.",
    "The factory operates for 5 days.",
    "The total number of products produced in 5 days is 5 days * 2250 products/day = 11250 products."
