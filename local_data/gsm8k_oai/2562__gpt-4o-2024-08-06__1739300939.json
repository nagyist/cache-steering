  "query": "If Jason eats three potatoes in 20 minutes, how long, in hours, would it take for him to eat all 27 potatoes cooked by his wife?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the rate at which Jason eats potatoes.",
    "According to the problem, Jason eats three potatoes in 20 minutes.",
    "I need to determine how many potatoes Jason eats per minute.",
    "If I divide 3 potatoes by 20 minutes, I get the rate in potatoes per minute: \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\) potatoes per minute.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it will take Jason to eat 27 potatoes.",
    "To do this, I can use the rate \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\) potatoes per minute to find the total time for 27 potatoes.",
    "To find the total time in minutes, I should set up a proportion or use the formula: total potatoes / rate = time. That would be 27 / \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\).",
    "Solving \\( 27 \\times \\frac{20}{3} \\) gives me the total time in minutes.",
    "27 multiplied by \\( \\frac{20}{3} \\) equals 180 minutes.",
    "Now I need to convert 180 minutes into hours.",
    "Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I divide 180 by 60.",
    "180 divided by 60 equals 3 hours."
