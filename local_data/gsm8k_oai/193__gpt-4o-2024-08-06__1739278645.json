  "query": "Melody planted sunflowers from two different seed packets. She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B.",
    "Let the height of the sunflowers from Packet B be x inches.",
    "I can express the height of sunflowers from Packet A as 1.20 times the height of sunflowers from Packet B.",
    "This gives me the equation: 1.20 * x = 192.",
    "To find x, which represents the height of sunflowers from Packet B, I need to solve the equation for x.",
    "I can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20.",
    "192 \u00f7 1.20 equals x.",
    "I will calculate 192 \u00f7 1.20.",
    "192 \u00f7 1.20 = 160.",
    "So, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches."

  "solution": "160"
