  "query": "Timmy's parents have a 2 car garage, which has both cars inside it.  Also inside is a riding lawnmower, a bicycle for Timmy as well as each of his parents, a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey, and a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices riding on.  How many wheels in total are in this garage?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the two cars in the garage.",
    "Each car typically has 4 wheels.",
    "Therefore, 2 cars will have 2 x 4 = 8 wheels.",
    "Next, there is a riding lawnmower in the garage.",
    "A standard riding lawnmower often has 4 wheels.",
    "So, the riding lawnmower adds 4 wheels.",
    "Considering the bicycles, there are three bicycles: one for Timmy and one for each of his parents.",
    "Each bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "Therefore, 3 bicycles will have 3 x 2 = 6 wheels.",
    "There's also a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey.",
    "A tricycle has 3 wheels.",
    "So, the tricycle adds 3 wheels.",
    "Finally, there is a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices on.",
    "A unicycle has 1 wheel.",
    "So, the unicycle adds 1 wheel.",
    "Now, I will sum all the wheels together.",
    "The total number of wheels is: 8 (from the cars) + 4 (from the riding lawnmower) + 6 (from the bicycles) + 3 (from the tricycle) + 1 (from the unicycle).",
    "Calculating this gives: 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22."

  "solution": "22"
