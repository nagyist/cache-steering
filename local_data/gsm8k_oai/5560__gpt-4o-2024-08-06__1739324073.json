    "I need to first determine the height of the middle-sized tree.",
    "The middle-sized tree is described as being 6 feet less than half the height of the tallest tree.",
    "The tallest tree is 108 feet tall.",
    "Half of the tallest tree's height is 108 / 2 = 54 feet.",
    "To find the middle tree's height, I subtract 6 from 54.",
    "54 - 6 = 48 feet.",
    "Now, I know that the middle-sized tree is 48 feet tall.",
    "Next, I need to determine the height of the smallest tree.",
    "The smallest tree is 1/4 the height of the middle-sized tree.",
    "I take 1/4 of 48 feet to find the height of the smallest tree.",
    "48 / 4 = 12 feet.",
    "The smallest tree is 12 feet tall."
