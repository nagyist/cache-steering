  "query": "Bob grew corn in his garden this year and ended up with 50 bushels. This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many ears of corn are in a bushel. Bob has 50 bushels of corn, and each bushel contains 14 ears.",
    "50 bushels * 14 ears per bushel = 700 ears of corn.",
    "Next, I'll add up how many bushels Bob gave away to his friends. Terry took 8 bushels, Jerry took 3 bushels, and Linda took 12 bushels.",
    "Total bushels given away to these three friends: 8 + 3 + 12 = 23 bushels.",
    "I need to calculate the number of ears in these 23 bushels that were given away.",
    "23 bushels * 14 ears per bushel = 322 ears.",
    "Bob also gave Stacy 21 ears of corn, which are not in bushels, so these should be subtracted separately.",
    "Now I add the 322 ears in bushels and the 21 separate ears given to Stacy.",
    "322 ears + 21 ears = 343 ears given away in total.",
    "Subtract the total ears given away from the total ears Bob initially had to find out how many he has left.",
    "700 ears initially - 343 ears given away = 357 ears left."

  "solution": "357"
