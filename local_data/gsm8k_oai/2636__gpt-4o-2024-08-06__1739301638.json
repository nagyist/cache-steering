  "query": "At school today, Charlize was 20 minutes late. Four of her classmates were each ten minutes late than she was. What's the total time for which the five students were late?",
  "steps": [
    "Charlize was 20 minutes late.",
    "Each of the four classmates was 10 minutes later than Charlize, so they were each 20 + 10 = 30 minutes late.",
    "To find the total time for which the five students were late, add Charlize's time to the total time for her classmates.",
    "Charlize's lateness contributes 20 minutes to the total.",
    "Each of the four classmates contributes 30 minutes.",
    "Calculate the total lateness for Charlize's classmates: 4 classmates * 30 minutes each = 120 minutes.",
    "The total lateness is Charlize's 20 minutes + 120 minutes from her classmates = 140 minutes."
