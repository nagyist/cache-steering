    "Let's first determine the current age of Arman's sister. Four years ago, she was 2 years old.",
    "To find her current age, add 4 years to her age from four years ago: 2 + 4 = 6 years old.",
    "Arman is six times older than his sister, who is currently 6 years old.",
    "Calculate Arman's current age by multiplying his sister's current age by 6: 6 * 6 = 36 years old.",
    "We need to determine in how many years Arman's age will be 40.",
    "Subtract Arman's current age from 40 to find out how many years it will take for him to reach that age: 40 - 36 = 4."
