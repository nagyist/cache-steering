  "steps": [
    "Mrs. Taylor bought two televisions that cost $650 each.",
    "First, I will calculate the initial total cost of the two televisions without any discount.",
    "The cost of one television is $650, so the cost for two televisions is \\(2 \\times 650 = 1300\\).",
    "Next, I need to consider the discount provided on the total sales price.",
    "The discount percentage is 25%.",
    "To find the discount amount, I will calculate 25% of $1300.",
    "25% of \\(1300\\) is \\((25 / 100) \\times 1300 = 325\\).",
    "The discount amount is $325.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original total price to find out how much Mrs. Taylor actually paid.",
    "The actual amount paid is \\(1300 - 325 = 975\\)."

  "solution": "975"
