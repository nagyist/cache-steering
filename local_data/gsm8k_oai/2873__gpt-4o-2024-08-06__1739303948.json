  "query": "Diana wants to buy winter clothes for all the 40 children at her local children's home. The home has five times as many teenagers as toddlers. There are also some newborns. If there are 6 toddlers, for how many newborns will Diana be shopping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Diana is buying clothes for 40 children. The children are categorized into teenagers, toddlers, and newborns.",
    "I know there are 6 toddlers.",
    "The problem states that there are five times as many teenagers as toddlers.",
    "Since there are 6 toddlers, the number of teenagers is 5 times 6, which equals 30.",
    "Now, I know there are 6 toddlers and 30 teenagers. So, let me calculate the total number of toddlers and teenagers together.",
    "Adding the numbers, 6 toddlers plus 30 teenagers equals 36 children.",
    "The total number of children Diana is buying clothes for is 40.",
    "If there are 36 toddlers and teenagers combined, there must be some newborns to make the total 40 children.",
    "Subtracting the number of toddlers and teenagers from the total, 40 minus 36 equals 4.",
    "So, there are 4 newborns."
