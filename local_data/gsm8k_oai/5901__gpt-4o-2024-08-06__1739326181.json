  "query": "Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster and 3 tickets to ride the giant slide. How many tickets does she need to ride the roller coaster 7 times and the giant slide 4 times?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tickets Janet needs for each ride.",
    "Riding the roller coaster once requires 5 tickets.",
    "Riding the giant slide once requires 3 tickets.",
    "Next, I calculate the total tickets Janet needs to ride the roller coaster 7 times.",
    "For 7 rides, she needs 7 times 5 tickets.",
    "7 times 5 is 35.",
    "Thus, Janet needs 35 tickets to ride the roller coaster 7 times.",
    "Now, I calculate the total tickets Janet needs to ride the giant slide 4 times.",
    "For 4 rides, she needs 4 times 3 tickets.",
    "4 times 3 is 12.",
    "Thus, Janet needs 12 tickets to ride the giant slide 4 times.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of tickets Janet needs for all the rides combined.",
    "I add the tickets for the roller coaster (35 tickets) to the tickets for the giant slide (12 tickets).",
    "35 plus 12 is 47."

  "solution": "47"
