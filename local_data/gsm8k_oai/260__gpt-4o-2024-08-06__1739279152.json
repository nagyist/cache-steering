  "query": "Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon.  How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine how many hours past noon we are considering, which is 6 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the length of the shadows in feet. Since the shadows stretch an extra 5 feet each hour, after 6 hours, they will be 6 hours \u00d7 5 feet/hour.",
    "6 hours \u00d7 5 feet/hour = 30 feet",
    "Now, I need to convert the length of the shadows from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot.",
    "So, I multiply the total feet by 12 inches/foot to get the length in inches: 30 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot.",
    "30 \u00d7 12 = 360"
  ],
  "solution": "360"
