  "query": "Zara bought 24 cows, 7 sheep, and some goats. Next week, she will transport all of them to a new farm in 3 equally-sized groups of 48 animals per group. How many goats does she own?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of cows and sheep Zara has.",
    "Zara bought 24 cows.",
    "Zara bought 7 sheep.",
    "Add the number of cows and sheep: 24 + 7 = 31 animals.",
    "I know the total number of animals will be 3 groups of 48 animals each.",
    "Calculate the total number of animals planned for transportation: 3 groups * 48 animals/group = 144 animals.",
    "Zara has 31 cows and sheep combined.",
    "To find the number of goats, subtract the number of cows and sheep from the total number of animals.",
    "Calculate the number of goats: 144 animals - 31 cows and sheep = 113 goats."

  "solution": "113"
