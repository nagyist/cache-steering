  "query": "Ryan has 40 balls. There are twice as many red balls as blue while the rest are green. If there are 11 blue balls, how many green balls are there?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many balls are green.",
    "First, I need to determine how many red balls there are.",
    "I am told that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls.",
    "There are 11 blue balls.",
    "So, the number of red balls is 2 times 11.",
    "Calculating that gives me 22 red balls.",
    "Now, I can find out the total number of non-green balls by adding the red and blue balls.",
    "Adding 22 red balls and 11 blue balls gives me 33 balls that are not green.",
    "Ryan has 40 balls in total.",
    "To find the green balls, I subtract the non-green (33) from the total (40).",
    "40 balls minus 33 non-green balls equals 7 green balls."
