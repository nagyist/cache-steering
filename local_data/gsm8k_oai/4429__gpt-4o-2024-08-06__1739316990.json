  "query": "Ivy drinks 2.5 liters of water each day. How many bottles of 2-liter water should Ivy buy for her 4 days consumption?",
  "steps": [
    "Ivy drinks 2.5 liters of water each day.",
    "I need to find out how much water Ivy will consume in 4 days.",
    "To do that, I'll multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 2.5 liters/day * 4 days = 10 liters.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 2-liter bottles are required for 10 liters of water.",
    "Each bottle contains 2 liters, so I'll divide the total liters by the volume of each bottle: 10 liters / 2 liters/bottle = 5 bottles."

  "solution": "5"
