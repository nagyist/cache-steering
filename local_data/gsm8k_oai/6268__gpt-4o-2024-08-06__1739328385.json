  "query": "Maryann spends seven times as long doing accounting as calling clients. If she worked 560 minutes today, how many minutes did she spend calling clients?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to establish a relationship between the time Maryann spends on accounting and calling clients.",
    "Let the time spent calling clients be \\( x \\) minutes.",
    "Then, the time spent on accounting would be \\( 7x \\) because it is seven times the time spent calling clients.",
    "The total time worked is the sum of time spent on various activities: \\( x + 7x = 560 \\).",
    "I can combine the like terms: \\( 8x = 560 \\).",
    "Now, I need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8.",
    "So, \\( x = \\frac{560}{8} \\).",
    "Calculating \\( \\frac{560}{8} \\).",
    "560 divided by 8 is 70.",
    "So, \\( x = 70 \\).",
    "Therefore, Maryann spent 70 minutes calling clients."
