  "query": "Mario has 3 hibiscus plants in his garden.  The first hibiscus plant has 2 flowers.  The second hibiscus plant has twice as many flowers as the first hibiscus plant.  The third hibiscus plant has four times as many flowers as the second hibiscus plant.  How many total blossoms does Mario have?",
  "steps": [
    "The first hibiscus plant has 2 flowers.",
    "The second hibiscus plant has twice as many flowers as the first hibiscus plant. This means it has 2 * 2 = 4 flowers.",
    "The third hibiscus plant has four times as many flowers as the second hibiscus plant. Therefore, it has 4 * 4 = 16 flowers.",
    "To find the total number of blossoms, I will add the flowers from all three plants: 2 (first plant) + 4 (second plant) + 16 (third plant).",
    "2 + 4 = 6",
    "6 + 16 = 22"
