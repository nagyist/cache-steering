  "query": "John has to hire a lawyer.  He pays $1000 upfront.  He then gets charged $100 per hour.  The lawyer has to work 50 hours in court time.  It takes 2 times that long in prep time.  His brother pays half the fee.  How much did John pay?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by calculating the total hours the lawyer works in court: 50 hours.",
    "Next, I calculate the prep time. It is 2 times the court time: 2 * 50 = 100 hours.",
    "I now add the court time and the prep time to get the total hours worked: 50 hours + 100 hours = 150 hours.",
    "The lawyer charges $100 per hour. I calculate the total charge for hourly work: 150 hours * $100 per hour = $15,000.",
    "John initially paid $1,000 upfront, so I add this to the total hourly charges: $15,000 + $1,000 = $16,000.",
    "John's brother pays half of the total fee. So I divide the total fee by 2 to find out how much the brother pays: $16,000 / 2 = $8,000.",
    "To find out how much John pays, I subtract the amount paid by his brother from the total fee: $16,000 - $8,000 = $8,000."

  "solution": "8000"
