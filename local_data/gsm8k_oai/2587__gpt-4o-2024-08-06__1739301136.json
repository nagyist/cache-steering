  "query": "In order to train for his fights Rocky would run 4 miles on day one of training.  Rocky would double the miles for day 2, and triple the miles from day 2 for day 3.  How many miles did Rocky run in the first three days of training?",
  "steps": [
    "On day one, Rocky runs 4 miles.",
    "On day two, Rocky doubles the miles from day one: 4 miles * 2 = 8 miles.",
    "On day three, Rocky triples the miles from day two: 8 miles * 3 = 24 miles.",
    "Now, I need to find the total miles Rocky ran in the first three days by adding them up.",
    "Total miles = 4 miles (day one) + 8 miles (day two) + 24 miles (day three).",
