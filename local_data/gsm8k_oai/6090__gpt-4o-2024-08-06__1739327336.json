  "query": "A gym charges its members $18 twice a month.  If it has 300 members how much does it make a month?",
  "steps": [
    "The gym charges each member $18 twice a month.",
    "I need to calculate how much each member pays in total per month.",
    "Each member pays $18 twice a month, so the total paid by one member in a month is $18 + $18.",
    "Calculating that gives $36 per member each month.",
    "Now I need to find out the total revenue from all 300 members in a month.",
    "Each of the 300 members pays $36 a month.",
    "So, I need to multiply 300 members by $36 to find the total monthly revenue.",
    "Calculating 300 members * $36 gives $10,800."

  "solution": "10800"
