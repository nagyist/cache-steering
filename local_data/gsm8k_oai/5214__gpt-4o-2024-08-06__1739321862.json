  "query": "Derek was 6 years old when he had three times as many dogs as cars. Ten years later, after selling some of his dogs and buying 210 more cars, the number of cars became twice the number of dogs. How many dogs does Derek have now if he had 90 dogs when he was six years old?",
  "steps": [
    "When Derek was 6, he had 90 dogs.",
    "He also had three times as many dogs as cars.",
    "Let's define the number of cars Derek had at age 6 as C.",
    "Therefore, 3C = 90 since he had three times as many dogs as cars.",
    "Solve for C: C = 90 / 3.",
    "C = 30. Thus, Derek had 30 cars when he was 6.",
    "Ten years later, Derek would be 16 years old.",
    "During those ten years, Derek sold some dogs and bought 210 more cars.",
    "The number of cars became twice the number of dogs at age 16.",
    "Let D be the number of dogs Derek has now (at age 16).",
    "The number of cars he has now is 30 + 210 = 240 cars.",
    "The problem states that the number of cars (240) is twice the number of dogs (D) now.",
    "So, 240 = 2D.",
    "Solve for D: D = 240 / 2.",
    "D = 120. Thus, Derek has 120 dogs now."

  "solution": "120"
