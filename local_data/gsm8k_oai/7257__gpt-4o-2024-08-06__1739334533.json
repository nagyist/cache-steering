  "query": "James buys 20 pounds of beef and half that much pork.  He uses 1.5 pounds of meat to make meals at his restaurant.  Each meal sells for $20.  How much money did he make?",
  "steps": [
    "James buys 20 pounds of beef.",
    "He buys half that much pork, which is 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of pork.",
    "In total, James has 20 + 10 = 30 pounds of meat.",
    "He uses 1.5 pounds of meat per meal.",
    "To find out how many meals he can make, we divide the total pounds of meat by the pounds per meal: 30 / 1.5 = 20 meals.",
    "Each meal sells for $20.",
    "To find out how much money he makes, we multiply the number of meals by the price per meal: 20 meals * $20/meal = $400."
