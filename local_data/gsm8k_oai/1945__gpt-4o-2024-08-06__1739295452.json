  "query": "Diego can carry 20 pounds of fruit home in his bookbag. If he buys a pound of watermelon, a pound of grapes, and a pound of oranges, how many pounds of apples can he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Diego can carry a total of 20 pounds of fruit in his bookbag.",
    "He buys 1 pound of watermelon.",
    "He buys 1 pound of grapes.",
    "He buys 1 pound of oranges.",
    "He has bought a total of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 pounds of fruit.",
    "To find out how many pounds of apples he can still buy, I need to subtract the weight of the fruit he already has from the total capacity.",
    "20 pounds total capacity - 3 pounds already bought = 17 pounds.",
    "So, Diego can buy 17 pounds of apples."

  "solution": "17"
