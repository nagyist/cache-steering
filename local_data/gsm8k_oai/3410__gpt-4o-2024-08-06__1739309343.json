  "query": "Suzie and 5 of her friends decide to rent an Airbnb at Lake Tahoe for 4 days from Thursday to Sunday. The rental rate for weekdays is $420 per day. The weekend rental rate is $540 per day. They all decide to split the rental evenly. How much does each person have to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total rental cost for the entire stay.",
    "There are 2 weekdays (Thursday and Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) in the stay.",
    "The cost for weekdays is $420 per day. For 2 weekdays, the cost is 2 multiplied by $420.",
    "2 * $420 equals $840.",
    "The cost for weekend days is $540 per day. For 2 weekend days, the cost is 2 multiplied by $540.",
    "2 * $540 equals $1,080.",
    "Now, I add the costs for the weekdays and the weekend days together to get the total cost.",
    "$840 + $1,080 equals $1,920 in total rental cost.",
    "There are 6 people in total (Suzie and 5 friends) sharing this cost.",
    "To find out how much each person has to pay, I divide the total rent by the number of people.",
    "$1,920 \u00f7 6 equals $320."
  ],
  "solution": "320"
