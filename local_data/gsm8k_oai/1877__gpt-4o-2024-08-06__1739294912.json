  "query": "Maya loves to read books. Last week she read 5 books. Each book had 300 pages of text. This week she read twice as much. How many pages did Maya read in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Last week, Maya read 5 books.",
    "Each book last week had 300 pages.",
    "To find the total pages she read last week, I need to multiply the number of books by the number of pages per book.",
    "5 books * 300 pages per book = 1500 pages last week.",
    "This week, Maya read twice as much as she did last week.",
    "Twice the number of pages she read last week is 2 * 1500 pages.",
    "2 * 1500 pages = 3000 pages this week.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pages Maya read over these two weeks.",
    "Total pages = pages last week + pages this week.",
    "Total pages = 1500 pages + 3000 pages.",
    "1500 pages + 3000 pages = 4500 pages."

  "solution": "4500"
