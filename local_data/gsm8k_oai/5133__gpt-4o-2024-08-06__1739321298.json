There was a raffle which brought in $343. The sale of cakes and drinks brought $279. At the end of the fair, the principal of the school shared the money raised between the 5 classes. How much money did each class receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money raised from all activities.",
    "The entrance tickets brought in $368.",
    "The raffle brought in $343.",
    "The sale of cakes and drinks brought in $279.",
    "Now, I need to add all these amounts together to find the total money raised.",
    "The total raised is $368 + $343 + $279.",
    "Let's add these amounts step by step: $368 + $343 = $711.",
    "Next, $711 + $279 = $990.",
    "The total amount of money raised is $990.",
    "The principal divided this total amount equally among the 5 classes.",
    "To find out how much each class received, I need to divide $990 by 5.",
    "$990 divided by 5 is $198.",
    "Each class received $198."
