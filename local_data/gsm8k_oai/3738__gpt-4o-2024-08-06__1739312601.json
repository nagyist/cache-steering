  "query": "Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the original prices of the items: a backpack costs $50, and each ring-binder costs $20.",
    "Next, I determine the price changes. The backpack price increased by $5, so the new backpack price is $50 + $5 = $55.",
    "The ring-binder price decreased by $2. Therefore, the new ring-binder price is $20 - $2 = $18.",
    "Julieta bought one backpack and three ring-binders. I calculate the total cost of the backpack: $55.",
    "Now, I calculate the total cost of the three ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54.",
    "To find the total amount Julieta spent, I combine the costs of the backpack and the ring-binders: $55 + $54.",
    "I add $55 and $54, which equals $109."

  "solution": "109"
