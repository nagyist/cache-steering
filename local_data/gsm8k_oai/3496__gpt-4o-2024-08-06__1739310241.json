  "steps": [
    "To determine the total number of tomato plants, I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of plants per row.",
    "The farmer planted 30 rows of tomatoes.",
    "There are 10 plants in each row.",
    "I need to multiply 30 rows by 10 plants per row.",
    "30 multiplied by 10 equals 300.",
    "The farmer has a total of 300 tomato plants.",
    "Each tomato plant yields 20 pieces of tomatoes.",
    "To find the total yield, I need to multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant.",
    "I need to multiply 300 plants by 20 pieces of tomatoes per plant.",
    "300 multiplied by 20 equals 6000."
