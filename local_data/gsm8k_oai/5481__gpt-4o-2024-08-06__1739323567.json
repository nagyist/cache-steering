  "query": "Calvin and Phoebe each have 8 more pastries than Frank but only five less than Grace. If Grace has 30 pastries, calculate the total number of pastries that the four have?",
  "steps": [
    "Start with the number of pastries Grace has. According to the problem, Grace has 30 pastries.",
    "Calvin and Phoebe each have five less than Grace. So, Calvin and Phoebe each have 30 - 5 pastries.",
    "Calculate 30 - 5 to find how many pastries Calvin and Phoebe have. This equals 25 pastries each.",
    "Calvin and Phoebe each have 8 more pastries than Frank. So, Frank has 25 - 8 pastries.",
    "Calculate 25 - 8 to find how many pastries Frank has. This equals 17 pastries.",
    "Now, add up all the pastries that each person has to find the total number of pastries: Grace has 30, Calvin has 25, Phoebe has 25, and Frank has 17.",
    "Calculate 30 + 25 + 25 + 17 to get the total number of pastries.",
    "30 + 25 = 55.",
    "55 + 25 = 80.",
    "80 + 17 = 97."
