  "query": "Janice needs to go to watch a movie in 2 hours. before she could leave, she needs to finish her homework which takes 30 minutes; clean her room which takes half as long as her homework; walk the dog which takes 5 minutes more than making homework; take out the trash which takes 1/6 of the time it takes her to do the homework. How many more minutes do Janice have left before the movie starts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes Janice to complete each task: doing homework, cleaning her room, walking the dog, and taking out the trash.",
    "Janice's homework takes 30 minutes.",
    "Cleaning the room takes half the time of the homework. So, it's 30 minutes / 2 = 15 minutes.",
    "Walking the dog takes 5 minutes more than the homework. So, it's 30 minutes + 5 = 35 minutes.",
    "Taking out the trash takes 1/6 of the time of the homework. So, it's 30 minutes / 6 = 5 minutes.",
    "Now I'll sum up all the time needed for these tasks: 30 minutes (homework) + 15 minutes (cleaning) + 35 minutes (walking the dog) + 5 minutes (trash).",
    "Adding these together: 30 + 15 + 35 + 5 = 85 minutes.",
    "Janice has 2 hours before the movie starts. 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "I need to subtract the total task time from the available time to find out how much time Janice has left: 120 minutes - 85 minutes.",
    "120 - 85 = 35 minutes."

  "solution": "35"
