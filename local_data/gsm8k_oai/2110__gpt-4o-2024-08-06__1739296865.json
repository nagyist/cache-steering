  "query": "In a grocery store, Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers and 3 packs of M&M's. If each piece of Snickers costs $1.5 and a pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers, how much is Julia's change if she gave the cashier 2 $10 bills?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of one pack of M&M's.",
    "The cost of 2 Snickers is \\(2 \\times \\$1.5 = \\$3\\).",
    "Therefore, a pack of M&M's costs \\$3.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total cost of the Snickers that Julia bought.",
    "Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers, each costing \\$1.5, so the total cost for Snickers is \\(2 \\times \\$1.5 = \\$3\\).",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the M&M's that Julia bought.",
    "Julia bought 3 packs of M&M's, each costing \\$3, so the total cost for M&M's is \\(3 \\times \\$3 = \\$9\\).",
    "Now, I will find the total cost of all the candies Julia bought.",
    "The total cost is the sum of the Snickers and M&M's, so it is \\$3 + \\$9 = \\$12.",
    "Julia gave the cashier two $10 bills, which amounts to \\$20.",
    "To find the change, I subtract the total cost from the amount Julia paid. Therefore, the change is \\$20 - \\$12 = \\$8."
