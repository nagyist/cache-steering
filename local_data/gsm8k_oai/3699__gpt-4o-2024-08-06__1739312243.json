  "query": "Carol has $60 and saves $9 per week. Mike has $90 and saves $3 per week. How many weeks before Carol and Mike both have the same amount of money?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the expression for the amount of money Carol has after a given number of weeks.",
    "Carol starts with $60 and saves $9 per week. So, after \\( x \\) weeks, Carol will have \\( 60 + 9x \\) dollars.",
    "Now, I should find the expression for the amount of money Mike has after the same number of weeks.",
    "Mike starts with $90 and saves $3 per week. So, after \\( x \\) weeks, Mike will have \\( 90 + 3x \\) dollars.",
    "The task is to find the number of weeks before Carol and Mike have the same amount of money.",
    "I need to set the expressions for the amount of money Carol and Mike have equal to each other: \\( 60 + 9x = 90 + 3x \\).",
    "To solve the equation, I'll start by subtracting \\( 3x \\) from both sides: \\( 60 + 6x = 90 \\).",
    "Next, subtract 60 from both sides: \\( 6x = 30 \\).",
    "Now, divide both sides by 6 to find \\( x \\): \\( x = 5 \\).",
    "I have found that it will take 5 weeks for Carol and Mike to have the same amount of money."
