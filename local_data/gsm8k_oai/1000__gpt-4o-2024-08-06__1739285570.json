    "First, I need to find out how many times John uses the heating pad in total.",
    "John uses the heating pad 3 times a week.",
    "He uses it for 2 weeks.",
    "To find the total number of uses, I multiply the number of uses per week by the number of weeks: 3 uses/week * 2 weeks = 6 uses.",
    "John spends $30 on the heating pad in total.",
    "To find out how much he spends per use, divide the total cost by the number of uses: $30 / 6 uses = $5 per use."
