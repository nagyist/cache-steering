  "query": "Jeff is collecting matchbox cars. He has twice as many cars as trucks. He has 60 total vehicles. How many trucks does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of trucks be T.",
    "According to the problem, the number of cars is twice the number of trucks, so the number of cars is 2T.",
    "The total number of vehicles is the sum of the number of trucks and cars, which is T + 2T.",
    "Simplify the expression: T + 2T = 3T.",
    "The problem states that the total number of vehicles is 60. So, we have the equation 3T = 60.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for T: T = 60 / 3.",
    "Perform the division: T = 20."
  ],
  "solution": "20"
