  "query": "Half of Taylor's house guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee in the morning.  Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak and he doubles that amount to make it strong.  If he makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee, how many tablespoons of coffee will he need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cups of weak coffee Taylor is making. According to the problem, he makes 12 cups of weak coffee.",
    "For weak coffee, he uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup. Therefore, for 12 cups of weak coffee, he needs 12 tablespoons of coffee.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cups of strong coffee Taylor is making. According to the problem, he makes 12 cups of strong coffee as well.",
    "For strong coffee, he uses double the amount of coffee per cup compared to weak coffee. So, he uses 2 tablespoons per cup for strong coffee.",
    "Therefore, for 12 cups of strong coffee, he needs 12 * 2 = 24 tablespoons of coffee.",
    "Now I need to find the total amount of coffee (in tablespoons) that he will need for both types of coffee. I will add the coffee required for weak coffee and the coffee required for strong coffee: 12 + 24 = 36 tablespoons."
