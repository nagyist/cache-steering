  "query": "Emerson and his friends love rowing and don't miss the sport on weekends. Starting in the morning, Emerson rowed and was 6 miles away from his starting point on a particular weekend. He continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed, only stopping for a while for rest before covering the remaining 18 miles. What's the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the initial distance Emerson covered.",
    "The problem states that Emerson was already 6 miles away from his starting point initially.",
    "Next, I need to consider the distance Emerson continued to row.",
    "It is mentioned that he rowed another 15 miles.",
    "Then, Emerson took a break and covered the remaining part of his trip.",
    "The last part of the trip was 18 miles.",
    "I need to calculate the total distance covered by summing these segments: the initial 6 miles, the next 15 miles, and the last 18 miles.",
    "First, I add the initial 6 miles and the 15 miles: 6 + 15 = 21 miles.",
    "Now, I add the remaining 18 miles Emerson covered after his break: 21 + 18.",
    "21 + 18 = 39 miles."

  "solution": "39"
