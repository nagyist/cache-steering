  "query": "Kimmie received $450 from her handmade crafts at the supermarket. Her friend Zahra received 1/3 less money when she sold the same amount of handmade crafts at Etsy. If both of them save half of their earnings on the same savings account, calculate the total amount of money in the joint savings account?",
  "steps": [
    "Kimmie received $450 from her handmade crafts at the supermarket.",
    "We need to calculate how much Zahra received from her sales on Etsy.",
    "Zahra received 1/3 less money than Kimmie.",
    "To find 1/3 of Kimmie's earnings, we calculate $450 divided by 3.",
    "$450 divided by 3 equals $150.",
    "Since Zahra received 1/3 less, we subtract $150 from Kimmie's total earnings.",
    "$450 minus $150 equals $300.",
    "Zahra received $300 from her sales on Etsy.",
    "Kimmie and Zahra save half of their earnings.",
    "Kimmie saves half of $450.",
    "$450 divided by 2 equals $225.",
    "Kimmie saves $225.",
    "Zahra saves half of $300.",
    "$300 divided by 2 equals $150.",
    "Zahra saves $150.",
    "To calculate the total amount of money in the joint savings account, add Kimmie's savings and Zahra's savings together.",
    "$225 plus $150 equals $375."
