    "First, I need to determine the number of boys at the party.",
    "30% of the 50 people are boys.",

    "30% of 50 is calculated as (30/100) * 50.",
    "(30/100) * 50 equals 15.",
    "So, there are 15 boys at the party.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many girls are at the party.",
    "There are a total of 50 people, and 15 of them are boys.",
    "The number of girls is the total number of people minus the number of boys.",
