  "query": "Mark constructed a deck that was 30 feet by 40 feet.  It cost $3 per square foot.  He then paid an extra $1 per square foot for sealant.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "The deck dimensions are given as 30 feet by 40 feet.",
    "To find the area of the deck, multiply its length and width: 30 feet * 40 feet.",
    "30 times 40 equals 1200 square feet, which is the area of the deck.",
    "The cost for constructing the deck is $3 per square foot.",
    "To find the total construction cost, multiply the area (1200 square feet) by the rate ($3 per square foot).",
    "1200 times 3 equals $3600, which is the cost of constructing the deck.",
    "Mark also paid an extra $1 per square foot for sealant.",
    "To find the total sealant cost, multiply the area (1200 square feet) by the rate for the sealant ($1 per square foot).",
    "1200 times 1 equals $1200, which is the cost for the sealant.",
    "To find the total amount Mark paid, add the cost of construction and the cost of the sealant together.",
    "$3600 plus $1200 equals $4800."

  "solution": "4800"
