  "query": "Mary and Jimmy start running from the same spot, but in opposite directions. Mary runs at 5 miles per hour and Jimmy runs at 4 miles per hour. What is the distance between them after 1 hour?",

    "Mary is running at 5 miles per hour.",
    "Jimmy is running at 4 miles per hour.",
    "They are running in opposite directions.",
    "After 1 hour, Mary will have run 5 miles (since distance = speed \u00d7 time).",
    "After 1 hour, Jimmy will have run 4 miles.",
    "To find the distance between them, I need to add the distances they have each traveled, since they are going in opposite directions.",
    "Distance between Mary and Jimmy = 5 miles (Mary) + 4 miles (Jimmy) = 9 miles."
