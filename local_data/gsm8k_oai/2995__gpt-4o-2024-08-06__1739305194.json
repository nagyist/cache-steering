  "query": "Amiyah is cutting some trees to build a cow shade. For every tree she cuts, she plants 5 new trees. If there were 400 trees on her farm and she cut 20% of them, calculate the total number of trees on the farm.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many trees Amiyah cuts down.",
    "20% of the trees were cut down, and there were originally 400 trees.",
    "I calculate 20% of 400. 20% is 0.2 in decimal form.",
    "0.2 multiplied by 400 equals 80. So, Amiyah cut down 80 trees.",
    "For every tree she cuts, she plants 5 new ones.",
    "Since she cut down 80 trees, she plants 80 multiplied by 5 new trees.",
    "80 times 5 is 400. So, she planted 400 new trees.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of trees on the farm now.",
    "Originally, there were 400 trees. She cut down 80 trees, so 400 minus 80 equals 320 trees remaining.",
    "Then she planted 400 new trees.",
    "Now to find the total number of trees, I add the remaining 320 to the 400 new trees.",
    "320 plus 400 equals 720."
  ],
  "solution": "720"
