  "query": "There were 180 apples in each crate. 12 such crates of apples were delivered to a factory. 160 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away. The remaining apples were packed into boxes of 20 apples each. How many boxes of apples were there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate the total number of apples delivered.",
    "Each crate has 180 apples.",
    "There are 12 crates.",
    "Multiply the number of crates by the number of apples per crate: 12 * 180.",
    "12 * 180 equals 2160 apples.",
    "Next, subtract the number of rotten apples from the total.",
    "There were 160 rotten apples.",
    "Subtract 160 from 2160 to find the number of good apples: 2160 - 160.",
    "2160 - 160 equals 2000 good apples.",
    "Now, we need to determine how many boxes of 20 apples can be packed with the 2000 apples.",
    "Divide the number of good apples by the number of apples per box: 2000 / 20.",
    "2000 divided by 20 equals 100."

  "solution": "100"
