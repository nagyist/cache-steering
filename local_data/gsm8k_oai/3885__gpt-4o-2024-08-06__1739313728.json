  "query": "James scored 13 field goals worth 3 points and 20 shots worth two points.  How many total points did he score?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total points James earned from the 3-point field goals.",
    "James scored 13 field goals, each worth 3 points.",
    "To find the total points from these field goals, I multiply the number of field goals by the points each is worth: 13 field goals * 3 points per field goal.",
    "13 multiplied by 3 equals 39.",
    "So, James scored 39 points from the 3-point field goals.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total points from the 2-point shots.",
    "James made 20 shots, each worth 2 points.",
    "To find the total points from these shots, I multiply the number of shots by the points each is worth: 20 shots * 2 points per shot.",
    "20 multiplied by 2 equals 40.",
    "So, James scored 40 points from the 2-point shots.",
    "Now, I will add the points from the 3-point field goals and the 2-point shots to find the total points.",
    "The total points are 39 points from 3-point field goals plus 40 points from 2-point shots.",
    "39 plus 40 equals 79."
