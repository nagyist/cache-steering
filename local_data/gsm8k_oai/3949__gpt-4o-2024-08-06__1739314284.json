  "query": "Nikka has a 100 stamp collection. Thirty-five percent of her stamps are Chinese, 20% are US stamps, and the rest are Japanese stamps. How many Japanese stamps does Nikka have?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the total number of Japanese stamps in Nikka's collection.",
    "Nikka's total stamp collection is 100 stamps.",
    "Thirty-five percent of the stamps are Chinese. To find the number of Chinese stamps, I calculate 35% of 100.",
    "35% of 100 is calculated as (35 / 100) * 100 = 35.",
    "So, Nikka has 35 Chinese stamps.",
    "Twenty percent of the stamps are US stamps. To find the number of US stamps, I calculate 20% of 100.",
    "20% of 100 is calculated as (20 / 100) * 100 = 20.",
    "So, Nikka has 20 US stamps.",
    "To find the number of Japanese stamps, I need to subtract the number of Chinese and US stamps from the total number of stamps.",
    "Nikka has 35 Chinese stamps and 20 US stamps. Adding these together gives me 35 + 20 = 55.",
    "So, out of 100 stamps, 55 are either Chinese or US stamps.",
    "Therefore, the remaining stamps must be Japanese stamps.",
    "I subtract 55 from 100 to calculate the number of Japanese stamps: 100 - 55 = 45."
