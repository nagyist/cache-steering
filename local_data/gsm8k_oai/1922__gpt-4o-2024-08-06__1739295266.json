  "query": "Stormi is saving up to buy a bicycle. She washes 3 cars for $10 each. She mows 2 lawns for $13 each. If the bicycle she wants costs $80, how much more money does Stormi need to make to afford the bicycle?",
  "steps": [
    "Stormi washes 3 cars for $10 each.",
    "To calculate the total money from washing cars, I multiply 3 cars by $10 each.",
    "3 cars * $10/car = $30.",
    "Stormi earns $30 from washing cars.",
    "Next, Stormi mows 2 lawns for $13 each.",
    "To find the total money from mowing lawns, I multiply 2 lawns by $13 each.",
    "2 lawns * $13/lawn = $26.",
    "Stormi earns $26 from mowing lawns.",
    "To find out how much money Stormi has altogether, I add the money from washing cars and mowing lawns.",
    "$30 + $26 = $56.",
    "The bicycle costs $80.",
    "To determine how much more money Stormi needs, I subtract the amount of money she already has from the cost of the bicycle.",
    "$80 - $56 = $24."
