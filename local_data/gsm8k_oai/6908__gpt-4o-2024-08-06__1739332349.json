  "query": "Before James starts the strength phase training of his cycle he has a powerlifting total of 2200 pounds at a bodyweight of 245 pounds.  He manages to gain 15% on his total and 8 pounds of body weight.  What is the ratio of his lifting total to bodyweight?",
  "steps": [
    "James starts with a powerlifting total of 2200 pounds.",
    "He gains 15% on his total.",
    "15% of 2200 pounds is calculated as 2200 * 0.15 = 330 pounds.",
    "Adding this gain to his original total: 2200 + 330 = 2530 pounds.",
    "James's new powerlifting total is 2530 pounds.",
    "His starting body weight is 245 pounds.",
    "He gains 8 pounds of body weight.",
    "Adding this gain to his original body weight: 245 + 8 = 253 pounds.",
    "James's new body weight is 253 pounds.",
    "The ratio of his lifting total to body weight is calculated as 2530 pounds / 253 pounds.",
    "Calculating the ratio: 2530 / 253 = 10."
