  "query": "Andy bakes and sells birthday cakes. To make two cakes he spends $12 on ingredients, and $1 on packaging for each cake. Andy sells each cake for $15. How much money does Andy make for each cake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost for two cakes.",
    "The cost for ingredients is $12 for two cakes.",
    "The cost for packaging is $1 per cake, so for two cakes, it is $1 x 2 = $2.",
    "The total cost for two cakes is the sum of the cost of ingredients and packaging, which is $12 + $2 = $14.",
    "Now, I need to determine the cost per cake.",
    "The total cost for two cakes is $14, so the cost per cake is $14 / 2 = $7.",
    "Next, I need to determine the selling price per cake.",
    "Andy sells each cake for $15.",
    "The money Andy makes per cake is the selling price minus the cost per cake.",
    "The profit per cake is $15 - $7 = $8."
