  "query": "Sheila, Purity, and Rose want to rent a house. Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity\u2019s share of the rent. Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays. If Rose\u2019s share is $1,800, what is the total house rent?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote Purity's share of the rent as \\( P \\).",
    "According to the problem, Rose can only afford thrice what Purity pays. Therefore, Rose's share, which is \\( 3P \\), is given to be $1,800.",
    "So, we have the equation \\( 3P = 1800 \\).",
    "To find \\( P \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "\\( P = \\frac{1800}{3} \\).",
    "Calculating that gives \\( P = 600 \\).",
    "Now we know Purity's share is $600.",
    "According to the problem, Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity\u2019s share. So, Sheila's share is \\( 5P \\).",
    "Substitute \\( P = 600 \\) into the expression for Sheila's share: \\( 5P = 5 \\times 600 \\).",
    "Therefore, Sheila's share is \\( 5 \\times 600 = 3000 \\).",
    "We now know Sheila's share is $3,000 and Purity's share is $600.",
    "Add up all their shares to find the total rent: Rose's share ($1,800) + Purity\u2019s share ($600) + Sheila\u2019s share ($3,000).",
    "So, the total rent is \\( 1800 + 600 + 3000 \\).",
    "Calculating that sum gives \\( 5400 \\)."
