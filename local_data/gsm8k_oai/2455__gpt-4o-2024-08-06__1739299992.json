Bows are $5 each, a bottle of vinegar is $2 and a box of baking soda is $1. The teacher has 23 students in this class. How much will the supplies cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost for one student.",
    "The cost for one bow per student is $5.",
    "The cost for one bottle of vinegar per student is $2.",
    "The cost for one box of baking soda per student is $1.",
    "To find the total cost for one student, I add these amounts together: $5 + $2 + $1.",

    "Next, I calculate the total cost for all 23 students.",
    "I need to multiply the cost for one student ($8) by the number of students (23).",
