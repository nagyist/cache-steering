  "query": "How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the area of one right triangle that has a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches.",
    "The formula for the area of a right triangle is (base * height) / 2.",
    "In this case, the base is 2 inches and the height is 2 inches.",
    "Calculating the area of the triangle: (2 * 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 square inches.",
    "Next, I will calculate the area of the square with 2-inch sides to determine how many of these triangles can fit inside it.",
    "The formula for the area of a square is side length squared.",
    "The side length of the square is 2 inches, so the area is 2 * 2 = 4 square inches.",
    "Now, I will determine how many triangles, each with an area of 2 square inches, fit into the 4-square-inch square.",
    "To find the number of triangles, divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: 4 square inches / 2 square inches per triangle = 2 triangles.",
    "I have calculated that 2 right triangles can fit inside the 2-inch square."
