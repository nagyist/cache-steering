  "query": "Janina spends $30 each day for rent and uses $12 worth of supplies daily to run her pancake stand. If she sells each pancake for $2, how many pancakes must Janina sell each day to cover her expenses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Janina's total daily expenses.",
    "Janina spends $30 each day for rent.",
    "She also uses $12 worth of supplies each day.",
    "To find the total daily expenses, I add the rent and supply costs.",
    "$30 (rent) + $12 (supplies) = $42",
    "Janina needs to cover a total of $42 in expenses every day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pancakes she must sell to cover these expenses.",
    "Each pancake is sold for $2.",
    "To find out how many pancakes she needs to sell, I divide the total expenses by the price per pancake.",
    "$42 (total expenses) \u00f7 $2 (price per pancake) = 21",
    "Janina must sell 21 pancakes each day to cover her expenses."
