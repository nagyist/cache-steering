  "steps": [
    "Elmo has 3 times as many books as his sister Laura.",
    "Let's denote the number of books Laura has as L.",
    "If Elmo has 3 times as many books as Laura, then 3L = 24, since Elmo has 24 books.",
    "To find how many books Laura has, solve for L in the equation 3L = 24.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 3: L = 24 / 3.",
    "L = 8.",
    "Laura has 8 books.",
    "Laura has twice as many books as her brother Stu.",
    "Let's denote the number of books Stu has as S.",
    "If Laura has twice as many books as Stu, then L = 2S.",
    "We already found that L is 8, so 8 = 2S.",
    "To find how many books Stu has, solve for S in the equation 8 = 2S.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 2: S = 8 / 2.",
    "S = 4."
