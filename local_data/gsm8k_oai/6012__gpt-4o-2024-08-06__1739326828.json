  "query": "A mother planted a 16-inch tree on her son's first birthday.  On the day the tree was planted, the boy was 24 inches tall.  If the tree grows twice as fast as the boy does, how tall will the tree be by the time the boy is 36 inches tall?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much taller the boy will grow until he reaches 36 inches.",
    "The boy's current height is 24 inches.",
    "He needs to grow to 36 inches.",
    "The difference between 36 inches and 24 inches is 12 inches. So, the boy will grow an additional 12 inches.",
    "The problem states that the tree grows twice as fast as the boy.",
    "If the boy grows 12 inches, the tree will grow 2 times that amount.",
    "2 times 12 inches is 24 inches. So, the tree will grow an additional 24 inches.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the tree's total height after this growth.",
    "The tree started at 16 inches tall.",
    "After growing 24 inches, the tree's height will be 16 inches + 24 inches.",
    "16 inches + 24 inches equals 40 inches."

  "solution": "40"
