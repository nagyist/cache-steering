  "query": "In five years Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew. If Drew is currently 12 years old, how old is Sam?",
  "steps": [
    "Drew's current age is 12 years.",
    "We need to find Drew's age in five years.",
    "Drew's age in five years is 12 + 5 = 17 years.",
    "According to the problem, in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew.",
    "We set up the equation: Sam's age in five years = 3 * Drew's age in five years.",
    "Let Sam's current age be S.",
    "In five years, Sam's age will be S + 5.",
    "We set the equation: S + 5 = 3 * 17.",
    "Simplify the right-hand side: 3 * 17 = 51.",
    "Now the equation is S + 5 = 51.",
    "Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for S: S = 51 - 5.",
    "Calculate the result: S = 46."

  "solution": "46"
