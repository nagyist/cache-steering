  "query": "Haley, Michael and Brandon were trying a marshmallow challenge to see who could hold more marshmallows in their mouths. Haley could hold 8 marshmallows in her mouth. Michael could hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley. Brandon could hold half as many as Michael. How many total marshmallows did all three kids hold in their mouths?",
  "steps": [
    "Haley could hold 8 marshmallows in her mouth.",
    "Michael could hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley.",
    "To find out how many marshmallows Michael could hold, we multiply the number Haley could hold by 3.",
    "8 marshmallows * 3 = 24 marshmallows. Michael could hold 24 marshmallows.",
    "Brandon could hold half as many marshmallows as Michael.",
    "To find out how many marshmallows Brandon could hold, we divide the number Michael could hold by 2.",
    "24 marshmallows / 2 = 12 marshmallows. Brandon could hold 12 marshmallows.",
    "Now we add the number of marshmallows each person could hold to find the total.",
    "8 marshmallows (Haley) + 24 marshmallows (Michael) + 12 marshmallows (Brandon) = 44 marshmallows."
