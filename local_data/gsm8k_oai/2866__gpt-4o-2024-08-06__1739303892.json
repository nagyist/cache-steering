  "query": "Erin is watching a TV mini series of Pride and Prejudice. There are 6 episodes that are each 50 minutes long. If Erin watches all of the episodes in one sitting, one after the other with no breaks, how many hours will she spend watching the series?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of minutes Erin will spend watching the whole series.",
    "There are 6 episodes, and each episode is 50 minutes long.",
    "I multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time in minutes.",
    "6 episodes \u00d7 50 minutes per episode = 300 minutes.",
    "Now, I convert the total time from minutes to hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To find the number of hours, I divide the total number of minutes by the number of minutes in an hour.",
    "300 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours.",
    "Erin will spend a total of 5 hours watching the series if she watches all episodes in one sitting with no breaks."
