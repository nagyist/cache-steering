  "query": "Lisa has decided to replace her old cutlery. As she is going through the cupboards, she sees the spoons from when each of her 4 children were babies as well as 2 decorative spoons she created. She doesn't want to get rid of any of these so she adds them to her new set of cutlery. The new set of cutlery has 10 large spoons and 15 teaspoons. If the children each had 3 spoons when they were babies, how many spoons does Lisa now have?",
  "steps": [
    "Lisa has 4 children.",
    "Each child had 3 spoons when they were babies.",
    "To find the total number of baby spoons, I multiply the number of children by the number of spoons each child had: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) baby spoons.",
    "Lisa also has 2 decorative spoons.",
    "The new set of cutlery includes 10 large spoons.",
    "The new set of cutlery also includes 15 teaspoons.",
    "I need to find the total number of spoons she has now.",
    "The total number of spoons is the sum of the baby spoons, decorative spoons, large spoons, and teaspoons.",
    "Adding these together: \\(12 \\, \\text{baby spoons} + 2 \\, \\text{decorative spoons} + 10 \\, \\text{large spoons} + 15 \\, \\text{teaspoons} = 39\\)."
