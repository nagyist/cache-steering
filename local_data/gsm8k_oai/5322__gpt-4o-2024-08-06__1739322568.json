  "query": "Of the 3 friends, Harry has 4 times as many fish as Joe, and Joe has 8 times as many fish as Sam does. If Sam has 7 fish, how many fish does Harry have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fish Joe has, given that Sam has 7 fish.",
    "According to the problem, Joe has 8 times as many fish as Sam.",
    "Sam has 7 fish, so I multiply 7 fish by 8 to find out how many fish Joe has.",
    "7 times 8 is 56. So, Joe has 56 fish.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many fish Harry has.",
    "The problem states that Harry has 4 times as many fish as Joe.",
    "Joe has 56 fish, so I need to multiply 56 by 4 to find the number of fish Harry has.",
    "56 times 4 is 224.",
    "Thus, Harry has 224 fish."

  "solution": "224"
