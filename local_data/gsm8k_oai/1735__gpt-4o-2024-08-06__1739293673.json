  "query": "Karl sells clothing in his store. He sells a T-shirt that costs $5, some pants that cost $4, and some skirts that cost $6, he also sells some refurbished t-shirts that cost half the original price. How much is his total income if he sold two T-shirts, one pair of pants, four skirts, and six refurbished T-shirts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total income from the T-shirts. The price of one T-shirt is $5, and Karl sold two of them.",
    "The total income from the two T-shirts is 2 * $5 = $10.",
    "Next, I calculate the total income from the pants. One pair of pants costs $4, and Karl sold one pair.",
    "The total income from the pants is 1 * $4 = $4.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total income from the skirts. Each skirt costs $6, and Karl sold four skirts.",
    "The total income from the skirts is 4 * $6 = $24.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total income from the refurbished T-shirts. Refurbished T-shirts cost half the original price of $5, which means they are $2.50 each.",
    "I multiply the cost of one refurbished T-shirt by the quantity sold: $2.50 * 6 = $15.",
    "To find the total income, I'll sum up all the individual incomes: $10 (T-shirts) + $4 (pants) + $24 (skirts) + $15 (refurbished T-shirts).",
    "$10 + $4 = $14.",
    "$14 + $24 = $38.",
    "$38 + $15 = $53."

  "solution": "53"
