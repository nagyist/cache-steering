  "query": "There are 3414 yellow balloons and there are 1762 more black balloons than yellow balloons. If the balloons will be evenly divided among 10 schools, how many balloons will one school receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many black balloons there are.",
    "There are 1762 more black balloons than yellow balloons.",
    "The number of yellow balloons is 3414.",
    "To find the number of black balloons, I will add 1762 to 3414.",
    "3414 + 1762 = 5176",
    "So, there are 5176 black balloons.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of balloons.",
    "Total balloons = Number of yellow balloons + Number of black balloons",
    "Total balloons = 3414 + 5176",
    "3414 + 5176 = 8590",
    "So, there are a total of 8590 balloons.",
    "The balloons need to be evenly divided among 10 schools.",
    "To find how many balloons each school will receive, I will divide the total number of balloons by 10.",
    "8590 \u00f7 10 = 859"

  "solution": "859"
