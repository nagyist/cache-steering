  "query": "In a show, there can be 5 actors at a time. Every actor is in the show for about 15 minutes, and then another 5 actors come in. How many actors can there be on the show in 1 hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider how many 15-minute segments there are in one hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in one hour.",
    "Divide 60 minutes by 15 minutes to find the number of segments.",
    "60 \u00f7 15 = 4 segments.",
    "In each 15-minute segment, 5 actors are on stage.",
    "To find the total number of actors who can be in the show in one hour, multiply the number of segments by the number of actors per segment.",
    "4 segments \u00d7 5 actors = 20 actors."
