  "query": "Emily loves to have pets and for that reason, she has 4 dogs in her home. Each one eats 250 grams of food per day. She has to go on vacation for 14 days. How many kilograms of food should she buy for her 4 dogs so they don't starve while she is out?",
  "steps": [
    "Emily has 4 dogs.",
    "Each dog eats 250 grams of food per day.",
    "We need to calculate the total amount of food required per day for all dogs.",
    "Multiply the amount of food one dog eats by the number of dogs: 250 grams/dog/day * 4 dogs = 1000 grams/day.",
    "Emily is going for a vacation of 14 days.",
    "Calculate the total amount of food needed for 14 days: 1000 grams/day * 14 days = 14000 grams.",
    "We need to convert grams to kilograms.",
    "There are 1000 grams in a kilogram.",
    "Divide the total grams by 1000 to convert to kilograms: 14000 grams / 1000 = 14 kilograms."
