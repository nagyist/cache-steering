  "query": "A snake's head is one-tenth its length. If a snake is 10 feet long, calculate the length of the rest of its body minus the head.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the formula or relationship given in the problem.",
    "The problem states that the snake's head is one-tenth of its total length.",
    "The total length of the snake is 10 feet.",
    "Calculate the length of the snake's head by taking one-tenth of the total length.",
    "One-tenth of 10 feet is calculated as: \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 10 = 1 \\) foot.",
    "Now, calculate the length of the rest of the snake's body by subtracting the length of the head from the total length.",
    "The rest of the body is \\( 10 \\) feet (total length) minus \\( 1 \\) foot (head length).",
    "The rest of the body is \\( 10 - 1 = 9 \\) feet."
