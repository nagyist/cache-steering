  "query": "After Martha went grocery shopping she had 4 bottles of juice in the refrigerator and 4 bottles in the pantry. During the week Martha bought 5 more bottles of juice. If Martha and her family drank 3 bottles of juice during the week, how many bottles are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Martha initially has 4 bottles of juice in the refrigerator.",
    "She also has 4 bottles of juice in the pantry.",
    "To find the total number of bottles she has initially, I add the two amounts: 4 in the refrigerator plus 4 in the pantry equals 8 bottles of juice.",
    "During the week, Martha bought 5 more bottles of juice.",
    "I need to add the 5 bottles she bought to the initial 8 bottles she already had.",
    "8 bottles (initial) plus 5 bottles (bought) equals 13 bottles of juice in total.",
    "Martha and her family drank 3 bottles of juice during the week.",
    "To find out how many bottles are left, I subtract the 3 bottles that were consumed from the total 13 bottles.",
    "13 bottles (total) minus 3 bottles (consumed) equals 10 bottles of juice remaining."
