  "query": "Tony loved to solve difficult pen and paper puzzles.  He did a warm-up puzzle that only took 10 minutes and after that he did 2 puzzles that each took 3 times as long.  How long did he spend solving puzzles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the time spent on the warm-up puzzle.",
    "The warm-up puzzle took 10 minutes.",
    "Next, I calculate the time spent on each of the two more difficult puzzles.",
    "Each difficult puzzle took 3 times as long as the warm-up puzzle.",
    "3 times 10 minutes equals 30 minutes per difficult puzzle.",
    "Now, I calculate the total time spent on the two difficult puzzles.",
    "Two puzzles each taking 30 minutes means 2 times 30 equals 60 minutes in total.",
    "Finally, I add the time spent on the warm-up puzzle to the total time of the difficult puzzles.",
    "10 minutes + 60 minutes equals 70 minutes."

  "solution": "70"
