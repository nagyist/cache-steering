  "query": "Natalie bought some food for a party she is organizing. She bought two cheesecakes, an apple pie, and a six-pack of muffins. The six-pack of muffins was two times more expensive than the cheesecake, and one cheesecake was only 25% cheaper than the apple pie. If the apple pie cost $12, how much did Natalie pay for all her shopping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine the price of one cheesecake. We know that one cheesecake was 25% cheaper than the apple pie.",
    "The apple pie cost $12.",
    "To find the price of one cheesecake, we calculate 25% of $12.",
    "25% of $12 is \\((25/100) * 12 = 3\\).",
    "Since a cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie, we subtract $3 from $12.",
    "So, the cheesecake costs \\(12 - 3 = 9\\) dollars.",
    "Now, I will determine the cost of the six-pack of muffins. We know that the six-pack was two times more expensive than the cheesecake.",
    "One cheesecake is $9, so the six-pack of muffins costs \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\) dollars.",
    "Now, I will sum up the costs. Natalie bought two cheesecakes, an apple pie, and a six-pack of muffins.",
    "The total cost of two cheesecakes is \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\) dollars.",
    "The cost of the apple pie is $12.",
    "The cost of the six-pack of muffins is $18.",
    "Now, summing up all the costs: \\(18 + 12 + 18\\).",
    "So, the total amount Natalie paid is \\(18 + 12 + 18 = 48\\) dollars."
