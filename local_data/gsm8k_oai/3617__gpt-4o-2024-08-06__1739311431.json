  "query": "Melanie has twice as many cats as Annie, and Annie has three times fewer cats than Jacob. If Jacob has 90 cats, how many cats does Melanie have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cats Annie has.",
    "Annie has three times fewer cats than Jacob.",
    "To find how many cats Annie has, I need to divide the number of Jacob's cats by 3.",
    "Jacob has 90 cats.",
    "90 divided by 3 is 30.",
    "So, Annie has 30 cats.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cats Melanie has.",
    "Melanie has twice as many cats as Annie.",
    "If Annie has 30 cats, then twice that number is 2 times 30.",
    "2 times 30 equals 60.",
    "Therefore, Melanie has 60 cats."

  "solution": "60"
