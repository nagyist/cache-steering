She adds this to her savings of $100 and goes out to Target to get what she wanted. If she spent 3/4 of the money, how much money did she remain with?",

    "She was gifted $70 by her granny.",

    "I will sum all these amounts to find the total: $20 + $40 + $30 + $70 + $100.",
    "$20 + $40 = $60.",
    "$60 + $30 = $90.",
    "$90 + $70 = $160.",
