  "query": "Rodney and Todd are rowing down a river that is 50 yards wide at one end. If the river's width increases from this end uniformly by 2 yards every 10 meters along, and they row along the river at a rate of 5 m/s, how long (in seconds) will it take them to get to the point where the river is 80 yards wide?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the width increase from yards to meters since the rowing rate is given in meters per second. There are 0.9144 meters in a yard.",
    "To find out how much the width increases in meters for an increase of 30 yards (from 50 yards to 80 yards), I multiply 30 yards by 0.9144 meters/yard.",
    "\\( 30 \\times 0.9144 = 27.432 \\) meters. This means the width of the river increases by 27.432 meters.",
    "The rate of width increase is 2 yards every 10 meters along the river. Converting 2 yards to meters: \n\\( 2 \\times 0.9144 = 1.8288 \\) meters.",
    "Now I need to calculate how far they need to row along the river to achieve this width increase. The river increases by 1.8288 meters every 10 meters.",
    "I need to find the distance along the river required for the width to increase by 27.432 meters. Using proportional reasoning: \n\\[\n\\frac{1.8288}{10} = \\frac{27.432}{x}\n\\]",
    "Solving for \\( x \\) gives:\n\\( x = \\frac{27.432 \\times 10}{1.8288} = 150 \\) meters.",
    "Rodney and Todd row at a speed of 5 meters per second. The time it takes to row 150 meters is found by dividing the distance by their rowing speed:\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{5} = 30 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]"
