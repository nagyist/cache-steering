  "query": "Aron spends 30 minutes/day three times a week vacuuming and 20 minutes/day 2 days a week dusting. How much time does he spend cleaning total each week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total time Aron spends vacuuming each week.",
    "He vacuums for 30 minutes per day.",
    "He vacuums three times a week.",
    "I need to multiply the number of minutes he vacuums each day by the number of days: 30 minutes/day * 3 days = 90 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total time Aron spends dusting each week.",
    "He dusts for 20 minutes per day.",
    "He dusts two times a week.",
    "I need to multiply the number of minutes he dusts each day by the number of days: 20 minutes/day * 2 days = 40 minutes.",
    "Now, I add the time spent vacuuming to the time spent dusting to get the total cleaning time: 90 minutes (vacuuming) + 40 minutes (dusting).",
    "90 minutes + 40 minutes = 130 minutes."

  "solution": "130"
