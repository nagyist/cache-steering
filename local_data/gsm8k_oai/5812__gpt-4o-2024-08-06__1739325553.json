  "query": "A store owner repacked his oils into 200 mL bottles. He was able to make 20 bottles. How many liters of oil did the store owner have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total volume of oil in all the bottles.",
    "Each bottle contains 200 mL of oil.",
    "There are 20 bottles in total.",
    "To find the total volume in milliliters, I multiply the number of bottles by the volume of each bottle: 20 bottles * 200 mL = 4000 mL.",
    "Now, I need to convert milliliters to liters.",
    "I know that 1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters.",
    "To convert 4000 mL to liters, I divide 4000 by 1000.",
    "4000 mL / 1000 = 4 liters."
