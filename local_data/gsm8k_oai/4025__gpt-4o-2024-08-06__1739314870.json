  "query": "A vampire drains three people a week. His best friend is a werewolf who eats five people a week, but only fresh ones, never drained ones. How many weeks will a village of 72 people last them both?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people are affected per week by the vampire and the werewolf together.",
    "The vampire drains 3 people per week.",
    "The werewolf eats 5 people per week.",
    "Since the werewolf only eats fresh people and never people who have been drained, their actions do not overlap. So we add their totals together.",
    "Together, the vampire and the werewolf affect 3 (drained) + 5 (eaten) = 8 people per week.",
    "The village has 72 people. To find out how many weeks 72 people will last, I divide the number of people by the number of people affected per week.",
    "Divide the total population by the weekly affected amount: 72 people / 8 people per week = 9 weeks.",
    "I have calculated it correctly and confirmed that there are no misunderstandings or mistakes in the logic."

  "solution": "9"
