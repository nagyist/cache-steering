  "query": "Alan has 8 pine trees in his backyard and each tree drops 200 pine cones. If 30% of the pine cones fall on Alan's roof, and each pine cone weighs 4 ounces, how many ounces of pine cones does Alan have on his roof?",
  "steps": [
    "Alan has 8 pine trees in his backyard.",
    "Each pine tree drops 200 pine cones.",
    "To find the total number of pine cones, multiply the number of trees by the number of cones per tree: 8 trees * 200 cones/tree = 1600 cones.",
    "30% of these pine cones fall on Alan's roof. To find out how many that is, calculate 30% of 1600 cones.",
    "30% of 1600 is 0.30 * 1600 = 480 cones.",
    "Each pine cone weighs 4 ounces.",
    "To find out the total weight of the pine cones on the roof, multiply the number of pine cones on the roof by the weight of each cone: 480 cones * 4 ounces/cone.",
    "480 * 4 = 1920 ounces."

  "solution": "1920"
