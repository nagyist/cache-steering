  "query": "Katrina has 120 cookies to sell at her bakery. She plans to take home any cookies she doesn\u2019t sell by the end of the day. In the morning, she sells 3 dozen cookies. During the lunch rush, she sells 57 cookies. In the afternoon, she sells 16 more cookies. How many cookies does she have left to take home?",
  "steps": [
    "Katrina starts the day with 120 cookies.",
    "In the morning, she sells 3 dozen cookies. I know that 1 dozen equals 12 cookies.",
    "Therefore, 3 dozen equals 3 x 12 cookies.",
    "3 x 12 is 36, so she sells 36 cookies in the morning.",
    "She then sells 57 cookies during the lunch rush.",
    "In the afternoon, she sells 16 more cookies.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the total number of cookies she sold during the day.",
    "She sold 36 cookies in the morning, 57 cookies during lunch, and 16 cookies in the afternoon.",
    "Adding these up gives 36 + 57 + 16.",
    "36 + 57 is 93.",
    "93 + 16 is 109.",
    "So, Katrina sold a total of 109 cookies during the day.",
    "To find out how many cookies she has left to take home, I need to subtract the total number of cookies sold from the starting amount of cookies.",
    "The starting amount is 120, and she sold 109.",
    "120 - 109 equals 11."

  "solution": "11"
