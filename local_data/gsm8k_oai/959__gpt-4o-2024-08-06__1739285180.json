  "query": "Janet makes 50 snowballs and her brother makes 150 snowballs. What percentage of the snowballs did Janet make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of snowballs made by Janet and her brother.",
    "Janet made 50 snowballs and her brother made 150 snowballs.",
    "The total number of snowballs is 50 + 150.",
    "50 + 150 equals 200.",
    "Next, I need to find out what percentage of the total snowballs were made by Janet.",
    "Janet made 50 out of the total 200 snowballs.",
    "To find the percentage, I use the formula: (part/whole) * 100%.",
    "So, I calculate (50/200) * 100%.",
    "50 divided by 200 equals 0.25.",
    "0.25 multiplied by 100% equals 25%."
