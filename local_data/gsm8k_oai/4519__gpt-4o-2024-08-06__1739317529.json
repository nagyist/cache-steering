  "steps": [
    "Sue made half as many buttons as Kendra.",
    "Sue made 6 buttons.",
    "Therefore, Kendra made 2 times 6 buttons.",
    "2 times 6 equals 12.",
    "So, Kendra made 12 buttons.",
    "Mari made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Kendra.",
    "Five times as many as Kendra's 12 buttons equals 5 times 12.",
    "5 times 12 equals 60.",
    "Mari made 4 more than 60 buttons.",
    "60 plus 4 equals 64."
