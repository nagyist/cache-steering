  "query": "Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, while her sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many dolls Rene's sister has.",
    "I know that Rene's sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. If the grandmother has 50 dolls, then Rene's sister has 50 + 2 dolls.",
    "Calculate the number of dolls Rene's sister has: 50 + 2 = 52 dolls.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many dolls Rene has.",
    "Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister. Her sister has 52 dolls, so Rene has 3 * 52 dolls.",
    "Calculate the number of dolls Rene has: 3 * 52 = 156 dolls.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of dolls they all have together.",
    "Add the number of dolls Rene, her sister, and their grandmother have: 156 (Rene) + 52 (sister) + 50 (grandmother).",
    "Calculate the total number of dolls: 156 + 52 + 50 = 258 dolls."
