  "query": "A local park has 70 pigeons that call the park home. Half of the pigeons are black, and 20 percent of the black pigeons are male.  How many more black female pigeons are there than black male pigeons?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will find the number of black pigeons in the park. There are 70 pigeons total, and half of them are black.",
    "Half of 70 is 35, so there are 35 black pigeons.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of black male pigeons. 20 percent of the black pigeons are male.",
    "20 percent of 35 is calculated by multiplying 35 by 0.20.",
    "35 multiplied by 0.20 equals 7. Thus, there are 7 black male pigeons.",
    "Now, I will find the number of black female pigeons. Since there are 35 black pigeons in total, and 7 are male, the rest are female.",
    "Subtracting 7 from 35 gives 28 black female pigeons.",
    "Finally, I need to find the difference between the number of black female pigeons and black male pigeons.",
    "There are 28 black female pigeons and 7 black male pigeons.",
    "28 minus 7 equals 21."

  "solution": "21"
