  "steps": [
    "Kalani has 20 candles in her bedroom.",
    "The number of candles in the living room is half the number of candles in the bedroom.",
    "Therefore, there are 20 / 2 = 10 candles in the living room.",
    "Donovan brings in 20 more candles.",
    "Add the number of candles in the bedroom and the living room to find out how many candles were originally in the house.",
    "20 (bedroom) + 10 (living room) = 30 candles originally in the house.",
    "Add the number of candles Donovan brought.",
    "30 (original candles) + 20 (Donovan's candles) = 50 candles in the house."
