  "query": "Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17, with the total number of pets being 189. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, how many dogs does she remain with altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of dogs and cats Heloise originally has.",
    "I know the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, and the total number of pets is 189.",
    "To find the original number of dogs, let me set up the equation 10x + 17x = 189, where x is the common ratio.",
    "Combine the terms to get 27x = 189.",
    "Now, I need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 27: x = 189 / 27.",
    "Calculating 189 / 27 gives me x = 7.",
    "Now, I can find the original number of dogs: 10x = 10 * 7 = 70.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many dogs Heloise has after giving 10 to her friend Janet.",
    "She originally had 70 dogs, so after giving away 10, she has 70 - 10 dogs left.",
    "Subtract 10 from 70 to find the remaining number of dogs: 70 - 10 = 60."

  "solution": "60"
