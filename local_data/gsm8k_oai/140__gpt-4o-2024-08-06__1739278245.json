  "query": "Fern is checking IDs to get into an R-rated movie. She denied 20% of the 120 kids from Riverside High, 70% of the 90 kids from West Side High, and half the 50 kids from Mountaintop High. How many kids got into the movie?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the number of Riverside High kids who were denied entry.",
    "20% of 120 is calculated as (20/100) * 120 = 24.",
    "Subtract the number of denied kids from Riverside High from the total from Riverside High to find out how many got in.",
    "120 - 24 = 96 kids from Riverside High got into the movie.",
    "Next, calculate the number of West Side High kids who were denied entry.",
    "70% of 90 is calculated as (70/100) * 90 = 63.",
    "Subtract the number of denied kids from West Side High from the total from West Side High to find out how many got in.",
    "90 - 63 = 27 kids from West Side High got into the movie.",
    "Then, calculate the number of Mountaintop High kids who were denied entry.",
    "Half of 50 is calculated as 50/2 = 25.",
    "Subtract the number of denied kids from Mountaintop High from the total from Mountaintop High to find out how many got in.",
    "50 - 25 = 25 kids from Mountaintop High got into the movie.",
    "Find the total number of kids who got into the movie by adding those from each school who were allowed entry.",
    "96 (Riverside High) + 27 (West Side High) + 25 (Mountaintop High) = 148."
