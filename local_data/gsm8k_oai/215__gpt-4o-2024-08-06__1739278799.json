  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of adults in the church.",
    "40% of 120 members are adults.",
    "Calculate 40% of 120: 0.40 * 120 = 48.",
    "So, there are 48 adults in the church.",
    "Next, find the number of children in the church.",
    "The total number of members is 120. Subtract the number of adults from this total: 120 - 48 = 72.",
    "There are 72 children in the church.",
    "Now, calculate the difference in number between children and adults.",
    "Subtract the number of adults from the number of children: 72 - 48 = 24.",
    "There are 24 more children than adults in the church."
