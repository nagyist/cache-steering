  "query": "An ice cream vendor has 50 chocolate-flavored ice creams and 54 mango-flavored ice creams in his cart. If he sold 3/5 of the chocolate-flavored ice creams and 2/3 of the mango-flavored ice creams, how many total ice creams were not sold?",
  "steps": [
    "The ice cream vendor has 50 chocolate-flavored ice creams.",
    "He sold 3/5 of those chocolate-flavored ice creams.",
    "To find how many chocolate-flavored ice creams he sold, calculate 3/5 of 50.",
    "3/5 of 50 is (3/5) * 50 = 30.",
    "The number of chocolate-flavored ice creams he sold is 30.",
    "Now, subtract the chocolate-flavored ice creams sold from the total: 50 - 30 = 20.",
    "So, 20 chocolate-flavored ice creams were not sold.",
    "Next, the vendor has 54 mango-flavored ice creams.",
    "He sold 2/3 of the mango-flavored ice creams.",
    "To find how many mango-flavored ice creams he sold, calculate 2/3 of 54.",
    "2/3 of 54 is (2/3) * 54 = 36.",
    "The number of mango-flavored ice creams he sold is 36.",
    "Now, subtract the mango-flavored ice creams sold from the total: 54 - 36 = 18.",
    "So, 18 mango-flavored ice creams were not sold.",
    "To find the total number of ice creams that were not sold, add the unsold chocolate-flavored and mango-flavored ice creams: 20 + 18.",
    "20 + 18 = 38."
