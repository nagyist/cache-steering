  "query": "Mason opens the hood of his car and discovers that squirrels have been using his engine compartment to store nuts. If 2 busy squirrels have been stockpiling 30 nuts/day and one sleepy squirrel has been stockpiling 20 nuts/day, all for 40 days, how many nuts are in Mason's car?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many nuts the 2 busy squirrels stockpile in one day.",
    "Each busy squirrel stockpiles 30 nuts per day, so together they stockpile 30 nuts/day * 2 squirrels = 60 nuts per day.",
    "Next, I calculate how many nuts the one sleepy squirrel stockpiles in one day.",
    "The sleepy squirrel stockpiles 20 nuts per day.",
    "Now, I sum the daily nut stockpiling totals of the busy squirrels and the sleepy squirrel.",
    "Total nuts per day = 60 nuts (from busy squirrels) + 20 nuts (from sleepy squirrel) = 80 nuts per day.",
    "I need to find the total number of nuts stockpiled in Mason's car over the course of 40 days.",
    "Total nuts = 80 nuts/day * 40 days.",
    "I calculate 80 * 40.",
    "80 * 40 = 3200."

  "solution": "3200"
