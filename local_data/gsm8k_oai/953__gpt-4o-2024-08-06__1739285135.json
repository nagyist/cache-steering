  "query": "Wendi brought home 4 chickens.  After a few days, she brought home enough additional chickens to double the number of chickens she owned.  Then, a neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens.  Finally, Wendi found an additional 4 less than ten chickens and brought them home too.  After this, how many chickens does Wendi have?",
  "steps": [
    "Wendi initially has 4 chickens.",
    "Wendi doubles the number of chickens by adding an equal number. So, she adds 4 more chickens, bringing the total to 8.",
    "A neighbor\u2019s dog eats 1 chicken, reducing the total number of chickens to 7.",
    "Wendi finds and brings home more chickens. It is stated as 4 less than ten. Ten minus four equals six.",
    "She brings home 6 additional chickens.",
    "Now, I will add these 6 chickens to the current total of 7 chickens.",
    "7 plus 6 equals 13."

  "solution": "13"
