  "query": "Yuri has been adopting puppies for a month now. The first week he adopted 20 puppies, the second week 2/5 times as many puppies as the first week, the third week twice the number of puppies he adopted in the second week, and the fourth week ten more puppies than he adopted on the first week. How many puppies does Yuri have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many puppies Yuri adopted each week.",
    "In the first week, Yuri adopted 20 puppies.",
    "In the second week, Yuri adopted 2/5 times as many puppies as the first week.",
    "So, the number of puppies adopted in the second week is 2/5 * 20.",
    "Calculating 2/5 * 20 = 2 * 4 = 8 puppies in the second week.",
    "In the third week, Yuri adopted twice the number of puppies he adopted in the second week.",
    "This means in the third week he adopted 2 * 8 puppies.",
    "Calculating 2 * 8 = 16 puppies in the third week.",
    "In the fourth week, Yuri adopted ten more puppies than he adopted on the first week.",
    "So, the number of puppies adopted in the fourth week is 20 + 10.",
    "Calculating 20 + 10 = 30 puppies in the fourth week.",
    "Now, I need to add up the puppies adopted each week to find the total number of puppies Yuri has.",
    "Adding up the puppies: 20 (first week) + 8 (second week) + 16 (third week) + 30 (fourth week).",
    "Calculating 20 + 8 + 16 + 30 = 74 puppies."
