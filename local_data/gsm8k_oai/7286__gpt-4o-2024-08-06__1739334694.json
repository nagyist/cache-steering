  "query": "Patrick has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time that Greg has left to finish his homework. Greg has six hours less than Jacob left to finish his homework. If Jacob has 18 hours left to finish his homework, calculate the total number of hours they all have left to finish their homework?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start with Jacob. We know that he has 18 hours left to finish his homework.",
    "Now we need to find out how many hours Greg has. It is given that Greg has 6 hours less than Jacob.",
    "Jacob has 18 hours, so Greg has 18 - 6 = 12 hours left.",
    "Next, we'll calculate how many hours Patrick has. It is stated that Patrick has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time Greg has left.",
    "Greg has 12 hours, so twice that amount is 2 * 12 = 24 hours.",
    "Patrick has 4 hours less than 24 hours, which means he has 24 - 4 = 20 hours left.",
    "Now we need to determine the total number of hours all three have left. We add up Jacob, Greg, and Patrick's hours: 18 + 12 + 20.",
    "Adding these gives us 18 + 12 + 20 = 50 hours."

  "solution": "50"
