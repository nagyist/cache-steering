  "steps": [
    "Emily spent X dollars on Friday.",
    "She spent twice that amount, 2X, on Saturday.",
    "On Sunday, she spent three times X, which is 3X.",
    "The total amount she spent over the three days is $120.",
    "The expression for the total amount spent is: X + 2X + 3X",
    "Simplify the expression: X + 2X + 3X = 6X",
    "The equation is 6X = $120.",
    "To find X, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 6.",
    "$120 divided by 6 is 20."
