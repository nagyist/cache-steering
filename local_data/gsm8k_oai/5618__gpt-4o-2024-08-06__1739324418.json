On Thursday night, he sleeps for 10 hours. On Friday night he sleeps for 7 hours. What is the average number of hours that Harry sleeps in one night?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of hours Harry sleeps from Monday to Friday.",
    "On Monday night, Harry sleeps for 8 hours.",
    "On Tuesday night, he sleeps for 7 hours.",
    "On Wednesday night, he sleeps for 8 hours.",
    "On Thursday night, he sleeps for 10 hours.",

    "Now I will add these hours together: 8 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 7.",
    "8 + 7 is 15.",
    "15 + 8 is 23.",
    "23 + 10 is 33.",
    "33 + 7 is 40.",
    "Harry sleeps a total of 40 hours from Monday to Friday.",
    "There are 5 nights from Monday to Friday.",
    "To find the average, divide the total hours by the number of nights: 40 \u00f7 5.",
    "40 \u00f7 5 = 8."
