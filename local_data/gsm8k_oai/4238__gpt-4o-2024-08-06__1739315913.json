  "query": "Luca went to a sandwich shop for lunch. The sandwich he bought was normally $8, but he had a coupon for a quarter of the price off. He then upgraded it with sliced avocado for an extra dollar. After adding a drink and a $3 salad, his total lunch bill was $12. How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?",
  "steps": [
    "The original price of the sandwich was $8.",
    "Luca had a coupon for a quarter of the price off. A quarter of $8 is $8 * 0.25 = $2.",
    "With the coupon, Luca's sandwich costs $8 - $2 = $6.",
    "Luca added sliced avocado to the sandwich for an extra $1.",
    "The new cost of the sandwich with avocado is $6 + $1 = $7.",
    "Luca also added a drink and a $3 salad to his order.",
    "His total lunch bill was $12.",
    "We know the cost of the sandwich with avocado is $7, and the salad is $3.",
    "Adding the costs of the sandwich and the salad gives $7 + $3 = $10.",
    "The drink cost can be found by subtracting the total for the sandwich and salad from the total bill: $12 - $10 = $2."
