  "query": "Felix is chopping down trees in his backyard. For every 13 trees he chops down he needs to get his axe resharpened. It cost him $5 to sharpen his axe. If he spends $35 on axe sharpening, at least how many trees has he chopped down?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Felix has sharpened his axe.",
    "Each time Felix sharpens his axe, it costs him $5.",
    "If he spends a total of $35 on sharpening, then the number of sharpenings is $35 divided by $5 per sharpening.",
    "Performing the division: $35 / $5 = 7.",
    "Felix sharpened his axe 7 times.",
    "Felix chops down 13 trees before needing to sharpen his axe each time.",
    "To find out how many trees he has chopped down, multiply the number of sharpenings by the number of trees chopped before sharpening.",
    "Performing the multiplication: 7 sharpenings * 13 trees per sharpening = 91 trees.",
    "Thus, Felix has chopped down at least 91 trees."

  "solution": "91"
