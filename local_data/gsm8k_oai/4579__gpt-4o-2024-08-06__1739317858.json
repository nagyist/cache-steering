  "query": "A window is made up of 8 glass panes. Each pane has a length of 12 inches and a width of 8 inches. What is the area of the window?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of one glass pane.",
    "The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.",
    "The length of each pane is 12 inches, and the width is 8 inches.",
    "So, the area of one pane is 12 inches * 8 inches.",
    "12 * 8 equals 96 square inches.",
    "Now, I need to find the total area of all 8 panes.",
    "Each pane has an area of 96 square inches.",
    "There are 8 panes, so I multiply 96 square inches by 8.",
    "96 * 8 equals 768.",
    "The total area of the window is 768 square inches."

  "solution": "768"
