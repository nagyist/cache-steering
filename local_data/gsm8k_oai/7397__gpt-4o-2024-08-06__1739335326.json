  "query": "Ryan is looking for people to crowdfund his new business idea.  If the average person funds $10 to a project they're interested in, how many people will Ryan have to recruit to fund a $1,000 business if he has $200 already?",
  "steps": [
    "Ryan has a business idea that requires $1,000 for funding.",
    "He already has $200 towards the project.",
    "To determine how much more he needs, I subtract the $200 he already has from the $1,000 total.",
    "$1,000 - $200 = $800, so he needs $800 more.",
    "The average person funds $10.",
    "To find out how many people he needs, I divide the $800 needed by the $10 per person.",
    "800 \u00f7 10 = 80, so Ryan needs 80 people."
