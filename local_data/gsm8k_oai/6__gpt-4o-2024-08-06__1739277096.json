  "query": "Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?",
  "steps": [
    "Albert buys 2 large pizzas.",
    "Each large pizza has 16 slices.",
    "To find out how many slices there are in 2 large pizzas, I need to multiply the number of slices in one large pizza by the number of large pizzas.",
    "16 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 32 slices",
    "Albert also buys 2 small pizzas.",
    "Each small pizza has 8 slices.",
    "To find out how many slices there are in 2 small pizzas, I need to multiply the number of slices in one small pizza by the number of small pizzas.",
    "8 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 16 slices",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of slices Albert eats if he eats all the pizzas.",
    "I add the number of slices from the large pizzas to the number of slices from the small pizzas.",
    "32 slices (large pizzas) + 16 slices (small pizzas) = 48 slices"
  ],
  "solution": "48"
