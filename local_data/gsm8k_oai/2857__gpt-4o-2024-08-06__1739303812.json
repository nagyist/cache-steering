  "query": "Dave bought 3 packs of white T-shirts and 2 packs of blue T-shirts for his basketball team. The white T-shirts come in packs of 6, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 4. How many T-shirts did Dave buy in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many white T-shirts Dave bought. He bought 3 packs of white T-shirts, and each pack contains 6 T-shirts.",
    "To find the total number of white T-shirts, I multiply the number of packs by the number of T-shirts in each pack: 3 packs \u00d7 6 T-shirts/pack = 18 white T-shirts.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many blue T-shirts Dave bought. He bought 2 packs of blue T-shirts, and each pack contains 4 T-shirts.",
    "To find the total number of blue T-shirts, I multiply the number of packs by the number of T-shirts in each pack: 2 packs \u00d7 4 T-shirts/pack = 8 blue T-shirts.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of T-shirts by adding the white and blue T-shirts together.",
    "I add the number of white T-shirts and blue T-shirts: 18 white T-shirts + 8 blue T-shirts = 26 T-shirts in total."
