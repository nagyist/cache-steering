  "query": "Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes in the morning every day. How much time (in hours) will he have spent jogging after two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much time Mr. John jogs each day. He spends 1 hour 30 minutes jogging daily.",
    "1 hour 30 minutes is the same as 1.5 hours when converted to a decimal.",
    "Next, I need to find out the total number of days in two weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days.",
    "Now, I will multiply the time Mr. John spends jogging each day by the number of days to find the total time.",
    "1.5 hours/day * 14 days = 21 hours.",
    "I've computed the total time, and I didn't make any calculation errors by breaking down the process clearly."

  "solution": "21"
