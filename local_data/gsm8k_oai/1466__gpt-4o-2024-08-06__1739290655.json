  "query": "A dog barks 30 times per minute.  If 2 dogs bark 30 times per minute, how many times will they have barked after 10 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the barking frequency of one dog first.",
    "One dog barks 30 times per minute.",
    "Next, I need to determine the barking frequency of two dogs.",
    "If 2 dogs bark 30 times each per minute, their total barking frequency is 30 + 30 = 60 times per minute.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total number of barks in 10 minutes.",
    "If they bark 60 times per minute, in 10 minutes they will bark 60 * 10 times.",
    "I calculate 60 * 10 = 600."
  ],
  "solution": "600"
