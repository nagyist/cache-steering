  "query": "Matt has six cats and half of them are female. If each female cat has 7 kittens, and Matt sells 9 of them, what percentage of his remaining cats are kittens (rounded to the nearest percent)?",
  "steps": [
    "Matt has six cats in total.",
    "Half of the six cats are female.",
    "Half of 6 is 3, so there are 3 female cats.",
    "Each female cat has 7 kittens.",
    "Since there are 3 female cats, the total number of kittens is 3 times 7.",
    "Calculating 3 times 7 gives us 21 kittens in total.",
    "Matt sells 9 of these kittens.",
    "Subtracting the sold kittens from the total kittens, 21 minus 9 equals 12 kittens.",
    "Now, these 12 kittens plus the initial 6 cats give Matt a total number of cats.",
    "6 adult cats plus 12 kittens equals 18 cats altogether.",
    "Next, we find out what percentage of these 18 cats are kittens.",
    "The number of kittens is 12.",
    "To find the percentage, divide the number of kittens by the total number of cats: 12 divided by 18.",
    "12 divided by 18 leaves us with approximately 0.6667.",
    "To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100.",
    "0.6667 multiplied by 100 is approximately 66.67.",
    "Rounding 66.67 to the nearest percent gives us 67%."
