  "query": "Lyka wants to buy a smartphone worth $160 but she only has $40 at the moment. She plans to save an equal amount of money per week for two months for the remaining amount that she needs. How much should she save per week?",
  "steps": [
    "Lyka wants to buy a smartphone worth $160.",
    "She currently has $40.",
    "To find out how much more money she needs, I subtract the money she has from the total cost of the smartphone.",
    "$160 - $40 = $120",
    "Lyka needs to save $120 more to buy the smartphone.",
    "She plans to save this amount over two months.",
    "A month generally has about 4 weeks. So, two months would have 2 x 4 = 8 weeks.",
    "Now I need to calculate how much she should save each week.",
    "I divide the amount she needs by the number of weeks.",
    "$120 \u00f7 8 weeks = $15 per week"

  "solution": "15"
