  "query": "Austin receives $5 for every hour he helps his father build a deck in their backyard. He works for 2 hours on Mondays, an hour on Wednesdays, and 3 hours on Fridays. If Austin wants to buy a bicycle that costs $180, how many weeks does he have to work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Austin earns in a single week.",
    "He works 2 hours on Mondays. At $5 per hour, he earns 2 * $5 = $10 on Mondays.",
    "He works 1 hour on Wednesdays. At $5 per hour, he earns 1 * $5 = $5 on Wednesdays.",
    "He works 3 hours on Fridays. At $5 per hour, he earns 3 * $5 = $15 on Fridays.",
    "Now, I need to add up his earnings for the entire week: $10 (Monday) + $5 (Wednesday) + $15 (Friday) = $30.",
    "This means Austin earns $30 each week.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many weeks Austin needs to work to buy the bicycle, which costs $180.",
    "To find out how many weeks he needs to work, divide the cost of the bicycle by his weekly earnings: $180 \u00f7 $30 = 6 weeks."
