  "query": "Liam is teaching art to a group of 10 students. He has 20 art kits that he hands out to the students to share, 1 art kit for 2 students. From those art kits half the students make 3 artworks each and half the students make 4 artworks each. How many artistic works does the whole class create?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students are making 3 artworks each and how many are making 4 artworks each from the total of 10 students.",
    "Half of the 10 students are making 3 artworks each, which means 5 students make 3 artworks each.",
    "The other half of the 10 students are making 4 artworks each, which also means 5 students make 4 artworks each.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of artworks made by the students who produce 3 artworks each. It is 5 students times 3 artworks per student.",
    "5 students \u00d7 3 artworks per student equals 15 artworks.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of artworks made by the students who produce 4 artworks each. It is 5 students times 4 artworks per student.",
    "5 students \u00d7 4 artworks per student equals 20 artworks.",
    "To get the total number of artworks created by the whole class, I add the artworks from the two groups of students.",
    "15 artworks + 20 artworks equals 35 artworks."
