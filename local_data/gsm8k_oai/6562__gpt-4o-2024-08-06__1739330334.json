  "query": "A pack of pretzels costs $4, while a pack of chips is 75% more expensive. Maciek went and bought two packets of chips and two packets of pretzels. How much did he pay for his purchases?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I find out how much a pack of chips costs.",
    "A pack of chips is 75% more expensive than a pack of pretzels.",
    "75% of $4 is calculated as 0.75 * $4 = $3.",
    "Therefore, a pack of chips costs $4 + $3 = $7.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total cost for two packets of chips.",
    "Two packets of chips cost 2 * $7 = $14.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost for two packets of pretzels.",
    "Two packets of pretzels cost 2 * $4 = $8.",
    "Adding these two amounts gives the total amount Maciek paid.",
    "$14 + $8 = $22."
  ],
  "solution": "22"
