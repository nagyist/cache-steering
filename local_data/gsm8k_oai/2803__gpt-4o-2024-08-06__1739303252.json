  "query": "Todd has $20. He buys 4 candy bars that cost $2 each. How much money in dollars does Todd have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Todd starts with $20.",
    "Todd buys 4 candy bars.",
    "Each candy bar costs $2.",
    "To find out the total cost of the candy bars, multiply the number of candy bars by the cost of each candy bar: 4 candy bars * $2 per candy bar.",

    "The total cost of the candy bars is $8.",
    "Subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the original amount of money: $20 - $8.",
