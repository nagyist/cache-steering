  "query": "Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.",
    "She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.",
    "So, we need to add 9 to the number of snowflake stamps to find the number of truck stamps.",
    "Truck stamps = 11 (snowflake stamps) + 9 = 20 truck stamps.",
    "She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.",
    "So, to find the number of rose stamps, we need to subtract 13 from the number of truck stamps.",
    "Rose stamps = 20 (truck stamps) - 13 = 7 rose stamps.",
    "Now to find the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to add the snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together.",
    "Total stamps = 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose).",
    "Total stamps = 38."
