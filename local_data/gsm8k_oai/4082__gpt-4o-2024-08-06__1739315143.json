  "query": "Tom and his friends were filling up water balloons. Tom filled up 3 times as many water balloons as Luke. Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony. If Anthony filled up 44 water balloons, how many did Tom fill up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many water balloons Luke filled up. I know that Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony.",
    "Anthony filled up 44 water balloons.",
    "So, Luke filled up 44 / 4 = 11 balloons.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many balloons Tom filled up. I know that Tom filled up 3 times as many balloons as Luke.",
    "Luke filled up 11 balloons.",
    "So, Tom filled up 3 * 11 = 33 balloons."
