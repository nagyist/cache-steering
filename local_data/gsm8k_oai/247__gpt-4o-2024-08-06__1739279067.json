He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days.  On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better.  How many pills are left in the bottle?",
  "steps": [
    "Tony bought a bottle containing 50 pills.",
    "For the first 2 days, he takes 2 pills, three times a day.",
    "He consumes 2 pills x 3 times = 6 pills per day during the first 2 days.",
    "In total for the first 2 days, he takes 6 pills/day x 2 days = 12 pills.",
    "For the next 3 days, he reduces the amount in half, taking 1 pill three times a day.",
    "He consumes 1 pill x 3 times = 3 pills per day during these 3 days.",
    "In total for the next 3 days, he takes 3 pills/day x 3 days = 9 pills.",
    "On the sixth day, he takes 2 pills in the morning.",
    "To recap, he took 12 pills in the first 2 days, 9 pills in the next 3 days, and 2 pills on the sixth day.",
    "Total pills taken = 12 + 9 + 2 = 23 pills.",
    "Starting with 50 pills and having taken a total of 23 pills, he has 50 - 23 = 27 pills remaining."
