  "query": "Bryan bought 5 t-shirts and 4 pairs of pants for $1500. If a t-shirt costs $100, how much does each pair of pants cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by considering the information we have: Bryan bought 5 t-shirts and 4 pairs of pants for $1500 in total.",
    "We know the cost of one t-shirt is $100.",
    "We will first calculate how much Bryan spent on the t-shirts.",
    "Since he bought 5 t-shirts and each costs $100, the total cost for the t-shirts is 5 t-shirts * $100/t-shirt = $500.",
    "Now, we will subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the overall amount spent to find how much he spent on pants.",
    "The total amount spent is $1500. The amount spent on t-shirts is $500. Thus, the amount spent on pants is $1500 - $500 = $1000.",
    "Bryan bought 4 pairs of pants for this amount.",
    "To find the cost of each pair of pants, we'll divide the total amount spent on pants by the number of pairs.",
    "The cost of each pair of pants is $1000 / 4 pairs = $250."

  "solution": "250"
