  "query": "Darnell has 1000 square feet of fabric that he's using to make mini flags. He makes square flags that are 4 feet by 4 feet, wide rectangular flags that are 5 feet by 3 feet, and tall rectangular flags that are 3 feet by 5 feet. He has already made 16 square flags, 20 wide flags, and 10 tall flags. How many square feet of fabric does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much fabric Darnell has already used.",
    "I will start by calculating the fabric used for the square flags. Each square flag is 4 feet by 4 feet, so it covers 4 * 4 = 16 square feet.",
    "Darnell has made 16 square flags. Therefore, the fabric used for square flags is 16 flags * 16 square feet/flag = 256 square feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate the fabric used for the wide rectangular flags. Each wide rectangular flag is 5 feet by 3 feet, so it covers 5 * 3 = 15 square feet.",
    "Darnell has made 20 wide rectangular flags. Therefore, the fabric used for wide rectangular flags is 20 flags * 15 square feet/flag = 300 square feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate the fabric used for the tall rectangular flags. Each tall rectangular flag is 3 feet by 5 feet, so it also covers 3 * 5 = 15 square feet.",
    "Darnell has made 10 tall rectangular flags. Therefore, the fabric used for tall rectangular flags is 10 flags * 15 square feet/flag = 150 square feet.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total fabric used by adding the fabric used for all types of flags.",
    "The total fabric used is 256 square feet (square flags) + 300 square feet (wide flags) + 150 square feet (tall flags).",
    "Total fabric used = 256 + 300 + 150 = 706 square feet.",
    "Finally, I will subtract the fabric used from the total fabric Darnell originally had to find how much fabric he has left.",
    "Darnell originally had 1000 square feet of fabric. So, the fabric left is 1000 square feet - 706 square feet.",
    "The amount of fabric left is 294 square feet."

  "solution": "294"
