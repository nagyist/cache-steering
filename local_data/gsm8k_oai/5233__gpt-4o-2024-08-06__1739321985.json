  "query": "Trisha needed to buy some groceries for herself and her dog. She spent $17 on meat, $22 on chicken, $43 on all the veggies, $5 on the eggs, and finally $45 on her dog\u2019s food. When she left the store, she had only $35 left. How much money did she bring with her at the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Trisha spent in total at the store.",
    "I will add up all the amounts she spent: $17 on meat, $22 on chicken, $43 on veggies, $5 on eggs, and $45 on dog food.",
    "Calculating the total, I start by adding $17 (meat) + $22 (chicken).",
    "$17 + $22 equals $39.",
    "Next, I add $39 + $43 (veggies).",
    "$39 + $43 equals $82.",
    "Then, I add $82 + $5 (eggs).",
    "$82 + $5 equals $87.",
    "Continuing, I add $87 + $45 (dog food).",
    "$87 + $45 equals $132.",
    "So, Trisha spent a total of $132 at the store.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money she had initially before shopping.",
    "Trisha had $35 left after spending $132.",
    "I will add the $132 she spent to the $35 she had left.",
    "$132 + $35 equals $167.",
    "Therefore, Trisha initially brought $167 with her to the store."
