  "query": "Three cats sat on a fence, meowing at the moon.  The first cat meowed 3 times per minute.  The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat.  And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "To start solving the problem, I need to determine how frequently each cat meows per minute.",
    "The first cat meows 3 times per minute as given in the problem.",
    "The second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat. Therefore, the second cat's meowing rate is 2 times 3, which is 6 times per minute.",
    "The third cat meows at one-third the frequency of the second cat. The second cat's rate is 6 times per minute, so the third cat's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\) times per minute.",
    "I now have the meowing rates for each cat: the first cat is 3 times per minute, the second cat is 6 times per minute, and the third cat is 2 times per minute.",
    "To find how many times each cat meows in 5 minutes, I multiply each cat's meowing rate by 5.",
    "The first cat meows \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\) times in 5 minutes.",
    "The second cat meows \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\) times in 5 minutes.",
    "The third cat meows \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) times in 5 minutes.",
    "Now I add up the total number of meows from all three cats.",
    "\\( 15 + 30 + 10 = 55 \\)"

  "solution": "55"
