  "query": "Gavin has had 4 dreams every day for a year now. If he had twice as many dreams last year as he had this year, calculate the total number of dreams he's had in the two years.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of days in the current year.",
    "Let's assume this year is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.",
    "Gavin has had 4 dreams every day this year.",
    "To find out the total number of dreams he had this year, I'll multiply 4 by 365.",
    "4 \u00d7 365 = 1460.",
    "He had 1460 dreams this year.",
    "According to the problem, last year he had twice as many dreams as this year.",
    "So, I need to double the number of dreams he had this year to find out last year's total.",
    "2 \u00d7 1460 = 2920.",
    "Gavin had 2920 dreams last year.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of dreams from last year and this year to find the total over the two years.",
    "1460 + 2920 = 4380."

  "solution": "4380"
