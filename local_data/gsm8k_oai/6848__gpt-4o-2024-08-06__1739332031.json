  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many quarters Olivia pays in total for both chips and soda.",
    "Olivia pays 4 quarters for the chips.",
    "She also pays 12 quarters for the soda.",
    "To find the total number of quarters, I add the quarters for chips and soda together: 4 quarters + 12 quarters.",
