  "query": "Maggie went to Lou's aquarium and saw 100 goldfish in the aquarium. She asked if she could take some home to care for, and she was allowed to catch half of them. While using a catching net, she caught 3/5 of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. How many goldfish does Maggie remain with to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of goldfish in the aquarium is 100.",
    "Maggie is allowed to take half of them home.",
    "Half of 100 is 100 / 2 = 50.",
    "So, Maggie is allowed to take 50 goldfish home.",
    "While catching, Maggie caught 3/5 of the total number she was allowed to take.",
    "3/5 of 50 is calculated as (3/5) * 50.",
    "(3/5) * 50 = (3 * 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30.",
    "Maggie caught 30 goldfish.",
    "She is allowed to take 50 goldfish, and she already caught 30.",
    "To find out how many goldfish she remains with to catch, subtract the number she caught from the total she is allowed to take.",
    "50 - 30 = 20."

  "solution": "20"
