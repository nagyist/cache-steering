  "query": "Based on a 2008 study, children 6\u201311 years old spend 45 minutes each day watching television. How many hours do these children watch television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many minutes children watch television in one week.",
    "The children watch television for 4 days each week.",
    "They watch for 45 minutes each day.",
    "To find the total weekly watch time, I multiply 45 minutes per day by 4 days per week.",
    "45 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 180 minutes/week.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total for 2 weeks.",
    "180 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 360 minutes in 2 weeks.",
    "Next, I need to convert these minutes into hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To convert minutes to hours, I divide the total minutes by 60.",
    "360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours."

  "solution": "6"
