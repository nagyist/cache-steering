  "query": "Andrew bought a big bag of balloons. The bag had 303 blue balloons and 453 purple balloons. If Andrew shares half of his balloons with his brother, how many balloons does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of balloons Andrew has.",
    "Andrew has 303 blue balloons and 453 purple balloons.",
    "I add the blue and purple balloons together: 303 + 453.",
    "303 + 453 equals 756. So, Andrew has 756 balloons in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many balloons Andrew shares with his brother.",
    "He shares half of his balloons with his brother, so I divide the total number of balloons by 2.",
    "756 divided by 2 equals 378.",
    "Andrew shares 378 balloons with his brother.",
    "To find out how many balloons Andrew has left, I subtract the number of balloons he shared from the total number of balloons.",
    "756 - 378 equals 378."

  "solution": "378"
