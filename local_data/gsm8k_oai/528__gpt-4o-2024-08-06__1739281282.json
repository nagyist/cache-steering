  "steps": [
    "James buys 3 dirt bikes at $150 each.",
    "To find the total cost of the dirt bikes, multiply 3 by $150.",
    "3 * $150 = $450",
    "James also buys 4 off-road vehicles at $300 each.",
    "To find the total cost of the off-road vehicles, multiply 4 by $300.",
    "4 * $300 = $1200",
    "Now add the total cost of the dirt bikes and the off-road vehicles.",
    "$450 + $1200 = $1650",
    "It costs $25 to register each of the vehicles.",
    "There are 3 dirt bikes and 4 off-road vehicles, making a total of 7 vehicles.",
    "Multiply the number of vehicles (7) by the registration cost ($25).",
    "7 * $25 = $175",
    "Add the registration cost to the total cost of the vehicles.",
    "$1650 + $175 = $1825"
