  "query": "Roger had a 6-hour drive planned out.  He didn't want to listen to music so he downloaded several podcasts.  The first podcast was 45 minutes long.  The second podcast was twice as long as that.  The third podcast was 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  His fourth podcast is 1 hour long.  How many hours will his next podcast have to be to fill up the full 6 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "Roger's first podcast is 45 minutes long.",
    "The second podcast is twice as long as the first podcast.",
    "45 minutes multiplied by 2 equals 90 minutes.",
    "The second podcast is 90 minutes long.",
    "The third podcast is given as 1 hour and 45 minutes long.",
    "1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes.",
    "Therefore, 1 hour and 45 minutes equals 60 minutes plus 45 minutes.",
    "1 hour and 45 minutes equals 105 minutes.",
    "The fourth podcast is 1 hour long.",
    "1 hour equals 60 minutes.",
    "Now, we need to add up the total time of all the podcasts in minutes.",
    "First podcast: 45 minutes",
    "Second podcast: 90 minutes",
    "Third podcast: 105 minutes",
    "Fourth podcast: 60 minutes",
    "Calculate the total time: 45 + 90 + 105 + 60.",
    "45 + 90 equals 135.",
    "135 + 105 equals 240.",
    "240 + 60 equals 300 minutes.",
    "The total of all the podcasts is 300 minutes.",
    "Roger wants to fill a total of 6 hours with the podcasts.",
    "Convert 6 hours to minutes. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, multiply 6 by 60.",
    "6 hours equals 360 minutes.",
    "Subtract the current total podcast time from the total desired time: 360 - 300.",
    "360 - 300 equals 60.",
    "Roger's next podcast needs to be 60 minutes long."
