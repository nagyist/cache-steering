    "The total cost of the shirt is $3.",
    "Macey has already saved $1.50.",
    "I need to find out how much more Macey needs to save.",
    "Subtract the amount Macey has already saved from the total cost: $3 - $1.50 = $1.50.",

    "Macey saves $0.50 per week.",
    "To find the number of weeks she needs to continue saving, divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings: $1.50 / $0.50 = 3 weeks."
