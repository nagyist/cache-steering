  "query": "GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pieces of mushrooms were used in total by Kenny and Karla.",
    "According to the problem, Kenny used 38 pieces and Karla used 42 pieces.",
    "I need to add these two numbers to find out the total number of pieces they used.",
    "38 + 42 = 80",
    "So, Kenny and Karla used 80 pieces of mushrooms combined.",
    "I also know that there are 8 pieces left on the cutting board.",
    "To find the total number of pieces GiGi had initially, I add the pieces used by Kenny and Karla to the pieces left.",
    "80 + 8 = 88",
    "GiGi had initially cut 88 pieces of mushrooms in total.",
    "Each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces. To find out how many whole mushrooms GiGi started with, I divide the total pieces by 4.",
    "88 divided by 4 equals 22.",
    "This means GiGi cut up 22 mushrooms at the beginning."
