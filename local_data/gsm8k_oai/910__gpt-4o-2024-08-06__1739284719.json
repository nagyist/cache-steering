  "query": "John buys 1/2 gallon jugs of cold brew coffee every 4 days.  How many cups of coffee does he drink a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how much cold brew coffee John buys every 4 days.",
    "He buys 1/2 gallon jug every 4 days.",
    "Next, I need to convert the amount he buys to cups because the question asks about cups per day.",
    "There are 16 cups in a gallon.",
    "Therefore, in 1/2 gallon, there are 16 * 1/2 = 8 cups of coffee.",
    "Now, I know John drinks 8 cups of coffee every 4 days.",
    "To find out how many cups he drinks per day, I divide the total cups by the number of days.",
    "8 cups \u00f7 4 days = 2 cups per day."

  "solution": "2"
