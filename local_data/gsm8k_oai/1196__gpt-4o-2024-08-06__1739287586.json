  "query": "The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, while the Carlo  Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley. Calculate the total age of the three brands of wine if the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the ages of all three wine brands. I know the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.",
    "I also know the Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley, so I calculate the age of Twin Valley as 40 years divided by 4.",
    "40 divided by 4 equals 10 years. Thus, the Twin Valley is 10 years old.",
    "The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi. So, I calculate 40 years times 3.",
    "40 times 3 equals 120 years. Therefore, the Franzia wine is 120 years old.",
    "To find the total age of the three brands, I add their ages together: 40 + 10 + 120.",
    "40 plus 10 equals 50, and 50 plus 120 equals 170."

  "solution": "170"
