  "query": "Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to first calculate how many total days it will take for Olaf to travel 4,000 miles.",
    "The boat travels 200 miles per day.",
    "I will divide the total distance by the daily distance: 4,000 miles / 200 miles per day.",
    "4,000 / 200 = 20 days.",
    "Now I will calculate the total amount of water needed for all 25 men for these 20 days.",
    "Each man, including Olaf, needs 1/2 gallon of water per day.",
    "Total water needed for one man for the journey: 1/2 gallon/day * 20 days = 10 gallons.",
    "There are 25 men in total.",
    "Total water needed for 25 men: 25 men * 10 gallons = 250 gallons."

  "solution": "250"
