  "query": "Kameron has 100 kangaroos on his large farm; Bert has 20 kangaroos on his farm. In how many more days will Bert have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now if he buys kangaroos at the same rate of 2 new kangaroos per day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the difference in the number of kangaroos between Kameron and Bert. Kameron has 100 kangaroos, and Bert has 20 kangaroos.",
    "To find the difference, I subtract the number of kangaroos Bert has from the number Kameron has: 100 - 20 = 80 kangaroos.",
    "Bert is acquiring kangaroos at the rate of 2 kangaroos per day.",
    "I need to calculate how many days it will take Bert to acquire 80 more kangaroos at the rate of 2 kangaroos per day.",
    "To find the number of days required, I divide the difference in kangaroos by the rate at which Bert is acquiring them: 80 kangaroos \u00f7 2 kangaroos per day = 40 days.",
    "I have determined that it will take Bert 40 days."

  "solution": "40"
