  "query": "Joy is winding balls of yarn for her cat to play with. The first ball is half the size of the second ball. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. She used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. How many feet of yarn did she use for the second ball?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining the variables for the sizes of the balls of yarn in terms of feet. Let \\( x \\) represent the size of the first ball of yarn in feet.",
    "We know that the first ball is half the size of the second ball. Therefore, the second ball is \\( 2x \\) feet.",
    "The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. Thus, the third ball is \\( 3x \\) feet.",
    "It is given that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. Therefore, \\( 3x = 27 \\).",
    "To find the size of the first ball \\( x \\), we solve the equation \\( 3x = 27 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \\( x \\): \n\\[ x = \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\]",
    "Now that we know \\( x = 9 \\), we can find the size of the second ball. The second ball is \\( 2x \\).",
    "Substitute \\( x = 9 \\) into the expression for the second ball: \n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]",
    "Joy used 18 feet of yarn for the second ball."
