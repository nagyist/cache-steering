  "query": "Brian is a real estate agent. He makes a 2% commission on each sale. During June, he sold three houses. The houses sold for $157,000, $499,000, and $125,000. What was Brian\u2019s total commission on these three sales?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the commission for each house sale separately.",
    "For the first house sold for $157,000, the commission is 2% of $157,000.",
    "To find 2% of $157,000, calculate \\(157,000 \\times 0.02\\).",
    "Perform the multiplication: \\(157,000 \\times 0.02 = 3,140\\).",
    "The commission for the first house is $3,140.",
    "Next, calculate the commission for the second house sold for $499,000.",
    "The commission is 2% of $499,000.",
    "To find 2% of $499,000, calculate \\(499,000 \\times 0.02\\).",
    "Perform the multiplication: \\(499,000 \\times 0.02 = 9,980\\).",
    "The commission for the second house is $9,980.",
    "Now, calculate the commission for the third house sold for $125,000.",
    "The commission is 2% of $125,000.",
    "To find 2% of $125,000, calculate \\(125,000 \\times 0.02\\).",
    "Perform the multiplication: \\(125,000 \\times 0.02 = 2,500\\).",
    "The commission for the third house is $2,500.",
    "Now, sum up all the commissions from the three houses: $3,140 + $9,980 + $2,500.",
    "Perform the addition: \\(3,140 + 9,980 = 13,120\\).",
    "Then add \\(13,120 + 2,500\\).",
    "Perform the addition: \\(13,120 + 2,500 = 15,620\\)."
