  "query": "Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month. This month he bought twice as many so that he has 40 toy cars now. How many toy cars did Jerome have originally?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Jerome bought 5 new toy cars last month.",
    "This month Jerome bought twice as many toy cars as last month.",
    "Twice as many toy cars this month means 2 times 5, which is 10 toy cars.",
    "So, Jerome bought 10 toy cars this month.",
    "Jerome now has 40 toy cars in total.",
    "I will add the 5 toy cars from last month to the 10 toy cars from this month to see how many new toy cars Jerome bought in total.",
    "5 + 10 = 15 toy cars that Jerome bought in total over the last two months.",
    "To find how many toy cars Jerome originally had, I will subtract the total number of toy cars he bought from the current total of 40.",
    "40 - 15 = 25 toy cars.",
    "Thus, Jerome originally had 25 toy cars before these two months."

  "solution": "25"
