  "query": "Mark had 10 pieces of fruit to eat in school this week. On Friday, he decided to keep 2 pieces of fruit for next week. He then brings the remaining 3 pieces of fruit to school for the day. How many pieces of fruit did Mark eat in the first four days of the week?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark started with 10 pieces of fruit for the week.",
    "On Friday, he decided to keep 2 pieces for next week, leaving him with 10 - 2 = 8 pieces of fruit for the week.",

    "The pieces of fruit he did not bring on Friday, which are the ones he ate from Monday to Thursday, is 8 - 3 = 5 pieces of fruit."
