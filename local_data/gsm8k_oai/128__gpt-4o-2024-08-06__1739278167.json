  "query": "A school principal is booking hotel rooms for a class of 30 students to stay at during an overnight field trip.  Each of the hotel's rooms has two queen size beds, which can fit two students each, and a pull-out couch, which can fit one student.  How many rooms does the principal need to book to fit all of the students in the class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many students each room can accommodate. Each room has two queen size beds, fitting 2 students per bed, and one pull-out couch for 1 student.",
    "Calculate the total number of students one room can accommodate: 2 students per bed x 2 beds = 4 students per beds, plus 1 student on the pull-out couch = 5 students per room.",
    "Next, calculate how many rooms are needed for the 30 students. Divide the total number of students by the number of students per room: 30 students / 5 students per room = 6 rooms.",
    "Check the division to ensure it is correct. 30 divided by 5 is indeed 6, without any remainder, so 6 rooms are sufficient."

  "solution": "6"
