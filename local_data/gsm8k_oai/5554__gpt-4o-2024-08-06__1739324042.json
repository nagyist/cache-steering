  "query": "Dante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs. If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that Dante needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs.",
    "Dante uses 60 eggs in his recipe.",
    "To find the number of cups of flour he needs, I need to calculate half of the number of eggs.",
    "Half of 60 eggs is 60 / 2 = 30 cups of flour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs he uses altogether.",
    "The total number is the sum of the cups of flour and the number of eggs.",
    "So, 30 cups of flour + 60 eggs = 90 total."
