  "query": "Djibo is 17 years old. Five years ago Djibo added his age with his sister's age and the sum was 35. How many years old is Djibo's sister today?",
  "steps": [
    "Djibo is currently 17 years old.",
    "Five years ago, Djibo would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old.",
    "Let S be Djibo's sister's age 5 years ago.",
    "According to the problem, five years ago the sum of their ages was 35.",
    "So we have the equation: 12 + S = 35.",
    "Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides: S = 35 - 12.",
    "S = 23. This means Djibo's sister was 23 years old five years ago.",
    "To find Djibo\u2019s sister's current age, we add 5 to her age from five years ago.",
    "Djibo's sister's current age is 23 + 5 = 28 years old."
