  "query": "Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out what 100% of Mitzel's allowance was, given that 35% equals $14.",
    "I can set up a proportion: \\( 0.35x = 14 \\) where \\( x \\) is the total allowance.",
    "To find \\( x \\), I'll divide $14 by 0.35.",
    "Calculating \\( 14 \\div 0.35 = 40 \\).",
    "So, Mitzel's total allowance is $40.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money is left. Mitzel spent $14, so I subtract $14 from the total allowance of $40.",
    "Calculating \\( 40 - 14 = 26 \\)."
