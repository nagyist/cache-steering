  "query": "A person borrowed an amount of money for a year at an interest rate of 12%. If the total interest is $1500, what was the original borrowed amount?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the original borrowed amount as \\( P \\).",
    "The interest rate is 12% per annum.",
    "The formula to calculate simple interest is \\( \\text{Interest} = P \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\).",
    "In this case, the time is 1 year.",
    "Therefore, the formula becomes \\( \\text{Interest} = P \\times 0.12 \\times 1 \\).",
    "We know the total interest paid is $1500.",
    "So, \\( 1500 = P \\times 0.12 \\times 1 \\).",
    "To find \\( P \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 0.12 to solve for \\( P \\).",
    "Thus, \\( P = \\frac{1500}{0.12} \\).",
    "Calculating the division, \\( P = 12500 \\)."

  "solution": "12500"
