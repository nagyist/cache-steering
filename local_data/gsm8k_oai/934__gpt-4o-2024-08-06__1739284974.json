  "query": "Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event. If Martha received 40 turtles, how many turtles did they receive together?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting that Martha received 40 turtles.",
    "I then note that Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha.",
    "I calculate the number of turtles Marion received by adding 20 to the number of turtles Martha received: 40 + 20 = 60.",
    "Now, I find the total number of turtles they both received together by adding the turtles Marion received to the turtles Martha received: 40 + 60.",
    "40 + 60 = 100."
  ],
  "solution": "100"
