  "steps": [
    "Tilly needs to sell 100 bags.",
    "She sells each bag for $10.",
    "So her total revenue from selling the bags would be 100 bags * $10/bag.",
    "100 bags * $10/bag = $1000.",
    "Her total revenue is $1000.",
    "Tilly wants to make a profit of $300.",
    "Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs.",
    "Let the cost of each bag be x dollars.",
    "So, the total cost for 100 bags = 100 bags * x dollars/bag = 100x dollars.",
    "We set up the profit equation: Revenue - Cost = Profit.",
    "$1000 - 100x = $300.",
    "To find x, we solve the equation: $1000 - 100x = $300.",
    "Adding 100x to both sides, we get $1000 = $300 + 100x.",
    "Subtracting $300 from both sides, we get $700 = 100x.",
    "Dividing both sides by 100 to isolate x, we get x = $7."
