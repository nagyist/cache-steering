  "query": "Ofelia joined a saving challenge wherein she has to save twice the amount she saved from the previous month. In January, she saved $10. How much is she going to save in May?",
  "steps": [
    "In January, Ofelia saved $10.",
    "In February, she needs to save twice of what she saved in January.",
    "$10 times 2 equals $20, so she saves $20 in February.",
    "In March, she again needs to save twice of what she saved in February.",
    "$20 times 2 equals $40, so she saves $40 in March.",
    "In April, she needs to save twice of what she saved in March.",
    "$40 times 2 equals $80, so she saves $80 in April.",
    "In May, she needs to save twice of what she saved in April.",
    "$80 times 2 equals $160, so she saves $160 in May."
