  "query": "Yvonne brings a box of chocolates to school. Half have nuts and half do not. The students eat 80% of the ones with nuts and eat half of the ones without nuts. If there are 28 chocolates left, how many chocolates were in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining variables. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of chocolates in the box.",
    "Since half of the chocolates have nuts and the other half do not, we have two equal halves.",
    "The number of chocolates with nuts is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).",
    "The number of chocolates without nuts is also \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).",
    "80% of the chocolates with nuts are eaten. This means \\( 0.8 \\times \\frac{x}{2} \\) chocolates with nuts are eaten.",
    "Let\u2019s calculate the number of chocolates with nuts remaining. It is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - 0.8 \\times \\frac{x}{2} \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{0.8x}{2} = \\frac{0.2x}{2} = 0.1x \\).",
    "Next, half of the chocolates without nuts are eaten, which is \\( 0.5 \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{0.5x}{2} = 0.25x \\).",
    "The number of chocolates without nuts remaining is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - 0.25x \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( \\frac{x}{2} - 0.25x = \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{0.5x}{2} = \\frac{0.5x}{2} = 0.25x \\).",
    "The total number of chocolates remaining after eating is the sum of the remaining chocolates with nuts and without nuts, which equals \\( 0.1x + 0.25x = 0.35x \\).",
    "We know that there are 28 chocolates remaining in total.",
    "Set up the equation \\( 0.35x = 28 \\) to solve for \\( x \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.35, giving \\( x = \\frac{28}{0.35} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{28}{0.35} \\). First, multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to get \\( \\frac{2800}{35} \\).",
    "Now perform the division: \\( 2800 \\div 35 = 80 \\)."
