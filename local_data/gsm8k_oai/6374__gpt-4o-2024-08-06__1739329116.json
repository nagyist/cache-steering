  "query": "Jen and Tyler are gymnasts practicing flips. Jen is practicing the triple-flip while Tyler is practicing the double-flip. Jen did sixteen triple-flips during practice. Tyler flipped in the air half the number of times Jen did. How many double-flips did Tyler do?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Jen flipped in the air during her practice.",
    "Jen is practicing triple-flips, which means she flips 3 times per triple-flip.",
    "Since Jen did 16 triple-flips, I multiply the number of flips per triple-flip by the number of triple-flips Jen did.",
    "16 triple-flips multiplied by 3 flips per triple-flip equals 48 flips in the air.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many times Tyler flipped in the air. According to the problem, Tyler flipped half the number of times Jen did.",
    "I divide the number of flips Jen did, 48, by 2 to find the number of flips Tyler did.",
    "48 divided by 2 equals 24 flips in the air for Tyler.",
    "Now I need to determine how many double-flips Tyler did. Each double-flip consists of 2 flips in the air.",
    "I divide the number of flips Tyler did, 24, by the number of flips per double-flip, which is 2.",
    "24 divided by 2 equals 12 double-flips."

  "solution": "12"
