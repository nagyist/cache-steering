  "steps": [
    "The gecko eats 12 bugs.",
    "The lizard eats half as many bugs as the gecko.",
    "Half of 12 bugs is 6 bugs.",
    "Therefore, the lizard eats 6 bugs.",
    "The frog eats 3 times as many bugs as the lizard.",
    "3 times 6 bugs is 18 bugs.",
    "Therefore, the frog eats 18 bugs.",
    "The toad eats 50% more bugs than the frog.",
    "50% of 18 bugs is 9 bugs.",
    "18 bugs + 9 bugs is 27 bugs.",
    "Therefore, the toad eats 27 bugs.",
    "Now, add up all the bugs eaten:",
    "12 bugs (gecko) + 6 bugs (lizard) + 18 bugs (frog) + 27 bugs (toad)",
    "12 + 6 is 18.",
    "18 + 18 is 36.",
    "36 + 27 is 63."
