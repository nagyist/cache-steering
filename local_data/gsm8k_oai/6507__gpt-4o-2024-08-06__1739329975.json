  "query": "There were 2450 sheets of paper that were evenly split into 5 binders. Justine took a binder and colored on one-half of the sheets of paper. How many sheets of paper did Justine use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sheets of paper are in each binder.",
    "The total number of sheets is 2450, and they are split evenly into 5 binders.",
    "To find the number of sheets in each binder, I will divide 2450 by 5.",
    "2450 \u00f7 5 = 490, so there are 490 sheets of paper in each binder.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many sheets Justine colored on.",
    "Justine colored on one-half of the sheets in her binder.",
    "To get one-half of the sheets in one binder, I will divide 490 by 2.",
    "490 \u00f7 2 = 245, so Justine colored on 245 sheets of paper."

  "solution": "245"
