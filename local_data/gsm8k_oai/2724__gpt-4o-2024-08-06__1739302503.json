  "query": "Jimmy is setting up a garden. He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings of veggies as each carrot, and each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. If each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables, and each plot has 9 plants, how many servings of vegetables is Jimmy growing?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first determine how many servings each carrot plant produces. We are told each carrot plant produces 4 servings of vegetables.",
    "The carrot plot has 9 plants, so the total servings from the carrot plot is 9 plants * 4 servings/plant = 36 servings.",
    "Next, let's determine how many servings each corn plant produces. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings as each carrot plant.",
    "A carrot plant produces 4 servings, so each corn plant produces 5 * 4 = 20 servings.",
    "The corn plot also has 9 plants, so the total number of servings from the corn plot is 9 plants * 20 servings/plant = 180 servings.",
    "Now, let's calculate the servings produced by each green bean plant. Each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant.",
    "Each corn plant produces 20 servings, so each green bean plant produces 20 / 2 = 10 servings.",
    "The green bean plot also has 9 plants, so the total number of servings from the green bean plot is 9 plants * 10 servings/plant = 90 servings.",
    "Now we have the total servings from each type of plant: carrots (36 servings), corn (180 servings), and green beans (90 servings).",
    "To find the total number of servings from all the plots, we need to add the servings from each plot together: 36 + 180 + 90.",
    "Calculating the total: 36 + 180 = 216.",
    "Then add the green beans servings: 216 + 90 = 306."

  "solution": "306"
