  "query": "Ashley had already blown up 12 balloons for the party when Andy took over and started blowing them up at a rate of 2 every five minutes. When Andy stopped, there were 50 balloons. For how many minutes did Andy blow up balloons?",
  "steps": [
    "I know there were already 12 balloons when Andy started blowing them up.",
    "The final number of balloons was 50.",
    "So, the additional balloons blown up by Andy are \\(50 - 12\\).",
    "Subtracting gives me \\(50 - 12 = 38\\).",
    "Therefore, Andy blew up 38 balloons.",
    "Andy blows up balloons at a rate of 2 every five minutes.",
    "I need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons Andy blew up to get to 38.",
    "Dividing 38 by 2 gives me \\(38 \\div 2 = 19\\).",
    "So Andy blew up 19 sets of 2 balloons.",
    "Each set takes 5 minutes.",
    "So for 19 sets, Andy took \\(19 \\times 5\\) minutes.",
    "Calculating that gives me \\(19 \\times 5 = 95\\)."

  "solution": "95"
