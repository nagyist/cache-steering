  "query": "Candied yams fly off the shelf during the holiday season. The store buys them in bulk boxes of 25 packages. If every third shopper buys a package of candied yams, how many bulk boxes of candied yams will the store need to order for their 375 predicted holiday shoppers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many shoppers will buy candied yams.",
    "It is given that every third shopper buys a package.",
    "To find the number of shoppers who buy a package, I will divide the total number of shoppers by 3.",
    "375 shoppers divided by 3 equals 125 shoppers.",
    "Now, I have found that 125 shoppers will buy a package of candied yams.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many bulk boxes are needed.",
    "Each bulk box contains 25 packages of candied yams.",
    "To find the number of boxes needed, I will divide the total number of packages needed by the number of packages in each box.",
    "125 packages divided by 25 packages per box equals 5 boxes.",
    "Thus, the store needs to order 5 bulk boxes of candied yams."
