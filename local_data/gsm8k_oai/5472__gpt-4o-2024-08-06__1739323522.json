  "query": "Care and Rick have a repair shop. Each repair is priced differently: phone repair costs $11, laptop repair costs $15 and computer repair costs $18. If they perform 5 phone repairs, 2 laptop repairs, and 2 computer repairs for this week, how much did they earn for the week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much they earn from phone repairs.",
    "They performed 5 phone repairs, and each phone repair costs $11.",
    "To find out the total earnings from phone repairs, I multiply the number of phone repairs (5) by the cost of each phone repair ($11).",
    "5 phone repairs * $11 per phone repair = $55.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much they earn from laptop repairs.",
    "They performed 2 laptop repairs, and each laptop repair costs $15.",
    "To find out the total earnings from laptop repairs, I multiply the number of laptop repairs (2) by the cost of each laptop repair ($15).",
    "2 laptop repairs * $15 per laptop repair = $30.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much they earn from computer repairs.",
    "They performed 2 computer repairs, and each computer repair costs $18.",
    "To find out the total earnings from computer repairs, I multiply the number of computer repairs (2) by the cost of each computer repair ($18).",
    "2 computer repairs * $18 per computer repair = $36.",
    "Finally, I need to add up all the earnings from each type of repair to find the total earnings for the week.",
    "$55 (phone repairs) + $30 (laptop repairs) + $36 (computer repairs) = $121."
