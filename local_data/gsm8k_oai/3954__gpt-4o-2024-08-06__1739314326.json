He adds a fenced-in area next to the farm made of 57 building blocks. If Jesse has 84 building blocks left, how many building blocks did he start with?",

    "Jesse builds a building with 80 building blocks.",
    "He then builds a farmhouse with 123 building blocks.",
    "He adds a fenced-in area with 57 building blocks.",
    "To find the total number of blocks used so far, I need to add the blocks from the building, farmhouse, and fence.",
    "80 (building) + 123 (farmhouse) = 203 blocks used so far.",
    "203 (so far) + 57 (fenced area) = 260 blocks used in total.",

    "260 (used) + 84 (left) = 344 building blocks originally."
