    "A carton of ice cream contains 10 scoops each.",

    "First, let's determine how many scoops have been taken from the chocolate carton.",
    "Ethan takes 1 scoop of chocolate.",
    "Lucas takes 2 scoops of chocolate.",
    "Danny takes 2 scoops of chocolate.",
    "Connor takes 2 scoops of chocolate.",
    "In total, 1 (Ethan) + 2 (Lucas) + 2 (Danny) + 2 (Connor) = 7 scoops of chocolate are taken.",
    "A chocolate carton has 10 scoops initially, so 10 - 7 = 3 scoops of chocolate are left.",

    "Olivia takes 1 scoop of strawberry.",
    "Shannon takes 2 scoops of strawberry.",
    "In total, 1 (Olivia) + 2 (Shannon) = 3 scoops of strawberry are taken.",

    "Olivia takes 1 scoop of vanilla.",
    "Shannon takes 2 scoops of vanilla.",
    "In total, 1 (Ethan) + 1 (Olivia) + 2 (Shannon) = 4 scoops of vanilla are taken.",

    "Now, add up the remaining scoops from each carton: 3 (chocolate) + 7 (strawberry) + 6 (vanilla) = 16 scoops of ice cream left."
