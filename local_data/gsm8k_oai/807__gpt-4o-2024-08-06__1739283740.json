  "query": "Yuan is 7 years older than his brother David and twice his age. How old is David?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define David's age as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Yuan is 7 years older than David, so Yuan's age can be expressed as \\( x + 7 \\).",
    "Yuan is also twice David's age, which can be expressed as \\( 2x \\).",
    "Since both expressions represent Yuan's age, we can set them equal to each other: \\( x + 7 = 2x \\).",
    "To solve for \\( x \\), subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation: \\( 7 = x \\).",
    "I've found that David's age, represented by \\( x \\), is 7 years old."
