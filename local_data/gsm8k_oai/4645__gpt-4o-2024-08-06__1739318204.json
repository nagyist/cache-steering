  "query": "There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the variables: I have white, red, and blue marbles with a total of 50 marbles.",
    "From the given information, there were originally 20 white marbles.",
    "The remaining marbles are red and blue, which together total 30 (i.e., 50 - 20).",
    "It is stated that the number of red and blue marbles is equal.",
    "So, if R = B, then R + B = 30 implies R = 15 and B = 15.",
    "Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles.",
    "The number of white marbles is 20 and the number of blue marbles is 15.",
    "The difference between the number of white marbles and blue marbles is 20 - 15 = 5.",
    "Double the difference means 2 * 5 = 10 marbles will be removed.",
    "Initially, there are 50 marbles in the box.",
    "After removing 10 marbles, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40."
