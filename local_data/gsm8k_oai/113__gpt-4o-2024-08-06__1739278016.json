  "query": "Baez has 25 marbles. She loses 20% of them one day. Then a friend sees her and gives her double the amount that Baez has after she lost them. How many marbles does Baez end up with?",
  "steps": [
    "Baez starts with 25 marbles.",
    "She loses 20% of them.",
    "To calculate 20% of 25, I use the formula: (20/100) * 25.",
    "(20/100) * 25 = 5.",
    "So, she loses 5 marbles.",
    "Subtracting 5 from 25, Baez now has 25 - 5 = 20 marbles.",
    "Her friend gives her double the amount of marbles she now has.",
    "Baez currently has 20 marbles.",
    "Double that amount is 20 * 2 = 40 marbles.",
    "Adding these 40 marbles to Baez's current total: 20 + 40 = 60 marbles."
