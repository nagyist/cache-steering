  "query": "Mary sees three breeding balls with 8 snakes each and 6 additional pairs of snakes. How many snakes did she see total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of snakes in the breeding balls.",
    "There are 3 breeding balls with 8 snakes each.",
    "To find out how many snakes are in the breeding balls in total, I multiply 3 by 8.",
    "3 multiplied by 8 equals 24. So, there are 24 snakes in the breeding balls.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of snakes in the additional pairs.",
    "There are 6 pairs of snakes, and each pair consists of 2 snakes.",
    "To find out how many snakes are in these pairs, I multiply 6 by 2.",
    "6 multiplied by 2 equals 12. So, there are 12 snakes in the pairs.",
    "To find the total number of snakes, I need to add the number of snakes in the breeding balls and the number of snakes in the pairs together.",
    "24 snakes in the breeding balls plus 12 snakes in the pairs equals 36."
