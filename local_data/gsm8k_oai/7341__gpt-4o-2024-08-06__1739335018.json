  "query": "LaKeisha is mowing lawns to raise money for a collector set of books. She charges $.10 for every square foot of lawn. The book set costs $150. If she has already mowed three 20 x 15 foot lawns, how many more square feet does she have to mow to earn enough for the book set?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much LaKeisha has already earned from the lawns she has mowed.",
    "Each lawn she mowed was 20 x 15 feet.",
    "The area of each lawn is 20 * 15 = 300 square feet.",
    "She mowed three lawns, so the total square footage is 3 * 300 = 900 square feet.",
    "She charges $0.10 per square foot, so she earned 900 * $0.10 = $90 from the lawns she has already mowed.",
    "The book set costs $150, so she needs $150 - $90 = $60 more to buy the books.",
    "To find out how many more square feet she must mow to earn $60, I divide $60 by her rate, which is $0.10 per square foot.",
    "$60 \u00f7 $0.10 = 600 square feet."

  "solution": "600"
