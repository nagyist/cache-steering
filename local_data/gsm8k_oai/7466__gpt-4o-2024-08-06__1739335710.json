  "query": "Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Janet spends on clarinet lessons each week. She pays $40 per hour for 3 hours.",
    "The weekly cost for clarinet lessons is $40/hour * 3 hours = $120.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Janet spends on piano lessons each week. She pays $28 per hour for 5 hours.",
    "The weekly cost for piano lessons is $28/hour * 5 hours = $140.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in weekly costs between piano and clarinet lessons.",
    "The difference each week is $140 - $120 = $20.",
    "To find the annual difference, I need to multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a year.",
    "Assuming there are 52 weeks in a year, the annual difference is $20/week * 52 weeks = $1040."

  "solution": "1040"
