  "query": "Randy has 1 more baseball glove than 7 times the number of bats he has. If he has 29 baseball gloves, how many bats does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of bats Randy has be represented by the variable \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Randy has 1 more baseball glove than 7 times the number of bats he has.",
    "This can be expressed as the equation: Number of baseball gloves = \\( 7x + 1 \\).",
    "We know from the problem that Randy has 29 baseball gloves.",
    "Substitute 29 for the number of baseball gloves in the equation: \\( 7x + 1 = 29 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: \\( 7x + 1 - 1 = 29 - 1 \\).",
    "This simplifies to: \\( 7x = 28 \\).",
    "Next, divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( \\frac{7x}{7} = \\frac{28}{7} \\).",
    "This simplifies to: \\( x = 4 \\).",
    "Randy has 4 bats."
