  "query": "Jackson collects 45 hermit crabs, 3 spiral shells per hermit crab, and 2 starfish per spiral shell. How many souvenirs does he collect total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many spiral shells Jackson has.",
    "He has 45 hermit crabs, and each hermit crab has 3 spiral shells.",
    "To find the total number of spiral shells, I multiply the number of hermit crabs by the number of spiral shells per hermit crab: 45 hermit crabs * 3 spiral shells = 135 spiral shells.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many starfish Jackson collects.",
    "He collects 2 starfish per spiral shell.",
    "To find the total number of starfish, I multiply the number of spiral shells by the number of starfish per spiral shell: 135 spiral shells * 2 starfish = 270 starfish.",
    "Now, I add the number of hermit crabs, spiral shells, and starfish to get the total number of souvenirs.",
    "Jackson has 45 hermit crabs, 135 spiral shells, and 270 starfish.",
    "The total number of souvenirs is the sum: 45 + 135 + 270.",
    "Adding these numbers, I get 45 + 135 = 180.",
    "Now, add the starfish: 180 + 270 = 450."
