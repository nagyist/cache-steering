  "query": "Joe found a new series to watch with a final season that will premiere in 10 days. The series has 4 full seasons already aired; each season has 15 episodes. To catch up with the season premiere he has to watch all episodes. How many episodes per day does Joe have to watch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many total episodes Joe needs to watch.",
    "Each of the 4 seasons has 15 episodes.",
    "Therefore, the total number of episodes is 4 seasons * 15 episodes per season.",
    "Calculating this, 4 * 15 = 60 episodes in total.",
    "Joe has 10 days to watch these episodes before the new season premieres.",
    "I need to determine how many episodes Joe should watch per day.",
    "To find this, I divide the total number of episodes by the number of days: 60 episodes / 10 days.",
    "Calculating this, 60 / 10 = 6 episodes per day."

  "solution": "6"
