  "query": "Adam has 18 magnets. He gave away a third of the magnets, and he still had half as many magnets as Peter. How many magnets does Peter have?",
  "steps": [
    "Adam originally has 18 magnets.",
    "Adam gives away a third of his magnets.",
    "A third of 18 is 18 / 3 = 6.",
    "After giving away 6 magnets, Adam is left with 18 - 6 = 12 magnets.",
    "Adam's remaining magnets are half as many as Peter's magnets.",
    "If 12 is half of Peter's magnets, then Peter must have twice as many magnets as Adam has now.",
    "Twice of 12 is 12 * 2 = 24."
