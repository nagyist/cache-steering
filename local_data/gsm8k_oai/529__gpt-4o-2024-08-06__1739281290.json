  "query": "A one-way ticket costs $2. A 30-day pass costs $50. What's the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the cost per ride if I use a one-way ticket. Each one-way ticket costs $2, so the cost per ride is $2.",
    "Next, I need to find the cost per ride with a 30-day pass. The 30-day pass is $50, and I need to determine the number of rides to make the cost per ride strictly cheaper than $2.",
    "To find when the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper, I set up the inequality \\( \\frac{50}{x} < 2 \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of rides.",
    "I solve the inequality \\( \\frac{50}{x} < 2 \\) by multiplying both sides by \\( x \\) to get \\( 50 < 2x \\).",
    "Next, I divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( x \\), obtaining \\( 25 < x \\).",
    "This means \\( x \\) must be greater than 25 for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride than the one-way ticket.",
    "Therefore, the minimum number of rides you need to take every month is 26, which is the smallest integer greater than 25."
