  "query": "Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu.  There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by.  What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?",
  "steps": [
    "Keanu was surfing at a speed of 20 miles per hour.",
    "The shark was swimming alongside Keanu at the same speed, which is also 20 miles per hour.",
    "The shark doubled its speed, meaning it increased its speed by 20 miles per hour (since doubling 20 mph results in 40 mph).",
    "Now, the shark's speed is 20 mph (initial speed) + 20 mph (increase) = 40 mph.",
    "The pilot fish increased its speed by half as much as the shark's increase.",
    "The shark's increase in speed was 20 mph. Half of this is 10 mph.",
    "The pilot fish originally was swimming at the same speed as Keanu, which was 20 mph.",
    "Thus, the pilot fish's new speed is 20 mph (initial speed) + 10 mph (increase) = 30 mph."
