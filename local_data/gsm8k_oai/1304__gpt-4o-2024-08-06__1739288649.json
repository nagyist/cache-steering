  "query": "Julio receives a $1 commission for every customer that buys in Edgars Fashion Store. The store sells to 35 customers in the first week, twice as many in the second week, and triple as many as the first week in the third week. If he receives a salary of $500 for the 3 weeks and a bonus of $50, how much in total does he earn for the 3 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many customers bought from the store in each week.",
    "In the first week, the number of customers is 35.",
    "In the second week, the store has twice as many customers as the first week, which is 2 * 35 = 70 customers.",
    "In the third week, the store has triple the number of customers as the first week, which is 3 * 35 = 105 customers.",
    "Now, I will add up the customers from all three weeks to know the total number of customers.",
    "The total number of customers over the three weeks is 35 + 70 + 105 = 210.",
    "Since Julio receives a $1 commission per customer, his total commission will be equal to the total number of customers, which is $210.",
    "Next, I will calculate his total earnings by adding the commission, salary, and bonus.",
    "His salary for the 3 weeks is $500.",
    "His bonus is $50.",
    "Therefore, his total earnings will be $210 (commission) + $500 (salary) + $50 (bonus).",
    "Calculating the sum gives $210 + $500 + $50 = $760."

  "solution": "760"
