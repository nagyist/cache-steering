  "query": "Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many calories Brandon gets from catching squirrels in one hour.",
    "Brandon can catch 6 squirrels in one hour.",
    "Each squirrel has 300 calories.",
    "To find the total calories from 6 squirrels, I have to multiply the number of squirrels by the calories per squirrel.",
    "So, 6 squirrels * 300 calories per squirrel = 1800 calories.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many calories Brandon gets from catching rabbits in one hour.",
    "Brandon can catch 2 rabbits in one hour.",
    "Each rabbit has 800 calories.",
    "To find the total calories from 2 rabbits, I have to multiply the number of rabbits by the calories per rabbit.",
    "So, 2 rabbits * 800 calories per rabbit = 1600 calories.",
    "Now, I know that catching squirrels gives Brandon 1800 calories per hour and catching rabbits gives him 1600 calories per hour.",
    "I need to find the difference in calories between catching squirrels and rabbits.",
    "1800 calories from squirrels - 1600 calories from rabbits = 200 calories."
