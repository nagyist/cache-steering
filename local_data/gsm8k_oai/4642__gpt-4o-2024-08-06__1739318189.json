  "query": "Mcgregor and Floyd were assigned 89 books to read for the week. If Mcgregor was able to finish 34 while Floyd was able to finish 32, how many books do they still have to read?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many books have been read in total by McGregor and Floyd.",
    "Mcgregor read 34 books.",
    "Floyd read 32 books.",
    "To find the total number of books they both have read, I need to add the number of books read by McGregor and Floyd.",
    "34 + 32 = 66",
    "So, together they have read 66 books.",
    "The total number of books assigned to them was 89.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the total number of books they have read from the total number of books assigned to determine how many books they still have to read.",
    "89 - 66 = 23"
  ],
  "solution": "23"
