  "query": "Gabe has three songs on his playlist. \u201cThe Best Day\u201d is 3 minutes, \u201cRaise the Roof\u201d is 2 minutes, and \u201cRap Battle\u201d is 3 minutes. How many times can Gabe listen to his entire playlist on the 40-minute ride to his wrestling match?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total duration of the entire playlist.",
    "The duration of \"The Best Day\" is 3 minutes.",
    "The duration of \"Raise the Roof\" is 2 minutes.",
    "The duration of \"Rap Battle\" is 3 minutes.",
    "I will add these durations together to find the total duration of the playlist.",
    "3 minutes + 2 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.",
    "The total duration of the playlist is 8 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many times Gabe can listen to this 8-minute playlist in the 40-minute ride.",
    "I will divide the total ride time by the total playlist duration.",
    "40 minutes divided by 8 minutes per playlist equals 5.",
    "This means Gabe can listen to his entire playlist 5 times during the ride."
