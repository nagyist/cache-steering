  "query": "John has 20% more boxes than Jules. Jules has 5 more boxes than Joseph. Joseph has 80% fewer boxes than Stan. If Stan has 100 boxes, how many boxes does John have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many boxes Joseph has.",
    "Stan has 100 boxes. Joseph has 80% fewer boxes than Stan.",
    "To find 80% fewer boxes, I calculate 80% of 100.",
    "80% of 100 is 0.8 \u00d7 100 = 80.",
    "Joseph has 100 - 80 = 20 boxes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many boxes Jules has.",
    "Jules has 5 more boxes than Joseph.",
    "So, Jules has 20 + 5 = 25 boxes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many boxes John has.",
    "John has 20% more boxes than Jules.",
    "To find 20% more, I calculate 20% of 25.",
    "20% of 25 is 0.2 \u00d7 25 = 5.",
    "Adding this to Jules's 25 boxes, John has 25 + 5 = 30 boxes."

  "solution": "30"
