  "query": "John has a large water collection tank.  The tank can hold 200 gallons.  It weighs 80 pounds empty.  A rainstorm fills it to 80% of capacity.  If a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, how much does it weigh now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the capacity of the tank in gallons. The tank can hold a total of 200 gallons.",
    "I need to find out how many gallons of water are in the tank when it is filled to 80% of its capacity.",
    "To find 80% of 200 gallons, I multiply 200 by 0.80.",
    "200 gallons * 0.80 = 160 gallons.",
    "The tank is filled with 160 gallons of water during the rainstorm.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the weight of the water alone. I know that each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.",
    "So, the weight of the water is 160 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon.",
    "160 * 8 = 1280 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to find the total weight of the tank when it is filled with water.",
    "The empty tank weighs 80 pounds.",
    "I add the weight of the water to the weight of the empty tank to find the total weight.",
    "1280 pounds (water) + 80 pounds (empty tank) = 1360 pounds."
  ],
  "solution": "1360"
