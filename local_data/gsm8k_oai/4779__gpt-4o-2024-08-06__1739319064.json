  "query": "Melony makes $21 of profit every time she sells 3 shirts and four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals. How much profit will she make if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the profit Melony makes from selling shirts.",
    "Melony makes $21 profit from selling 3 shirts.",
    "To find the profit per shirt, I'll divide $21 by 3.",
    "$21 divided by 3 equals $7 profit per shirt.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the profit she makes from pairs of sandals.",
    "Melony makes four times as much profit from 2 pairs of sandals as she does from 3 shirts.",
    "Since she makes $21 from 3 shirts, four times this amount is 4 times $21.",
    "4 times $21 equals $84.",
    "So, she makes $84 profit from selling 2 pairs of sandals.",
    "Now, I'll find the profit per pair of sandals. I'll divide $84 by 2.",
    "$84 divided by 2 equals $42 profit per pair of sandals.",
    "Now, I have the profit amounts: $7 per shirt and $42 per pair of sandals.",
    "Melony sells 7 shirts, so I will calculate the profit from shirts by multiplying 7 shirts by $7 profit per shirt.",
    "7 times $7 equals $49 profit from 7 shirts.",
    "Melony also sells 3 pairs of sandals, so I'll calculate the profit from sandals by multiplying 3 pairs by $42 profit per pair of sandals.",
    "3 times $42 equals $126 profit from 3 pairs of sandals.",
    "To find Melony's total profit, I'll add the profit from shirts and the profit from sandals.",
    "$49 plus $126 equals $175 total profit."
