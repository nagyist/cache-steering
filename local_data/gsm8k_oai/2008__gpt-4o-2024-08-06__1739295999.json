  "query": "25% of oysters have pearls in them. Jamie can collect 16 oysters during each dive. How many dives does he have to make to collect 56 pearls?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of oysters with pearls for every dive Jamie makes.",
    "Since 25% of oysters have pearls, then out of 16 oysters collected in one dive, 0.25 times 16 oysters have pearls.",
    "Calculate 0.25 multiplied by 16 to find the number of oysters with pearls per dive.",
    "0.25 * 16 = 4",
    "I now know Jamie finds 4 oysters with pearls per dive.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many dives it will take to collect 56 pearls.",
    "Dividing the total number of pearls needed by the number of pearls found per dive gives the number of dives needed.",
    "56 divided by 4 equals 14.",
    "Jamie needs to make 14 dives to collect 56 pearls."
