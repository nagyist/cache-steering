  "query": "Tim is stuck in traffic for twice as long as he was driving.  He drove 5 hours.  How long was the trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between the time Tim was driving and the time he was stuck in traffic.",
    "The problem states that Tim was stuck in traffic for twice as long as he was driving.",
    "He drove for 5 hours.",
    "So, the time he was stuck in traffic would be twice that of his driving time.",
    "Calculating twice the driving time: 2 * 5 = 10 hours.",
    "Now, I should add the driving time and the time spent stuck in traffic to find the total trip time.",
    "The total trip time is 5 hours (driving) + 10 hours (stuck in traffic) = 15 hours."

  "solution": "15"
