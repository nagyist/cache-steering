  "query": "A quarterback steps back to throw 80 times in a game.  30 percent of the time he does not get a pass thrown.  Half of the times that he does not throw the ball he is sacked for a loss.  How many times is the quarterback sacked for a loss in the game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many times the quarterback does not get a pass thrown. He steps back to throw 80 times in a game.",
    "30 percent of the time, he does not get a pass thrown. So, I need to calculate 30 percent of 80.",
    "30 percent of 80 is calculated as 0.3 multiplied by 80.",
    "0.3 multiplied by 80 is 24. This means the quarterback does not get a pass thrown 24 times.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many of these times he gets sacked for a loss. I'm told that half of the times he does not throw the ball, he is sacked for a loss.",
    "Half of 24 is calculated as 24 divided by 2.",
    "24 divided by 2 is 12.",
    "So, the quarterback is sacked for a loss 12 times in the game."

  "solution": "12"
