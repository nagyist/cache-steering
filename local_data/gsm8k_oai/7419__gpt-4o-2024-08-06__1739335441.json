  "query": "Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to define variables for the number of candies each person has. Let's say Corey has C candies.",
    "According to the problem, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey, so she has C + 8 candies.",
    "Together, Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies.",
    "I can set up the equation to represent the total number of candies: C + (C + 8) = 66.",
    "Simplify the equation: 2C + 8 = 66.",
    "Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate terms with C: 2C = 66 - 8.",
    "Calculate 66 - 8: 58.",
    "Now the equation is 2C = 58.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for C: C = 58 / 2.",
    "Calculate 58 divided by 2: 29.",
    "Corey has 29 candies."

  "solution": "29"
