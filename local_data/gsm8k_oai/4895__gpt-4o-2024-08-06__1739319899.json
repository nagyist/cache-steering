  "query": "Christina and her friend are driving across the state. When Christina is driving the speed limit is 30 miles per hour. When her friend is driving, the speed limit is 40 miles per hour. The drive is 210 miles total. If her friend drives for 3 hours and both drive at the speed limit, how many minutes will Christina drive?",
  "steps": [
    "The total distance of the drive is 210 miles.",
    "Christina's friend drives at 40 miles per hour.",
    "Christina's friend drives for 3 hours.",
    "To calculate the distance her friend drives, multiply her friend's driving speed (40 miles per hour) by the time her friend drives (3 hours).",
    "Distance driven by her friend is 40 miles/hour * 3 hours = 120 miles.",
    "Subtract the distance her friend drives from the total distance of the drive to find out how far Christina needs to drive.",
    "The distance Christina needs to drive is 210 miles - 120 miles = 90 miles.",
    "Christina drives at a speed of 30 miles per hour.",
    "To find out how long Christina will drive, divide the distance Christina needs to drive (90 miles) by her driving speed (30 miles per hour).",
    "The time Christina drives is 90 miles / 30 miles per hour = 3 hours.",
    "Convert the driving time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.",
    "Christina's driving time in minutes is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes."

  "solution": "180"
