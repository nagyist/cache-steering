  "query": "A boy runs 1.5 km in 45 minutes. What is his speed in kilometers per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It wants the boy's speed in kilometers per hour.",
    "To find speed, I use the formula speed = distance / time.",
    "The distance given is 1.5 kilometers.",
    "The time taken is 45 minutes.",
    "Since I need the speed in kilometers per hour, I have to convert the time from minutes to hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "So, 45 minutes is 45/60 hours.",
    "Simplifying 45/60 gives me 3/4 hours.",
    "Now, I calculate the speed using the formula speed = distance / time.",
    "The distance is 1.5 kilometers, and the time is 3/4 hours.",
    "So, I need to divide 1.5 kilometers by 3/4 hours.",
    "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.",
    "The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.",
    "Multiplying 1.5 by 4/3 will give the speed.",
    "1.5 multiplied by 4/3 is the same as 1.5 * (4/3).",
    "First, I calculate 1.5 * 4 = 6.",
    "Then, I divide 6 by 3 to get the final speed.",
    "6 divided by 3 is 2."
