  "query": "Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?",
  "steps": [
    "Eric originally had 150 colored pencils.",
    "He divided these into 5 containers.",
    "Each container originally had 150 / 5 = 30 pencils.",
    "Another teacher brought him 30 more pencils.",
    "Now, Eric has 150 + 30 = 180 colored pencils in total.",
    "He wants to redistribute these pencils evenly across the 5 containers.",
    "To do this, divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 / 5 = 36 pencils per container.",
    "Each container will now contain 36 pencils."

  "solution": "36"
