  "query": "Alexa has a lemonade stand where she sells lemonade for $2 for one cup. If she spent $20 on ingredients, how many cups of lemonade does she need to sell to make a profit of $80?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of money Alexa wants to make to cover both her expenses and her desired profit.",
    "Alexa spent $20 on ingredients and wants to make a profit of $80.",
    "To find the total revenue she needs, I add these two amounts: $20 + $80 = $100.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cups of lemonade must be sold to reach this revenue.",
    "Each cup is sold for $2, so I need to calculate how many $2 sales make up $100.",
    "I divide the total revenue needed by the price per cup: $100 \u00f7 $2 = 50."

  "solution": "50"
