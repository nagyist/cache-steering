  "query": "Tabitha and her friends were excited to go to the Christmas parade because they knew candy would be thrown to the crowd from the floats.  Tabitha caught 22 pieces of candy.  Stan caught 13 pieces.  Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha caught and Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan.  How many pieces in total did the friends catch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much candy Julie caught. Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha. Tabitha caught 22 pieces.",
    "Half of 22 is 22 / 2 = 11 pieces.",
    "Now I know Julie caught 11 pieces of candy.",
    "Next, I determine how much candy Carlos caught. Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan. Stan caught 13 pieces.",
    "Twice of 13 is 13 * 2 = 26 pieces.",
    "Now I know Carlos caught 26 pieces of candy.",
    "Now I sum the total number of pieces of candy caught by all of them.",
    "Tabitha caught 22 pieces, Stan caught 13 pieces, Julie caught 11 pieces, and Carlos caught 26 pieces.",
    "I add these amounts together: 22 + 13 + 11 + 26.",
    "22 + 13 = 35.",
    "35 + 11 = 46.",
    "46 + 26 = 72."

  "solution": "72"
