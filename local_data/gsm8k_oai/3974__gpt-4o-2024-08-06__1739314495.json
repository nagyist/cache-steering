  "query": "John reads his bible every day.  He reads for 2 hours a day and reads at a rate of 50 pages an hour.  If the bible is 2800 pages long how many weeks will it take him to read it all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pages John reads in a day.",
    "He reads 2 hours a day and at a rate of 50 pages per hour.",
    "To find out how many pages he reads per day, I calculate 2 hours per day times 50 pages per hour.",
    "2 * 50 equals 100 pages per day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many total pages are in the Bible.",
    "The Bible is 2800 pages long.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many days John will take to read all of the 2800 pages.",
    "To do this, I divide the total number of pages, 2800, by the number of pages he reads per day, which is 100.",
    "2800 divided by 100 equals 28 days.",
    "Finally, I need to find out how many weeks 28 days corresponds to.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "I divide 28 days by 7 days per week.",
    "28 divided by 7 equals 4 weeks."
