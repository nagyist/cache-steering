  "query": "Abe owns a restaurant. Every month he spends a third of his budget on food, a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies, and the rest of his budget on employee wages. If his budget is $3000 and he uses it up every month, how much is he spending on wages?",
  "steps": [
    "Abe's total monthly budget is $3000.",
    "He spends a third of his budget on food.",
    "To calculate the amount spent on food, I take one third of $3000: $3000 * (1/3).",
    "$3000 * (1/3) = $3000 / 3 = $1000.",
    "Abe spends $1000 on food.",
    "He spends a quarter of his budget on restaurant supplies.",
    "To calculate the amount spent on supplies, I take one quarter of $3000: $3000 * (1/4).",
    "$3000 * (1/4) = $3000 / 4 = $750.",
    "Abe spends $750 on restaurant supplies.",
    "I need to find out how much of his budget he spends on wages.",
    "He uses up all of his budget every month, so the remaining budget goes towards wages.",
    "To calculate the amount spent on wages, I subtract the amounts spent on food and supplies from the total budget: $3000 - $1000 - $750.",
    "$3000 - $1000 = $2000.",
    "$2000 - $750 = $1250.",
    "Abe spends $1250 on employee wages."

  "solution": "1250"
