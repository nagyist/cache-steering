  "query": "There are 48 passengers on the bus. Two-thirds of the passengers are women and the rest are men.  If one-eighth of the men are standing, how many men are seated?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of women on the bus.",
    "There are 48 passengers in total.",
    "Two-thirds of these passengers are women.",
    "Calculate two-thirds of 48.",
    "48 divided by 3 is 16.",
    "16 times 2 is 32.",
    "So, there are 32 women on the bus.",
    "Now, calculate the number of men on the bus.",
    "Subtract the number of women from the total passengers.",
    "48 minus 32 equals 16.",
    "So, there are 16 men on the bus.",
    "Next, determine how many men are standing.",
    "One-eighth of the men are standing.",
    "Calculate one-eighth of 16.",
    "16 divided by 8 equals 2.",
    "So, 2 men are standing.",
    "Now, calculate the number of men who are seated.",
    "Subtract the number of standing men from the total men.",
    "16 minus 2 equals 14."
