  "query": "Hannah comes home from work to find her older son taped her younger son to a chair with 22 strands of duct tape. If Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute and her son can cut 3 strands per minute, how long will it take them to free her younger son?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of strands that need to be cut. It's given that there are 22 strands of duct tape.",
    "Next, calculate how many strands can be cut per minute by both Hannah and her son together. Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute.",
    "Her son can cut 3 strands per minute.",
    "Together, they can cut 8 + 3 = 11 strands per minute.",
    "Divide the total number of strands, 22, by the number of strands they can cut per minute, which is 11.",
    "22 divided by 11 is 2.",
    "Therefore, it will take them 2 minutes to cut all 22 strands."

  "solution": "2"
