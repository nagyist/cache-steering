  "query": "Christy and her friend Tanya go to Target to buy some face moisturizer and body lotions. Christy spends twice as much as Tanya, who pays 50$ for two face moisturizers each and 60$ per body lotion, buying four of them. How much money did they spend together in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much Tanya spends in total. She buys two face moisturizers.",
    "Each face moisturizer costs $50, so for two moisturizers, she spends 2 * $50.",
    "Calculating that gives me 2 * 50 = $100.",
    "Tanya also buys four body lotions at $60 each.",
    "For the four body lotions, she spends 4 * $60.",
    "Calculating that gives me 4 * 60 = $240.",
    "To find out how much Tanya spends in total, I add up the amounts spent on face moisturizers and body lotions.",
    "So, Tanya's total expenses are $100 + $240.",
    "Calculating that gives me $340.",
    "The problem states that Christy spends twice as much as Tanya.",
    "So, Christy's spending is 2 * $340.",
    "Calculating that gives me 2 * 340 = $680.",
    "Finally, to find the total amount spent by both Christy and Tanya, I add their expenses together.",
    "So, the total is $340 (Tanya) + $680 (Christy).",
    "Calculating that gives me $1020."

  "solution": "1020"
