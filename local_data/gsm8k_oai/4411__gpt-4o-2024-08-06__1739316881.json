  "query": "Alexis can sew a skirt in 2 hours and a coat in 7 hours. How long does it take for Alexis to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how long it takes Alexis to sew one skirt.",
    "Alexis takes 2 hours to sew one skirt.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the time required to sew 6 skirts.",
    "For 6 skirts, the total time is 6 skirts \u00d7 2 hours/skirt = 12 hours.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it takes Alexis to sew one coat.",
    "Alexis takes 7 hours to sew one coat.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the time required to sew 4 coats.",
    "For 4 coats, the total time is 4 coats \u00d7 7 hours/coat = 28 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find the total time required to sew both 6 skirts and 4 coats.",
    "The total time is the sum of the time for skirts and the time for coats, which is 12 hours + 28 hours.",
    "Calculating the sum, I get 12 hours + 28 hours = 40 hours."
