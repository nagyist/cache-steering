  "query": "Monika went out for the day and spent some money. She went to the mall and spent $250. Then, she went to the movies and watched 3 movies back to back that each cost $24. Then she stopped by the farmer's market on her way home and got 20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag. How much money did Monika spend throughout her day?",
  "steps": [
    "Monika spent $250 at the mall.",
    "Movies cost $24 each, and she watched 3 movies.",
    "The cost for the movies is 3 times $24.",
    "3 times $24 equals $72.",
    "Monika spent $72 on movies.",
    "She bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25 each.",
    "To find the total cost for the beans, multiply 20 by $1.25.",
    "20 times $1.25 equals $25.",
    "Monika spent $25 at the farmer's market on beans.",
    "Now, add up all her expenses: $250 + $72 + $25.",
    "$250 plus $72 equals $322.",
    "$322 plus $25 equals $347."

  "solution": "347"
