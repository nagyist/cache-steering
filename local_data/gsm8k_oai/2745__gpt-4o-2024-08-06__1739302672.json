  "query": "During a staff meeting, 50 doughnuts were served. If each of the 19 staff ate 2 doughnuts, how many doughnuts are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Begin by identifying the total number of doughnuts: 50.",
    "Determine how many doughnuts each staff member ate: 2 doughnuts per person.",
    "Calculate the total number of doughnuts consumed by all 19 staff members: 19 staff members \u00d7 2 doughnuts each.",
    "19 \u00d7 2 = 38. So, 38 doughnuts were eaten by the staff members.",
    "Subtract the number of doughnuts eaten from the total number of doughnuts available: 50 - 38.",
    "Perform the subtraction: 50 - 38 = 12."
