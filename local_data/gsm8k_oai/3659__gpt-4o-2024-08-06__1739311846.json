  "query": "Radhika got a new gaming system and asked everyone to get her games as gifts to add to the games she already has that she bought with her gaming system. On Christmas, she is given 12 new video games. On her birthday in February, she is given 8 more video games. Radhika already owned 1/2 the number of games as what she was given on Christmas and her birthday. How many video games does she own now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many games Radhika was given in total on Christmas and her birthday. She received 12 games on Christmas.",
    "She received another 8 games on her birthday in February.",
    "To find the total number of games gifted to her, I add the Christmas and birthday gifts: 12 + 8 = 20 games.",
    "Now I need to determine how many games Radhika already owned.",
    "According to the problem, she originally owned 1/2 the number of games that she received as gifts. This means she owned half of 20.",
    "Calculating half of 20 gives me: 20 / 2 = 10 games.",
    "Now, I can find the total number of games Radhika owns by adding the number of games she originally owned to the number she was gifted.",
    "Radhika originally owned 10 games, and she received 20 more as gifts.",
    "Thus, the total number of games she owns now is 10 + 20 = 30 games."
