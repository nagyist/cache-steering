  "query": "To raise funds for her local soup kitchen, Didi enlisted the help of her family, friends, and neighbors. They donated 10 same-size cakes that she sliced into 8 slices per cake and started selling a slice for $1. A local business owner was so impressed by Didi's efforts that she offered to donate 50 cents for each slice Didi sold. A second business owner also offered to donate a quarter for each slice sold. If Didi sold all the slices, how much money did she raise?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, first I need to determine how many slices of cake were sold in total.",
    "Didi had 10 cakes, and each cake was sliced into 8 pieces.",
    "Therefore, the total number of slices is calculated by multiplying the number of cakes by the number of slices per cake: 10 cakes * 8 slices per cake = 80 slices.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total money earned from selling the slices.",
    "Since each slice is sold for $1, Didi earns $1 per slice sold. So, for 80 slices, she earns 80 * $1 = $80.",
    "Next, I need to account for the donations made by the business owners for each slice sold.",
    "The first business owner donates 50 cents per slice. For 80 slices, the donation is 80 * $0.50 = $40.",
    "The second business owner donates 25 cents per slice. For 80 slices, the donation is 80 * $0.25 = $20.",
    "I will now add up all the money raised: the money from sales plus both business owners' donations.",
    "Total money raised from sales = $80.\nTotal donation from the first business owner = $40.\nTotal donation from the second business owner = $20.",
    "Adding these amounts gives the total money raised: $80 + $40 + $20 = $140."

  "solution": "140"
