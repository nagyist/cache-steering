  "query": "Charley bought 30 pencils. She lost 6 pencils while moving to school, and of course, also lost 1/3 of the remaining pencils because she wasn't very good at keeping track of pencils. How many pencils does she currently have?",
  "steps": [
    "Charley initially has 30 pencils.",
    "Charley loses 6 pencils on the way to school, so I need to subtract 6 from the initial 30 pencils.",
    "30 - 6 equals 24. So, Charley now has 24 pencils.",
    "Charley then loses 1/3 of the remaining pencils. I need to calculate 1/3 of 24.",
    "1/3 of 24 equals 24 divided by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 is 8. So, Charley loses 8 more pencils.",
    "To find out how many pencils Charley currently has, I need to subtract the 8 lost pencils from the remaining 24 pencils.",
    "24 - 8 equals 16."
  ],
  "solution": "16"
