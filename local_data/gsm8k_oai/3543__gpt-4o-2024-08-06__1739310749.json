  "query": "Nancy replaced all of the old vinyl tiles in her bathroom with new hardwood flooring.  She replaced flooring in two areas of the bathroom: a 10 foot by 10 foot central area, and a 6 foot by 4 foot hallway.  How many square feet of hardwood flooring did Nancy install in her bathroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the central area where Nancy replaced the flooring.",
    "The central area is a rectangle measuring 10 feet by 10 feet.",
    "Area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.",
    "For the central area, the area is 10 feet * 10 feet.",
    "10 feet * 10 feet = 100 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to find the area of the hallway where Nancy also replaced the flooring.",
    "The hallway is a rectangle measuring 6 feet by 4 feet.",
    "Again, I use the area formula for a rectangle: length * width.",
    "For the hallway, the area is 6 feet * 4 feet.",
    "6 feet * 4 feet = 24 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to add the two areas together to find the total amount of hardwood flooring installed.",
    "The total hardwood flooring installed is the area of the central area plus the area of the hallway.",
    "100 square feet (central area) + 24 square feet (hallway) = 124 square feet."

  "solution": "124"
