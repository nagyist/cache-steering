  "query": "Jamie earns $10 an hour by delivering flyers. She delivers flyers 2 days each week. It takes her 3 hours each time she delivers flyers. After delivering flyers for 6 weeks, how much money will she have earned?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Jamie works each day delivering flyers.",
    "It is given that she works 3 hours each time she delivers flyers.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many hours she works each week.",
    "Jamie delivers flyers 2 days each week, and she works 3 hours each day.",
    "Therefore, she works 2 days * 3 hours/day = 6 hours each week.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many hours she works over the course of 6 weeks.",
    "She works 6 hours each week, so over 6 weeks, she works 6 weeks * 6 hours/week = 36 hours.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money she earns per hour.",
    "It is given that she earns $10 an hour.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total money earned by multiplying the number of hours worked by her hourly rate.",
    "She works a total of 36 hours, and she earns $10 per hour.",
    "Therefore, the total money earned is 36 hours * $10/hour = $360."
