  "query": "Hannah fills her kids' stockings with 4 candy canes, 2 beanie babies and 1 book. If she has 3 kids, how many stocking stuffers does she buy total?",
  "steps": [
    "Hannah fills each kid's stocking with 4 candy canes.",
    "She has 3 kids, so the total number of candy canes is 4 candy canes per kid times 3 kids.",
    "4 candy canes/kid * 3 kids = 12 candy canes.",
    "Hannah also fills each stocking with 2 beanie babies.",
    "She has 3 kids, so the total number of beanie babies is 2 beanie babies per kid times 3 kids.",
    "2 beanie babies/kid * 3 kids = 6 beanie babies.",
    "Additionally, Hannah includes 1 book in each stocking.",
    "She has 3 kids, so the total number of books is 1 book per kid times 3 kids.",
    "1 book/kid * 3 kids = 3 books.",
    "Now, I need to add all the items together to find the total number of stocking stuffers.",
    "Total number of items = total number of candy canes + total number of beanie babies + total number of books.",
    "12 candy canes + 6 beanie babies + 3 books = 21 stocking stuffers."
