  "query": "Mr. and Mrs. McPherson have to renew their rent by the end of the year. They agreed that Mrs. McPherson would raise 30% of the money. If their rent is $1200 per year, how much does Mr. McPherson need to raise to complete the rent?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Mrs. McPherson will contribute to the rent.",
    "Mrs. McPherson is responsible for 30% of the $1200 rent.",
    "I convert the percentage to a decimal for calculation: 30% as a decimal is 0.30.",
    "I calculate Mrs. McPherson's contribution by multiplying the rent amount by her percentage: $1200 * 0.30.",
    "$1200 * 0.30 equals $360.",
    "Next, I deduce how much Mr. McPherson needs to contribute by subtracting Mrs. McPherson's contribution from the total rent.",
    "$1200 (total rent) - $360 (Mrs. McPherson's contribution) equals $840."

  "solution": "840"
