  "query": "A zoo has 8 parrots. It 3 times the number of snakes than parrots and 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?",
  "steps": [
    "The zoo has 8 parrots.",
    "The number of snakes is 3 times the number of parrots. So, the number of snakes is 8 * 3 = 24.",
    "The number of monkeys is 2 times the number of snakes. So, the number of monkeys is 24 * 2 = 48.",
    "The number of elephants is half the total of parrots and snakes. Parrots and snakes together are 8 + 24 = 32. Half of 32 is 32 / 2 = 16. So, there are 16 elephants.",
    "There are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. So, the number of zebras is 16 - 3 = 13.",
    "The question asks for the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys. Zebras number 13, and monkeys number 48.",
    "The difference between the number of monkeys and zebras is 48 - 13 = 35."
