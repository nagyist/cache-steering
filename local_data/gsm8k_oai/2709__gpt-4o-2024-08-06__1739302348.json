  "query": "Class A is twice as big as Class B. Class A is also a third the size of Class C. If Class B has 20 people in it, how many people are in Class C?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, I need to express the relationships between the classes in terms of their sizes.",
    "Class A is twice as big as Class B. Therefore, the size of Class A is 2 times the size of Class B.",
    "Given that Class B has 20 people, I can calculate the size of Class A.",
    "The size of Class A is 2 * 20 = 40 people.",
    "Next, Class A is a third the size of Class C.",
    "That means Class C is 3 times as big as Class A.",
    "The size of Class C is then 3 times the size of Class A, which is 3 * 40.",
    "Performing this multiplication gives me 3 * 40 = 120 people."

  "solution": "120"
