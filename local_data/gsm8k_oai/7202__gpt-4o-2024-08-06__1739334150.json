  "query": "Chris has twelve marbles, and Ryan has twenty-eight marbles. If they put marbles together in a pile and then each takes away 1/4 of marbles from the pile, calculate the number of marbles remaining in the pile.",
  "steps": [
    "Chris has 12 marbles.",
    "Ryan has 28 marbles.",
    "To find the total number of marbles in the pile, I add Chris's marbles and Ryan's marbles together.",
    "12 marbles + 28 marbles = 40 marbles in the pile.",
    "Now, both Chris and Ryan each take away 1/4 of the marbles from the pile.",
    "First, I calculate how many marbles Chris will take. 1/4 of 40 marbles is 40 / 4 = 10 marbles.",
    "Now, I calculate how many marbles Ryan will take. Ryan will also take 1/4 of the pile, which again is 40 / 4 = 10 marbles.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many marbles they take away in total. Chris takes 10 marbles and Ryan takes 10 marbles.",
    "10 marbles + 10 marbles = 20 marbles are taken from the pile.",
    "To find out how many marbles are remaining in the pile, I need to subtract the total number of marbles taken from the original number of marbles in the pile.",
    "40 marbles - 20 marbles = 20 marbles remaining in the pile."

  "solution": "20"
