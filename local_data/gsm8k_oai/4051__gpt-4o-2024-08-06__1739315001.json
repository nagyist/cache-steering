  "query": "Five friends eat at Wendy's and ordered the following: a platter of Taco Salad that cost $10, 5 orders of Dave's Single hamburger that cost $5 each, 4 sets of french fries that cost $2.50, and 5 cups of peach lemonade that cost $2 each. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the Taco Salad. It costs $10.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the 5 Dave's Single hamburgers. Each hamburger costs $5, so 5 times $5 equals $25.",
    "Now, I figure out the cost of the 4 sets of french fries. Each set costs $2.50, so 4 times $2.50 equals $10.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the 5 cups of peach lemonade. Each cup costs $2, so 5 times $2 equals $10.",
    "To find the total cost of all the items, I add up the individual totals: $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (hamburgers) + $10 (french fries) + $10 (lemonade) equals $55.",
    "Now, I need to split this total bill equally between the 5 friends.",
    "To do this, I divide the total cost by the number of friends: $55 divided by 5 equals $11."
