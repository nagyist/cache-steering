  "query": "Marlon had 42 lollipops in the beginning. On his way home, he saw Emily and gave her 2/3 of his lollipops. Then, Marlon kept 4 lollipops and gave the rest to Lou. How many lollipops did Lou receive?",
  "steps": [
    "Marlon initially had 42 lollipops.",
    "Marlon gave 2/3 of his lollipops to Emily.",
    "Let's calculate how many lollipops he gave to Emily: (2/3) * 42 = 28 lollipops.",
    "Subtract the lollipops given to Emily from the initial amount: 42 - 28 = 14 lollipops left with Marlon.",
    "Marlon kept 4 lollipops for himself.",
    "Subtract the 4 lollipops he kept from the amount he had left: 14 - 4 = 10 lollipops.",
    "These 10 lollipops were given to Lou."
