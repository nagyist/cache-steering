  "query": "Claire won a $100 gift card to her favorite coffee shop. She wants to treat herself to a latte that cost $3.75 and a croissant for $3.50 every morning for a week.  She also plans to buy 5 cookies that cost $1.25 each. How much money will be left on her card after a week of coffee and pastry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of Claire's daily coffee and pastry for a week.",
    "Claire buys a latte for $3.75 and a croissant for $3.50 each morning.",
    "The total cost per morning is $3.75 + $3.50 = $7.25.",
    "She plans to buy this combination every morning for 7 days.",
    "The total weekly cost for the morning routine is $7.25 * 7 = $50.75.",
    "Now, I have to calculate the cost of the cookies.",
    "Claire plans to buy 5 cookies at $1.25 each.",
    "The total cost for cookies is 5 * $1.25 = $6.25.",
    "Next, I need to find the overall total cost of her purchases with the gift card.",
    "The sum of the weekly cost for coffee and pastry, and the cost of cookies is $50.75 + $6.25 = $57.",
    "Claire started with a $100 gift card.",
    "Thus, the remaining money on the card after these purchases is $100 - $57 = $43."

  "solution": "43"
