    "Dorchester earns a base pay of $40 per day.",
    "In addition to his base pay, Dorchester earns $2.25 for each puppy he washes.",
    "On Wednesday, Dorchester earned a total of $76.",
    "I need to find out how much Dorchester earned specifically from washing puppies. To do this, I need to subtract his base pay from the total earnings.",
