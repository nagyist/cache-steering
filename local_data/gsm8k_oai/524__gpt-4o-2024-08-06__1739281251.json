  "query": "There are 336 books in a library. On Monday, 124 books are taken out. On Tuesday, 22 books are brought back. How many books are there now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that there are originally 336 books in the library.",
    "On Monday, 124 books are taken out, so I need to subtract 124 from 336.",
    "336 - 124 equals 212. So, after Monday, there are 212 books in the library.",
    "On Tuesday, 22 books are brought back. This means I need to add 22 to 212.",
    "212 + 22 equals 234. Therefore, after Tuesday, there are 234 books in the library."

  "solution": "234"
