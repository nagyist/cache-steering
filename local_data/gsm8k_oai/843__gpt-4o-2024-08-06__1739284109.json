    "Randy starts with $30.",
    "Randy spends $10 on lunch.",
    "Subtract the $10 spent on lunch from $30.",
    "$30 - $10 = $20. So, Randy has $20 left after buying lunch.",

    "A quarter of $20 is calculated by dividing $20 by 4.",
    "$20 \u00f7 4 = $5. Randy spends $5 on the ice cream cone.",

    "$20 - $5 = $15. So, Randy has $15 left."
