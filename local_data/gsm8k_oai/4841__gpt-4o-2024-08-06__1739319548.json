  "query": "In the last 25 years, 60% of Scrabble champions have been women and the rest have been men. There is one champion per year. Of the men, 40% had a beard. How many men with beards have been Scrabble champion?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of Scrabble champions over the last 25 years.",
    "There has been one champion per year for 25 years, so the total number of champions is 25.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these champions are men.",
    "60% of the champions are women, which means 100% - 60% = 40% are men.",
    "Now, I will calculate the number of male champions.",
    "40% of 25 champions are men: 0.40 * 25 = 10 men.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these men had a beard.",
    "Of the men, 40% had a beard.",
    "Calculate 40% of the 10 male champions: 0.40 * 10 = 4 men.",
    "Therefore, the number of men with beards who have been Scrabble champion is 4."
