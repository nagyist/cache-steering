  "query": "Lidia bought a new tablet, and she needs to buy some apps for it. One app costs $4 on average, and Lidia needs 15 of them. She has $66 for this purpose. How much money will she be left with if she buys all the apps she needs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much it will cost for Lidia to buy the apps.",
    "Each app costs $4 on average.",
    "Lidia needs 15 apps.",
    "To find the total cost for 15 apps, I will multiply the number of apps by the cost of each app.",
    "15 apps * $4 per app = $60.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money Lidia will have left after buying the apps.",
    "Lidia started with $66.",
    "The cost of the apps is $60.",
    "To find the remaining amount, I will subtract the total cost of the apps from the amount Lidia has.",
    "$66 - $60 = $6."
