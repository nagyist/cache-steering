  "query": "Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how much it rained on the first day. It rained 4 inches on the first day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much it rained on the second day. The problem states it rained 5 times as much on the second day as it did on the first day. Since it rained 4 inches on the first day, I will multiply 4 by 5.",
    "4 inches times 5 equals 20 inches. Therefore, it rained 20 inches on the second day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much it rained on the third day. The problem states it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days on the third day. So, I will add the rainfall from the first day and the second day together.",
    "The first day had 4 inches of rain, and the second day had 20 inches. So, the sum of the rainfall for the first two days is 4 + 20.",
    "4 + 20 equals 24 inches. The sum of the first two days is 24 inches.",
    "The problem states it rained 6 inches less than this sum on the third day. So, I need to subtract 6 from 24 to find the rainfall on the third day.",
    "24 minus 6 equals 18 inches. Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day."

  "solution": "18"
