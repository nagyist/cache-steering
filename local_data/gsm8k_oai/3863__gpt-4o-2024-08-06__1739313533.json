  "query": "It takes 2.5 hours to groom a dog and 0.5 hours to groom a cat. What is the number of minutes it takes to groom 5 dogs and 3 cats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total time it takes to groom 5 dogs.",
    "It takes 2.5 hours to groom one dog.",
    "For 5 dogs, the time is 5 times 2.5 hours.",
    "5 multiplied by 2.5 equals 12.5 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total time it takes to groom 3 cats.",
    "It takes 0.5 hours to groom one cat.",
    "For 3 cats, the time is 3 times 0.5 hours.",
    "3 multiplied by 0.5 equals 1.5 hours.",
    "I now add the time for grooming dogs and cats together.",
    "12.5 hours (for dogs) plus 1.5 hours (for cats) equals 14 hours in total.",
    "Finally, I need to convert 14 hours into minutes.",
    "1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.",
    "14 hours is 14 times 60 minutes.",
    "14 multiplied by 60 equals 840 minutes."
