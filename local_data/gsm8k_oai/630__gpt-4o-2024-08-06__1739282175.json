  "query": "On her birthday, Avianna bought red candles and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3. If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the ratio of red candles to blue candles is 5:3.",
    "Avianna had 45 red candles.",
    "The ratio 5:3 means for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles.",
    "To find out how many sets of red candles fit into 45, I can divide 45 by 5.",
    "45 divided by 5 equals 9.",
    "So, there are 9 sets of 5 red candles.",
    "Each set of 5 red candles corresponds to a set of 3 blue candles.",
    "Therefore, there are 9 sets of 3 blue candles.",
    "To find the total number of blue candles, I multiply 9 by 3.",
    "9 multiplied by 3 equals 27."

  "solution": "27"
