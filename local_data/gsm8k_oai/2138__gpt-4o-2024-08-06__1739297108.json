  "steps": [
    "The carpenter made ten tables this month.",
    "Last month, he made three fewer tables than this month.",
    "Three fewer than ten is 10 - 3 = 7.",
    "Last month, the carpenter made 7 tables.",
    "Now, to find the total number of tables made in these two months, I need to add the tables from both months.",
    "So, the total number of tables made is 10 (this month) + 7 (last month).",
    "10 + 7 = 17."
