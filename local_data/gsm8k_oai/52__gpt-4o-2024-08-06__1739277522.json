  "query": "Arnel had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  He kept ten pencils and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. If his friends got eight pencils each, how many pencils are in each box?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Arnel has ten boxes of pencils, and each box has the same number of pencils.",
    "Let's say each box has \"x\" pencils. Then, 10 boxes would contain 10 times x pencils, which is 10x pencils.",
    "According to the problem, Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself and then shared the rest equally among his five friends.",
    "Each friend received 8 pencils, and since there are 5 friends, the total number of pencils given to friends is 5 times 8, which equals 40 pencils.",
    "So, the number of pencils after Arnel kept 10 and gave 40 more pencils to his friends is 10 + 40 = 50 pencils.",
    "Since 10x represents the total number of pencils Arnel had, and after distributing and keeping some, 10x equals 50 pencils.",
    "Now let's solve for x in the equation 10x = 50.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for x: x = 50 / 10.",
    "Thus, x = 5."

  "solution": "5"
