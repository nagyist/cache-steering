  "query": "Cary is saving money to buy a new pair of shoes that cost $120. He has already saved $30. He earns $5 for every lawn he mows. If he mows 3 lawns each weekend, how many more weekends will he have to mow lawns before he can afford to buy the shoes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much more money Cary needs to save to buy the shoes. The shoes cost $120, and he has already saved $30.",
    "To find out how much more money he needs, I subtract the amount he has saved from the cost of the shoes: $120 - $30 = $90.",
    "Next, I calculate how much money Cary earns each weekend. He earns $5 for every lawn he mows, and he mows 3 lawns each weekend.",
    "To find out his weekly earnings, I multiply the number of lawns by the earnings per lawn: 3 lawns x $5/lawn = $15 per weekend.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many weekends it will take for Cary to save the remaining $90. I do this by dividing the remaining amount needed by his weekly earnings.",
    "I divide the remaining $90 by the $15 he earns each weekend: $90 \u00f7 $15/weekend = 6 weekends.",
    "Therefore, Cary will need to mow lawns for 6 more weekends to save enough money to buy the shoes."
