  "query": "Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total number of spiders Sami finds. There are 3 spiders.",
    "Next, note the total number of ants Hunter sees. There are 12 ants.",
    "Count the total number of ladybugs Ming discovers. There are 8 ladybugs.",
    "Recognize that 2 of the ladybugs fly away, reducing the number of ladybugs in the playground.",
    "Subtract the 2 ladybugs that fly away from the total number of ladybugs: 8 - 2 = 6 ladybugs remain.",
    "Calculate the total number of insects remaining by adding together the remaining ladybugs, ants, and spiders: 6 (ladybugs) + 12 (ants) + 3 (spiders).",
    "Add these numbers: 6 + 12 = 18.",
    "Add the remaining number of spiders to this total: 18 + 3 = 21."
