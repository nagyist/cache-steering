  "query": "David finished his homework in 60 minutes. He spent 15 minutes on his math homework and 18 minutes on his spelling homework. He spent the rest of the time reading for his daily reading log. How many minutes did he spend reading?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that the total time David spent on all his homework activities is 60 minutes.",
    "Next, I know that he spent 15 minutes on his math homework.",
    "Also, he spent 18 minutes on his spelling homework.",
    "Now I will add the time spent on math and spelling together: 15 minutes + 18 minutes.",
    "15 + 18 equals 33 minutes.",
    "This means he spent a combined total of 33 minutes on math and spelling homework.",
    "To find out how much time he spent reading, I'll subtract the time spent on math and spelling from the total time. So, 60 minutes - 33 minutes.",
    "60 - 33 is 27 minutes.",
    "Therefore, David spent 27 minutes reading for his daily reading log."

  "solution": "27"
