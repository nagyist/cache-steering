  "query": "Susan is taking a two week vacation. She works five days a week and has six days of paid vacation. The rest of her workdays will be unpaid vacation time. She gets paid $15 per hour and works 8 hours a day. How much pay will she miss on her vacation?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many workdays Susan usually has in two weeks.",
    "Susan works five days a week.",
    "In two weeks, she would work 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 workdays.",
    "Susan has six days of paid vacation.",
    "So, out of the 10 workdays, 6 days are paid.",
    "Therefore, the remaining 10 workdays - 6 paid workdays = 4 workdays will be unpaid.",
    "Now, let's calculate how many hours she works in a day.",
    "Susan works 8 hours per day.",
    "For the 4 unpaid days, she won't be paid for 4 days * 8 hours/day = 32 hours.",
    "She earns $15 per hour.",
    "Thus, the pay she will miss for those 32 hours is 32 hours * $15/hour.",
    "32 * 15 = 480."
  ],
  "solution": "480"
