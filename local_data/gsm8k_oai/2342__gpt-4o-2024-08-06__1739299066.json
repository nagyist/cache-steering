  "query": "An internet provider gives a 5% discount if the customer pays before the 25th day of the month. If the monthly internet rate is $50, how much did the customer pay in all for 4 months if he paid every 25th of the month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the monthly internet rate, which is $50.",
    "Calculate the discount amount. A 5% discount on $50 is calculated as 0.05 * $50.",
    "0.05 * $50 equals $2.50.",
    "Subtract the discount amount from the original monthly rate to find the discounted rate. $50 - $2.50 equals $47.50.",
    "Since the customer pays every 25th of the month, he qualifies for the discount each month.",
    "Multiply the discounted rate by 4 months. $47.50 * 4 equals $190."
  ],
  "solution": "190"
