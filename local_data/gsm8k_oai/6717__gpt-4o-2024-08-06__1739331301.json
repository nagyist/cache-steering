  "query": "In four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet. If Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age, who is 60, how old is Harriet now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine Peter's current age. It is given that Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age.",
    "Peter's mother is 60 years old, so Peter is half of 60.",
    "Calculate half of 60, which is 30.",
    "So, Peter is currently 30 years old.",
    "In four years, Peter will be 30 + 4 = 34 years old.",
    "It is given that in four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet.",
    "Let Harriet's current age be H years.",
    "In four years, Harriet's age will be H + 4.",
    "According to the problem, 34 (Peter's age in four years) will be twice Harriet's age in four years.",
    "Set up the equation: 34 = 2(H + 4).",
    "Solve for H: First, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate (H + 4).",
    "34 divided by 2 is 17. So, 17 = H + 4.",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for H.",
    "17 - 4 equals 13.",
    "Harriet's current age, H, is 13."
