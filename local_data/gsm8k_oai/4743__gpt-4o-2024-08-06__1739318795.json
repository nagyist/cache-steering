  "query": "Mike changes tires on different vehicles.  He changes all the tires on 12 motorcycles and all the tires on 10 cars.  How many tires did he change?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tires are on a motorcycle. Each motorcycle has 2 tires.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many tires Mike changed for the motorcycles. There are 12 motorcycles, and each has 2 tires.",
    "12 motorcycles times 2 tires per motorcycle equals 24 tires. So, Mike changed 24 tires for all motorcycles.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tires are on a car. Each car has 4 tires.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many tires Mike changed for the cars. There are 10 cars, and each has 4 tires.",
    "10 cars times 4 tires per car equals 40 tires. So, Mike changed 40 tires for all cars.",
    "Now, I'll add the number of tires Mike changed for both the motorcycles and cars together.",
    "24 tires from motorcycles plus 40 tires from cars equals 64 tires."

  "solution": "64"
