  "query": "Alicia has 20 gumballs. Pedro has that many gumballs plus an additional number of gumballs equal to three times the number Alicia has. They put their gumballs in a bowl, and later Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs to eat. How many gumballs are remaining in the bowl?",
  "steps": [
    "Alicia has 20 gumballs.",
    "Pedro has the number of gumballs Alicia has, which is 20, plus an additional three times that amount.",
    "Three times the number of gumballs Alicia has is 3 * 20 = 60 gumballs.",
    "So Pedro has 20 + 60 = 80 gumballs.",
    "Next, they put their gumballs together in a bowl. The total number of gumballs in the bowl is Alicia's 20 plus Pedro's 80.",
    "20 + 80 = 100. Thus, there are 100 gumballs in the bowl.",
    "Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs to eat.",
    "To find out how many gumballs Pedro takes out, we calculate 40% of 100.",
    "40% of 100 is 0.40 * 100 = 40 gumballs.",
    "Pedro takes out 40 gumballs, meaning the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl is the original total minus the number taken out.",
    "100 - 40 = 60 gumballs remain in the bowl."
