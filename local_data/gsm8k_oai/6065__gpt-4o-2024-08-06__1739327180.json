  "query": "Anna has 50 pencils and Harry has twice the number of Anna\u2019s Pencils but he lost 19 of them. How many pencils are left with Harry?",
  "steps": [
    "Anna has 50 pencils.",
    "Harry has twice the number of Anna's pencils.",
    "To find out how many pencils Harry initially had, I multiply Anna's pencils by 2.",
    "50 multiplied by 2 equals 100.",
    "So, Harry initially had 100 pencils.",
    "However, Harry lost 19 pencils.",
    "To find out how many pencils Harry has left, I subtract the lost pencils from the initial total.",
    "100 minus 19 equals 81."
