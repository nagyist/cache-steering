    "The show was on the air for 10 seasons.",
    "The total number of seasons is split into two halves: the first 5 seasons and the second 5 seasons.",
    "In the first half, there were 20 episodes per season.",
    "In the second half, there were 25 episodes per season.",
    "First, I need to calculate the number of episodes in the first 5 seasons.",
    "5 seasons * 20 episodes per season = 100 episodes",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of episodes in the second 5 seasons.",
    "5 seasons * 25 episodes per season = 125 episodes",
    "Now, I will add the episodes from both halves together.",
    "100 episodes (first half) + 125 episodes (second half) = 225 episodes"
