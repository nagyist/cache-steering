  "query": "Bobby has three squares of fabric that he will turn into a flag. The first square is 8 feet by 5 feet. The second one is 10 feet by 7 feet. The third one is 5 feet by 5 feet. If he wants his flag to be 15 feet long, how tall will it be?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total area of fabric Bobby has.",
    "The area of the first square is 8 feet x 5 feet = 40 square feet.",
    "The area of the second square is 10 feet x 7 feet = 70 square feet.",
    "The area of the third square is 5 feet x 5 feet = 25 square feet.",
    "Adding these areas together, the total area of fabric is 40 + 70 + 25 = 135 square feet.",
    "Bobby wants his flag to be 15 feet long, so I need to divide the total area by the length to find the height.",
    "If the flag is 15 feet long, then the height will be the total area divided by the length: 135 square feet \u00f7 15 feet = 9 feet."
