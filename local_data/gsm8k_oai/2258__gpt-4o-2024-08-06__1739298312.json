  "query": "Dan has two times as many stickers as Tom. Tom has 3 times as many stickers as Bob. If Bob has 12 stickers, how many does Dan have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stickers Tom has.",
    "According to the problem, Tom has 3 times as many stickers as Bob.",
    "Bob has 12 stickers.",
    "So, I calculate the number of stickers Tom has by multiplying Bob's stickers by 3.",
    "Tom's stickers = 12 * 3 = 36 stickers.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many stickers Dan has.",
    "Dan has two times as many stickers as Tom.",
    "I multiply the number of stickers Tom has by 2 to find Dan's stickers.",
    "Dan's stickers = 36 * 2 = 72 stickers."
