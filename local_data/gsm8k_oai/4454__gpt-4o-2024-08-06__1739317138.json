  "query": "James is building a hall of mirrors. Three of the walls will be completed covered with glass. If two of those walls are 30 feet by 12 feet and the third is 20 feet by 12 feet, how many square feet of glass does he need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of the first two identical walls.",
    "Each of the first two walls measures 30 feet in width and 12 feet in height.",
    "The area of one of these walls is calculated as: 30 feet * 12 feet.",
    "The area of one of the first two walls is 360 square feet.",
    "Since there are two such walls, their combined area is: 2 * 360 square feet.",
    "The combined area of the first two walls is 720 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the area of the third wall.",
    "The third wall measures 20 feet in width and 12 feet in height.",
    "The area of the third wall is calculated as: 20 feet * 12 feet.",
    "The area of the third wall is 240 square feet.",
    "To find the total area of glass needed, I add the area of the two identical walls to the area of the third wall.",
    "So, the total area is: 720 square feet + 240 square feet.",
    "The total area of glass needed is 960 square feet."

  "solution": "960"
