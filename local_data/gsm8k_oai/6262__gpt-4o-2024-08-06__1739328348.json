  "query": "The ratio of books to pens that Arlo has to buy for his school supplies is 7:3. If he bought a total of 400 stationery from the store, calculate the number of books he bought.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by understanding the ratio, which is 7:3 for books to pens.",
    "This means for every 7 books, there are 3 pens.",
    "The ratio can be represented as 7x for books and 3x for pens, where x is a common multiplier.",
    "The total number of items he bought is 400.",
    "According to the ratio, the total number of items (books and pens) can be expressed as 7x + 3x.",
    "Simplifying this gives us 10x, which is the total number of items.",
    "Since we know the total number of items is 400, we can set up the equation 10x = 400.",
    "To find the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by 10.",
    "x = 400 / 10",
    "x = 40",
    "Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of books by substituting x back into 7x.",
    "The number of books is 7 * 40.",
    "7 * 40 = 280"
  ],
  "solution": "280"
