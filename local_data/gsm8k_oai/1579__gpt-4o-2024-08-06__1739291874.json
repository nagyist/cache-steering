  "query": "Last night, Olive charged her phone for 10 hours. Assuming each hour of charge lasts the phone 2 hours of use, calculate the total time Olive would be able to use her phone before it goes off if she charges it for 3/5 of the time she charged the phone last night.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Olive charged her phone last night. She charged it for 10 hours.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many hours of charge Olive should use, given she charges it for 3/5 of the time she charged last night.",
    "To calculate 3/5 of 10 hours, I multiply 10 by 3/5.",
    "10 * 3/5 = 30/5 = 6 hours of charging.",
    "Each hour of charge provides the phone with 2 hours of use.",
    "If Olive charges her phone for 6 hours, the total hours of use will be 6 hours of charging multiplied by 2 hours of use per hour of charging.",
    "6 * 2 = 12 hours of use."
  ],
  "solution": "12"
