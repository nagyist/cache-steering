  "query": "Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's denote the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, which is twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses.",
    "This gives us the equation: \\( 2x = 500 \\).",
    "Let's solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2: \\( x = \\frac{500}{2} = 250 \\).",
    "So, Joseph pays $250 for the power used by the water heater.",
    "The problem also states that the amount Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater.",
    "This gives us the equation for the refrigerator: \\( 3x = 3 \\times 250 = 750 \\).",
    "Therefore, Joseph pays $750 for the power used by the refrigerator.",
    "We know from the problem that Joseph pays $500 for the electric oven.",
    "Now let's calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by all these gadgets:",
    "Add up the amounts: $750 (refrigerator) + $250 (water heater) + $500 (oven).",
    "The total amount is \\( 750 + 250 + 500 = 1500 \\)."
