  "query": "Delta, Beta and Gamma decided to share 40 donuts. Delta took 8 donuts and Beta took three times as many as Gamma. How many donuts did Gamma receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many donuts Beta and Gamma shared in total after Delta took hers. Delta took 8 donuts from the total of 40.",
    "Subtracting the 8 donuts Delta took from the 40 total donuts, we are left with 32 donuts for Beta and Gamma to share.",
    "According to the question, Beta took three times as many donuts as Gamma. Let's denote the number of donuts Gamma received as G.",
    "This means Beta took 3G donuts.",
    "The total donuts Beta and Gamma took should equal 32, so I write the equation: G + 3G = 32.",
    "Solving for G, the equation becomes 4G = 32.",
    "Dividing both sides by 4, I find G = 8.",
    "Gamma received 8 donuts."
