  "query": "Jason is making pasta. He fills the pot with 41 degree water. Each minute the temperature of the water increases by 3 degrees. Once the water reaches 212 degrees and is boiling, Jason needs to cook his pasta for 12 minutes. Then it will take him 1/3 that long to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad. How many minutes does it take Jason to cook dinner?",
  "steps": [
    "Jason fills the pot with water at 41 degrees.",
    "The water needs to reach a boiling point of 212 degrees.",
    "The temperature of the water increases by 3 degrees every minute.",
    "To find out how many minutes it takes for the water to reach 212 degrees, I will subtract the initial temperature from the boiling point: 212 - 41 = 171 degrees.",
    "Next, I will divide the temperature difference by the rate of heating: 171 degrees / 3 degrees per minute = 57 minutes.",
    "So, it takes 57 minutes for the water to reach boiling.",
    "Once the water is boiling, Jason cooks his pasta for 12 minutes.",
    "So far, the total time spent cooking the pasta is 57 minutes + 12 minutes = 69 minutes.",
    "After cooking the pasta, it takes Jason 1/3 of 12 minutes to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad.",
    "1/3 of 12 minutes is 12 / 3 = 4 minutes.",
    "Adding these 4 minutes to the previous total time gives us 69 minutes + 4 minutes = 73 minutes."
