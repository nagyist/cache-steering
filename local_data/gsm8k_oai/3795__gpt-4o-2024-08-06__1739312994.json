  "query": "If Natasha was going 10 mph over the speed limit and it took her an hour to arrive at her destination that was 60 miles away, what was the speed limit?",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the distance Natasha traveled is 60 miles.",
    "It also mentions that it took her 1 hour to travel that distance.",
    "To find her speed, I can divide the distance traveled by the time taken.",
    "60 miles / 1 hour = 60 mph. This is Natasha's speed.",
    "According to the question, Natasha was going 10 mph over the speed limit.",
    "Let the speed limit be x mph.",
    "Since Natasha was traveling at 60 mph and was 10 mph over the speed limit, I can set up the equation: speed limit + 10 mph = 60 mph.",
    "So, x + 10 = 60.",
    "I need to solve for x: x = 60 - 10.",
    "x = 50."

  "solution": "50"
