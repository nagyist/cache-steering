  "query": "Mike began to train to play basketball every day for a tournament. One day he plays a maximum of 2 hours. After a week of training, he increased the maximum time to 3 hours. How many hours did Mike train during the first two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many hours Mike trained over the course of two weeks.",
    "In the first week, Mike trained a maximum of 2 hours per day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "For the first week, he would have trained 2 hours per day times 7 days.",
    "2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.",
    "In the second week, he increased his maximum training time to 3 hours per day.",
    "Again, there are 7 days in a week.",
    "For the second week, he would have trained 3 hours per day times 7 days.",
    "3 hours/day * 7 days = 21 hours.",
    "Now, I need to add the hours from both weeks to find the total training time.",
    "First week's training time: 14 hours.",
    "Second week's training time: 21 hours.",
    "Total training time = 14 hours + 21 hours.",
    "14 + 21 = 35."
