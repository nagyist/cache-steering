  "query": "Andy and Dawn spent the weekend cleaning the house. When putting away the laundry Andy took six minutes more than two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes. If it took Dawn 20 minutes to wash the dishes how many minutes did it take Andy to put away the laundry?",
  "steps": [
    "Andy took six minutes more than two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes.",
    "Dawn took 20 minutes to wash the dishes.",
    "To find out how long it took Andy, I need to calculate two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes.",
    "Two times 20 minutes is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) minutes.",
    "Now, I need to add six minutes to this result because Andy took six minutes more than two times Dawn\u2019s time.",
    "40 minutes plus 6 minutes is \\(40 + 6 = 46\\) minutes."
  ],
  "solution": "46"
