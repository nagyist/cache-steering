  "query": "Angela slept 6.5 hours every night in December. She decided she should get more sleep and began sleeping 8.5 hours a night in January. How much more sleep did Angela get in January?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of days in December and January. December has 31 days.",
    "Similarly, January also has 31 days.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total amount of sleep Angela got in December. At 6.5 hours per night for 31 days, this is 6.5 hours/day * 31 days.",
    "6.5 * 31 = 201.5 hours of sleep in December.",
    "Then, I'll calculate the total amount of sleep Angela got in January. At 8.5 hours per night for 31 days, this is 8.5 hours/day * 31 days.",
    "8.5 * 31 = 263.5 hours of sleep in January.",
    "To find out how much more sleep Angela got in January compared to December, I subtract the total December sleep from the January sleep.",
    "263.5 - 201.5 = 62."
  ],
  "solution": "62"
