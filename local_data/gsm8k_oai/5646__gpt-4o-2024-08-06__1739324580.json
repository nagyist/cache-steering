  "query": "Steve decides to read a new book.  He reads 100 pages Monday, Wed, and Friday.  The book is 2100 pages long.  How many weeks does it take to read them all?",
  "steps": [
    "The book is 2100 pages long.",
    "Steve reads 100 pages each on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.",
    "So he reads 100 pages * 3 days = 300 pages per week.",
    "To determine the number of weeks, divide the total number of pages by pages read per week.",
    "That calculation is 2100 pages / 300 pages per week = 7 weeks."
