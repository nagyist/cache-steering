  "query": "Mary, Edna, and Lucy are athletes who train every Saturday. Mary ran 3/8 of a 24-kilometer field on one Saturday. Edna ran 2/3 of the distance of Edna, and Lucy ran 5/6 of the distance of Edna. How many more kilometers should Lucy run to cover the same distance as Mary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's find out how many kilometers Mary ran.",
    "Mary ran 3/8 of a 24-kilometer field.",
    "Calculate Mary's running distance: 3/8 * 24 km.",
    "3/8 * 24 = 9 km. So, Mary ran 9 kilometers.",
    "Next, let's calculate the distance Edna ran.",
    "Edna ran 2/3 of the distance of Mary.",
    "Edna's running distance: 2/3 * 9 km.",
    "2/3 * 9 = 6 km. So, Edna ran 6 kilometers.",
    "Now, calculate the distance Lucy ran.",
    "Lucy ran 5/6 of the distance of Edna.",
    "Lucy's running distance: 5/6 * 6 km.",
    "5/6 * 6 = 5 km. So, Lucy ran 5 kilometers.",
    "We need to find out how many more kilometers Lucy should run to cover the same distance as Mary.",
    "Mary's running distance is 9 kilometers, and Lucy's running distance is 5 kilometers.",
    "Subtract Lucy's distance from Mary's distance: 9 km - 5 km.",
    "9 - 5 = 4 km."
