  "query": "Blinky wants to make a three-layer birthday cake for her mom. The recipe for the smallest layer of the cake requires 2 cups of sugar. If the second layer is twice as big as the first and the third layer is three times larger than the second, how many total cups of sugar will she need for the third layer?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how much sugar is needed for each layer of the cake.",
    "The smallest layer requires 2 cups of sugar.",
    "The second layer is twice as big as the first layer.",
    "To find the amount of sugar needed for the second layer, I multiply the sugar for the first layer by 2.",
    "2 cups of sugar (first layer) x 2 = 4 cups of sugar for the second layer.",
    "The third layer is three times larger than the second layer.",
    "To find the amount of sugar needed for the third layer, I multiply the sugar for the second layer by 3.",
    "4 cups of sugar (second layer) x 3 = 12 cups of sugar for the third layer."
