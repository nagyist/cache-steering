  "query": "Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days Herman feeds the birds. December has 31 days.",
    "January also has 31 days.",
    "February typically has 28 days.",
    "I add the number of days in each month to find the total days: 31 + 31 + 28.",
    "Calculating 31 + 31, I get 62 days for December and January.",
    "Adding 28 to 62, I get 90 days for December, January, and February combined.",
    "Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.",
    "This totals 1 cup of bird food per day (1/2 + 1/2).",
    "Since Herman feeds 1 cup per day, I multiply 1 cup by the 90 days.",
    "1 cup per day times 90 days equals 90 cups."

  "solution": "90"
