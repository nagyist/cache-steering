  "query": "Blake goes to the grocery store and spends $40 on oranges, $50 on apples, and $60 on mangoes. If he has $300, how much change was he given?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how much Blake spends in total.",
    "Blake spends $40 on oranges.",
    "He spends $50 on apples.",
    "He spends $60 on mangoes.",
    "Now, I will add up the total amount spent: $40 + $50 + $60.",
    "$40 + $50 equals $90.",
    "Now, I add $60 to $90.",
    "$90 + $60 equals $150.",
    "Blake spends a total of $150.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much money Blake has initially, which is $300.",
    "Now, I subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money: $300 - $150.",
    "$300 - $150 equals $150.",
    "Therefore, the change given back to Blake is $150."

  "solution": "150"
