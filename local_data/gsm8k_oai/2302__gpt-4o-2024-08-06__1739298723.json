  "query": "Each year a store decreased the price of a certain model of TV by $35. If the price in 2001 was $1950, what was the price in 2009?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of years between 2001 and 2009.",
    "2009 minus 2001 equals 8 years.",
    "The price decreases by $35 each year.",
    "To find the total decrease over 8 years, I need to multiply the number of years by the yearly decrease.",
    "8 years times $35 per year equals $280.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the total decrease from the starting price in 2001.",
    "The original price was $1950.",
    "So, $1950 minus $280 gives the price in 2009.",
    "1950 minus 280 equals 1670."
  ],
  "solution": "1670"
