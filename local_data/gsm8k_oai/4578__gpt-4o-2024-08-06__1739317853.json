  "query": "Grace just started her own business. Each week, she charges 300 dollars. Grace's client will pay her every 2 weeks. How many weeks will it take for Grace to get 1800 dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Grace charges 300 dollars per week.",
    "She gets paid every 2 weeks.",
    "Every 2-week period, she earns 300 dollars per week multiplied by 2 weeks, which equals 600 dollars.",
    "Grace wants to earn a total of 1800 dollars.",
    "To find out how many 2-week periods it takes to earn 1800 dollars, I divide 1800 dollars by 600 dollars per 2-week period.",
    "1800 divided by 600 equals 3. So, it takes three 2-week periods to earn 1800 dollars.",
    "Since each period is 2 weeks long, I multiply 3 periods by 2 weeks per period to get the total number of weeks.",
    "3 periods multiplied by 2 weeks per period equals 6 weeks."

  "solution": "6"
