    "First, I need to determine the total number of steps Toby wants to walk over the entire week.",
    "He wants to average 9,000 steps per day for 7 days.",
    "I multiply 9,000 steps/day by 7 days to get the total steps needed for the week.",
    "9,000 steps/day * 7 days = 63,000 steps.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of steps Toby has already walked from Sunday to Thursday.",

    "Monday's steps: 9,100",
    "Tuesday's steps: 8,300",

    "9,400 + 9,100 = 18,500",

    "26,800 + 9,200 = 36,000",
    "36,000 + 8,900 = 44,900",
    "Toby has walked a total of 44,900 steps from Sunday to Thursday.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more steps Toby needs to reach his goal of 63,000 total steps.",
    "63,000 total needed steps - 44,900 steps already walked = 18,100 steps remaining.",
    "The remaining 18,100 steps must be walked over Friday and Saturday.",
