  "query": "Jeff has 16 GB of storage on his phone. He is already using 4 GB. If a song takes up about 30MB of storage, how many songs can Jeff store on his phone? (There are 1000 MB in a GB).",
  "steps": [
    "Jeff has 16 GB of total storage on his phone.",
    "He is already using 4 GB of that storage.",
    "To find out how much storage he has left, subtract the used storage from the total storage.",
    "Total storage remaining = 16 GB - 4 GB = 12 GB.",
    "Now, convert the remaining storage from GB to MB, since 1 GB = 1000 MB.",
    "Remaining storage in MB = 12 GB * 1000 MB/GB = 12000 MB.",
    "Each song takes up about 30 MB of storage.",
    "To find out how many songs Jeff can store, divide the available storage by the size of each song.",
    "Number of songs = 12000 MB / 30 MB/song.",
    "Number of songs = 400."

  "solution": "400"
