  "query": "Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the apples.",
    "There are 5 apples and each costs $1.",
    "So, the cost of the apples is 5 apples * $1/apple = $5.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost for the oranges.",
    "There are 2 oranges and each costs $2.",
    "So, the cost of the oranges is 2 oranges * $2/orange = $4.",
    "Now, I add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges to get the total cost.",
    "The total cost is $5 (apples) + $4 (oranges) = $9."
