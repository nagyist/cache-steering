  "query": "Andrea needs 45 rhinestones to finish an art project. She bought a third of what she needed and found a fifth of what she needed in her supplies. How many rhinestones does she still need?",
  "steps": [
    "Andrea needs a total of 45 rhinestones for her art project.",
    "First, let's find out how many rhinestones Andrea bought. She bought a third of what she needed.",
    "A third of 45 is calculated as 45 divided by 3.",
    "45 divided by 3 equals 15.",
    "So, Andrea bought 15 rhinestones.",
    "Now, let's find out how many rhinestones Andrea found in her supplies. She found a fifth of what she needed.",
    "A fifth of 45 is calculated as 45 divided by 5.",
    "45 divided by 5 equals 9.",
    "So, Andrea found 9 rhinestones in her supplies.",
    "Next, we need to find out how many rhinestones Andrea currently has by adding what she bought and what she found.",
    "Andrea currently has 15 (bought) plus 9 (found).",
    "15 plus 9 equals 24.",
    "Andrea has 24 rhinestones in total.",
    "To find out how many rhinestones she still needs, subtract the amount she has from the total needed.",
    "45 (total needed) minus 24 (current total) equals 21."
