  "query": "John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what \"half times younger\" means. Generally, \"half times younger\" isn't a clear term, but it might imply that John's age is half that of his father's age.",
    "John's father is 40 years old.",
    "If John is \"half times younger\" and that means he is half his father's age, we calculate John's age as 40 divided by 2.",
    "So, John's age is 20.",
    "Now, I need to find John's mother's age to determine the age difference between John and his mother.",
    "John's father is 4 years older than John's mother. Since John's father is 40, his mother must be 40 - 4.",
    "John's mother's age is 36.",
    "Finally, I find the age difference between John and his mother by subtracting John's age from his mother's age: 36 - 20."
