  "query": "Mandy has three $20 bills while Manny has two $50 bills. If both of them decide to exchange their bills for $10 bills, how many more $10 bills than Mandy will Manny have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Mandy has in terms of dollars.",
    "Mandy has three $20 bills.",
    "The total amount of money Mandy has is 3 x $20 = $60.",
    "Next, I calculate how many $10 bills Mandy can exchange her $60 for.",
    "Since each $10 bill is $10, Mandy can get $60 \u00f7 $10 = 6 $10 bills.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money Manny has in terms of dollars.",
    "Manny has two $50 bills.",
    "The total amount of money Manny has is 2 x $50 = $100.",
    "Next, I calculate how many $10 bills Manny can exchange his $100 for.",
    "Since each $10 bill is $10, Manny can get $100 \u00f7 $10 = 10 $10 bills.",
    "Now, I calculate how many more $10 bills Manny will have than Mandy.",
    "Manny has 10 $10 bills and Mandy has 6 $10 bills.",
    "The difference in the number of $10 bills is 10 - 6 = 4."
