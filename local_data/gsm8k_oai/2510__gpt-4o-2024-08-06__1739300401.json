  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total amount Lindsey saved over the three months.",
    "In September, Lindsey saved $50.",
    "In October, Lindsey saved $37.",
    "In November, Lindsey saved $11.",
    "I will sum these amounts to find the total savings: $50 + $37 + $11.",
    "$50 + $37 = $87.",
    "$87 + $11 = $98.",
    "Lindsey's mom said she would give Lindsey $25 since she saved more than $75.",
    "I will add this $25 to Lindsey's total savings: $98 + $25.",
    "$98 + $25 = $123.",
    "Lindsey spent $87 on a video game.",
    "I will subtract the cost of the video game from her total amount: $123 - $87.",
    "$123 - $87 = $36."
