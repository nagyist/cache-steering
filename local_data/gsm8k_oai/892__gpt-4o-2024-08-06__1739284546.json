  "query": "An auto shop has a part that Clark needs for $80. Clark buys 7 of them and got a discount. If Clark only had to pay $439, how much was the discount?",
  "steps": [
    "The price for one part is $80.",
    "Clark buys 7 parts.",
    "To find the total cost without the discount, I multiply 7 parts by $80.",
    "$80 multiplied by 7 equals $560.",
    "Clark paid $439 in total.",
    "To find the discount, I subtract the total paid from the original total cost.",
    "$560 minus $439 equals $121."
  ],
  "solution": "121"
