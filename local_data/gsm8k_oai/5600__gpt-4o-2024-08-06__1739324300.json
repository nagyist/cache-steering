  "query": "Charles is moving from Springfield, which has 482,653 people, to Greenville, which has 119,666 fewer people. What is the total population of Springfield and Greenville?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the population of Greenville. I know it is 119,666 fewer people than Springfield.",
    "Springfield's population is 482,653. To find Greenville's population, I'll subtract 119,666 from 482,653.",
    "482,653 - 119,666 equals 362,987. Therefore, Greenville's population is 362,987.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total population of both Springfield and Greenville.",
    "To find the total population, I will add 482,653 (Springfield) and 362,987 (Greenville).",
    "482,653 + 362,987 equals 845,640."
