    "Marc bought a total of 50 episodes of \"Friends.\"",
    "He watches 1/10 of the episodes he bought each day.",
    "To find out how many episodes he watches in a day, calculate 1/10 of 50.",
    "1/10 of 50 episodes is 50 / 10.",
    "50 / 10 equals 5 episodes.",
    "So, Marc watches 5 episodes per day.",
    "Now, to find out how many days it will take to watch all the episodes, divide the total episodes by the number of episodes watched per day.",
    "50 episodes / 5 episodes per day equals 10 days."
