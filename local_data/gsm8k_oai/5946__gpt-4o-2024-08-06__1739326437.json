  "query": "Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. If the capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons and it's 3/4 full, calculate the total number of gallons of water they both have if Catherine's water heater is also full with water to 3/4 of its capacity.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the capacity of Catherine's water heater.",
    "I know Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's.",
    "The capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons.",
    "So, the capacity of Catherine's water heater is 40 gallons \u00f7 2.",
    "This means Catherine's water heater has a capacity of 20 gallons.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much water is currently in Wallace's water heater.",
    "Wallace's water heater is 3/4 full.",
    "So, the amount of water in Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons \u00d7 (3/4).",
    "Calculating this, I find that Wallace's water heater contains 30 gallons of water.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much water is in Catherine's water heater.",
    "Catherine's water heater is also 3/4 full.",
    "So, the amount of water in Catherine's water heater is 20 gallons \u00d7 (3/4).",
    "Calculating this, I find that Catherine's water heater contains 15 gallons of water.",
    "To find the total amount of water they both have, I need to add the amount of water in Wallace's heater to the amount in Catherine's.",
    "Thus, the total amount of water is 30 gallons + 15 gallons.",
    "This gives me a total of 45 gallons of water."
