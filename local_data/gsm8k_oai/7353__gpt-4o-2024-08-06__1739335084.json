  "query": "Jay went to watch a singer in a one hour 20 minutes concert.  If there was a 10-minute intermission, and all the songs were 5 minutes except for one song that lasted 10 minutes, how many songs did she sing?",
  "steps": [
    "Jay went to watch a one hour 20 minutes concert.",
    "First, I need to convert 1 hour 20 minutes into total minutes.",
    "1 hour equals 60 minutes.",
    "Therefore, 1 hour and 20 minutes equals 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.",
    "The total concert time is 80 minutes.",
    "There was a 10-minute intermission during the concert.",
    "I need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find the actual time when songs were sung.",
    "80 minutes (total concert time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 70 minutes.",
    "Now, I know that the total time of actual singing is 70 minutes.",
    "All the songs were 5 minutes each except for one song that lasted 10 minutes.",
    "Let\u2019s first account for the 10-minute song.",
    "Subtract 10 minutes for the 10-minute song from the total singing time.",
    "70 minutes - 10 minutes = 60 minutes.",
    "The remaining 60 minutes were used for songs that each last 5 minutes.",
    "To find out how many 5-minute songs there were, divide the remaining 60 minutes by 5 minutes per song.",
    "60 minutes \u00f7 5 minutes/song = 12 songs.",
    "So, there were 12 songs that lasted 5 minutes each.",
    "Including the 10-minute song, the total number of songs sung is 12 five-minute songs + 1 ten-minute song = 13 songs."
