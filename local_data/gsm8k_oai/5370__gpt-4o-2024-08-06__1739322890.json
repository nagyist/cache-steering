  "query": "If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the length of the diameter of the circle first.",
    "The formula for the diameter of a circle is \\(d = 2r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.",
    "The radius of the circle is given as 14 feet.",
    "I will substitute the radius into the diameter formula: \\(d = 2 \\times 14\\).",
    "Calculating the diameter: \\(d = 28\\) feet.",
    "Next, I need to convert the diameter from feet to inches because the pencils are measured in inches.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot.",
    "Multiplying the diameter in feet by 12 to convert to inches: \\(28 \\times 12\\).",
    "Calculating: \\(28 \\times 12 = 336\\) inches.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 6-inch pencils can fit into the 336 inches of the diameter.",
    "To find the number of pencils, I divide the total length in inches by the length of one pencil: \\(336 \\div 6\\).",
    "Calculating: \\(336 \\div 6 = 56\\)."

  "solution": "56"
