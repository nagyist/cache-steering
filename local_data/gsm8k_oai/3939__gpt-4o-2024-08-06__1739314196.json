  "query": "If Patty's dress was $10 more than Ida's dress, and Ida's dress was $30 more than Jean's dress, and Jean's dress was $10 less than Pauline's dress, and lastly Pauline's dress was $30, how much did all the ladies spend on dressed put together?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by finding out the cost of each individual's dress, beginning with Pauline, since her dress cost is directly given.",
    "Pauline's dress cost = $30.",
    "Jean's dress cost is $10 less than Pauline's dress.",
    "Jean's dress cost = $30 (Pauline's) - $10 = $20.",
    "Ida's dress cost is $30 more than Jean's dress.",
    "Ida's dress cost = $20 (Jean's) + $30 = $50.",
    "Patty's dress cost is $10 more than Ida's dress.",
    "Patty's dress cost = $50 (Ida's) + $10 = $60.",
    "Now, I'll add up the costs of all the dresses.",
    "Pauline's dress cost = $30",
    "Jean's dress cost = $20",
    "Ida's dress cost = $50",
    "Patty's dress cost = $60",
    "Total dress cost = $30 + $20 + $50 + $60",
    "Total dress cost = $160"
