  "query": "Rob has some baseball cards, and a few are doubles. One third of Rob's cards are doubles, and Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob. If Jess has 40 doubles baseball cards, how many baseball cards does Rob have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining the variables we need. Let x represent the total number of baseball cards that Rob has.",
    "We are told that one third of Rob's cards are doubles.",
    "Therefore, the number of double cards Rob has is x/3.",
    "Next, we know Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob.",
    "Jess has 40 double baseball cards.",
    "Since Jess's double cards are 5 times Rob's doubles, we can set up the equation: 5 * (x/3) = 40.",
    "Now, solve the equation for x by dividing both sides by 5 to isolate x/3. We get x/3 = 40 / 5.",
    "Simplify the right side: x/3 = 8.",
    "To find x, multiply both sides of the equation by 3: x = 8 * 3.",
    "Calculate the multiplication: x = 24."

  "solution": "24"
