  "query": "How many portions of 200 ml milk can Jasmine pour from a full 2-liter container of milk?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the conversion between liters and milliliters.",
    "1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters.",
    "Jasmine has a 2-liter container of milk.",
    "To convert 2 liters into milliliters, I multiply 2 liters by 1000 milliliters per liter.",
    "2 liters * 1000 milliliters/liter = 2000 milliliters.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 200-milliliter portions can be obtained from 2000 milliliters of milk.",
    "To find this, I divide the total milliliters by the portion size in milliliters.",
    "2000 milliliters / 200 milliliters per portion = 10 portions.",
    "I should double-check my conversion and division to ensure there are no mistakes.",
    "The conversion from liters to milliliters and division calculation both appear correct.",
    "Jasmine can pour 10 portions of 200 ml milk from the 2-liter container."
