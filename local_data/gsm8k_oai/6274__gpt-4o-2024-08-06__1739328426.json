  "query": "Jill is going to resod her front yard. The plot of land in front of her house is 200 feet wide by 50 feet. Her house has a sidewalk that is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long. There are also four flower beds: two right in front of the house that are 4 feet deep by 25 feet long, one that is 10 feet by 12 feet, and a fourth that is 7 feet by 8 feet. How many square feet of sod will she need to cover her yard, minus the sidewalk and flower beds?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total area of the plot of land in front of Jill's house.",
    "The width of the plot is 200 feet and the length is 50 feet.",
    "The total area is calculated by multiplying the width by the length: 200 feet * 50 feet.",
    "The total area of the plot is 10,000 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to find the area of the sidewalk that will not be sodded.",
    "The sidewalk is 3 feet wide and 50 feet long.",
    "The area of the sidewalk is 3 feet * 50 feet = 150 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to find the area of the first two flower beds, which are each 4 feet deep by 25 feet long.",
    "Each flower bed has an area of 4 feet * 25 feet = 100 square feet.",
    "There are two identical flower beds in front of the house.",
    "The total area for these two flower beds is 2 * 100 square feet = 200 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to find the area of the third flower bed, which is 10 feet by 12 feet.",
    "The area of the third flower bed is 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.",
    "Finally, I need to find the area of the fourth flower bed, which is 7 feet by 8 feet.",
    "The area of the fourth flower bed is 7 feet * 8 feet = 56 square feet.",
    "I will add the areas of the sidewalk and all the flower beds together to find the total area that will not be sodded.",
    "The total area not sodded is 150 (sidewalk) + 200 (first two flower beds) + 120 (third flower bed) + 56 (fourth flower bed).",
    "150 + 200 + 120 + 56 = 526 square feet will not be sodded.",
    "To find the area that will be sodded, I subtract the total area not sodded (526 square feet) from the total plot area (10,000 square feet).",
    "10,000 square feet - 526 square feet = 9,474 square feet of sod will be needed."
