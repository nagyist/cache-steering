  "query": "Josiah puts a quarter in his piggy bank every day for 24 days.  Leah saves 50 cents in an empty pickle jar every day for 20 days. Megan saves twice as much as Leah for 12 days.   How much do the three children save together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Josiah saves in total.",
    "Josiah saves a quarter each day, which is 25 cents.",
    "He saves for 24 days.",
    "Total savings of Josiah = 25 cents/day * 24 days.",
    "Let me perform the multiplication: 25 * 24 equals 600.",
    "Josiah saves a total of 600 cents, which is $6.00, since 100 cents equal 1 dollar.",
    "Next, I calculate how much Leah saves in total.",
    "Leah saves 50 cents every day.",
    "She saves for 20 days.",
    "Total savings of Leah = 50 cents/day * 20 days.",
    "Performing the multiplication: 50 * 20 equals 1000.",
    "Leah saves a total of 1000 cents, which is $10.00.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much Megan saves.",
    "Megan saves twice as much as Leah each day.",
    "Leah saves 50 cents every day, so Megan saves 50 * 2 = 100 cents every day.",
    "Megan saves for 12 days.",
    "Total savings of Megan = 100 cents/day * 12 days.",
    "Performing the multiplication: 100 * 12 equals 1200.",
    "Megan saves a total of 1200 cents, which is $12.00.",
    "Now, I should add all three amounts to determine how much the three children save together.",
    "Josiah saves $6.00, Leah saves $10.00, and Megan saves $12.00.",
    "Total savings = $6.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 = $28.00."
