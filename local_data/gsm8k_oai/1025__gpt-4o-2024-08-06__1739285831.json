  "query": "A survey conducted by the school showed that only 20% of the 800 parents agree to a tuition fee increase. How many parents disagree with the tuition fee increase?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of parents surveyed is 800.",
    "20% of the parents agree to the tuition fee increase.",
    "To find out how many parents agree, I need to calculate 20% of 800.",
    "20% of 800 is calculated by multiplying 800 by 0.20.",
    "800 multiplied by 0.20 equals 160.",
    "So, 160 parents agree to the tuition fee increase.",
    "To find the number of parents who disagree, I subtract the number who agree from the total number surveyed.",
    "800 minus 160 equals 640.",
    "So, 640 parents disagree with the tuition fee increase."

  "solution": "640"
