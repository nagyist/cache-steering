  "query": "John raises emu.  He has 4 pens for emu and each pen has 6 emus in it.  Each female emu lays 1 egg per day.  If half the emu are females how many eggs does he get a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of emus John has. He has 4 pens.",
    "Each pen has 6 emus.",
    "So, 4 pens times 6 emus each equals 24 emus in total.",
    "Half of the emus are female, so calculate half of 24.",
    "Half of 24 is 12, so there are 12 female emus.",
    "Each female lays 1 egg per day.",
    "To find out how many eggs are laid in a day, multiply the number of females by the number of eggs each lays: 12 females times 1 egg each equals 12 eggs per day.",
    "The question asks for eggs per week, so multiply the daily eggs by 7.",
    "12 eggs per day times 7 days equals 84 eggs per week."

  "solution": "84"
