  "query": "An animal shelter recently took in twelve cats. The shelter already had half that number of cats. Two days later, three had been adopted. The next day, one of the cats had five kittens, and one person arrived to pick up one of the cats that was their missing pet. How many cats does the shelter have now?",
  "steps": [
    "The shelter recently took in twelve cats.",
    "The shelter already had half that number of cats.",
    "Half of twelve is six, so the shelter had six cats initially.",
    "Adding the twelve new cats, the total number of cats is six plus twelve.",
    "Six plus twelve equals eighteen cats in the shelter.",
    "Two days later, three cats were adopted.",
    "Eighteen minus three equals fifteen cats after the adoption.",
    "The next day, one of the cats had five kittens.",
    "Adding the five kittens, the shelter now has fifteen plus five cats.",
    "Fifteen plus five equals twenty cats after the kittens were born.",
    "One cat was picked up by a person as it was their missing pet.",
    "Twenty minus one equals nineteen cats remaining in the shelter."
