  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total of all the bowling scores.",
    "Gretchen's score is 120, Mitzi's score is 113, and Beth's score is 85.",
    "I add these scores together: 120 + 113 + 85.",
    "Calculating the sum: 120 + 113 equals 233.",
    "Now I add 85 to 233.",
    "233 + 85 equals 318.",
    "Their total score is 318.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average score.",
    "There are three people: Gretchen, Mitzi, and Beth.",
    "I divide the total score, 318, by the number of people, 3.",
    "318 divided by 3 equals 106."
