  "query": "The long jump finals contained four national champions competing against one another.  The first competitor jumped a distance of 22 feet.  The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor.  The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the third competitor.  And the fourth competitor jumped 3 feet further than the third competitor.  How long, in feet, did the fourth competitor jump?",
  "steps": [
    "The first competitor jumped 22 feet.",
    "The second competitor jumped one foot farther than the first competitor, so they jumped \\(22 + 1 = 23\\) feet.",
    "The third competitor jumped two feet shorter than the second competitor, which was stated incorrectly. Let's say it should have been that they jumped two feet less than the second competitor's jump, so they jumped \\(23 - 2 = 21\\) feet.",
    "The fourth competitor jumped three feet further than the third competitor, so they jumped \\(21 + 3 = 24\\) feet."
