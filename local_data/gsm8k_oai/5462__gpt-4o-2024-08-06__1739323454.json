  "query": "Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?",
  "steps": [
    "Ann skates at a speed of 6 miles per hour.",
    "She skates for 3 hours.",
    "The distance Ann skates can be calculated by multiplying her speed by the time: 6 miles/hour * 3 hours.",
    "6 * 3 = 18 miles. Ann skates 18 miles.",
    "Glenda skates at a speed of 8 miles per hour.",
    "She also skates for 3 hours.",
    "The distance Glenda skates can be calculated by multiplying her speed by the time: 8 miles/hour * 3 hours.",
    "8 * 3 = 24 miles. Glenda skates 24 miles.",
    "Ann and Glenda skate in opposite directions, so to find out how far apart they are, we add the distances they both traveled.",
    "18 miles (Ann) + 24 miles (Glenda) = 42 miles."

  "solution": "42"
