  "query": "Evelyn\u2019s family watched 10 hours of television last week. The week before, they watched 8 hours of television. If they watch 12 hours of television next week, what is the average number of hours of television that they watch per week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of hours of television watched over the three weeks.",
    "Evelyn's family watched 10 hours last week.",
    "The week before, they watched 8 hours.",
    "Next week, they plan to watch 12 hours.",
    "To calculate the total hours watched over the three weeks, I add 10, 8, and 12 together.",
    "10 + 8 = 18",
    "18 + 12 = 30",
    "The total number of hours watched over the three weeks is 30 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average number of hours per week.",
    "There are three weeks in total.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of hours watched by the number of weeks.",
    "30 hours / 3 weeks = 10 hours per week"
