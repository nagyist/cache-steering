  "query": "Micah has 7 fish in his aquarium. Kenneth has three times as many fish in his aquarium and Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth in his aquarium. How many fish do the boys have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Micah has 7 fish.",
    "Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah.",
    "Three times 7 is 21, so Kenneth has 21 fish.",
    "Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth.",
    "Subtract 15 from 21, which equals 6, so Matthias has 6 fish.",
    "Now, add up all of the fish.",
    "Micah's 7 fish plus Kenneth's 21 fish plus Matthias's 6 fish equals 34 fish."
