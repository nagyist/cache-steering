  "query": "The seats of a bus are arranged in 23 rows of 4 seats. At the start, 16 people climb. At the first stop, 15 people board the bus and 3 get off. At the second stop, 17 people get on the bus and 10 get off. How many empty seats are there after the second stop?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of seats on the bus.",
    "There are 23 rows of 4 seats each.",
    "Multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row: 23 * 4 = 92 seats in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many people were on the bus after each stop.",
    "Initially, there are 16 people on the bus.",
    "At the first stop, 15 more people board, bringing the total to 16 + 15 = 31 people.",
    "At the first stop, also 3 people get off the bus, so the total becomes 31 - 3 = 28 people.",
    "At the second stop, 17 more people board the bus, so the total is now 28 + 17 = 45 people.",
    "At the second stop, 10 people get off the bus, leaving 45 - 10 = 35 people on the bus.",
    "Now I need to find out how many empty seats there are with 35 people on the bus.",
    "There are 92 seats in total and 35 people on the bus.",
    "The number of empty seats is 92 - 35 = 57 empty seats."
