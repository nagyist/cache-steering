  "query": "Niko has bought 9 pairs of socks that cost $2 each and plans to resell them. He wants to gain 25% profit from four of the pairs of socks and $0.2 profit each for the other 5 pairs of socks. How much will his total profit be?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost price of one pair of socks.",
    "The cost price of one pair is $2.",
    "Niko has bought 9 pairs, so I need to find the total cost for 9 pairs.",
    "Total cost = 9 pairs \u00d7 $2 = $18",
    "Now, I need to calculate the profit for the four pairs where he wants a 25% profit.",
    "The cost of four pairs = 4 pairs \u00d7 $2 = $8.",
    "A 25% profit on $8 is calculated as follows: 25% of $8 = 0.25 \u00d7 $8 = $2.",
    "Therefore, the profit from these four pairs is $2.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the profit from the remaining 5 pairs.",
    "He wants a $0.2 profit on each of the 5 pairs.",
    "Total profit from the 5 remaining pairs = 5 pairs \u00d7 $0.2 = $1.",
    "Now, I need to find the total profit by adding the profit from both groups of socks.",
    "Total profit = Profit from four pairs + Profit from five pairs = $2 + $1 = $3."
