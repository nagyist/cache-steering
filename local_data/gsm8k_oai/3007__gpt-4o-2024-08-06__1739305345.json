  "steps": [
    "Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20.",
    "She also bought 2 skirts.",
    "Both skirts cost the same amount of money.",
    "She spent a total of $50.",
    "To find out how much she spent on the skirts, I subtract the cost of the art supplies ($20) from the total amount spent ($50).",
    "$50 - $20 = $30.",
    "So, Emily spent $30 on the 2 skirts.",
    "To find the cost of each skirt, I need to divide the total cost of the skirts ($30) by the number of skirts (2).",
    "$30 \u00f7 2 = $15."
