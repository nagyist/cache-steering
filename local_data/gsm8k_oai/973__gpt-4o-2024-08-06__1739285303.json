  "query": "The buyers who came to Mr. Brandon's shop yesterday bought goods worth $80. If 2/5 of the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday were credit sales, and the rest were cash sales, how much did Mr. Brandon get from cash sales?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the fraction of the total sales that were cash sales.",
    "I know that 2/5 of the total amount of sales were credit sales.",
    "This means that the remaining sales were cash sales.",
    "The fraction of the sales that were cash sales would be 1 - 2/5.",
    "1 - 2/5 = 5/5 - 2/5 = 3/5.",
    "Therefore, 3/5 of the total sales were cash sales.",
    "The total sales amount was $80.",
    "To find out how much Mr. Brandon got from cash sales, I need to calculate 3/5 of $80.",
    "3/5 of $80 can be calculated by multiplying $80 by 3/5.",
    "$80 * 3/5 = $240/5.",
    "$240/5 = $48."
  ],
  "solution": "48"
