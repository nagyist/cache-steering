  "query": "John's weight bench can support 1000 pounds.  He wants to make sure to stay 20% under that weight for safety.  If he weighs 250 pounds how much weight can he put on the bar?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate what weight limit John wants to maintain for safety, which is 20% under 1000 pounds.",
    "20% of 1000 pounds is calculated by multiplying 1000 by 0.20.",
    "1000 * 0.20 = 200 pounds.",
    "Now, to find the safe weight limit, I subtract this amount (200 pounds) from 1000 pounds.",
    "1000 - 200 = 800 pounds.",
    "The maximum safe weight limit for the bench is 800 pounds.",
    "Next, I subtract John's weight from this safe limit to determine how much additional weight he can add to the bar.",
    "800 - 250 = 550 pounds."

  "solution": "550"
