  "query": "Beyonce releases 5 different singles on iTunes. Then she releases 2 albums that each has 15 songs and 1 album that has 20 songs. How many songs has Beyonce released in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of singles Beyonce released. I know she released 5 different singles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of songs on the albums she released. I will start with the two albums that have 15 songs each.",
    "For the two albums, 2 albums multiplied by 15 songs per album equals 30 songs.",
    "Now, I will consider the third album, which has 20 songs.",
    "So the total number of songs on all albums is 30 songs from the first two albums plus 20 songs from the third album.",
    "This gives a total of 30 + 20 = 50 songs from the albums.",
    "Finally, to find the total number of songs released, I need to add the number of singles to the total number of album songs.",
    "The total number of songs is 5 singles + 50 album songs.",
    "Adding these gives 5 + 50 = 55 songs."

  "solution": "55"
