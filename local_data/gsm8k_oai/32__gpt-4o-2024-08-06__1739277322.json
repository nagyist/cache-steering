  "query": "A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the travel distances after each turn around the ring.",
    "The car travels 5 meters after the 1st turn.",
    "The car travels 8 meters after the 2nd turn.",
    "Let \\( x \\) be the distance traveled after the 3rd turn.",
    "The problem states the total distance traveled around the ring is 23 meters.",
    "The distance traveled after the 4th turn is such that the car immediately exits, so it doesn't add to the ring distance.",
    "Set up the equation for the total distance: \\( 5 + 8 + x = 23 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( x \\) by solving the equation: \\( 5 + 8 + x = 23 \\).",
    "Simplify: \\( 13 + x = 23 \\).",
    "Subtract 13 from both sides: \\( x = 23 - 13 \\).",
    "Calculate: \\( x = 10 \\)."
