  "query": "Mary had 6 lambs and 2 of the lambs had 2 babies each.  She traded 3 lambs for one goat.  One morning, she woke up and found an extra 7 lambs in the field.  How many lambs does Mary have?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying how many lambs Mary originally had. She had 6 lambs to begin with.",
    "Next, note that 2 of the lambs had 2 babies each.",
    "2 lambs having 2 babies each means they added 2 x 2 = 4 babies in total.",
    "Add these 4 baby lambs to the original 6 lambs.",
    "Mary now has 6 + 4 = 10 lambs.",
    "Now, consider the trade Mary made. She traded 3 lambs for 1 goat.",
    "Subtract the 3 traded lambs from her current total.",
    "Mary now has 10 - 3 = 7 lambs after the trade.",
    "One morning, Mary found an additional 7 lambs in the field.",
    "Add these 7 new lambs to the 7 she had after the trade.",
    "Mary now has 7 + 7 = 14 lambs."
