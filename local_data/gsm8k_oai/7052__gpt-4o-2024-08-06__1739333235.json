  "query": "The average speed for an hour drive is 66 miles per hour. If Felix wanted to drive twice as fast for 4 hours, how many miles will he cover?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify Felix's current average speed, which is 66 miles per hour.",
    "Felix wants to drive twice as fast. Double the current speed: 66 miles per hour * 2 = 132 miles per hour.",
    "Determine how many hours Felix wants to drive at this new speed: 4 hours.",
    "Calculate the total distance Felix will cover by multiplying the speed by the time: 132 miles per hour * 4 hours.",
    "132 miles per hour * 4 hours equals 528 miles."
