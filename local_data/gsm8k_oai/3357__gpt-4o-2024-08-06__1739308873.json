  "query": "James buys 100 tennis balls and gives half of them away.  The other half he puts into 5 large containers.  How many tennis balls go in each container?",
  "steps": [
    "James buys 100 tennis balls initially.",
    "He gives half of them away.",
    "Half of 100 is 50, so he gives away 50 tennis balls.",
    "This means he has 50 tennis balls left.",
    "James puts these 50 tennis balls into 5 large containers.",
    "To find out how many tennis balls go in each container, I need to divide the number of tennis balls he has by the number of containers.",
    "The calculation is 50 divided by 5.",
    "50 divided by 5 equals 10.",
    "Therefore, 10 tennis balls go in each container."
