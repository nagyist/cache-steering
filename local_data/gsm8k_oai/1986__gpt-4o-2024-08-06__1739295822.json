  "query": "$240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel. Samuel received 3/4 of the money. From his share, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks. How much does Samuel have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Samuel received from the original $240.",
    "Samuel received 3/4 of the $240.",
    "To calculate his share, I multiply 240 by 3/4.",
    "\\( 240 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 180 \\).",
    "So, Samuel received $180.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Samuel spent on drinks.",
    "He spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks.",
    "To calculate this amount, I multiply 240 by 1/5.",
    "\\( 240 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 48 \\).",
    "Samuel spent $48 on drinks.",
    "Now, I subtract the amount Samuel spent on drinks from what he initially received.",
    "\\( 180 - 48 = 132 \\).",
    "Samuel has $132 left after spending on drinks."

  "solution": "132"
