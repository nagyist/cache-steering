  "query": "Erica is getting dessert at a pie buffet where all the pies are the same size. She takes 1/5 of an apple pie and 3/4 of a cherry pie. What fraction of a whole pie did Erica take, expressed as a percentage?",
  "steps": [
    "Erica takes 1/5 of an apple pie.",
    "Erica also takes 3/4 of a cherry pie.",
    "To find the total amount of pie Erica took, I need to add the fractions 1/5 and 3/4.",
    "First, I need a common denominator to add the fractions. The denominators 5 and 4 have a least common multiple of 20.",
    "Convert 1/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 20. Multiply the numerator and denominator by 4, resulting in 4/20.",
    "Convert 3/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 20. Multiply the numerator and denominator by 5, resulting in 15/20.",
    "Now add the fractions: 4/20 + 15/20 = 19/20.",
    "Erica took 19/20 of a whole pie.",
    "To express 19/20 as a percentage, I need to multiply by 100.",
    "\\( \\frac{19}{20} \\times 100 = 95\\).",
    "Erica took 95% of a whole pie."
  ],
  "solution": "95"
