  "query": "A 40 meters rope was cut into 2 parts in the ratio of 2:3. How long is the shorter part?",
  "steps": [
    "The total length of the rope is 40 meters.",
    "The rope is cut into two parts in the ratio of 2:3.",
    "To find the lengths of the parts, I need to divide 40 meters into two parts such that their lengths are in the ratio 2:3.",
    "First, I will add the numbers in the ratio: 2 + 3 = 5.",
    "The sum of the parts of the ratio is 5, which indicates that the rope is divided into 5 equal segments.",
    "Next, I will determine the length of each segment by dividing the total length of the rope by the sum of the parts of the ratio: 40 meters / 5 = 8 meters per segment.",
    "The length of the shorter part is 2 segments, according to the ratio.",
    "To find the length of the shorter part, I multiply the number of segments for the shorter part by the length of each segment: 2 * 8 meters = 16 meters."
