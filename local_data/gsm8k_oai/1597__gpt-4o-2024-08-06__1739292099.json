  "query": "Jaynie wants to make leis for the graduation party.  It will take 2 and half dozen plumeria flowers to make 1 lei.  If she wants to make 4 leis, how many plumeria flowers must she pick from the trees in her yard?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of plumeria flowers required to make one lei.",
    "Jaynie needs 2 and a half dozen plumeria flowers for one lei.",
    "A dozen is equal to 12 flowers.",
    "2 dozen flowers would be 2 x 12 = 24 flowers.",
    "Half a dozen would be 0.5 x 12 = 6 flowers.",
    "Adding both values: 24 + 6 = 30 flowers are needed for one lei.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many plumeria flowers are required for 4 leis.",
    "Each lei requires 30 flowers.",
    "Therefore, for 4 leis, the number of flowers needed is 4 x 30 = 120 flowers."
