  "query": "Jeannie hikes the 12 miles to Mount Overlook at a pace of 4 miles per hour, and then returns at a pace of 6 miles per hour. How long did her hike take, in hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how long it took Jeannie to hike to Mount Overlook.",
    "The distance to Mount Overlook is 12 miles.",
    "She hikes at a pace of 4 miles per hour on the way to Mount Overlook.",
    "To find the time taken for the first part of the hike, I divide the distance by the speed: 12 miles \u00f7 4 miles per hour.",
    "12 \u00f7 4 equals 3. So, it took Jeannie 3 hours to hike to Mount Overlook.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it took her to return.",
    "The return distance is also 12 miles.",
    "She returns at a pace of 6 miles per hour.",
    "To find the time taken for the return hike, I divide the return distance by her return speed: 12 miles \u00f7 6 miles per hour.",
    "12 \u00f7 6 equals 2. So, it took Jeannie 2 hours to return from Mount Overlook.",
    "Now, I add the time taken to hike to Mount Overlook and the time taken to return.",
    "3 hours (to Mount Overlook) + 2 hours (return) = 5 hours."

  "solution": "5"
