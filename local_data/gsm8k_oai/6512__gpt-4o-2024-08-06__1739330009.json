  "query": "Clara is selling boxes of cookies to raise money for a school trip. There are 3 different types for sale. The first type has 12 cookies per box. The second type has 20 cookies per box, and the third type has 16 cookies per box. If Clara sells 50 boxes of the first type, 80 boxes of the second type, and 70 boxes of the third type, how many cookies does she sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cookies are in the boxes of the first type.",
    "Each box of the first type has 12 cookies.",
    "Clara sells 50 boxes of the first type.",
    "To find the total number of cookies from the first type, I multiply 12 cookies per box by 50 boxes.",
    "12 cookies/box * 50 boxes = 600 cookies from the first type.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many cookies come from the second type of box.",
    "Each box of the second type has 20 cookies.",
    "Clara sells 80 boxes of the second type.",
    "To find the total number of cookies from the second type, I multiply 20 cookies per box by 80 boxes.",
    "20 cookies/box * 80 boxes = 1600 cookies from the second type.",
    "Now, I will calculate the number of cookies from the third type of box.",
    "Each box of the third type has 16 cookies.",
    "Clara sells 70 boxes of the third type.",
    "To find the total number of cookies from the third type, I multiply 16 cookies per box by 70 boxes.",
    "16 cookies/box * 70 boxes = 1120 cookies from the third type.",
    "To find the total number of cookies Clara sells, I need to sum the cookies from all three types.",
    "Total cookies = 600 (from the first type) + 1600 (from the second type) + 1120 (from the third type).",
    "Total cookies = 600 + 1600 + 1120 = 3320 cookies."

  "solution": "3320"
