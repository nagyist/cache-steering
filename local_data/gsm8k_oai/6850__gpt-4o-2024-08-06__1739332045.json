  "query": "Dave breaks 2 guitar strings per night when playing live.  If he performs 6 shows a week for 12 weeks, how many guitar strings will he need to replace?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of guitar strings Dave breaks per show. We know he breaks 2 guitar strings per show.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of shows Dave performs per week. He performs 6 shows each week.",
    "Now, I'll determine the total number of shows he performs over the course of 12 weeks. This is 6 shows per week times 12 weeks.",
    "6 shows/week * 12 weeks = 72 shows.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many guitar strings he breaks in total. Since he breaks 2 strings per show, I multiply the total number of shows (72) by the number of strings broken per show (2).",
    "72 shows * 2 strings/show = 144 strings."
  ],
  "solution": "144"
