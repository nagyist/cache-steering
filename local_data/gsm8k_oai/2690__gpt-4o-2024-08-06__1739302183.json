  "query": "Bonnie and Samuel went to the market together. Bonnie bought 8 apples. Samuel bought 20 more apples than Bonnie. Samuel then ate half of them and used 1/7 of them to make apple pie. How many apples does Samuel have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Bonnie bought 8 apples.",
    "Samuel bought 20 more apples than Bonnie.",
    "This means Samuel bought 8 + 20 apples.",
    "8 + 20 is 28. Samuel bought 28 apples in total.",
    "Samuel ate half of his apples.",
    "Half of 28 apples is 28 / 2.",
    "28 divided by 2 equals 14. Samuel ate 14 apples.",
    "Therefore, Samuel has 28 - 14 apples left after eating half of them.",
    "28 - 14 is 14. Samuel has 14 apples left after eating.",
    "Next, Samuel used 1/7 of his total apples to make apple pie.",
    "1/7 of 28 is calculated as 28 / 7.",
    "28 divided by 7 equals 4. Samuel used 4 apples to make apple pie.",
    "After using apples for an apple pie, Samuel has 14 - 4 apples left.",
    "14 - 4 equals 10. Samuel has 10 apples left."
