  "query": "At Kaleb's Restaurant, a group with six adults and two children came in to eat. If each adult meal cost six dollars and each children's meal was $4, and every person ordered a soda for $2  how much was the bill?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the adult meals.",
    "There are six adults, and each adult meal costs $6.",
    "So, the total cost for the adult meals is 6 adults * $6/adult = $36.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the children's meals.",
    "There are two children, and each children's meal costs $4.",
    "So, the total cost for the children's meals is 2 children * $4/child = $8.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for all the sodas.",
    "There are six adults and two children, so the total number of sodas is 8.",
    "Each soda costs $2.",
    "So, the total cost for the sodas is 8 sodas * $2/soda = $16.",
    "Finally, I need to add up all these costs to find the total bill.",
    "The total bill is $36 (adult meals) + $8 (children's meals) + $16 (sodas) = $60."

  "solution": "60"
