  "query": "Rory collects rainwater. He has 100 L of rainwater in his tank. During a heavy rainstorm, water flows into the tank at a rate of 2 L/min for 90 minutes. How much water is in the tank at the end of the heavy rain?",
  "steps": [
    "Rory starts with 100 L of water in the tank.",
    "Water flows into the tank at a rate of 2 L/min.",
    "The storm lasts for 90 minutes.",
    "To find out how much water flows into the tank during the storm, I need to multiply the flow rate by the duration of the storm.",
    "2 L/min * 90 min = 180 L",
    "So, 180 L of water is added to the tank during the storm.",
    "To find the total amount of water in the tank at the end, I will add the initial amount of water in the tank to the amount of water added during the storm.",
    "100 L + 180 L = 280 L",
    "Therefore, at the end of the heavy rain, there are 280 L of water in Rory's tank."

  "solution": "280"
