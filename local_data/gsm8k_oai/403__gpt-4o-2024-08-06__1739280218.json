  "query": "Omi is twice as old as Kimiko. Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko. If Kimiko is 28 years old, calculate the average age of the three?",
  "steps": [
    "Start with Kimiko's age, which is given as 28 years.",
    "Calculate Omi's age. Omi is twice as old as Kimiko, so I multiply Kimiko's age by 2.",
    "28 * 2 = 56. So, Omi is 56 years old.",
    "Next, calculate Arlette's age. Arlette is 3/4 times as old as Kimiko.",
    "I multiply Kimiko's age by 3/4.",
    "28 * 3/4 = 21. So, Arlette is 21 years old.",
    "Now, find the total age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette together. Add their ages together.",
    "56 (Omi's age) + 28 (Kimiko's age) + 21 (Arlette's age) = 105.",
    "To find the average age, divide the total age by the number of people, which is 3.",
    "105 divided by 3 equals 35."

  "solution": "35"
