  "query": "Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for one week. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days. How many hours did Natasha and Esteban exercise in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate the total minutes Natasha exercised in one week.",
    "Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for 7 days.",
    "To find the total minutes Natasha exercised, multiply 30 minutes by 7 days.",
    "30 minutes/day * 7 days = 210 minutes",
    "Next, calculate the total minutes Esteban exercised over the 9 days.",
    "Esteban exercised for 10 minutes each day for 9 days.",
    "To find the total minutes Esteban exercised, multiply 10 minutes by 9 days.",
    "10 minutes/day * 9 days = 90 minutes",
    "Now, find the total minutes both Natasha and Esteban exercised together.",
    "Add Natasha's total minutes (210) to Esteban's total minutes (90).",
    "210 minutes + 90 minutes = 300 minutes",
    "Convert the total minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.",
    "Divide the total minutes by 60 to convert to hours.",
    "300 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours"

  "solution": "5"
