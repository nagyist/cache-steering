  "query": "James joins a football team and becomes the star.  He scores 4 touchdowns per game and each touchdown is worth 6 points.  There are 15 games in the season.  He also manages to score 2 point conversions 6 times during the season.  The old record was 300 points during the season.  How many points did James beat the old record by?",
  "steps": [
    "James scores 4 touchdowns per game.",
    "Each touchdown is worth 6 points.",
    "To find the number of points James scores per game from touchdowns, multiply 4 touchdowns by 6 points per touchdown.",
    "4 touchdowns/game * 6 points/touchdown = 24 points/game",
    "There are 15 games in the season.",
    "To find the total points from touchdowns for the season, multiply the points per game by the number of games.",
    "24 points/game * 15 games = 360 points from touchdowns",
    "James also scores 2 point conversions 6 times during the season.",
    "Each 2 point conversion is worth 2 points.",
    "To find the total points from 2 point conversions, multiply the number of conversions by the points per conversion.",
    "6 conversions * 2 points/conversion = 12 points from conversions",
    "Add the points from touchdowns and the points from conversions to get the total points for the season.",
    "360 points from touchdowns + 12 points from conversions = 372 total points",
    "The old record was 300 points during the season.",
    "To find how many points James beat the old record by, subtract the old record from James's total points.",
    "372 total points - 300 old record points = 72 points"
