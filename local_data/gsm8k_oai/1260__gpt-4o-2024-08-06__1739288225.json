  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the individual costs involved.",
    "The cost of the computer game is $66.",
    "He also buys three movie tickets, each costing $12.",
    "To find the total cost of the movie tickets, I need to multiply the cost of one ticket by the number of tickets.",
    "The total cost for the three movie tickets is $12 \u00d7 3.",
    "Calculating that, $12 \u00d7 3 equals $36.",
    "Now, I need to add the cost of the computer game to the total cost of the movie tickets to find the total amount Jackson spent.",
    "I add $66 (computer game) and $36 (movie tickets) together.",
    "$66 + $36 equals $102."
