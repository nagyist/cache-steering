  "query": "A single train car can carry 60 passengers. A 747 airplane can carry 366 passengers. How many more passengers can a train with 16 cars carry than 2 airplanes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many passengers a train with 16 cars can carry.",
    "A single train car can carry 60 passengers.",
    "Therefore, a train with 16 cars can carry 16 * 60 passengers.",
    "16 * 60 = 960",
    "So, a train with 16 cars can carry 960 passengers.",
    "Next, I calculate how many passengers 2 airplanes can carry.",
    "A single 747 airplane can carry 366 passengers.",
    "Therefore, 2 airplanes can carry 2 * 366 passengers.",
    "2 * 366 = 732",
    "So, 2 airplanes can carry 732 passengers.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in passenger capacity between the train with 16 cars and the 2 airplanes.",
    "I subtract the number of passengers the 2 airplanes can carry from the number of passengers the train can carry: 960 - 732.",
    "960 - 732 = 228"
  ],
  "solution": "228"
