  "query": "Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles. He has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. How many red marbles does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of red marbles Brett has as \\( r \\).",
    "According to the problem, the number of blue marbles is 24 more than the number of red marbles.",
    "Expressing this in an equation form gives: number of blue marbles = \\( r + 24 \\).",
    "The problem also states that Brett has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles.",
    "This can be written as: number of blue marbles = \\( 5 \\times r \\).",
    "Now I have two expressions for the number of blue marbles: \\( r + 24 \\) and \\( 5r \\).",
    "To find the value of \\( r \\), I set these two expressions equal to each other: \\( r + 24 = 5r \\).",
    "Subtract \\( r \\) from both sides to solve for \\( r \\): \\( 24 = 4r \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 4 to find \\( r \\): \\( r = 6 \\).",
    "Brett has 6 red marbles, and my solution seems consistent with the problem statement."
