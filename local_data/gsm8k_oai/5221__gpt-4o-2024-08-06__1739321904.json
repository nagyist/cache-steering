    "The chef starts with 60 eggs.",
    "He puts 10 eggs in the fridge.",
    "To find out how many eggs he uses for cakes, I subtract the eggs put in the fridge from the total eggs: 60 - 10 = 50 eggs.",
    "Each cake requires 5 eggs.",
    "I need to determine how many cakes can be made with 50 eggs by dividing the number of eggs by the number needed for each cake: 50 \u00f7 5.",
    "50 divided by 5 equals 10."
