  "query": "Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Cheryl walked away from home at a speed of 2 miles per hour.",
    "She continued walking at this speed for a total of 3 hours.",
    "The distance she walked while going away from home is calculated by multiplying her speed by the time walked. So, 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.",
    "After walking away from home for 6 miles, Cheryl decided to return.",
    "She walked the same distance back home, which is also 6 miles.",
    "To find the total distance walked, I need to add the distance away from home and back home.",
    "The total distance is 6 miles (away) + 6 miles (back) = 12 miles."

  "solution": "12"
