  "query": "Julia is performing in her high school musical this weekend and her family wants to come to the show. Tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for children. If her mom, dad, grandma, and three little sisters come to the show, how much will the total be for their tickets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify who in Julia's family will be attending the show. They are: her mom, dad, grandma, and three little sisters.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of adults and the number of children. Her mom, dad, and grandma are adults, so there are 3 adults in total.",
    "Her three little sisters are children, so there are 3 children in total.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost for the adult tickets. Each adult ticket costs $12.",
    "The total cost for adult tickets is 3 adults times $12 per ticket.",
    "3 times 12 is 36, so the total cost for the adult tickets is $36.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost for the children's tickets. Each child ticket costs $10.",
    "The total cost for the children's tickets is 3 children times $10 per ticket.",
    "3 times 10 is 30, so the total cost for the children's tickets is $30.",
    "Now I need to find the total cost for all the tickets by adding the cost of the adult tickets and the children's tickets.",
    "The total cost is $36 for the adults plus $30 for the children.",
    "36 plus 30 is 66, so the total cost for all the tickets is $66."

  "solution": "66"
