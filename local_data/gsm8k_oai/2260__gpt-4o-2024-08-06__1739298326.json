  "query": "A special school has a deaf-student population 3 times its blind-student population. If there are 180 students in total, how many blind students are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's designate the number of blind students as \\( x \\).",
    "The number of deaf students is 3 times the number of blind students, so it will be \\( 3x \\).",
    "The total number of students is the sum of deaf and blind students.",
    "We can set up the equation for the total as \\( x + 3x = 180 \\).",
    "Combine like terms to simplify: \\( 4x = 180 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 4: \\( x = \\frac{180}{4} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{180}{4} \\), which equals 45.",
    "There are 45 blind students in the school."
