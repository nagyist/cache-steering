  "query": "On the island of Castor, there are 40 chess players. A quarter of the island's chess players have never lost to an AI. How many people on the island have lost to a computer, at least once?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many chess players on the island have never lost to an AI.",
    "There are 40 chess players in total on the island.",
    "A quarter of these players have never lost to an AI.",
    "Since a quarter is 1/4, I need to calculate 1/4 of 40.",
    "Calculating 1/4 of 40: \\(40 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 10\\).",
    "So, 10 chess players have never lost to an AI.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many chess players have lost to an AI at least once.",
    "If 10 players have never lost to an AI, the rest must have lost at least once.",
    "Subtracting the players who have never lost from the total: \\(40 - 10 = 30\\).",
    "Therefore, 30 players have lost to a computer at least once."

  "solution": "30"
