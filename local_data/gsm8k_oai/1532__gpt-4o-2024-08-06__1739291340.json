  "query": "A fixer uses 30% of the nails in a container to repair the kitchen. He also used 70% of the remaining nails in the container to repair the fence. If there were 400 nails in the container, how many nails are remaining?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many nails were initially in the container.",
    "The problem states that there are 400 nails initially in the container.",
    "Calculate the number of nails used to repair the kitchen, which is 30% of the total initial nails.",
    "30% of 400 nails is 0.30 * 400 = 120.",
    "Subtract the number of nails used for the kitchen from the initial total to find the number of nails remaining after the kitchen repair.",
    "400 - 120 = 280 nails remaining after the kitchen repair.",
    "Next, calculate the number of nails used to repair the fence, which is 70% of the remaining nails.",
    "70% of 280 nails is 0.70 * 280 = 196.",
    "Subtract the number of nails used for the fence from the nails remaining after the kitchen repair to find the final number of nails left.",
    "280 - 196 = 84 nails remaining in the container after both repairs."

  "solution": "84"
