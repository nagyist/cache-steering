  "query": "Jay & Gloria were hosting a 4th of July party at their house.  Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36.  They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone.  The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00.  If they wanted all of their guests to have a flag and they also wanted 1 flag each, how much would they spend at the craft store?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate the total number of guests invited by both Jay and Gloria. Jay invited 22 people.",
    "Gloria invited 36 people.",
    "The total number of guests is 22 (Jay's guests) + 36 (Gloria's guests) = 58 guests.",
    "Now, I need to include Jay and Gloria to this count, each wanting a flag as well.",
    "Including themselves, that's 58 guests + 2 = 60 people total who need flags.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many sets of 5 flags are needed for 60 flags, since the store sells 5 flags for $1.00.",
    "To find out how many sets of 5 flags are needed, I divide 60 flags by 5 flags per set.",
    "60 divided by 5 is 12.",
    "This means they will need 12 sets of 5 flags to have enough flags for everyone.",
    "Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, the total cost will be 12 sets * $1.00 per set.",
    "The total amount they would spend is $12.00."
  ],
  "solution": "12"
