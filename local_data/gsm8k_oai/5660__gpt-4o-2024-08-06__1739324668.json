  "query": "Mr. Willson worked on making his furniture for 3/4 an hour on Monday. On Tuesday, he worked for half an hour. Then he worked for 2/3 an hour on Wednesday and 5/6 of an hour on Thursday. If he worked for 75 minutes on Friday, how many hours in all did he work from Monday to Friday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert all times worked into the same unit. Since most times are in hours, I'll convert the 75 minutes on Friday into hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 75 minutes is 75/60 hours.",
    "Simplify 75/60. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 15.",
    "75 divided by 15 is 5, and 60 divided by 15 is 4, so 75 minutes is 5/4 hours.",
    "Now I'll add up all the times worked in hours.",
    "He worked 3/4 hours on Monday, so that's 3/4.",
    "He worked 1/2 hour on Tuesday, which is equivalent to 2/4 when expressed with a common denominator.",
    "On Wednesday, he worked 2/3 hours. Using a common denominator of 12, this is equivalent to 8/12.",
    "On Thursday, he worked 5/6 hours. Converting to twelfths, this is 10/12.",
    "On Friday, as calculated, he worked 5/4 hours, which is equivalent to 15/12.",
    "Now, I need to add up the fractions: 3/4 + 1/2 + 2/3 + 5/6 + 5/4.",
    "First, convert all fractions to twelfths: 3/4 is 9/12, 1/2 is 6/12.",
    "We already have 8/12 and 10/12 for Wednesday and Thursday.",
    "Finally, we have 15/12 for Friday.",
    "Now add up all the fractional hours: 9/12 + 6/12 + 8/12 + 10/12 + 15/12.",
    "Adding these gives: (9 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 15) / 12 = 48/12.",
    "Simplify 48/12 to find the total in hours.",
    "48 divided by 12 is 4."
