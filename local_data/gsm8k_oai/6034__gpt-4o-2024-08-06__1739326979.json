  "query": "Brendan went fishing with his dad. Brenden caught 8 fish in the morning. He threw 3 back that were too small. He caught 5 more in the afternoon. Brendan\u2019s dad caught 13 fish. How many fish did they catch in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of fish Brendan caught.",
    "Brendan caught 8 fish in the morning.",
    "Out of those 8, he threw back 3 fish.",
    "So, the number of fish Brendan kept after the morning is 8 - 3 = 5 fish.",
    "In the afternoon, Brendan caught 5 more fish.",
    "Thus, the total number of fish Brendan kept is 5 (from morning) + 5 (from afternoon) = 10 fish.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of fish Brendan caught to the number Brendan's dad caught.",
    "Brendan\u2019s dad caught 13 fish.",
    "Adding the total number of fish Brendan caught (10) to the number Brendan's dad caught (13).",
    "10 fish (Brendan) + 13 fish (Dad) = 23 fish."

  "solution": "23"
