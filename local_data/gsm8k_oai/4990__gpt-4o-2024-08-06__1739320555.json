  "query": "On Tuesday last week, Leo dropped off 10 pairs of trousers and some shirts at Sudsy Laundry. He was given a bill of $140, charged at $5 per shirt and $9 for each pair of trousers. When he went to pick up his clothes yesterday, the attendant insisted that he had only dropped off 2 shirts. Leo reported the matter to the manager, who ordered the attendant to search for the rest of Leo\u2019s shirts. How many shirts were missing?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost for the 10 pairs of trousers.",
    "Each pair of trousers costs $9, so for 10 pairs, the cost is 10 * $9.",
    "10 * $9 is $90.",
    "This means the trousers cost $90 in total.",
    "Leo's total bill was $140.",
    "The cost for the shirts would then be the remainder of his total bill after accounting for the trousers.",
    "Total cost for the shirts is $140 - $90.",
    "$140 - $90 is $50.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many shirts can be washed for $50.",
    "Each shirt costs $5 to wash.",
    "To determine the number of shirts, divide the total cost for shirts by the cost per shirt: $50 \u00f7 $5.",
    "$50 \u00f7 $5 is 10.",
    "So, Leo initially dropped off 10 shirts.",
    "The attendant insisted that only 2 shirts were dropped off.",
    "To find out how many shirts are missing, subtract the number of shirts the attendant says they have (2) from the number Leo initially dropped off (10).",
    "10 - 2 is 8."
