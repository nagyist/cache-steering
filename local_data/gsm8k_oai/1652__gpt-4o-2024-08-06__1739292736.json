  "query": "Tommy has 10 more sheets than Jimmy does. If Jimmy has 32 sheets, how many more sheets will Jimmy have than Tommy if his friend Ashton gives him 40 sheets.",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many sheets Tommy currently has.",
    "The problem states that Tommy has 10 more sheets than Jimmy.",
    "Jimmy currently has 32 sheets.",
    "If Tommy has 10 more sheets than Jimmy, I must add 10 sheets to Jimmy's 32 sheets.",
    "32 sheets + 10 sheets = 42 sheets, so Tommy has 42 sheets.",
    "Next, I need to account for Ashton giving sheets to Jimmy.",
    "Ashton gives Jimmy 40 additional sheets.",
    "Jimmy's new total sheet count is 32 sheets + 40 sheets = 72 sheets.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more sheets Jimmy has than Tommy after receiving the sheets from Ashton.",
    "Jimmy now has 72 sheets, while Tommy still has 42 sheets.",
    "To find out how many more sheets Jimmy has, subtract Tommy's sheet count from Jimmy's new sheet count.",
    "72 sheets - 42 sheets = 30 sheets."
