  "query": "Nicky went to the DMV. He spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number, and quadruple that amount of time plus 14 minutes waiting for his number to be called. How long did he wait total?",
  "steps": [
    "Nicky spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number.",
    "He then waited quadruple the time he spent taking a number to have his number called.",
    "Quadruple of 20 minutes is 20 * 4 = 80 minutes.",
    "He also spent an additional 14 minutes waiting.",
    "The time spent waiting for his number to be called is 80 minutes + 14 minutes = 94 minutes.",
    "Now, to find the total waiting time, we add the time spent taking a number and the time spent waiting for his number to be called.",
    "The total waiting time is 20 minutes + 94 minutes = 114 minutes."

  "solution": "114"
