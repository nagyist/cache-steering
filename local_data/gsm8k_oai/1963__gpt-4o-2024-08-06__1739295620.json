  "query": "Christine makes money by commission rate. She gets a 12% commission on all items she sells. This month, she sold $24000 worth of items. Sixty percent of all her earning will be allocated to her personal needs and the rest will be saved.  How much did she save this month?",
  "steps": [
    "Christine earns a commission of 12% on her sales.",
    "This month, she sold $24000 worth of items.",
    "To find out her total earnings from commission, I need to calculate 12% of $24000.",
    "12% is equal to 0.12 as a decimal.",
    "The commission earnings can be calculated as $24000 * 0.12.",
    "Performing the multiplication, $24000 * 0.12 = $2880.",
    "Christine's earnings from commission this month are $2880.",
    "Sixty percent of her earnings are allocated to personal needs.",
    "60% is equal to 0.60 as a decimal.",
    "The amount allocated to personal needs is $2880 * 0.60.",
    "Performing the multiplication, $2880 * 0.60 = $1728.",
    "So, Christine will allocate $1728 to her personal needs.",
    "The rest of her earnings will be saved.",
    "To find out how much she saves, I will subtract the personal needs allocation from the total earnings.",
    "The savings amount is $2880 - $1728.",
    "Performing the subtraction, $2880 - $1728 = $1152."
