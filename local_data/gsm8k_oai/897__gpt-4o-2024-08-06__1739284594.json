  "query": "The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that the square-shaped piece of paper has a side length of 20 cm.",
    "To find the perimeter of the square, I will multiply the side length by 4, as a square has four equal sides.",
    "So, the perimeter of the square is 20 cm \u00d7 4 = 80 cm.",
    "The problem states that this perimeter is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen.",
    "If the height of the screen minus 20 cm equals the perimeter of the square, I can set up the equation: height - 20 cm = 80 cm.",
    "To find the height of the screen, I will add 20 cm to the perimeter of 80 cm.",
    "Therefore, the height of the screen is 80 cm + 20 cm.",
    "This calculation gives me a height of 100 cm."

  "solution": "100"
