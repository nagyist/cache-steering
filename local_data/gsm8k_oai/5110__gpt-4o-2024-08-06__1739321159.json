    "Mark has a total of 12 candy bars.",
    "He has 3 Snickers.",
    "He has 2 Mars bars.",
    "To find out how many Butterfingers he has, I need to first add the number of Snickers and Mars bars.",
    "3 Snickers + 2 Mars bars = 5 candy bars.",
    "Now, I subtract the total number of Snickers and Mars bars from the total number of candy bars to find the number of Butterfingers.",
    "12 total candy bars - 5 candy bars (Snickers and Mars bars) = 7 Butterfingers."
