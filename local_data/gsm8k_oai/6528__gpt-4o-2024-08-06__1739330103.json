  "query": "At the Bertolli Farm, they grow 2073 tomatoes, 4112 cobs of corn, and 985 onions. How many fewer onions are grown than tomatoes and corn together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of tomatoes and corn together.",
    "The number of tomatoes is 2073 and the number of cobs of corn is 4112.",
    "To find the total, I will add the tomatoes and corn: 2073 + 4112.",
    "Calculating the sum: 2073 + 4112 = 6185.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many fewer onions are grown compared to the total number of tomatoes and corn.",
    "The number of onions grown is 985.",
    "To find out how many fewer onions there are, I will subtract the number of onions from the total number of tomatoes and corn: 6185 - 985.",
    "Calculating the difference: 6185 - 985 = 5200."

  "solution": "5200"
