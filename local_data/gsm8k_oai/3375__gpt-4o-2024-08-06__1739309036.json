  "query": "Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students are girls.",
    "60% of the 150 students are girls.",
    "Calculate 60% of 150: \\(0.60 \\times 150 = 90\\).",
    "There are 90 girls.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students are boys.",
    "Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: \\(150 - 90 = 60\\).",
    "There are 60 boys.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many of the boys joined varsity clubs.",
    "Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs.",
    "Calculate 1/3 of 60: \\(60 \\div 3 = 20\\).",
    "20 boys joined varsity clubs.",
    "Subtract the number of boys who joined varsity clubs from the total number of boys to find how many did not join.",
    "Calculate: \\(60 - 20 = 40\\).",
    "There are 40 boys who did not join varsity clubs."
