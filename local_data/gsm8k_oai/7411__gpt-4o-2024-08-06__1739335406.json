  "query": "Kevin has a tree growing in his garden that is currently 180 inches tall. That is 50% taller than it was when he planted it there. How tall was the tree, in feet, then?",
  "steps": [
    "The current height of the tree is 180 inches.",
    "The tree is 50% taller now than it was when Kevin planted it.",
    "This means the current height is 150% of its original height, where 100% represents the original height and the additional 50% represents the growth.",
    "Let the original height be x inches.",
    "The equation representing this is 1.5x = 180 inches.",
    "To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.5.",
    "180 \u00f7 1.5 = 120.",
    "This means the original height of the tree was 120 inches.",
    "To convert the original height to feet, I need to divide by 12, because there are 12 inches in a foot.",
    "120 \u00f7 12 = 10."
  ],
  "solution": "10"
