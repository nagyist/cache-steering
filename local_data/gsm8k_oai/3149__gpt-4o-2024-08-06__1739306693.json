  "query": "Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?",
  "steps": [
    "Isaac has a 30 meters ribbon initially.",
    "He cuts the ribbon into 6 equal parts.",
    "To find the length of one part, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts: 30 meters \u00f7 6 parts.",
    "30 meters \u00f7 6 parts = 5 meters per part.",
    "Isaac uses 4 parts of the ribbon.",
    "To find the total length of the ribbon used, multiply the number of parts used by the length of each part: 4 parts \u00d7 5 meters per part.",
    "4 parts \u00d7 5 meters per part = 20 meters used.",
    "To find the ribbon that is not used, subtract the length of the used ribbon from the total ribbon: 30 meters - 20 meters.",
    "30 meters - 20 meters = 10 meters not used."
