  "query": "Toby is making toast and adding peanut butter to it. He wants to make sure he has 500 calories for breakfast. A piece of bread has 100 calories. A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories. If he has one piece of bread, how many servings of peanut butter should he add?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many calories Toby gets from the piece of bread.",
    "One piece of bread has 100 calories.",
    "Toby's goal for breakfast is to have 500 calories.",
    "I need to find out how many more calories are needed after including the bread.",
    "500 calories (goal) - 100 calories (bread) = 400 calories needed from peanut butter.",
    "Each serving of peanut butter has 200 calories.",
    "I need to calculate how many servings of peanut butter are needed to reach 400 calories.",
    "400 calories needed / 200 calories per serving = 2 servings."
