  "query": "The PTA had saved $400 set aside after a fundraising event. They spent a fourth of the money on school supplies. Then they spent half of what was left on food for the faculty. How much money did they have left?",
  "steps": [
    "The PTA initially had $400.",
    "They spent a fourth of the money on school supplies.",
    "A fourth of $400 is calculated as $400 / 4.",
    "$400 / 4 equals $100.",
    "So, they spent $100 on school supplies.",
    "To find out how much money was left after buying school supplies, subtract $100 from $400.",
    "$400 - $100 equals $300.",
    "Now, they have $300 left.",
    "They spent half of the remaining money on food for the faculty.",
    "Half of $300 is calculated as $300 / 2.",
    "$300 / 2 equals $150.",
    "So, they spent $150 on food for the faculty.",
    "To find out how much money was left after buying food, subtract $150 from $300.",
    "$300 - $150 equals $150.",
    "Thus, the PTA has $150 left."
