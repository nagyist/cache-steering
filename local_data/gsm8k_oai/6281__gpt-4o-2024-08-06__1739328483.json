  "query": "Jenna catches an eel that's 1/3 as long as Bill's. If the combined length of their eels is 64 inches, how long is Jenna's eel?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the length of Bill's eel as B inches.",
    "Since Jenna's eel is 1/3 as long as Bill's, the length of Jenna's eel is (1/3)B inches.",
    "The combined length of Jenna's and Bill's eels is 64 inches. Therefore, we can write the equation: B + (1/3)B = 64.",
    "Combine the terms on the left side of the equation: (1 + 1/3)B = 64.",
    "Convert 1 into a fraction with a denominator of 3: (3/3) + (1/3) = 4/3. So, (4/3)B = 64.",
    "To isolate B, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 4/3, which is 3/4: B = 64 * (3/4).",
    "Calculate 64 * (3/4) = 48. So, B = 48 inches. Bill's eel is 48 inches long.",
    "Since Jenna's eel is 1/3 as long as Bill's, calculate (1/3) * 48 inches.",
    "(1/3) * 48 = 16 inches. Jenna's eel is 16 inches long."
