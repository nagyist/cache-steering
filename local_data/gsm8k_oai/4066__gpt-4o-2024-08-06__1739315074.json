  "query": "Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what happened to the marbles each day.",
    "On Monday, Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 marbles in the jar.",
    "On Tuesday, they took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar and divided them equally.",
    "To find 3/5 of the marbles, I need to calculate 3/5 of 30.",
    "3/5 of 30 is (3/5) * 30 = 18.",
    "They took out 18 marbles on Tuesday to divide equally between them.",
    "Since the marbles were divided equally, both Cleo and Ignacio took 18 / 2 = 9 marbles each on Tuesday.",
    "Now I need to find out how many marbles were left in the jar after they took out the 18 marbles.",
    "Originally, there were 30 marbles in the jar and they removed 18, so 30 - 18 = 12 marbles remained.",
    "On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles that were left in the jar.",
    "There were 12 marbles left in the jar and she took 1/2 of them.",
    "1/2 of 12 marbles is 12 / 2 = 6 marbles.",
    "Cleo already had 9 marbles from what was taken out on Tuesday.",
    "So, on the third day, Cleo had 9 marbles from Tuesday + 6 marbles from what she took = 15 marbles in total."
