  "query": "Joe sells cookies for 20% more than it costs to make them. If he sold 50 cookies and earned $60, how much do the cookies cost to make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the selling price of each cookie.",
    "Joe earned $60 from selling 50 cookies.",
    "To find the selling price of each cookie, I divide the total earnings ($60) by the number of cookies sold (50).",
    "$60 / 50 = $1.20",
    "So, each cookie is sold for $1.20.",
    "Joe sells cookies for 20% more than it costs to make them.",
    "Let the cost price of each cookie be x.",
    "The selling price is 20% more than the cost price.",
    "This means the selling price is x + 0.20x = 1.20x.",
    "Since I already calculated that the selling price per cookie is $1.20, I set up the equation: 1.20x = 1.20.",
    "To find x, I divide both sides of the equation by 1.20.",
    "x = 1.20 / 1.20 = 1",
    "Each cookie costs $1 to make."
