  "query": "Michael makes birdhouses to sell at craft shows. He charges $22 for each large birdhouse, $16 for each medium birdhouse, and $7 for each small birdhouse. This week, he sold 2 large birdhouses, 2 medium birdhouses, and 3 small birdhouses. How much money, in dollars, did he make this week?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the earnings from each size of birdhouse separately and then sum them up.",
    "First, I'll calculate the earnings from the large birdhouses.",
    "Michael sold 2 large birdhouses.",
    "Each large birdhouse sells for $22.",
    "The earnings from the large birdhouses are 2 * 22 = $44.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the earnings from the medium birdhouses.",
    "Michael sold 2 medium birdhouses.",
    "Each medium birdhouse sells for $16.",
    "The earnings from the medium birdhouses are 2 * 16 = $32.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the earnings from the small birdhouses.",
    "Michael sold 3 small birdhouses.",
    "Each small birdhouse sells for $7.",
    "The earnings from the small birdhouses are 3 * 7 = $21.",
    "Now, I will add up the earnings from each size to find the total earnings.",
    "The total earnings is $44 + $32 + $21.",
    "$44 + $32 = $76.",
    "$76 + $21 = $97."
