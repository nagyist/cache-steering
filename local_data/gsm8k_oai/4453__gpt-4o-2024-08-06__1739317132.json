  "query": "Jason bought a new bookcase that can hold a maximum of 80 pounds of weight. Jason has 70 hardcover books that each weigh half a pound, 30 textbooks that each weigh 2 pounds, and 3 knick-knacks that each weight 6 pounds. How many pounds over the bookcase's weight limit is this total collection of items?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total weight of the hardcover books.",
    "There are 70 hardcover books, and each weighs 0.5 pounds.",
    "The total weight of the hardcover books is 70 books * 0.5 pounds per book = 35 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total weight of the textbooks.",
    "There are 30 textbooks, and each weighs 2 pounds.",
    "The total weight of the textbooks is 30 books * 2 pounds per book = 60 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total weight of the knick-knacks.",
    "There are 3 knick-knacks, and each weighs 6 pounds.",
    "The total weight of the knick-knacks is 3 items * 6 pounds per item = 18 pounds.",
    "I will now add the weights of the hardcover books, textbooks, and knick-knacks to find the total weight of all items.",
    "The total weight is 35 pounds (hardcover books) + 60 pounds (textbooks) + 18 pounds (knick-knacks) = 113 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pounds over the bookcase's weight limit this total weight is.",
    "The bookcase's weight limit is 80 pounds.",
    "The total weight of the items is 113 pounds, which is over the weight limit.",
    "To find how many pounds over the limit, I subtract the weight limit from the total weight: 113 pounds - 80 pounds = 33 pounds."
