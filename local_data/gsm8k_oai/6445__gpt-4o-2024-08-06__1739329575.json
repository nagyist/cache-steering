  "steps": [
    "Tina has 12 pink pens.",
    "Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens, so she has 12 - 9 green pens.",
    "12 - 9 equals 3, so Tina has 3 green pens.",
    "Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens, so she has 3 + 3 blue pens.",
    "3 + 3 equals 6, so Tina has 6 blue pens.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pens Tina has by adding the number of pink, green, and blue pens together.",
    "Tina has 12 pink pens, 3 green pens, and 6 blue pens.",
    "The total number of pens is 12 + 3 + 6.",
    "12 + 3 equals 15, and 15 + 6 equals 21."
