  "query": "Following her doctor\u2019s recommendation to up her daily water intake, Nancy now drinks the equivalent of 60% of her body weight in water. If Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, how much, in pounds, does she weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "Nancy drinks the equivalent of 60% of her body weight in water.",
    "Her daily water intake is 54 pounds.",
    "We need to find Nancy's body weight, which we'll call W.",
    "60% of her body weight equals 54 pounds.",
    "In mathematical terms, 0.60 * W = 54.",
    "To find W, divide both sides of the equation by 0.60.",
    "W = 54 / 0.60.",
    "Calculate 54 / 0.60 to find the value of W.",
    "54 divided by 0.60 equals 90."
