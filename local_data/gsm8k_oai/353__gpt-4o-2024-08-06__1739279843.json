  "query": "On Friday, Remy paid Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture. Later that evening, the company\u2019s accountant discovered that a new intern in the sales department had overcharged Remy. If the cost of a piece of furniture is $134, how much money will Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC reimburse Remy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Remy should have been charged for the 150 pieces of furniture.",
    "The cost of one piece of furniture is $134.",
    "I need to multiply the number of pieces by the cost per piece to find the correct total charge: 134 * 150.",
    "Calculating 134 * 150, I will break this down: 134 * 100 = 13,400 and 134 * 50 = 6,700.",
    "Adding these results together: 13,400 + 6,700 = 20,100.",
    "Remy should have been charged $20,100 for the furniture.",
    "The amount Remy actually paid was $20,700.",
    "To find the reimbursement amount, I will subtract the correct charge from the amount paid: 20,700 - 20,100.",
    "20,700 - 20,100 = 600."
  ],
  "solution": "600"
