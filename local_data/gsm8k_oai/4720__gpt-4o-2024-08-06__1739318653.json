  "query": "Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?",
  "steps": [
    "Cara has a total of 60 marbles.",
    "20 of the marbles are yellow.",
    "Half as many marbles are green as there are yellow marbles.",
    "Half of 20 is 10, so there are 10 green marbles.",
    "The yellow and green marbles together total 20 + 10 = 30 marbles.",
    "This means the remaining marbles are 60 - 30 = 30 marbles.",
    "These remaining 30 marbles are equally divided between red and blue.",
    "So, there are 30 / 2 = 15 red marbles.",
    "Similarly, there are 15 blue marbles.",
    "The probability of picking a blue marble is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles.",
    "This probability is 15 blue marbles / 60 total marbles.",
    "15/60 simplifies to 1/4.",
    "The odds, expressed as a percentage, are (1/4) * 100.",
    "(1/4) * 100 equals 25."

  "solution": "25"
