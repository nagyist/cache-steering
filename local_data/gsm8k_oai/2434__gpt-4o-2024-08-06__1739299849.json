  "query": "Tameka is selling boxes of crackers for her scout troop. On Friday, she sold 40 boxes. On Saturday, she sold 10 fewer than twice that number. And on Sunday, she sold half as many as Sunday. How many boxes did she sell over the three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many boxes Tameka sold on each day.",
    "On Friday, she sold 40 boxes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many she sold on Saturday.",
    "Tameka sold 10 fewer than twice the number on Friday. Twice 40 is 80.",
    "Subtract 10 from 80 to find the number sold on Saturday: 80 - 10 = 70.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many she sold on Sunday.",
    "The problem states she sold half as many on Sunday as on Sunday, which seems like an error.",
    "Checking again, it likely means half as many as on Saturday, so I\u2019ll use that interpretation.",
    "Half of 70 is 35, so she sold 35 boxes on Sunday.",
    "Now, I will add up the boxes sold over the three days: Friday + Saturday + Sunday.",
    "The total is 40 + 70 + 35.",
    "Adding those gives me 145."

  "solution": "145"
