  "steps": [
    "Mr. Alonzo harvested 245.5 kg of tomatoes in total.",
    "He sold 125.5 kg to Mrs. Maxwell.",
    "He also sold 78 kg to Mr. Wilson.",
    "To find the total amount of tomatoes sold, I need to add the amount sold to Mrs. Maxwell and the amount sold to Mr. Wilson.",
    "125.5 kg + 78 kg = 203.5 kg",
    "Mr. Alonzo sold a total of 203.5 kg of tomatoes.",
    "To find the number of kilograms of tomatoes that are not sold, I need to subtract the total kilograms sold from the total amount harvested.",
    "245.5 kg - 203.5 kg = 42 kg",
    "Therefore, 42 kg of tomatoes were not sold."
