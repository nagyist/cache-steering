  "query": "Mrs. Brynlee reduced the prices of items in her store by 20% after the local government gave small businesses in her county a subsidy. If the price of a shirt in the store was $60 and that of the leather jacket was $90, calculate the amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the reduced price of a shirt. The original price of a shirt is $60.",
    "The reduction is 20% of $60.",
    "20% of $60 is \\(0.2 \\times 60 = 12\\).",
    "The reduced price of a shirt is \\(60 - 12 = 48\\).",
    "Next, I need to calculate the reduced price of a leather jacket. The original price of a leather jacket is $90.",
    "The reduction is 20% of $90.",
    "20% of $90 is \\(0.2 \\times 90 = 18\\).",
    "The reduced price of a leather jacket is \\(90 - 18 = 72\\).",
    "Now, I calculate the total cost for 5 shirts at the reduced price.",
    "5 shirts at $48 each will cost \\(5 \\times 48 = 240\\).",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost for 10 leather jackets at the reduced price.",
    "10 leather jackets at $72 each will cost \\(10 \\times 72 = 720\\).",
    "I add the costs for the shirts and jackets together to find the total amount Teagan will pay.",
    "The total cost is \\(240 + 720 = 960\\)."
