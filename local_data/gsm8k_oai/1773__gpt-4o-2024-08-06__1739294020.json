  "query": "Savannah is wrapping presents for her friends and family for Christmas. She has bought 3 rolls of wrapping paper to wrap 12 gifts. If it takes 1 roll to wrap 3 gifts and 1 roll to wrap 5 other gifts, if there is no wrapping paper leftover after Savannah wraps the rest of the gifts, how many gifts did she wrap with the third roll of paper?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many gifts Savannah wrapped with the third roll of wrapping paper.",
    "I know that Savannah has 3 rolls of wrapping paper and 12 gifts.",
    "The first roll is used to wrap 3 gifts.",
    "The second roll is used to wrap 5 gifts.",
    "3 (from the first roll) + 5 (from the second roll) = 8 gifts have been wrapped using the first two rolls.",
    "Savannah has 12 gifts in total and she has already wrapped 8 gifts.",
    "12 - 8 = 4 gifts remain to be wrapped.",
    "Savannah uses the third roll to wrap these remaining 4 gifts."
