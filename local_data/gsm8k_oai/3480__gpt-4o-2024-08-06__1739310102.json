  "query": "Chelsea made 4 batches of cupcakes for the bake sale. The cupcakes took 20 minutes to bake and 30 minutes to ice per batch. How long did it take Chelsea to make the cupcakes?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how long it took Chelsea to bake the cupcakes and how long it took her to ice them, then add those times together.",
    "There are 4 batches of cupcakes, and each batch takes 20 minutes to bake.",
    "To find the total time spent baking, I will multiply the number of batches (4) by the baking time per batch (20 minutes).",
    "4 batches \u00d7 20 minutes per batch = 80 minutes spent baking.",
    "Now I need to calculate how long it took Chelsea to ice the cupcakes.",
    "Each batch takes 30 minutes to ice.",
    "I will multiply the number of batches (4) by the icing time per batch (30 minutes).",
    "4 batches \u00d7 30 minutes per batch = 120 minutes spent icing.",
    "To find the total time Chelsea spent making the cupcakes, I need to add the time spent baking and the time spent icing.",
    "80 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (icing) = 200 minutes total."
