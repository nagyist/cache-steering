  "query": "Casey is going to stay at a motel while she works her summer job as a ski instructor. The hotel charges $280/week or $1000/month. If Casey will be staying 3 months, each with exactly 4 weeks, how much money does she save by paying monthly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost if Casey pays by the week.",
    "There are 4 weeks in each month, and she stays for 3 months. So, she stays for a total of \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) weeks.",
    "The motel charges $280 per week. So, the total cost if she pays weekly is \\(12 \\times 280\\).",
    "Calculating \\(12 \\times 280\\): \n12 times 280 is \\(3360\\).",
    "Now, I need to determine the total cost if Casey pays by the month.",
    "The motel charges $1000 per month. She stays for 3 months.",
    "Calculating \\(3 \\times 1000\\): \n3 times 1000 is \\(3000\\).",
    "Now, I need to find the difference between the weekly total cost and the monthly total cost to determine her savings.",
    "The weekly cost is $3360. The monthly cost is $3000.",
    "Calculating the savings: \\(3360 - 3000 = 360\\).",
    "Casey saves $360 by paying monthly instead of weekly."

  "solution": "360"
