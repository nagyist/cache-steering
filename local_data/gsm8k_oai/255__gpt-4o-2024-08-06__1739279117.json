  "query": "Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?",
  "steps": [
    "Bush is currently 12 years old.",
    "Since Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years, we add 3 years to Bush's age to find Matt's current age.",
    "12 (Bush's age) + 3 = 15. So, Matt is currently 15 years old.",
    "We need to determine Matt's age 10 years from now.",
    "To find Matt's age in 10 years, add 10 to his current age of 15.",
    "15 + 10 = 25. So, Matt will be 25 years old 10 years from now."
