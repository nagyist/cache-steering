  "query": "Susie and Britney each keep chickens, of two different breeds. Susie has 11 Rhode Island Reds and 6 Golden Comets. Britney has twice as many Rhode Island Reds as Susie, but only half as many Golden Comets. How many more chickens are in Britney's flock than in Susie's?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will count the number of chickens Susie has.",
    "Susie has 11 Rhode Island Reds.",
    "Susie also has 6 Golden Comets.",
    "Adding them up, Susie has 11 + 6 = 17 chickens in total.",
    "Now, I will find out how many chickens Britney has.",
    "Britney has twice as many Rhode Island Reds as Susie.",
    "So, Britney has 2 * 11 Rhode Island Reds = 22 Rhode Island Reds.",
    "Britney has half as many Golden Comets as Susie.",
    "So, Britney has 6 / 2 = 3 Golden Comets.",
    "Adding them up, Britney has 22 + 3 = 25 chickens in total.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more chickens Britney has than Susie.",
    "Britney has 25 chickens, and Susie has 17 chickens.",
    "Subtracting Susie's total from Britney's: 25 - 17 = 8."
