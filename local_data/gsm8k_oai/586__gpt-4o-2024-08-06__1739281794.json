  "query": "Harvey and his friend Sam decided to run a footrace in their school track field to see who was better at running. While at it, Harvey runs 8 miles more than his friend Sam, who runs a total of 12 miles. Calculate the total number of miles the two friends run together.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand the problem describes a footrace between Harvey and Sam.",
    "Sam runs a total of 12 miles.",
    "Harvey runs 8 miles more than Sam.",
    "To find out how many miles Harvey runs, I need to add 8 miles to Sam's 12 miles.",
    "12 miles + 8 miles equals 20 miles.",
    "So, Harvey runs 20 miles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of miles both Harvey and Sam run together.",
    "Sam runs 12 miles and Harvey runs 20 miles.",
    "I add their distances together: 12 miles + 20 miles.",
    "12 miles + 20 miles equals 32 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "32"
