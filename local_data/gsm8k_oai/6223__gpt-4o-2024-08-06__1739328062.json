  "query": "Bernie loves eating chocolate. He buys two chocolates every week at the local store. One chocolate costs him $3. In a different store, there is a long-term promotion, during which each chocolate costs only $2. How much would Bernie save in three weeks, if he would buy his chocolates in this store instead of his local one?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many chocolates Bernie buys in three weeks.",
    "Bernie buys 2 chocolates each week.",
    "Since he buys chocolates every week, in three weeks he buys 2 chocolates/week * 3 weeks = 6 chocolates.",
    "Now, I will calculate the cost of these chocolates at the local store.",
    "At the local store, each chocolate costs $3.",
    "Therefore, 6 chocolates at $3 each would cost 6 * $3 = $18.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of these chocolates at the store with the promotion.",
    "At the store with the promotion, each chocolate costs $2.",
    "Therefore, 6 chocolates at $2 each would cost 6 * $2 = $12.",
    "To find out how much Bernie would save by buying in the promotional store, I subtract the total cost in the promotional store from the total cost in the local store.",
    "The savings would be $18 - $12 = $6."

  "solution": "6"
