  "query": "7 out of 40 people in a cafeteria are wearing checkered shirts. The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes. The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of people in the cafeteria is 40.",
    "There are 7 people wearing checkered shirts.",
    "The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times the number wearing checkered shirts.",
    "4 times the number of people wearing checkered shirts is 4 * 7 = 28 people.",
    "So, there are 28 people wearing horizontal stripes.",
    "To find the number of people wearing vertical stripes, subtract the number of people wearing checkered and horizontal stripes from the total number of people.",
    "Subtract the 7 people wearing checkered shirts and the 28 people wearing horizontal stripes from the total 40 people: 40 - 7 - 28.",
    "40 - 7 = 33.",
    "33 - 28 = 5."
