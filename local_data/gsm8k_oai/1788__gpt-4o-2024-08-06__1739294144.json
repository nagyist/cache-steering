  "query": "Mr. Shaefer harvested 500 lychees in a carton and took them to the market. He sold half of them and took home the remaining number of lychees where they ate 3/5 of them. Calculate the number of lychees remaining.",
  "steps": [
    "Mr. Shaefer harvested 500 lychees.",
    "He sold half of them at the market.",
    "To find out how many lychees he sold, I need to calculate 500 divided by 2.",
    "500 divided by 2 is 250 lychees sold.",
    "Now, I subtract the number of lychees sold from the total harvested to find out how many he took home: 500 - 250.",
    "500 - 250 equals 250 lychees taken home.",
    "He and his family ate 3/5 of the lychees that he took home.",
    "To find out how many lychees they ate, I need to calculate 3/5 of 250.",
    "3/5 of 250 is calculated as (3/5) * 250.",
    "Calculating (3/5) * 250 gives me 150 lychees eaten.",
    "Now, I subtract the number they ate from the number brought home to find out how many are remaining: 250 - 150.",
    "250 - 150 equals 100 lychees remaining."
