  "query": "The Period 1 gym class has 5 fewer than twice as many students as in the Period 2 gym class. There are 11 students in the Period 1 gym class. How many are in the Period 2 gym class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will define a variable to represent the number of students in the Period 2 gym class. Let's call this variable \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, the number of students in the Period 1 gym class is 5 fewer than twice the number of students in the Period 2 gym class.",
    "The problem states that there are 11 students in the Period 1 gym class.",
    "The equation based on this information is: \\( 2x - 5 = 11 \\).",
    "I will solve this equation to find \\( x \\), the number of students in the Period 2 gym class.",
    "First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: \\( 2x - 5 + 5 = 11 + 5 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( 2x = 16 \\).",
    "Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = \\frac{16}{2} \\).",
    "Simplify: \\( x = 8 \\)."
