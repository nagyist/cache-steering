  "query": "Julio goes fishing and can catch 7 fish every hour. By the 9th hour, how many fish does Julio have if he loses 15 fish in the process?",
  "steps": [
    "Julio catches 7 fish every hour.",
    "He fishes for 9 hours.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of fish he catches in 9 hours.",
    "Multiply the number of fish caught per hour by the number of hours: 7 fish/hour * 9 hours = 63 fish.",
    "This tells me Julio catches a total of 63 fish in 9 hours.",
    "Julio loses 15 fish during the process.",
    "To find out how many fish he has left, I need to subtract the 15 lost fish from the total he caught.",
    "Calculate: 63 fish - 15 fish = 48 fish."
