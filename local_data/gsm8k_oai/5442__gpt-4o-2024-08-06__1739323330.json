  "query": "Francis' family has 2 ukuleles, 4 guitars, and a certain number of violins. Each ukulele has 4 strings. Each guitar has 6 strings. Each violin has 4 strings. If the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings, how many violins does Francis' family have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate the total number of strings from the ukuleles.",
    "There are 2 ukuleles. Each has 4 strings.",
    "The total number of strings from the ukuleles is 2 ukuleles * 4 strings/ukulele = 8 strings.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of strings from the guitars.",
    "There are 4 guitars. Each has 6 strings.",
    "The total number of strings from the guitars is 4 guitars * 6 strings/guitar = 24 strings.",
    "I now add the strings from the ukuleles and guitars.",
    "The total number of strings from the ukuleles and guitars is 8 strings + 24 strings = 32 strings.",
    "The total number of strings among all instruments is given as 40 strings.",
    "The remaining strings must come from the violins.",
    "The number of strings that come from the violins is 40 strings - 32 strings = 8 strings.",
    "Each violin has 4 strings.",
    "To find the number of violins, I divide the total number of strings from the violins by the number of strings per violin.",
    "The number of violins is 8 strings / 4 strings/violin = 2 violins."
