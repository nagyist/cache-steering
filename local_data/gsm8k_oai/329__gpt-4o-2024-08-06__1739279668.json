  "query": "Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts and Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts. They planned to share the doughnuts evenly with their 8 other friends. How many doughnuts will each of them receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many doughnuts Samuel bought.",
    "Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts.",
    "A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12.",
    "2 x 12 = 24.",
    "So, Samuel bought 24 doughnuts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many doughnuts Cathy bought.",
    "Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts.",
    "3 dozen means 3 x 12.",
    "3 x 12 = 36.",
    "Cathy bought 36 doughnuts.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of doughnuts bought by both Samuel and Cathy.",
    "Samuel's doughnuts + Cathy's doughnuts = 24 + 36.",
    "24 + 36 = 60.",
    "There are 60 doughnuts in total.",
    "Samuel and Cathy want to share the doughnuts with their 8 other friends.",
    "Including Samuel and Cathy, there are 10 people in total.",
    "I need to divide the 60 doughnuts evenly among the 10 people.",
    "60 doughnuts / 10 people = 6 doughnuts per person."
