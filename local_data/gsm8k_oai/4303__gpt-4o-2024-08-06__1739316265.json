  "query": "Jeffrey owns a poultry farm with 12 hens. For every 3 hens, there is 1 rooster. Each hen has 5 chicks. How many chickens are there in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of roosters on the farm.",
    "There are 12 hens and for every 3 hens, there is 1 rooster.",
    "To find the number of roosters, I divide the number of hens by 3.",
    "12 hens \u00f7 3 hens per rooster = 4 roosters",
    "Next, I need to find out how many chicks there are in total.",
    "Each hen has 5 chicks and there are 12 hens.",
    "Multiply the number of hens by the number of chicks per hen to get the total number of chicks.",
    "12 hens \u00d7 5 chicks per hen = 60 chicks",
    "Now, I will add the number of hens, roosters, and chicks to find the total number of chickens.",
    "12 hens + 4 roosters + 60 chicks = 76 chickens"

  "solution": "76"
