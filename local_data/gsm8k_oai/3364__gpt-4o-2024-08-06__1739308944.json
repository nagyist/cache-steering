  "query": "Zane purchases 2 polo shirts from the 40% off rack at the men\u2019s store.  The polo shirts are $50 each at the regular price.  How much did he pay for the shirts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the discounted price of one polo shirt. The original price of one shirt is $50.",
    "The discount is 40%. So I need to calculate 40% of $50.",
    "To find 40% of $50, I multiply $50 by 0.40.",
    "$50 \u00d7 0.40 = $20",
    "So, the discount on one polo shirt is $20.",
    "Now, I will subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.",
    "$50 - $20 = $30",
    "The discounted price for one polo shirt is $30.",
    "Zane purchased 2 polo shirts. Now I will calculate the total cost for 2 shirts.",
    "2 shirts \u00d7 $30 per shirt = $60"

  "solution": "60"
