  "query": "Dustin and Sam are both reading. Dustin can read 75 pages in an hour. Sam can read 24 pages in an hour. How many more pages does Dustin read in 40 minutes compared to Sam?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes.",
    "Dustin reads 75 pages in 60 minutes.",
    "To find out how many pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes, I can set up a proportion.",
    "The proportion is 75 pages/60 minutes = x pages/40 minutes.",
    "I will solve for x.",
    "x = (75 pages * 40 minutes) / 60 minutes.",
    "x = 3000 pages/60 minutes.",
    "x = 50 pages.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many pages Sam reads in 40 minutes.",
    "Sam reads 24 pages in 60 minutes.",
    "To find out how many pages Sam reads in 40 minutes, I can use a similar proportion.",
    "The proportion is 24 pages/60 minutes = y pages/40 minutes.",
    "I will solve for y.",
    "y = (24 pages * 40 minutes) / 60 minutes.",
    "y = 960 pages/60 minutes.",
    "y = 16 pages.",
    "Now I know that Dustin reads 50 pages in 40 minutes and Sam reads 16 pages in 40 minutes.",
    "I need to calculate how many more pages Dustin reads compared to Sam.",
    "50 pages - 16 pages = 34 pages."
