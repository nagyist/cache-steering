  "query": "Harper collected 30% more pieces of Halloween candy than her sister Maggie, who only collected 50 pieces.  Neil collected 40% more candy than Harper.  How much candy did Neil get on Halloween?",
  "steps": [
    "Maggie collected 50 pieces of candy.",
    "Harper collected 30% more candy than Maggie.",
    "To find 30% of 50, I need to calculate 0.30 * 50.",
    "0.30 * 50 = 15",
    "Harper collected 15 more pieces than Maggie.",
    "So, Harper collected 50 + 15 pieces.",
    "50 + 15 = 65",
    "Harper collected 65 pieces of candy.",
    "Neil collected 40% more candy than Harper.",
    "To find 40% of 65, I need to calculate 0.40 * 65.",
    "0.40 * 65 = 26",
    "Neil collected 26 more pieces than Harper.",
    "So, Neil collected 65 + 26 pieces.",
    "65 + 26 = 91",
    "Neil collected 91 pieces of candy on Halloween."
