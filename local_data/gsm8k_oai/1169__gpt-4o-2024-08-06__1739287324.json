  "query": "Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. His mother gave him five boxes with eight baseball cards.  If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?",
  "steps": [
    "Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box.",
    "I need to find out how many basketball cards he has in total.",
    "I will multiply the number of boxes by the number of basketball cards in each box: 4 * 10.",
    "4 * 10 equals 40. So, Ben has 40 basketball cards.",
    "Now, let me find out how many baseball cards his mother gave him.",
    "His mother gave him five boxes with eight baseball cards in each.",
    "I need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of baseball cards in each box: 5 * 8.",
    "5 * 8 equals 40. So, his mother gave him 40 baseball cards.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of cards Ben has before giving any away.",
    "I will add the number of basketball cards to the number of baseball cards: 40 + 40.",
    "40 + 40 equals 80. So, Ben has 80 cards in total initially.",
    "Ben gives 58 cards to his classmates.",
    "I need to subtract the number of cards he gives away from his total number of cards: 80 - 58.",
    "80 - 58 equals 22.",
    "Therefore, after giving away 58 cards, Ben has 22 cards left."
