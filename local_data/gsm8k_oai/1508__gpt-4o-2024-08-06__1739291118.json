  "query": "Dorothy sells glass frames at half the price that Jemma sells them. Jemma sells the glass frames at 5 dollars each, selling twice as many frames as Dorothy does. If Jemma sold 400 frames, how much did they make together in total from the sale of the glass frames?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how much Jemma sells each glass frame for. The problem states that Jemma sells them for $5 each.",
    "Next, we find out how many frames Jemma sold. The problem states that Jemma sold 400 frames.",
    "To find out how much Jemma made from selling 400 frames, we multiply the number of frames by the price per frame. So, 400 frames * $5/frame = $2000.",
    "Now, we know that Dorothy sells glass frames at half the price Jemma does. Since Jemma sells them for $5, Dorothy sells them for half of that, which is $2.50 per frame.",
    "Jemma sells twice as many frames as Dorothy. Therefore, if Jemma sold 400 frames, Dorothy must have sold half of that amount.",
    "400 frames / 2 = 200 frames. So, Dorothy sold 200 frames.",
    "To find out how much Dorothy made from selling 200 frames, we multiply the number of frames by her price per frame. So, 200 frames * $2.50/frame = $500.",
    "Finally, to find out how much they made together, we add the amounts they each earned. Jemma made $2000 and Dorothy made $500.",
    "$2000 + $500 = $2500."

  "solution": "2500"
