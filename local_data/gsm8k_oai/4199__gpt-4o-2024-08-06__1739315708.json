  "query": "Jenn is saving up money to buy a bike. She has 5 jars full of quarters. Each jar can hold 160 quarters. If the bike costs 180 dollars, how much money will she have left over after buying it?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many quarters Jenn has in total.",
    "Jenn has 5 jars of quarters, and each jar holds 160 quarters.",
    "To find the total number of quarters, I need to multiply the number of jars by the number of quarters per jar.",
    "5 jars * 160 quarters/jar = 800 quarters.",
    "Now, I need to convert the total number of quarters into dollars.",
    "Each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars.",
    "So, I need to multiply the total number of quarters by the value of each quarter.",
    "800 quarters * 0.25 dollars/quarter = 200 dollars.",
    "Jenn has 200 dollars from her quarters.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the cost of the bike from the total amount of money Jenn has.",
    "The bike costs 180 dollars.",
    "To find out how much money Jenn will have left over, I calculate 200 dollars - 180 dollars.",
    "200 dollars - 180 dollars = 20 dollars."

  "solution": "20"
