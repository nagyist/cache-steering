  "query": "Loris needs three more books to have the same number as Lamont, who has twice the number of books Darryl has. If Darryl has 20 books, calculate the total number of books the three have.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start with what we know: Darryl has 20 books.",
    "Lamont has twice the number of books as Darryl.",
    "So, Lamont has 2 times 20 books.",
    "Calculating Lamont's books: 2 * 20 = 40.",
    "Lamont has 40 books.",
    "Loris needs three more books to have the same number as Lamont.",
    "If Loris needs 3 more books to equal Lamont's 40 books, that means he currently has 40 - 3 books.",
    "Calculating Loris's current number of books: 40 - 3 = 37.",
    "Loris has 37 books.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of books the three have.",
    "Total number of books is the sum of Darryl's, Lamont's, and Loris's books.",
    "Adding them: 20 (Darryl) + 40 (Lamont) + 37 (Loris).",
    "Total = 20 + 40 + 37 = 97."

  "solution": "97"
