  "query": "Brittany has 3 gerbils: Puffy, Muffy, and Scruffy. Puffy weighs 5 ounces more than Muffy. Muffy weighs 3 ounces less than Scruffy.  If Scruffy weighs 12 ounces, how much would the scale indicate, in ounces, if Brittany put Puffy and Muffy on the scale?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the weight of Scruffy. We know Scruffy weighs 12 ounces.",
    "Next, calculate Muffy's weight. Muffy weighs 3 ounces less than Scruffy.",
    "Subtract 3 ounces from Scruffy's weight of 12 ounces to find Muffy's weight: 12 - 3 = 9 ounces.",
    "Now, calculate Puffy's weight. Puffy weighs 5 ounces more than Muffy.",
    "Add 5 ounces to Muffy's weight of 9 ounces to find Puffy's weight: 9 + 5 = 14 ounces.",
    "Finally, calculate the combined weight of Puffy and Muffy. Add Puffy's weight of 14 ounces to Muffy's weight of 9 ounces.",
    "14 ounces (Puffy) + 9 ounces (Muffy) = 23 ounces."
