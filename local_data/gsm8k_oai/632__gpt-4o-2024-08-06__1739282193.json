  "query": "Yeon has three times as many watermelon seeds as Gwi. Gwi has 40 more watermelon seeds than Bom. If Bom has 300 watermelon seeds, how many seeds do they have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many watermelon seeds Bom has. According to the problem, Bom has 300 seeds.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many seeds Gwi has. The problem states that Gwi has 40 more seeds than Bom.",
    "To find the number of seeds Gwi has, I add the 40 extra seeds to the 300 seeds that Bom has. So, Gwi has 300 + 40 = 340 seeds.",
    "Now I need to find out how many seeds Yeon has. The problem tells me that Yeon has three times as many seeds as Gwi.",
    "To calculate Yeon's seeds, I multiply Gwi's seeds by three. Therefore, Yeon has 3 * 340 = 1020 seeds.",
    "Now I have the number of seeds each person has: Bom has 300 seeds, Gwi has 340 seeds, and Yeon has 1020 seeds.",
    "To find the total number of seeds they have together, I need to add their seeds: 300 + 340 + 1020.",
    "Adding these amounts gives the total: 300 + 340 = 640, and then 640 + 1020 = 1660 seeds."

  "solution": "1660"
