  "query": "Antoine is having a dinner party and his butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person.  If he's inviting 6 people over and the beef tenderloin is $15.00 a pound, how much will this cost him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pounds of meat Antoine will need for the party.",
    "The butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person.",
    "Antoine is inviting 6 people.",
    "To find out how many pounds of meat are needed, multiply the number of people by the recommendation: 6 people * 1/2 pound per person.",
    "6 * 1/2 is 3.",
    "Thus, Antoine needs 3 pounds of meat.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the meat.",
    "The beef tenderloin is $15.00 per pound.",
    "To find the total cost, multiply the number of pounds needed by the cost per pound: 3 pounds * $15.00 per pound.",
    "3 * 15 equals 45."
