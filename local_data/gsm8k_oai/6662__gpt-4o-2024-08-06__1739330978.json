  "query": "Queenie earns $150 a day as a part-time clerk. She earns an additional $5 per hour as overtime pay. How much will Queenie receive for working 5 days with 4 hours overtime?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Queenie's basic pay for the 5 days.",
    "She earns $150 a day.",
    "For 5 days, she would earn 5 times $150.",
    "5 times $150 equals $750.",
    "Now, I need to calculate Queenie's overtime pay.",
    "She earns an additional $5 for each hour of overtime.",
    "She works 4 hours of overtime.",
    "4 hours times $5 per hour equals $20.",
    "Finally, to find the total amount Queenie will receive, I need to add her basic pay and her overtime pay.",
    "$750 (basic pay) plus $20 (overtime pay) equals $770."
