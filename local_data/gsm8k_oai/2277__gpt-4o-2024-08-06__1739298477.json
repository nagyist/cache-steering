  "query": "Davante has twice as many friends as there are days in the week. 3 of his friends are girls. How many friends does he have that are boys?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many days there are in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "I know that Davante has twice as many friends as there are days in the week.",
    "Twice the number of days in the week is 2 times 7.",
    "2 times 7 is 14.",
    "So, Davante has 14 friends in total.",
    "I also know that 3 of his friends are girls.",
    "I need to find out how many of his friends are boys.",
    "I will subtract the number of girl friends from the total number of friends to find the number of boy friends.",
    "14 total friends minus 3 girl friends equals 11 boy friends."
