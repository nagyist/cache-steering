  "query": "Andrew's dog has 12 burrs and six times as many ticks as burrs. How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many ticks Andrew's dog has.",
    "We know the dog has 12 burrs.",
    "The number of ticks is six times the number of burrs.",
    "I'll calculate six times 12 to find the number of ticks.",
    "Six times 12 is 72.",
    "So, the dog has 72 ticks.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of foreign objects in the dog's fur.",
    "I will add the number of burrs and ticks together.",
    "Adding 12 burrs and 72 ticks gives me a total.",
    "12 plus 72 equals 84."

  "solution": "84"
