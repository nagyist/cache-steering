  "query": "Mike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?",
  "steps": [
    "Mike's normal typing speed is 65 words per minute.",
    "Due to the accident, Mike's typing speed is reduced by 20 words per minute.",
    "To find Mike's new typing speed, I subtract 20 words from 65 words per minute.",
    "65 - 20 = 45",
    "So, Mike's new typing speed is 45 words per minute.",
    "The document contains 810 words.",
    "To find out how many minutes it will take Mike to type 810 words at his new speed, I need to divide the total number of words by his typing speed.",
    "I will divide 810 by 45 to find the time in minutes.",
    "810 \u00f7 45 = 18",
    "It will take Mike 18 minutes to finish typing the document."

  "solution": "18"
