  "query": "Pam has 10 bags of apples. Each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. If Gerald's bags have 40 apples each, how many apples does Pam have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Gerald's bags have 40 apples each.",
    "Pam's bags have the same number of apples as 3 of Gerald\u2019s bags.",
    "To find out how many apples are in one of Pam's bags, I calculate 3 times the number of apples in one of Gerald's bags.",
    "I multiply 3 by 40, since Gerald\u2019s bags have 40 apples each.",
    "3 times 40 is equal to 120. Therefore, one of Pam's bags has 120 apples.",
    "Pam has 10 bags in total.",
    "To find out how many apples Pam has in total, I multiply the number of apples in one of her bags by the total number of her bags.",
    "I multiply 10 by 120.",
    "10 times 120 equals 1200."
