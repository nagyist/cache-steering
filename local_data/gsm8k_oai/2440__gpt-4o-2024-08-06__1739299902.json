  "query": "Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to his two friends Jensen and Finley, who share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11. How many tickets does Finley get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many tickets Wally gives away. He gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets.",
    "Calculate 3/4 of 400. This can be found by multiplying 400 by 3/4.",
    "3/4 of 400 = 400 * 3/4 = 300 tickets.",
    "So, Wally gives away 300 tickets.",
    "These 300 tickets are shared between Jensen and Finley in a ratio of 4:11.",
    "The total parts in the ratio 4:11 is 4 + 11 = 15 parts.",
    "Calculate how many tickets one part is by dividing the total number of tickets by the total number of parts.",
    "One part = 300 tickets / 15 parts = 20 tickets per part.",
    "Finley gets 11 parts of the tickets.",
    "Determine how many tickets Finley gets by multiplying 20 tickets per part by 11 parts.",
    "Finley's tickets = 20 * 11 = 220 tickets."

  "solution": "220"
