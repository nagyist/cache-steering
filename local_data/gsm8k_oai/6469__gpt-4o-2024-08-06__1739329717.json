  "query": "Twice Angie's age, plus 4, is 20. How old is Angie?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by setting up an equation based on the information given.",
    "Twice Angie's age can be represented as \\(2a\\), where \\(a\\) is Angie's age.",
    "According to the problem, twice Angie's age plus 4 equals 20.",
    "So, the equation is \\(2a + 4 = 20\\).",
    "We need to solve for \\(a\\).",
    "First, subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(a\\).",
    "This gives us \\(2a = 20 - 4\\).",
    "Calculate the right side: \\(20 - 4 = 16\\).",
    "Now the equation is \\(2a = 16\\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(a\\).",
    "\\(a = 16 / 2\\).",
    "Calculate the division: \\(16 / 2 = 8\\).",
    "So, Angie's age is 8."
