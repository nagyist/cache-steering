  "query": "Jason is hiring two construction workers, one electrician and one plumber. If the construction workers each make $100/day, the electrician makes double what a worker is paid and the plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary, how much are the overall labor costs for one day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much each of the construction workers will be paid for one day.",
    "Each construction worker makes $100 per day.",
    "Since there are two construction workers, I multiply $100 by 2.",
    "This equals $200 for both construction workers.",
    "Next, I find out how much the electrician makes per day.",
    "The electrician makes double what a construction worker is paid.",
    "Since a construction worker is paid $100, the electrician makes $100 x 2.",
    "This equals $200 for the electrician per day.",
    "Now, I determine how much the plumber earns per day.",
    "The plumber makes 250% of a construction worker's salary.",
    "I convert the percentage into a decimal: 250% = 2.5.",
    "Then, I multiply $100 by 2.5 to find the plumber's daily wage.",
    "This equals $250 for the plumber per day.",
    "Finally, I add up the wages for all the workers to calculate the total labor cost for one day.",
    "I sum $200 (construction workers) + $200 (electrician) + $250 (plumber).",
    "This gives me a total of $650."

  "solution": "650"
