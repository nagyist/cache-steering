  "query": "Jonathan enjoys walking and running for exercise, and he has three different exercise routines.  On Mondays, he walks at 2 miles per hour.  On Wednesdays, he walks at 3 miles per hour.  And on Fridays, he runs at 6 miles per hour.  On each exercise day, he travels 6 miles.  What is the combined total time, in hours, he spends exercising in a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much time Jonathan spends exercising on Mondays.",
    "On Mondays, Jonathan walks at 2 miles per hour and travels 6 miles.",
    "Time is calculated by dividing distance by speed.",
    "For Mondays, the time taken is 6 miles / 2 miles per hour = 3 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time spent exercising on Wednesdays.",
    "On Wednesdays, Jonathan walks at 3 miles per hour and travels 6 miles.",
    "For Wednesdays, the time taken is 6 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2 hours.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the time spent exercising on Fridays.",
    "On Fridays, Jonathan runs at 6 miles per hour and travels 6 miles.",
    "For Fridays, the time taken is 6 miles / 6 miles per hour = 1 hour.",
    "Finally, I need to add up the time spent on each day to find the total time spent exercising in a week.",
    "Total time = Monday time + Wednesday time + Friday time = 3 hours + 2 hours + 1 hour.",
    "3 hours + 2 hours + 1 hour = 6 hours."

  "solution": "6"
