  "query": "There are 24 students in the class. One-third had their school portraits taken before lunch. After lunch, but before gym class, 10 additional students had their portraits taken. After gym class, how many students have not yet had their picture taken?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students had their portraits taken before lunch.",
    "Given that one-third of the 24 students had their portraits taken before lunch, I'll calculate one-third of 24.",
    "One-third of 24 is 24/3 = 8 students.",
    "Now I know that 8 students had their portraits taken before lunch.",
    "Next, I'm told that after lunch, but before gym class, 10 additional students had their portraits taken.",
    "I need to add these 10 students to the 8 who already had their portraits taken.",
    "8 (before lunch) + 10 (after lunch) = 18 students have had their portraits taken by this point.",
    "Now I need to find out how many students have not yet had their picture taken.",
    "I know there are 24 students in total, and 18 have already had their portraits taken.",
    "So, I'll subtract the 18 from the total number of students, which is 24.",
    "24 - 18 = 6 students have not yet had their picture taken."
