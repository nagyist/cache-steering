  "query": "Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session on his new grill.  He needs to cook 115 hamburgers in total for tonight's party.  He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.  How many more sessions will it take Ronald to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many hamburgers Ronald still needs to cook.",
    "Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers.",
    "He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.",
    "Subtract the number of hamburgers he has already cooked from the total amount needed: 115 - 40 = 75.",
    "Ronald still needs to cook 75 hamburgers.",
    "I need to determine how many more sessions are required to cook these 75 hamburgers.",
    "Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session.",
    "Divide the remaining hamburgers by the number he can cook per session: 75 \u00f7 15.",
    "75 divided by 15 is 5.",
    "This means Ronald needs 5 more sessions to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers."
