  "query": "The ski lift carries skiers all the way from the bottom of the mountain to the very top of the mountain, and then drops them off so they can ski back down the mountain. If it takes a skier 15 minutes to ride the lift from the bottom to the top of the mountain, and then it takes 5 minutes to ski back down the mountain, what is the most number of times a person can ski down the mountain in 2 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time it takes for one complete trip, which includes both the lift ride up and skiing down.",
    "The lift ride from the bottom to the top takes 15 minutes.",
    "The time taken to ski back down is 5 minutes.",
    "So, the total time for one round trip is 15 minutes (up) + 5 minutes (down) = 20 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many 20-minute round trips can fit into 2 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so in 2 hours, there are 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "To determine how many 20-minute trips fit into 120 minutes, I divide 120 by 20.",
    "120 divided by 20 equals 6. This means a person can make 6 complete trips in 2 hours."

  "solution": "6"
