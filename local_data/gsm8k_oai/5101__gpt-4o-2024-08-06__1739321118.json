  "query": "Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?",
  "steps": [
    "Johnny wants to build 5 tables.",
    "Each table has 4 legs, so each table needs 4 planks for the legs.",
    "Additionally, each table needs 5 planks for the surface.",
    "Adding the planks for the legs and the surface together, each table needs a total of 4 + 5 planks = 9 planks.",
    "To find the total number of planks needed for all 5 tables, we multiply the number of planks per table by the number of tables: 9 planks/table \u00d7 5 tables = 45 planks."

  "solution": "45"
