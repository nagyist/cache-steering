  "query": "Nathan went to the arcade. He played the air hockey game 2 times and the basketball game 4 times. If each game cost 3 tokens, how many tokens did he use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of tokens Nathan spent on the air hockey game.",
    "He played the air hockey game 2 times.",
    "Each air hockey game costs 3 tokens.",
    "So, for the air hockey game, Nathan spent 2 times 3 tokens.",
    "2 times 3 equals 6 tokens for the air hockey game.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the tokens spent on the basketball game.",
    "He played the basketball game 4 times.",
    "Each basketball game also costs 3 tokens.",
    "For the basketball game, Nathan spent 4 times 3 tokens.",
    "4 times 3 equals 12 tokens for the basketball game.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of tokens Nathan used.",
    "I will add the tokens for both games: 6 tokens for air hockey plus 12 tokens for basketball.",
    "6 plus 12 equals 18."

  "solution": "18"
