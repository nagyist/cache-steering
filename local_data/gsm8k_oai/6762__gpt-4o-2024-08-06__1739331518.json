  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the number of cats in the village that have spots. This is one third of all the cats.",
    "The total number of cats in the village is 120.",
    "To find the number of spotted cats, calculate \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120\\).",
    "\\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\\). So, there are 40 spotted cats in the village.",
    "Next, find the number of spotted cats that are also fluffy. This is a quarter of the spotted cats.",
    "Calculate \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40\\).",
    "\\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\\).",
    "There are 10 cats that are both spotted and fluffy."
