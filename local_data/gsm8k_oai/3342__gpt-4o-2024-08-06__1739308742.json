  "query": "Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does. If Don eats 80 pizzas, how many pizzas do they both eat altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pizzas Daria eats.",
    "Daria consumes 2.5 times the amount of pizza that Don does.",
    "Don eats 80 pizzas, so I will calculate how many pizzas Daria eats by multiplying 80 by 2.5.",
    "80 multiplied by 2.5 is 80 * 2.5 = 200.",
    "Daria eats 200 pizzas.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of pizzas both Daria and Don eat.",
    "Don eats 80 pizzas, and Daria eats 200 pizzas.",
    "To find the total, I add their amounts together: 80 + 200 = 280."
