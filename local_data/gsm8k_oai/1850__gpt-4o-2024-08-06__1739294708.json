  "query": "Drew is reseeding his lawn with grass seed. One bag of grass seed covers 250 square feet of lawn. His lawn is 22 feet from the house to the curb and 36 feet from side to side. He bought four bags of seed. How many extra square feet could the leftover grass seed cover after Drew reseeds his lawn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total area of Drew's lawn. The lawn is rectangular, so I will multiply the length by the width.",
    "The length of the lawn is 22 feet, and the width is 36 feet.",
    "The area of the lawn is 22 feet x 36 feet = 792 square feet.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much area the bags of seed can cover.",
    "Each bag covers 250 square feet, and Drew bought four bags.",
    "Four bags cover 4 x 250 = 1,000 square feet.",
    "Now I want to determine the difference between the coverage from the seed bags and the actual lawn area.",
    "The bags can cover 1,000 square feet, but Drew's lawn is only 792 square feet.",
    "So, I will subtract the lawn area from the area the seed can cover: 1,000 square feet - 792 square feet = 208 square feet."

  "solution": "208"
