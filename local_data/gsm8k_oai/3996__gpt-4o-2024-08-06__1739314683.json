  "query": "If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the ratio of how the pizza slices are shared between Buzz and the waiter. The ratio is given as 5:8, with Buzz's share being the 5 parts.",
    "The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 (Buzz) + 8 (waiter) = 13 parts.",
    "The entire pizza is 78 slices, and these slices are divided into 13 parts according to the ratio.",
    "I need to determine how many slices each part represents. To do this, I divide the total slices by the total number of parts: 78 slices \u00f7 13 parts = 6 slices per part.",
    "Next, I calculate how many slices the waiter gets. The waiter has 8 parts according to the ratio.",
    "The number of slices the waiter ate is 8 parts \u00d7 6 slices per part = 48 slices.",
    "The question asks for twenty less the number of slices that the waiter ate. So, I subtract 20 from the waiter's slices: 48 slices - 20 = 28 slices."

  "solution": "28"
