  "query": "Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Jill made 10 almond candles, as she ran out after making these.",
    "I also know that Jill had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent.",
    "Since she made 10 almond candles, she would have enough coconut scent for 1.5 times that number, or 10 * 1.5.",
    "Calculating 10 * 1.5 gives 15. Therefore, Jill made 15 coconut candles.",
    "Jill made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles.",
    "Twice 15 is 30. Therefore, Jill made 30 lavender candles."

  "solution": "30"
