  "query": "Tony has a piece of quilt that is 6 feet by 24 feet. If he wants to turn it into a square and use all the fabric, how long is each side of the square?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the quilt.",
    "The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.",
    "The length of the quilt is 6 feet and the width is 24 feet.",
    "The area of the quilt is 6 feet multiplied by 24 feet.",
    "6 multiplied by 24 equals 144.",
    "The area of the quilt is 144 square feet.",
    "Tony wants to turn the quilt into a square and use all the fabric.",
    "The area of the square will also be 144 square feet.",
    "The formula for the area of a square is side length squared.",
    "Let's call the side length of the square 's'.",
    "So, s squared equals 144.",
    "To find 's', I need to take the square root of 144.",
    "The square root of 144 is 12."
