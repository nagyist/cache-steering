  "query": "Of the 600 students at River Falls High School, 3/4 of them play tennis. Of those that play tennis, 60% of them also play hockey. How many students play both hockey and tennis?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students at River Falls High School play tennis.",
    "3/4 of the 600 students play tennis.",
    "To find this, I calculate 3/4 of 600.",
    "3/4 of 600 is (3/4) * 600.",
    "I calculate (3 * 600) / 4.",
    "3 * 600 is 1800.",
    "1800 divided by 4 is 450.",
    "Therefore, 450 students play tennis.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these tennis players also play hockey.",
    "60% of the tennis players also play hockey.",
    "I calculate 60% of 450.",
    "60% is equivalent to 0.6.",
    "I calculate 0.6 * 450.",
    "0.6 * 450 is 270."
