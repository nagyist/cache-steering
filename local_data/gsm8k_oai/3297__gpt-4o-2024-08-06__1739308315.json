    "I've been given that Tom rides his bike 30 miles per day for the first 183 days of the year.",
    "To calculate the total miles for the first 183 days, I multiply 30 miles per day by 183 days.",
    "30 miles/day * 183 days = 5490 miles.",
    "The total for the first 183 days is 5490 miles.",
    "There are normally 365 days in a year.",
    "Tom rides 35 miles per day for the rest of the year.",
    "To find the remaining days in the year, I subtract the first 183 days from 365 days.",
    "365 days - 183 days = 182 days remaining.",
    "For these remaining 182 days, Tom rides 35 miles per day.",
    "To find the total miles for these 182 days, I multiply 35 miles per day by 182 days.",
    "35 miles/day * 182 days = 6370 miles.",
    "The total for the remaining days is 6370 miles.",
    "Now, I add up all the miles Tom rides in the year: 5490 miles for the first part of the year plus 6370 miles for the rest.",
    "5490 miles + 6370 miles = 11860 miles."
