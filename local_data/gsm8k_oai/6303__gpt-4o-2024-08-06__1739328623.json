  "query": "At least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue. All of the rest are red, except for 4 that are green. If he has 63 marbles, how many of them are red?",
  "steps": [
    "Fred has a total of 63 marbles.",
    "At least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue.",
    "To find a third of the marbles, divide the total number of marbles by 3: 63 / 3 = 21.",
    "So, at least 21 marbles are dark blue.",
    "Let's assume the minimum number of dark blue marbles, which is 21.",
    "If 21 marbles are dark blue, we subtract these from the total marbles to find how many are left: 63 - 21 = 42 marbles.",
    "According to the problem, all the remaining marbles, except for 4 that are green, are red.",
    "Subtract the 4 green marbles from the remaining marbles: 42 - 4 = 38.",
    "The rest of the marbles are red. So, Fred has 38 red marbles."
