  "query": "Jen buys and sells candy bars. She buys candy bars for 80 cents each and sells them for a dollar each. If she buys 50 candy bars and sells 48 of them, how much profit does she make in cents?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Jen spends to buy the 50 candy bars.",
    "Each candy bar costs 80 cents. So, I multiply 80 cents by 50 bars.",
    "80 * 50 = 4000 cents.",
    "Jen spends 4000 cents to buy 50 candy bars.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much Jen earns from selling 48 candy bars.",
    "Each candy bar is sold for 100 cents (a dollar). So, I multiply 100 cents by 48 bars.",
    "100 * 48 = 4800 cents.",
    "Jen earns 4800 cents from selling 48 candy bars.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between the earnings and the cost.",
    "Profit = Earnings - Cost.",
    "Profit = 4800 cents (earnings) - 4000 cents (cost).",
    "4800 - 4000 = 800.",
    "Jen makes a profit of 800 cents."

  "solution": "800"
