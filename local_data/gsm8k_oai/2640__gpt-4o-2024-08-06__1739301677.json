  "query": "If a rectangle has a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638, how many rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the length of the rectangle using the area formula for a rectangle, which is Area = Width \u00d7 Length.",
    "I know the area is 1638 square inches, and the width is 42 inches. So, I can set up the equation 1638 = 42 \u00d7 Length.",
    "To find the length, I need to divide the area by the width: Length = 1638 / 42.",
    "Calculating the division: 1638 divided by 42 equals 39. So, the length of the rectangle is 39 inches.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many rectangles of this size would reach a total length of 390 inches.",
    "Since the length of one rectangle is 39 inches, I can find the number of rectangles by dividing the total desired length by the length of one rectangle: 390 / 39.",
    "Calculating the division: 390 divided by 39 equals 10.",
    "Therefore, 10 rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches."
