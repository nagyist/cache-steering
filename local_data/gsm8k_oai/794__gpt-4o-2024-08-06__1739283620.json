  "query": "With one mighty blow, Maria cracked open the pinata, and candies spilled all over the floor.  There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies.  If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first determine the number of yellow candies.",
    "We know there are 40 red candies.",
    "The problem states there are 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies.",
    "Three times the number of red candies is \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).",
    "Subtracting 20 from 120 gives \\(120 - 20 = 100\\).",
    "Therefore, there are 100 yellow candies.",
    "Next, we need to determine the number of blue candies.",
    "The problem states there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies.",
    "Half of 100 yellow candies is \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\).",
    "So, there are 50 blue candies.",
    "Now let's calculate the total number of candies before Carlos ate the yellow candies.",
    "We have 40 red candies, 100 yellow candies, and 50 blue candies.",
    "Adding these gives \\(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\\).",
    "Carlos ate all the yellow candies, which means he ate 100 candies.",
    "To find out how many candies remained, we subtract the yellow candies Carlos ate from the total number of candies.",
    "The remaining candies are \\(190 - 100 = 90\\)."
