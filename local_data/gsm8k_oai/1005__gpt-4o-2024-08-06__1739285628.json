  "query": "4 friends went to buy from a clothes shop. Every item was 50% off.  All four friends decided to buy a t-shirt. The original price of the t-shirt was 20 dollars. How much money did they spend in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the discounted price of the t-shirt.",
    "The original price of the t-shirt is 20 dollars.",
    "The discount is 50% off, so I need to calculate 50% of 20 dollars.",
    "50% of 20 dollars is 0.50 * 20 = 10 dollars.",
    "This means the price after the discount is 20 dollars - 10 dollars = 10 dollars.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total amount the 4 friends spent.",
    "Each friend buys one t-shirt, and each t-shirt costs 10 dollars after the discount.",
    "Therefore, the total cost for 4 friends is 4 t-shirts * 10 dollars/t-shirt.",
    "4 * 10 dollars = 40 dollars."

  "solution": "40"
