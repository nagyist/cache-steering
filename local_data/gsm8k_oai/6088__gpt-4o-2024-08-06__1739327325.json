  "query": "Kim has 4 dozen shirts.  She lets her sister have 1/3 of them.  How many shirts does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many shirts Kim has initially.",
    "1 dozen equals 12 shirts.",
    "Kim has 4 dozen shirts, so I need to calculate 4 times 12.",
    "4 times 12 equals 48 shirts.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many shirts Kim gives to her sister.",
    "Kim gives her sister 1/3 of her shirts.",
    "I need to calculate 1/3 of 48 for that.",
    "1/3 times 48 equals 16 shirts.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the shirts given to her sister from the total number of shirts Kim initially had.",
    "48 shirts minus 16 shirts equals 32 shirts."
