  "query": "Tom was putting hardwood flooring into his living room that measured 16' long and 20' wide.  The flooring comes 10 sq ft per box and he has already put down 250 sq ft of flooring.  How many more boxes does Tom need to complete the job?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total area of the living room.",
    "The living room is 16 feet long and 20 feet wide.",
    "To find the total area, I multiply the length by the width.",
    "16 feet x 20 feet = 320 square feet.",
    "Tom has already put down 250 square feet of flooring.",
    "To find out how much more flooring Tom needs to install, I subtract the area already covered from the total area.",
    "320 square feet (total area) - 250 square feet (covered area) = 70 square feet remaining.",
    "Each box of flooring covers 10 square feet.",
    "To find the number of boxes needed to cover the remaining area, I divide the remaining area by the area covered per box.",
    "70 square feet \u00f7 10 square feet per box = 7 boxes."

  "solution": "7"
