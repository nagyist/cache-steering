  "query": "Jon makes 3/4's the salary that Karen makes. John makes $3000 per month. How long will it take him to make the same amount of money that Karen does in 3 months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between Jon's and Karen's salaries. Jon makes 3/4 of what Karen makes.",
    "I know Jon's monthly salary, which is $3000. I need to find Karen's salary. Since Jon makes 3/4 of Karen's salary, I set up the equation: (3/4) * Karen's salary = $3000.",
    "To find Karen's salary, I divide Jon's salary by 3/4. This means Karen's salary = $3000 / (3/4).",
    "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, Karen's salary = $3000 * (4/3).",
    "Calculating that gives Karen's salary = $4000 per month.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much Karen makes in 3 months. If Karen earns $4000 per month, then in 3 months she will make $4000 * 3.",
    "Calculating that, Karen will make $12000 in 3 months.",
    "Jon needs to make $12000 to equal what Karen makes in 3 months. I need to find out how long it will take Jon to earn $12000 given his monthly salary of $3000.",
    "To find the number of months it will take Jon to make $12000, I use the equation: $3000 * number of months = $12000.",
    "I divide $12000 by $3000 to get the number of months. That result is $12000 / $3000 = 4.",
    "Thus, it will take Jon 4 months to earn the same amount that Karen earns in 3 months."
