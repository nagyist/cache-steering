  "query": "A 25 story building has 4 apartments on each floor. If each apartment houses two people, how many people does the building house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many apartments are in the entire building.",
    "Since there are 25 stories in the building, and each story has 4 apartments, I will multiply the number of stories by the number of apartments per story. That's 25 stories times 4 apartments.",
    "25 multiplied by 4 is 100.",
    "Now, I know there are 100 apartments in the building.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people live in these 100 apartments.",
    "Each apartment houses two people, so I will multiply the number of apartments by the number of people per apartment.",
    "So I multiply 100 apartments by 2 people per apartment.",
    "100 multiplied by 2 is 200.",
    "Therefore, the building houses 200 people in total."

  "solution": "200"
