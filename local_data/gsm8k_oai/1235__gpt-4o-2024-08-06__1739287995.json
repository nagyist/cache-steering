  "query": "Penny has $20. Penny buys 4 pairs of socks for $2 a pair and a hat for $7. How much money does Penny have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Penny spends on the socks.",
    "Penny buys 4 pairs of socks at $2 per pair.",
    "Multiplying 4 pairs by $2 per pair gives me a total of $8 spent on socks.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Penny spends on the hat.",
    "The hat costs $7.",
    "Now, I can calculate the total amount Penny spends.",
    "Penny spends $8 on socks plus $7 on the hat.",
    "Adding these amounts gives me $8 + $7 = $15.",
    "Now, I subtract the total spending from Penny's initial amount of money.",
    "Penny started with $20.",
    "Subtracting the total spending ($15) from $20 gives me $5."
