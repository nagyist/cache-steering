  "query": "It takes Jennifer 20 minutes to groom each of her 2 long hair dachshunds.  If she grooms her dogs every day, how many hours does she spend grooming her dogs in 30 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how long it takes for Jennifer to groom one dog.",
    "It takes Jennifer 20 minutes to groom one dog.",
    "Next, determine the total time it takes to groom both dogs in one session.",
    "Since there are 2 dogs, Jennifer spends 20 minutes per dog, so the total time for two dogs is 20 minutes/dog * 2 dogs = 40 minutes.",
    "Now, determine how much time she spends grooming her dogs each day.",
    "She spends 40 minutes grooming both dogs each day.",
    "Calculate the total time spent grooming over 30 days.",
    "Multiply the daily grooming time by the number of days: 40 minutes/day * 30 days = 1200 minutes.",
    "Convert the total time in minutes to hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so divide the total minutes by 60: 1200 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours."

  "solution": "20"
