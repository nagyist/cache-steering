  "query": "Ruth prepared sandwiches. She ate 1 sandwich and gave 2 sandwiches to her brother. Her first cousin arrived and ate 2 sandwiches. Then her two other cousins arrived and ate 1 sandwich each. There were 3 sandwiches left. How many sandwiches did Ruth prepare?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by calculating how many sandwiches Ruth and the others ate in total.",
    "Ruth ate 1 sandwich.",
    "She gave 2 sandwiches to her brother.",
    "Her first cousin ate 2 sandwiches.",
    "Each of her two other cousins ate 1 sandwich.",
    "Summing these amounts: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 equals 7 sandwiches eaten.",
    "There are 3 sandwiches remaining after everyone ate.",
    "To find the total number of sandwiches prepared, add the sandwiches eaten to the sandwiches left: 7 (eaten) + 3 (left) equals 10 sandwiches."
