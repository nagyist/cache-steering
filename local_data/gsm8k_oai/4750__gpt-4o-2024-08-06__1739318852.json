  "query": "Onum Lake has 25 more trout than Boast Pool.   There are 75 fish in Boast Pool.  Riddle Pond has half as many fish as Onum Lake.  What is the average number of fish in all three bodies of water?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many trout are in Onum Lake.",
    "Onum Lake has 25 more trout than Boast Pool.",
    "Boast Pool has 75 fish.",
    "So, the number of trout in Onum Lake is 75 + 25.",
    "That gives Onum Lake 100 trout.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many fish are in Riddle Pond.",
    "Riddle Pond has half as many fish as Onum Lake.",
    "Riddle Pond has 100 / 2 = 50 fish.",
    "Now, I have the number of fish in each body of water:\nBoast Pool: 75 fish\nOnum Lake: 100 fish\nRiddle Pond: 50 fish",
    "I need to find the total number of fish in all three bodies of water.",
    "Total number of fish = 75 + 100 + 50.",
    "This totals to 225 fish.",
    "Now, I need to find the average number of fish in all three bodies of water.",
    "To find the average, divide the total number of fish by the number of bodies of water.",
    "There are 3 bodies of water.",
    "Average number of fish = 225 / 3.",
    "Calculating that gives us 75."
