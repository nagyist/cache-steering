  "query": "The school principal decided that she wanted every class to have an equal number of boys and girls in each first-grade classroom. There are 4 classrooms. There are 56 boys and 44 girls. How many total students are in each classroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students including both boys and girls.",
    "There are 56 boys and 44 girls, so the total number of students is 56 + 44.",
    "Calculating this gives 56 + 44 = 100 students.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many students are to be distributed equally in each of the 4 classrooms.",
    "I have 100 students in total and I want to distribute them into 4 equal groups.",
    "To find the number of students per classroom, I divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 100 \u00f7 4.",
    "Performing the division, 100 \u00f7 4 equals 25.",
    "Therefore, each classroom will have 25 students."

  "solution": "25"
