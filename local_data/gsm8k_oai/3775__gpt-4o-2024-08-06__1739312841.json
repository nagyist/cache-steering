  "query": "Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward on the CoinRun environment. CoinRun's maximum reward is half as much as the maximum ProcGen reward of 240. How much reward did Greg's PPO algorithm get?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the maximum reward on the CoinRun environment first.",
    "I know that the CoinRun's maximum reward is half of the maximum ProcGen reward.",
    "The maximum ProcGen reward is given as 240.",
    "To find CoinRun's maximum reward, I calculate 240 divided by 2.",
    "240 divided by 2 equals 120.",
    "So, the maximum reward for CoinRun is 120.",
    "Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward on CoinRun.",
    "To find 90% of the maximum reward, I need to calculate 90% of 120.",
    "90% can be written as 0.9 in decimal form.",
    "I multiply 120 by 0.9 to find the reward Greg's PPO algorithm got.",
    "120 times 0.9 equals 108."

  "solution": "108"
