  "query": "Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. At the same rate, for how many hours would she need to baby-sit to earn $75?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the hourly rate Alani earns for baby-sitting.",
    "She earned $45 for 3 hours.",

    "I need to divide the desired earnings, $75, by the hourly rate, which is $15 per hour.",
    "$75 divided by $15 per hour equals 5 hours.",
    "I need to check my calculations to make sure they are correct.",
