  "query": "Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day. Since the 500 ml bottles are currently out of stock at the store, she buys a 2-liter bottle of soda instead. If Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day, how long will the 2-liter bottle of soda last? There are 1,000 ml in 1 liter.",
  "steps": [
    "Dana drinks 500 ml of soda each day.",
    "She bought a 2-liter bottle of soda.",
    "There are 1,000 ml in 1 liter, so a 2-liter bottle contains 2 x 1,000 ml = 2,000 ml of soda.",
    "We need to determine how many days 2,000 ml will last if Dana drinks 500 ml per day.",
    "Divide the total amount of soda, 2,000 ml, by the daily consumption, 500 ml/day.",
    "2,000 ml \u00f7 500 ml/day = 4 days."
