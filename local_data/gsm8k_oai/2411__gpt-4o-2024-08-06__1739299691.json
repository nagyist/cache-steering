  "query": "Bo is learning words for the GRE.  He got 800 flashcards.  He knew 20% of the words on them.  He has 40 days to learn the rest.  How many words does he need to learn a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many words Bo already knows.",
    "Bo knows 20% of the 800 words.",
    "To find 20% of 800, I multiply 800 by 0.20.",
    "800 times 0.20 equals 160.",
    "So, Bo already knows 160 words.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many words he needs to learn.",
    "I subtract the number of words he knows from the total number of words.",
    "800 minus 160 equals 640.",
    "Bo needs to learn 640 words.",
    "He has 40 days to learn these words.",
    "I need to find out how many words per day he should learn.",
    "To do this, I divide the number of words he needs to learn by the number of days he has.",
    "640 divided by 40 equals 16.",
    "Bo needs to learn 16 words per day."

  "solution": "16"
