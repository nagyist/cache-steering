  "query": "Rich ran a 24-mile marathon in 3 hours and 36 minutes. On average, how long, in minutes, did it take Rich to run a mile during the race?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time it took Rich to complete the marathon in minutes.",
    "Rich ran for 3 hours and 36 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "Converting the hours to minutes, I calculate 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.",
    "I then add the additional 36 minutes to the 180 minutes.",
    "180 minutes + 36 minutes = 216 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it took Rich to run each mile on average.",
    "Rich ran a total of 24 miles.",
    "I divide the total time in minutes by the number of miles: 216 minutes \u00f7 24 miles.",
    "Performing the division, 216 \u00f7 24 = 9.",
    "This means, on average, it took Rich 9 minutes to run a mile."

  "solution": "9"
