  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the current age of Justin's sister, Jessica.",
    "Justin is 26 years old, and Jessica was 6 years old when Justin was born.",
    "Jessica's current age is 26 (Justin's age) + 6 years = 32 years.",
    "Now, I need to determine the current age of their elder brother, James.",
    "James is 7 years older than Jessica.",
    "James's current age is 32 (Jessica's age) + 7 years = 39 years.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how old James will be in 5 years.",
    "James's age after 5 years will be 39 + 5 = 44 years."
