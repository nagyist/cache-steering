  "query": "Frank and his friends Betty and Bill went to their farm and picked oranges to eat. Betty picked 15 oranges and Bill picked 12 oranges. Frank picked three times the number that Betty and Bill picked combined. Frank then planted 2 seeds from each of his oranges into the ground and waited 20 years for each seed to turn into a beautiful orange tree. If each orange tree contains 5 oranges for Frank's son Philip to pick, how many oranges are there for Philip to pick in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Betty picked 15 oranges.",
    "Bill picked 12 oranges.",
    "Betty and Bill together picked 15 + 12 oranges.",
    "15 + 12 equals 27.",
    "Frank picked three times the number of oranges that Betty and Bill picked combined.",
    "Thus, Frank picked 3 * 27 oranges.",
    "Calculate 3 * 27.",
    "3 * 27 equals 81.",
    "Frank picked 81 oranges.",
    "Frank planted 2 seeds from each of his oranges.",
    "For each of Frank's 81 oranges, he planted 2 seeds.",
    "Calculate 2 seeds per orange for 81 oranges.",
    "2 * 81 equals 162 seeds planted.",
    "Each seed turns into one orange tree after 20 years.",
    "There are 162 seeds, which turn into 162 orange trees.",
    "Each orange tree contains 5 oranges for Philip to pick.",
    "Calculate the total number of oranges by multiplying the number of trees by the number of oranges per tree.",
    "162 orange trees * 5 oranges per tree equals 810 oranges."

  "solution": "810"
