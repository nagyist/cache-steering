  "query": "Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden, who has twice as much as Marcus. How many more pencils does Dana have than Marcus, if Jayden has 20 pencils?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to establish how many pencils Jayden has. According to the problem, Jayden has 20 pencils.",
    "Next, I know that Jayden has twice as many pencils as Marcus. This means I need to find half of Jayden's pencils to get the number of pencils Marcus has.",
    "Calculating half of Jayden's pencils: 20 divided by 2 equals 10. So, Marcus has 10 pencils.",
    "Now, I know that Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden. Since Jayden has 20 pencils, Dana has 20 plus 15.",
    "Adding 20 and 15 gives me 35. Dana has 35 pencils.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many more pencils Dana has than Marcus. Dana has 35 pencils and Marcus has 10 pencils.",
    "Subtracting Marcus's pencils from Dana's gives me 35 minus 10.",
    "Calculating the subtraction yields 25. So, Dana has 25 more pencils than Marcus."
