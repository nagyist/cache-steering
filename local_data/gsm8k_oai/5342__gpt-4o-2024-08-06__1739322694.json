  "query": "Nick hides 10 chocolates in his closet. His brother Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates than Nick hides. Last night, their mom found and took 5 chocolates from Alix. How many more chocolates does Alix have than Nick?",
  "steps": [
    "Nick hides 10 chocolates in his closet.",
    "Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick does.",
    "To find how many chocolates Alix initially hid, multiply 10 by 3.",
    "10 multiplied by 3 is 30. So, Alix initially hid 30 chocolates.",
    "Last night, their mom took 5 chocolates from Alix.",
    "Subtract 5 from the 30 chocolates Alix initially had.",
    "30 minus 5 is 25. So, Alix now has 25 chocolates.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more chocolates Alix has than Nick.",
    "Nick has 10 chocolates, and Alix has 25 chocolates.",
    "The difference between Alix's and Nick's chocolates is 25 minus 10.",
    "25 minus 10 is 15."
