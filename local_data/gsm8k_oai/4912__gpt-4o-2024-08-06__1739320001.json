  "query": "Joey has 30 pages to read for history class tonight. He decided that he would take a break when he finished reading 70% of the pages assigned. How many pages must he read after he takes a break?",
  "steps": [
    "Joey needs to read a total of 30 pages.",
    "He plans to take a break after reading 70% of these pages.",
    "First, we need to calculate what 70% of 30 pages is.",
    "70% as a decimal is 0.70.",
    "Multiplying 30 pages by 0.70 will give us the number of pages Joey reads before taking a break.",
    "30 pages * 0.70 = 21 pages.",
    "Joey reads 21 pages before his break.",
    "To find out how many pages he must read after his break, subtract the pages already read from the total pages.",
    "30 pages - 21 pages = 9 pages."
