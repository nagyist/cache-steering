  "query": "Collin has 25 flowers. Ingrid gives Collin a third of her 33 flowers. If each flower has 4 petals, how many petals does Collin have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Collin starts with 25 flowers.",
    "Ingrid has 33 flowers. To find a third of her flowers, I need to divide 33 by 3.",
    "33 divided by 3 is 11. Ingrid gives Collin 11 flowers.",
    "Collin now has his original 25 flowers plus the 11 flowers from Ingrid.",
    "25 plus 11 equals 36. Collin has 36 flowers in total.",
    "Each flower has 4 petals. To find out how many petals Collin has, I need to multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower.",
    "36 flowers times 4 petals per flower equals 144 petals."
