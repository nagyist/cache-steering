  "query": "Of the 90 people on William's bus, 3/5 were Dutch. Of the 1/2 of the Dutch who were also American, 1/3 got window seats. What's the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how many people on the bus were Dutch.",
    "William's bus has 90 people, and 3/5 of them were Dutch.",
    "To find the number of Dutch people, I'll calculate 3/5 of 90.",
    "3/5 * 90 = (3 * 90) / 5 = 270 / 5 = 54.",
    "There are 54 Dutch people on the bus.",
    "Next, I'll find out how many of these Dutch people are also American.",
    "It's given that 1/2 of the Dutch were also American.",
    "So, I need to calculate 1/2 of 54.",
    "1/2 * 54 = 54 / 2 = 27.",
    "There are 27 Dutch Americans on the bus.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of Dutch Americans who got window seats.",
    "It's given that 1/3 of the Dutch Americans got window seats.",
    "So, I need to calculate 1/3 of 27.",
    "1/3 * 27 = 27 / 3 = 9."
