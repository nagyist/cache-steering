  "query": "Camille saw 3 cardinals and four times as many robins as cardinals while bird watching. She also saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals and 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. How many birds did Camille see?",
  "steps": [
    "Camille saw 3 cardinals.",
    "There are four times as many robins as cardinals.",
    "Calculating the number of robins: 4 times 3 cardinals = 12 robins.",
    "Camille saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals.",
    "Calculating the number of blue jays: 2 times 3 cardinals = 6 blue jays.",
    "Camille saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals.",
    "Calculating three times the number of cardinals: 3 times 3 cardinals = 9.",
    "Adding 1 to the previous step gives us the number of sparrows: 9 + 1 = 10 sparrows.",
    "Adding all the birds together: 3 cardinals + 12 robins + 6 blue jays + 10 sparrows.",
    "Calculating the total number of birds: 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31 birds."
