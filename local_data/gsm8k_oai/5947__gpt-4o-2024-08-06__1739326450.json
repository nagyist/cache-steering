    "Karina was born in 1970.",
    "Karina's current age is 40.",
    "I will calculate the current year by adding 40 to Karina's birth year (1970).",

    "Karina is twice as old as her brother.",
    "Let Karina's brother's current age be x years.",
    "Therefore, Karina's age is 2x.",
    "We know Karina's current age is 40, so 2x = 40.",
    "Now, solve for x: x = 40 / 2.",
    "x = 20.",
    "Karina's brother is 20 years old in 2010.",
    "To find out when he was born, subtract his age from the current year: 2010 - 20.",
    "2010 - 20 = 1990."
