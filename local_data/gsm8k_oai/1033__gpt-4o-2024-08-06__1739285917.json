  "query": "James takes up dancing for fitness.  He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking.  He dances twice a day for .5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week.  He burned 300 calories an hour walking.  How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many calories James burns per hour while dancing. It's stated that he loses twice as many calories per hour dancing as when he was walking.",
    "He burned 300 calories per hour when walking. Therefore, dancing would burn 2 times 300 calories per hour.",
    "Calculating, 2 times 300 equals 600. So, James burns 600 calories per hour dancing.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many hours he dances in a week and how many calories he burns each session.",
    "James dances for 0.5 hours each session and he does this twice a day.",
    "Each day, he dances 0.5 hours times 2, which equals 1 hour of dancing per day.",
    "He dances 4 times a week, so the total hours per week he dances is 1 hour per day times 4 days.",
    "Calculating, 1 hour times 4 days equals 4 hours of dancing each week.",
    "To find out the total calorie burn, I multiply the number of hours he dances per week by the calories burned per hour.",
    "James burns 600 calories per hour and he dances for 4 hours per week.",
    "Therefore, 600 calories per hour times 4 hours equals 2400 calories."

  "solution": "2400"
