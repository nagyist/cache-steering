    "Max attended 40 college courses in 2 years.",
    "Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max in the same period.",
    "To find out how many courses Sid attended, I need to multiply the number of courses Max attended by four.",
    "40 courses (Max) * 4 = 160 courses (Sid).",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of college courses both Max and Sid attended.",
    "I add the number of courses Max attended to the number of courses Sid attended.",
    "40 (Max) + 160 (Sid) = 200"
