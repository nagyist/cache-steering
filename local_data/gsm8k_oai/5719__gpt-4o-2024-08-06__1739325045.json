  "query": "Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley, and Seafoam Valley has two-thirds as many skirts as Azure Valley. If Azure Valley has 60 skirts, how many skirts does Purple Valley have?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many skirts Seafoam Valley has.",
    "According to the problem, Seafoam Valley has two-thirds as many skirts as Azure Valley.",
    "Azure Valley has 60 skirts.",
    "Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60\\).",
    "Calculate \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = 40\\).",
    "So, Seafoam Valley has 40 skirts.",
    "Now I need to find out how many skirts Purple Valley has.",
    "Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley.",
    "Seafoam Valley has 40 skirts.",
    "One-quarter of 40 is calculated as: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40\\).",
    "Calculate \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\\).",
