  "query": "Jerry charges $20 to pierce someone's nose and 50% more to pierce their ears. If he pierces 6 noses and 9 ears, how much money does he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Jerry charges to pierce ears.",
    "Jerry charges $20 for a nose piercing.",
    "He charges 50% more to pierce ears, so I need to calculate 50% of $20.",
    "50% of $20 is $10.",
    "So, he charges $20 + $10 = $30 to pierce ears.",
    "Now, I\u2019ll calculate how much money he makes from piercing noses.",
    "He pierces 6 noses at $20 each.",
    "6 noses x $20 per nose = $120.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll calculate how much money he makes from piercing ears.",
    "He pierces 9 ears at $30 each.",
    "9 ears x $30 per ear = $270.",
    "Finally, I need to add the money made from nose piercings and ear piercings.",
    "$120 (from noses) + $270 (from ears) = $390."

  "solution": "390"
