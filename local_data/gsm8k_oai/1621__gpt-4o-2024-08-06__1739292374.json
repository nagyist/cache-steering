  "query": "At a cafe, the breakfast plate has two eggs and twice as many bacon strips as eggs.  If 14 customers order breakfast plates, how many bacon strips does the cook need to fry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bacon strips are on one breakfast plate.",
    "Each breakfast plate has two eggs.",
    "The number of bacon strips is twice the number of eggs.",
    "Twice as many bacon strips as two eggs means there are 2 * 2 = 4 bacon strips on one plate.",
    "Now, I know there are 4 bacon strips on one breakfast plate.",
    "There are 14 customers, each ordering one breakfast plate.",
    "To find the total number of bacon strips needed, I multiply the number of breakfast plates by the number of bacon strips per plate.",
    "14 breakfast plates * 4 bacon strips per plate = 56 bacon strips."

  "solution": "56"
