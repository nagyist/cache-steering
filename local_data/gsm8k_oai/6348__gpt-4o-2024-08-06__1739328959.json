  "query": "Jill runs a business breeding llamas. Nine of her llamas got pregnant with 1 calf, and 5 of them got pregnant with twins. After they give birth, Jill traded 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas. Then she sells 1/3 of her herd at the market. How many total llamas  (calves and adults) does Jill have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many calves are born to the llamas that got pregnant.",
    "Nine llamas got pregnant with 1 calf each, so they will have a total of 9 calves.",
    "Five llamas got pregnant with twins, so they will have 5 x 2 = 10 calves.",
    "Adding these together, 9 + 10 = 19 calves are born.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many llamas Jill has after she trades 8 calves for 2 adult llamas.",
    "Initially, Jill has her 9 + 5 = 14 adult llamas.",
    "She then has 19 calves after the births.",
    "She trades 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas.",
    "After this trade, she has 19 - 8 = 11 calves remaining.",
    "She gains 2 adult llamas, so she now has 14 + 2 = 16 adult llamas.",
    "The total herd size before selling is 16 adult llamas + 11 calves = 27 llamas.",
    "Jill then sells 1/3 of her herd at the market.",
    "One third of 27 llamas is 27 / 3 = 9 llamas.",
    "After selling these 9 llamas, she has 27 - 9 = 18 llamas left."
