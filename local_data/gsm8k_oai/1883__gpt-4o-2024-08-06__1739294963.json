  "steps": [
    "Jim finds a treasure chest with 100 gold coins in it. This is the first part of the total amount of gold he finds.",
    "He also finds 2 smaller bags. Each smaller bag has half as much gold as the treasure chest.",
    "Half of 100 gold coins is 50 gold coins. This is the amount of gold in one smaller bag.",
    "There are 2 smaller bags, so I need to multiply 50 gold coins by 2 to get the total gold from the smaller bags.",
    "Multiplying gives me 50 gold coins * 2 = 100 gold coins in the two smaller bags.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of gold Jim finds. He finds 100 gold coins from the chest and 100 gold coins from the bags.",
    "100 gold coins + 100 gold coins = 200 gold coins in total.",
    "Jim spends 8 hours scuba diving, so I need to divide the total gold by the number of hours to find out how much gold he finds per hour.",
    "200 gold coins / 8 hours = 25 gold coins per hour."

  "solution": "25"
