  "query": "Aria has twice as many high school credits as Emily, who has twice the number of high school credits as Spencer. If Emily has 20 credits, what's twice the total number of high school credits the three have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many credits Emily has. The problem states that Emily has 20 credits.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many credits Spencer has. The problem states Emily has twice as many credits as Spencer. So, Spencer has half of Emily's credits.",
    "Spencer's credits = 20 credits (Emily) \u00f7 2 = 10 credits.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many credits Aria has. The problem states Aria has twice as many credits as Emily.",
    "Aria's credits = 20 credits (Emily) \u00d7 2 = 40 credits.",
    "Now that I know the number of credits each has: Spencer has 10 credits, Emily has 20 credits, and Aria has 40 credits.",
    "I need to find the total number of credits the three have together.",
    "Total credits = Spencer's credits + Emily's credits + Aria's credits = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 credits.",
    "The problem asks for twice the total number of credits. Therefore, I need to multiply the total number by 2.",
    "Twice the total number of credits = 70 \u00d7 2 = 140."
  ],
  "solution": "140"
