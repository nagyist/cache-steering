  "query": "Tina saved $27 in June, $14 in July, and $21 in August. Then Tina spent $5 on books and $17 on new shoes. How much money does Tina have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Tina saved over the three months.",
    "In June, Tina saved $27.",
    "In July, Tina saved $14.",
    "In August, Tina saved $21.",
    "To find the total savings, I add the amounts for each month: $27 + $14 + $21.",
    "$27 plus $14 equals $41.",
    "$41 plus $21 equals $62.",
    "Tina saved a total of $62.",
    "Now, I need to consider how much money Tina spent.",
    "Tina spent $5 on books.",
    "She also spent $17 on new shoes.",
    "To find the total expenses, I add the amounts spent: $5 + $17.",
    "$5 plus $17 equals $22.",
    "So, Tina spent a total of $22.",
    "Finally, I need to subtract the total expenses from the total savings to find how much money Tina has left: $62 - $22.",
    "$62 minus $22 equals $40."
