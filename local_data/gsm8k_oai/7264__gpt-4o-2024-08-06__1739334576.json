  "query": "The capacity of Karson's home library is 400 books. If he currently has 120 books, how many more books does he have to buy to make his library 90% full?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what 90% of the library's total capacity is.",
    "The total capacity of the library is 400 books.",
    "To find 90% of 400, I need to calculate \\(0.90 \\times 400\\).",
    "Performing the multiplication: \\(0.90 \\times 400 = 360\\).",
    "Therefore, to be 90% full, the library needs to have 360 books.",
    "Karson currently has 120 books.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more books he needs to reach 360 books.",
    "Subtract the current number of books from the target number: \\(360 - 120\\).",
    "Performing the subtraction: \\(360 - 120 = 240\\).",
    "Karson needs to buy 240 more books."

  "solution": "240"
