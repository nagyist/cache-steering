  "query": "In a shop, there is a sale of clothes. Every shirt costs $5, every hat $4, and a pair of jeans $10. How much do you need to pay for three shirts, two pairs of jeans, and four hats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the cost of the shirts. Each shirt costs $5.",
    "There are three shirts to buy.",
    "The total cost for the shirts is 3 shirts * $5 per shirt = $15.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the cost of the jeans. Each pair of jeans costs $10.",
    "There are two pairs of jeans to buy.",
    "The total cost for the jeans is 2 pairs * $10 per pair = $20.",
    "Next, I need to figure out the cost of the hats. Each hat costs $4.",
    "There are four hats to buy.",
    "The total cost for the hats is 4 hats * $4 per hat = $16.",
    "To find the total cost, I need to add up the costs of the shirts, jeans, and hats.",
    "The total cost is $15 (shirts) + $20 (jeans) + $16 (hats).",
    "Adding those amounts gives $15 + $20 + $16 = $51."
