  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate my current age given that I am 4 times older than Billy, who is 4 years old.",
    "If Billy is 4 years old, and I am 4 times older than him, then my current age is 4 * 4 = 16 years old.",
    "Next, to find out how old I was when Billy was born, I subtract Billy's current age from my current age.",
    "My current age is 16 years and Billy's current age is 4 years. So, 16 years - 4 years = 12 years."
