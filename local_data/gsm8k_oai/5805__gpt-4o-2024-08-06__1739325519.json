    "The initial population of Youngsville is 684 people.",
    "The population increased by 25%. To find the increase, I need to calculate 25% of 684.",
    "25% can be expressed as 0.25 in decimal form.",
    "To find 25% of 684, I multiply 684 by 0.25.",
    "684 * 0.25 = 171",
    "The increase in population is 171 people.",
    "To find the new population, I add the increase to the initial population: 684 + 171.",
