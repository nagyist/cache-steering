  "query": "Lucille has to divide the revenue from her business in the ratio of 4:11 for employee salaries and stock purchases, respectively. If she has $3000 as her revenue, calculate the total amount of money she spends on employee salary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I recognize that Lucille's revenue division is represented by a ratio of 4:11.",
    "This ratio is divided into parts where 4 parts are for employee salaries and 11 parts are for stock purchases.",
    "The total parts in this ratio can be calculated as the sum of both parts (4 + 11).",
    "Calculating the total parts, I get 4 + 11 = 15 parts in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much one part is worth in terms of money by using Lucille's total revenue of $3000.",
    "To find the value of one part, I divide $3000 by the total number of parts, which is 15.",
    "Calculating this division, $3000 \u00f7 15 = $200.",
    "Now, I know each part is equivalent to $200.",
    "Since employee salaries correspond to 4 parts, I multiply the value of one part ($200) by 4.",
    "Performing this multiplication, I calculate 4 \u00d7 $200 = $800.",
    "Therefore, the amount of money Lucille spends on employee salaries is $800."

  "solution": "800"
