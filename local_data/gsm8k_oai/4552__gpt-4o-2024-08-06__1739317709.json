  "query": "Millie, Monica, and Marius are taking subjects for school. Millie takes three more subjects than Marius, who takes 4 subjects more than Monica. If Monica took 10 subjects, how many subjects all take altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many subjects Monica takes, which is given as 10 subjects.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of subjects Marius takes. Marius takes 4 more subjects than Monica.",
    "So, Marius takes 10 (Monica's subjects) + 4 = 14 subjects.",
    "Now, I calculate how many subjects Millie takes. Millie takes 3 more subjects than Marius.",
    "So, Millie takes 14 (Marius's subjects) + 3 = 17 subjects.",
    "To find out how many subjects they all take altogether, I add the subjects taken by each person.",
    "Monica takes 10 subjects.",
    "Marius takes 14 subjects.",
    "Millie takes 17 subjects.",
    "Adding these together: 10 (Monica) + 14 (Marius) + 17 (Millie) = 41 subjects."
