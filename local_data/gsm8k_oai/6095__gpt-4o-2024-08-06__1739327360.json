  "query": "Beau\u2019s sons are triplets.  They are 16 years old today.  Three years ago, the sum of his 3 sons\u2019 ages equaled Beau\u2019s age.  How old is Beau today?",
  "steps": [
    "Beau's sons are triplets and 16 years old today.",
    "The age of each son is 16 years old.",
    "To find the total age of the sons today, we calculate 16 + 16 + 16.",
    "16 + 16 + 16 equals 48.",
    "The sum of Beau's sons' ages today is 48.",
    "Three years ago, each son was 3 years younger, so we calculate 16 - 3.",
    "16 - 3 equals 13.",
    "The age of each son three years ago was 13.",
    "The total age of the sons three years ago would be 13 + 13 + 13.",
    "13 + 13 + 13 equals 39.",
    "Three years ago, the sum of his sons' ages equaled Beau's age.",
    "Therefore, Beau's age three years ago was 39.",
    "To find Beau's current age, we add 3 to his age three years ago.",
    "39 + 3 equals 42."
