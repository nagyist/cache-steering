  "query": "Olivia gave William 10 napkins. Amelia also gives William twice the number of napkins Olivia gave him. If William had 15 napkins before, how many napkins does he have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Olivia gave William 10 napkins.",
    "Amelia gives William twice the number of napkins Olivia gave him.",
    "Since Olivia gave William 10 napkins, Amelia will give him 2 times that, which is 2 x 10 = 20 napkins.",
    "William had 15 napkins before receiving napkins from Olivia and Amelia.",
    "To find the total number of napkins William has now, I need to add the napkins he initially had to the ones he received from Olivia and Amelia.",
    "William starts with 15 napkins.",
    "He receives 10 napkins from Olivia, so now he has 15 + 10 = 25 napkins.",
    "He then receives 20 napkins from Amelia, so now he has 25 + 20 = 45 napkins."
