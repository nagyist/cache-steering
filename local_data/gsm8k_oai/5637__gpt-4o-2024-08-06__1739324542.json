  "query": "Mrs. Petersons bought 10 tumblers for $45 each. She paid with five $100 bills. How much change will Mrs. Petersons receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the 10 tumblers.",
    "The cost of each tumbler is $45.",
    "Multiply the cost per tumbler by the number of tumblers: $45 * 10.",
    "$45 * 10 equals $450.",
    "The total cost for 10 tumblers is $450.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Mrs. Petersons paid.",
    "She paid with five $100 bills.",
    "Multiply the number of $100 bills by the value of each bill: 5 * $100.",
    "5 * $100 equals $500.",
    "Mrs. Petersons paid a total of $500.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the change Mrs. Petersons will receive.",
    "Subtract the total cost of the tumblers from the amount paid: $500 - $450.",
    "$500 - $450 equals $50."
