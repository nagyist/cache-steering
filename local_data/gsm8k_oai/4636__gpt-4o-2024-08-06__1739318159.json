  "query": "Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy\u2019s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining the initial number of biscuits Randy had, which is 32.",
    "Calculate the total number of biscuits given to Randy by adding the biscuits from his father and mother: 13 from his father and 15 from his mother.",
    "13 + 15 equals 28. So, Randy received 28 additional biscuits.",
    "Add the biscuits Randy received to the number of biscuits he initially had: 32 + 28.",
    "32 + 28 equals 60. Therefore, Randy now has 60 biscuits in total.",
    "Subtract the biscuits that Randy's brother ate from the total: 60 - 20.",
    "60 - 20 equals 40. So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits."

  "solution": "40"
