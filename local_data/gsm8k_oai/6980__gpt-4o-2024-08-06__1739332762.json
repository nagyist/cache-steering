  "query": "Bill decides to bring donuts to work for a meeting that day.  He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them.  He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry.  When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking.  Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call.  While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts.  Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting.  How many donuts are left in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "Bill starts with 50 donuts.",
    "Bill eats 2 donuts on the ride in.",
    "Now there are 50 - 2 = 48 donuts left.",
    "The secretary takes 4 donuts.",
    "48 - 4 = 44 donuts remain.",
    "Bill's coworkers steal half of the remaining donuts.",
    "Half of 44 is 44 / 2 = 22.",
    "After the coworkers take their share, there are 44 - 22 = 22 donuts left."

  "solution": "22"
