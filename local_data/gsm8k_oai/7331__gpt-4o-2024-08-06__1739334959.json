  "query": "The big bottles of mango juice hold 30 ounces and cost 2700 pesetas each. The small bottles hold 6 ounces and cost 600 pesetas each. How many pesetas would be saved by buying a big bottle instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of small bottles required to equal the volume of one big bottle.",
    "A big bottle holds 30 ounces.",
    "A small bottle holds 6 ounces.",
    "To find the equivalent number of small bottles, I need to divide the volume of the big bottle by the volume of the small bottle.",
    "30 ounces / 6 ounces per small bottle = 5 small bottles are needed to match the volume of one big bottle.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of these 5 small bottles.",
    "One small bottle costs 600 pesetas.",
    "The cost for 5 small bottles is 5 bottles * 600 pesetas per bottle.",
    "The cost of 5 small bottles is 3000 pesetas.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much is saved by buying a big bottle instead of 5 small bottles.",
    "The cost of one big bottle is 2700 pesetas.",
    "The cost of 5 small bottles is 3000 pesetas.",
    "To find the savings, I subtract the cost of the big bottle from the cost of the small bottles.",
    "3000 pesetas - 2700 pesetas = 300 pesetas saved by buying a big bottle."
