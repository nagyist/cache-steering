  "query": "The outdoor scouts went on a hike to see a waterfall. To get to the hike, the club members took 3 cars, 6 taxis and 2 vans. There were 4 people in each car, 6 people in each taxis and 5 people in each van. How many people went on the hike?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total number of people in the cars.",
    "There were 3 cars with 4 people in each car.",
    "Multiplying the number of cars by the number of people per car gives 3 * 4 = 12 people in the cars.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of people in the taxis.",
    "There were 6 taxis with 6 people in each taxi.",
    "Multiplying the number of taxis by the number of people per taxi gives 6 * 6 = 36 people in the taxis.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of people in the vans.",
    "There were 2 vans with 5 people in each van.",
    "Multiplying the number of vans by the number of people per van gives 2 * 5 = 10 people in the vans.",
    "Now, I will add the people from the cars, taxis, and vans to find the total number of people who went on the hike.",
    "Adding together, 12 people from cars, 36 people from taxis, and 10 people from vans gives 12 + 36 + 10.",
    "Performing the addition, 12 + 36 + 10 = 58 people."
