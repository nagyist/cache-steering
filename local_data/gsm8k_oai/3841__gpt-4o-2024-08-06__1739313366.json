  "query": "Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each and 4 shirts for $33 each. She gave $250 to the cashier. So how much change did she take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the pants. Laura bought 2 pairs, each costing $54.",
    "The total cost for the pants is 2 pairs \u00d7 $54 per pair.",
    "Calculating the total cost for the pants: 2 \u00d7 54 = $108.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the shirts. Laura bought 4 shirts, each costing $33.",
    "The total cost for the shirts is 4 shirts \u00d7 $33 per shirt.",
    "Calculating the total cost for the shirts: 4 \u00d7 33 = $132.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of both the pants and the shirts.",
    "The total cost of both pants and shirts is $108 (pants) + $132 (shirts).",
    "Calculating the total cost: $108 + $132 = $240.",
    "Laura gave $250 to the cashier. I need to calculate the change she received.",
    "To find the change, subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she gave: $250 - $240.",
    "Calculating the change: $250 - $240 = $10."
