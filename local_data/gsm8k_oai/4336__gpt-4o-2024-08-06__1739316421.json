  "query": "Running for 2 hours, Jonah burnt 30 calories every hour. How many more calories would he have lost if he would have run for five hours?",
  "steps": [
    "Jonah burns 30 calories for every hour he runs.",
    "He ran for 2 hours.",
    "To calculate the calories burnt in 2 hours, I multiply 30 calories/hour by 2 hours.",
    "30 calories/hour * 2 hours = 60 calories.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many calories Jonah would burn if he ran for 5 hours.",
    "For 5 hours, the calculation is 30 calories/hour * 5 hours.",
    "30 calories/hour * 5 hours = 150 calories.",
    "Now I find the difference in calories burnt between running for 5 hours and 2 hours.",
    "The difference is 150 calories (5 hours) - 60 calories (2 hours).",
    "150 - 60 = 90 calories."
