  "query": "Angela has half as many insects as Jacob does, and Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean. If Dean has 30 insects, how much does Angela have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many insects Jacob has. According to the problem, Jacob has 5 times as many insects as Dean.",
    "I know Dean has 30 insects.",
    "So, I calculate Jacob's insects by multiplying Dean's insects by 5.",
    "30 insects (Dean) * 5 = 150 insects (Jacob)",
    "Next, I need to find out how many insects Angela has.",
    "Angela has half as many insects as Jacob.",
    "I calculate this by dividing Jacob's insects by 2.",
    "150 insects (Jacob) / 2 = 75 insects (Angela)"
  ],
  "solution": "75"
