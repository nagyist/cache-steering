  "query": "Darryl is an inventor who just designed a new machine. He had to pay $3600 for the parts to construct the machine, and $4500 for the patent he applied for once he built it. If the machine sells for $180, how many machines does Darryl need to sell to break even after the costs?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how many machines Darryl needs to sell to break even, I need to calculate the total costs he incurred.",
    "The total cost of constructing the machine is $3600.",
    "The cost of the patent is $4500.",
    "To find the total cost, I need to add the cost of constructing the machine to the patent cost.",
    "Total cost = $3600 + $4500 = $8100.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many machines need to be sold to cover this $8100 cost.",
    "Each machine sells for $180.",
    "To find the number of machines needed to be sold, I divide the total cost by the price of each machine.",
    "Number of machines = $8100 / $180.",
    "Divide $8100 by $180 to get the number of machines.",
    "$8100 \u00f7 $180 = 45."

  "solution": "45"
