  "query": "Martha has 11 butterflies in her collection. She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies. The rest of her butterflies are black. If Martha has 5 black butterflies, how many blue butterflies does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Martha has a total of 11 butterflies.",
    "I am told she has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies.",
    "I also know that Martha has 5 black butterflies.",
    "Let's calculate the number of butterflies that are either blue or yellow by subtracting the black butterflies from the total.",
    "11 total butterflies minus 5 black butterflies equals 6 butterflies that are either blue or yellow.",
    "Let \"y\" be the number of yellow butterflies.",
    "Then, the number of blue butterflies would be \"2y\" since she has twice as many blue as yellow.",
    "The number of blue and yellow butterflies together should equal 6.",
    "So, I set up the equation: y + 2y = 6.",
    "Simplifying that equation gives me 3y = 6.",
    "To find \"y,\" I divide both sides by 3, which gives me y = 2.",
    "If y = 2, then the number of yellow butterflies is 2.",
    "Since the number of blue butterflies is twice the number of yellow butterflies, I multiply the number of yellow butterflies (2) by 2.",
    "Therefore, the number of blue butterflies is 2 * 2 = 4."
