    "Goldie's hourly rate is $5.",
    "Last week, Goldie worked for 20 hours.",
    "To calculate her earnings for last week, I need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked.",
    "Earnings last week = $5/hour * 20 hours = $100.",
    "This week, Goldie worked for 30 hours.",
    "To calculate her earnings for this week, I need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked.",
    "Earnings this week = $5/hour * 30 hours = $150.",
    "Goldie's total earnings for both weeks will be the sum of her earnings from last week and this week.",
    "Total earnings = $100 (last week) + $150 (this week) = $250."
