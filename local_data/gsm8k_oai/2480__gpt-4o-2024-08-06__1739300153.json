  "query": "A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?",
  "steps": [
    "The school needs robes for each of its 30 singers.",
    "The school currently has 12 robes.",
    "To find out how many more robes are needed, I subtract the number of robes the school already has from the total number of robes needed: 30 - 12.",
    "30 - 12 equals 18. So, the school needs to buy 18 more robes.",
    "Each robe costs $2.",
    "To find the total cost of the 18 robes, I multiply the number of robes needed (18) by the cost per robe ($2).",
    "18 times $2 equals $36.",
    "Therefore, the school will spend $36 on the robes."

  "solution": "36"
