  "query": "Beth had 150 students in her 10th-grade class.  The following year 30 more students join.  In her final year, 15 students left.  How many students did Beth have in her class at the end of her final year?",
  "steps": [
    "Beth initially had 150 students in her 10th-grade class.",
    "The following year, 30 more students joined the class.",
    "To find the new total, I need to add the 30 students to the initial 150 students.",
    "150 + 30 is 180. Therefore, after the new students joined, there were 180 students in the class.",
    "In her final year, 15 students left the class.",
    "To find the number of students left, I need to subtract the 15 students who left from the 180 students.",
    "180 - 15 is 165. Therefore, there were 165 students in the class at the end of her final year."

  "solution": "165"
