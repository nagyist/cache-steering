  "query": "Amber is trying to decide if she wants to spend her $7 on candy or chips. She decides to buy the thing that she can get the most of. The bags of candy cost $1 and contain 12 ounces each. The bags of chips are $1.40 and contain 17 ounces each. How many ounces does she get if she buys the item that gives her the most?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate how many bags of candy Amber can buy with her $7.",
    "Each bag of candy costs $1, so Amber can buy $7 / $1 = 7 bags of candy.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many total ounces of candy 7 bags would provide.",
    "Each bag of candy has 12 ounces, so 7 bags would have 7 * 12 = 84 ounces of candy.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many bags of chips Amber can buy with her $7.",
    "Each bag of chips costs $1.40. So, Amber can buy $7 / $1.40 bags of chips.",
    "To make the division easier, I'll divide 7 by 1.4.",
    "7 / 1.4 is equal to 5. So, Amber can buy 5 bags of chips.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many total ounces of chips 5 bags would provide.",
    "Each bag of chips has 17 ounces, so 5 bags would have 5 * 17 = 85 ounces of chips.",
    "Finally, I'll compare the total ounces Amber can get from candy and chips to determine which is more.",
    "Amber can get 84 ounces of candy or 85 ounces of chips.",
    "The chips provide more ounces, so Amber should buy the chips."
