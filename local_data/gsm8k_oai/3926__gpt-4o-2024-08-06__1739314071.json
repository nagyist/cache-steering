  "query": "Fred had 212 sheets of paper. He received another 307 sheets of paper from Jane and gave Charles 156 sheets of paper. How many sheets of paper does Fred have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Fred initially had 212 sheets of paper.",
    "He received another 307 sheets from Jane.",
    "To find the total sheets Fred has after receiving from Jane, I will add 212 and 307.",
    "212 + 307 = 519",
    "Fred now has 519 sheets of paper after receiving from Jane.",
    "Fred gave 156 sheets of paper to Charles.",
    "To find the number of sheets Fred has left, I'll subtract the 156 sheets he gave to Charles from the 519 sheets he had.",
    "519 - 156 = 363",
    "Fred has 363 sheets of paper left."
