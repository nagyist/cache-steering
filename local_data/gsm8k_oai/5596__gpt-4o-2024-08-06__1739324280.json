  "query": "The total number of whales in the sea this year is double what it was last year. If the World Animals Organization predicts that there will be 800 more whales in the sea next year, and the number of whales in the sea last year was 4000, calculate the total number of whales in the sea next year if the predictions are accurate.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the number of whales in the sea this year.",
    "I know that the number of whales this year is double that of last year.",
    "Last year, there were 4000 whales.",
    "So, to find the number of whales this year, I multiply the number from last year by 2.",
    "Whales this year = 4000 * 2 = 8000.",
    "Next, I add the predicted number of new whales for next year to the number of whales this year.",
    "The prediction is that there will be 800 more whales next year.",
    "Adding the predicted increase to this year's total: 8000 + 800 = 8800."

  "solution": "8800"
