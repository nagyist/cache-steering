  "query": "Cary walks 3 miles round-trip to the grocery store, where he buys and eats a candy bar with 200 calories. If Cary burns 150 calories per mile walked, what's Cary's net calorie deficit (expressed as a positive number)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total calories Cary burns by walking.",
    "Cary walks a total of 3 miles.",
    "Cary burns 150 calories per mile.",
    "To find the total calories burned from walking, I multiply the miles walked by the calories burned per mile: 3 miles * 150 calories/mile.",
    "3 miles * 150 calories/mile = 450 calories.",
    "Now, I know that Cary burns a total of 450 calories by walking.",
    "Next, I need to consider the calories Cary consumes by eating the candy bar.",
    "The candy bar has 200 calories.",
    "To find Cary's net calorie deficit, I must subtract the calories consumed from the calories burned.",
    "Calories burned from walking = 450 calories.",
    "Calories consumed from candy bar = 200 calories.",
    "Net calorie deficit = Calories burned - Calories consumed = 450 calories - 200 calories.",
    "450 calories - 200 calories = 250 calories."
  ],
  "solution": "250"
