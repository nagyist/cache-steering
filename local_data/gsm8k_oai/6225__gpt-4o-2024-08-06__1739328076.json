  "query": "Pedro, Linden, and Jesus are playing a game. Jesus has 60 squares. Linden has 75 squares. Pedro has 200. How many more squares does Pedro have than both Jesus and Linden combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of squares that Jesus and Linden have combined.",
    "Jesus has 60 squares and Linden has 75 squares.",
    "I will add the squares of Jesus and Linden together: 60 + 75.",
    "60 + 75 equals 135.",
    "So, Jesus and Linden together have 135 squares.",
    "Now I need to determine how many more squares Pedro has compared to Jesus and Linden combined.",
    "Pedro has 200 squares.",
    "I will subtract the combined total of Jesus and Linden's squares from Pedro's squares: 200 - 135.",
    "200 - 135 equals 65."

  "solution": "65"
