  "query": "Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?",
  "steps": [
    "Sam has a total of 18 cows.",
    "I need to figure out how many of these cows are black.",
    "The problem states that 5 more than half the cows are black.",
    "First, I'll calculate half of Sam's total number of cows. Half of 18 is 18/2, which equals 9.",
    "Now, according to the problem, the number of black cows is 5 more than this half.",
    "9 (half of the cows) plus 5 equals 14. Therefore, there are 14 black cows.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cows are not black.",
    "Out of the 18 total cows, there are 14 that are black.",
    "To find the number of cows that are not black, I subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows. So, 18 - 14 equals 4."
