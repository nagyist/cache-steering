  "steps": [
    "Jennifer starts with ten pears.",
    "Jennifer starts with 20 oranges.",
    "Jennifer has twice as many apples as pears.",
    "Twice as many apples as pears means she has 2 * 10 = 20 apples.",

    "Jennifer gives her sister two oranges.",
    "Jennifer gives her sister two apples.",
    "In total, Jennifer gives her sister 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 fruits.",
    "The number of fruits Jennifer has left is 50 - 6 = 44."
