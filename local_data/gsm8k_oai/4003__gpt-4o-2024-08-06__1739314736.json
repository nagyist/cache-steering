  "query": "Joanna has $8. Compared to her money, her brother has thrice as much while her sister has only half as much. How much money do the three of them have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Joanna has $8.",
    "Joanna's brother has three times as much money as Joanna.",
    "To find out how much Joanna's brother has, I multiply Joanna's amount by 3.",
    "Calculating 8 * 3 gives me $24.",
    "Joanna's brother has $24.",
    "Joanna's sister has half as much money as Joanna.",
    "To find out how much Joanna's sister has, I divide Joanna's amount by 2.",
    "Calculating 8 / 2 gives me $4.",
    "Joanna's sister has $4.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of money all three of them have together.",
    "I add Joanna's, her brother's, and her sister's amounts together: 8 + 24 + 4.",
    "Calculating 8 + 24 + 4 gives me $36.",
    "The total amount of money the three siblings have altogether is $36."
