  "query": "Antonov bought 60 candies. He gave a pack of candy to his sister. If a pack of candy has 20 pieces, how many packs does Antonov still have?",
  "steps": [
    "Antonov initially has 60 candies.",
    "He gives a pack of candy to his sister.",
    "A pack contains 20 pieces.",
    "After giving one pack to his sister, 20 candies are removed from Antonov's collection.",
    "I calculate how many candies Antonov has left: 60 candies - 20 candies = 40 candies.",
    "Each pack contains 20 pieces, so I divide the remaining candies by the number of candies in one pack to determine how many packs he has: 40 candies \u00f7 20 candies per pack = 2 packs."
