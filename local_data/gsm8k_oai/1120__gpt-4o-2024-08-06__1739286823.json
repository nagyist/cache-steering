  "query": "A printing press is printing brochures. The press prints 20 single-page spreads, and twice as many double-page spreads. For each 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads, each of which take up a quarter of a page. The brochures can be arranged in any order as long as they are made up of 5 pages each. How many brochures is the printing press creating?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the number of double-page spreads printed.",
    "The problem states that there are twice as many double-page spreads as single-page spreads.",
    "There are 20 single-page spreads printed.",
    "So, the number of double-page spreads is 2 times 20, which is 40.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of pages printed.",
    "A single-page spread equates to 1 page. Therefore, 20 single-page spreads equal 20 pages.",
    "A double-page spread equates to 2 pages. Therefore, 40 double-page spreads equal 80 pages.",
    "Adding them, the total number of pages for the spreads is 20 + 80 = 100 pages.",
    "For every 4 pages printed for spreads, there is 1 block of ads.",
    "Each block of 4 ads takes up one whole page because they are each a quarter of a page.",
    "The total number of ad pages is thus the total pages for spreads divided by 4.",
    "100 divided by 4 equals 25.",
    "Therefore, there are 25 ad pages.",
    "Next, find the total number of pages including both spreads and ads.",
    "There are 100 pages from the spreads and 25 pages from the ads.",
    "Thus, the total number of pages printed is 100 + 25 = 125 pages.",
    "Each brochure is made up of 5 pages.",
    "The number of brochures is the total number of pages divided by the number of pages per brochure.",
    "125 divided by 5 equals 25."
