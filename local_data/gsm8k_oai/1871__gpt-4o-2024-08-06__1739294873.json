    "I know that there are 30 notebooks on the shelf.",
    "I am told that there are 50 more pens than notebooks.",
    "To find the number of pens, I need to add 50 to the number of notebooks.",
    "There are 30 notebooks, so I will add 50 to 30 to find the number of pens.",
    "30 (notebooks) + 50 = 80 pens.",

    "I will add the number of notebooks and pens together.",
    "30 (notebooks) + 80 (pens) = 110."
