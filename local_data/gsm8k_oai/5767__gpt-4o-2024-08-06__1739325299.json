  "query": "Jefferson has 56 bananas, while Walter, his friend, has 1/4 times fewer bananas. If they decide to combine their bananas and share them equally between themselves, how many bananas does Walter get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that Jefferson has 56 bananas.",
    "Walter has 1/4 times fewer bananas than Jefferson.",
    "To find out how many bananas Walter has, I need to calculate 1/4 of Jefferson's bananas, which is 56.",
    "1/4 of 56 is calculated by dividing 56 by 4.",
    "56 divided by 4 equals 14.",
    "Walter has 56 - 14 bananas, since he has 1/4 times fewer.",
    "56 - 14 equals 42.",
    "Therefore, Walter has 42 bananas.",
    "Now, I add Jefferson's and Walter's bananas together.",
    "Jefferson has 56 bananas, and Walter has 42 bananas.",
    "56 plus 42 equals 98.",
    "They combine their bananas to have a total of 98 bananas.",
    "They decide to share the 98 bananas equally.",
    "I divide 98 by 2 to find out how many bananas each gets.",
    "98 divided by 2 equals 49.",
    "Each person gets 49 bananas."

  "solution": "49"
