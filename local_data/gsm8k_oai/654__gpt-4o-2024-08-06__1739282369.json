  "query": "If there are two pennies in each of the twelve compartments of Roshesmina's piggy bank and she adds 6 more pennies to each compartment, calculate the total number of pennies she has?",
  "steps": [
    "There are initially 2 pennies in each of the 12 compartments.",
    "To find the initial total number of pennies, I need to multiply 2 pennies per compartment by 12 compartments.",
    "2 pennies/compartment * 12 compartments = 24 pennies.",
    "She adds 6 more pennies to each of the 12 compartments.",
    "I need to calculate the number of additional pennies added. This is 6 pennies per compartment times 12 compartments.",
    "6 pennies/compartment * 12 compartments = 72 additional pennies.",
    "To find the new total number of pennies, I need to add the initial number of pennies to the additional pennies.",
    "24 initial pennies + 72 additional pennies = 96 pennies."
