  "query": "Jake's dad can drive the distance from their house to the water park in 30 minutes. He spends half that journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour on the highway. If Jake can bike 11 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to bike to the water park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the total time Jake's dad takes to reach the water park, which is 30 minutes. We need to find out the distance.",
    "He spends half the time at 28 miles per hour and the other half at 60 miles per hour. So he spends 15 minutes (which is 0.25 hours) at each speed.",
    "Let's calculate the distance covered at 28 miles per hour. In 0.25 hours, he drives 28 miles/hour * 0.25 hours = 7 miles.",
    "Now, let's calculate the distance covered at 60 miles per hour. In 0.25 hours, he drives 60 miles/hour * 0.25 hours = 15 miles.",
    "The total distance to the water park is the sum of the two distances: 7 miles + 15 miles = 22 miles.",
    "Now we need to determine how long it will take Jake to bike this distance. He bikes at 11 miles per hour.",
    "To find the time it takes for Jake to bike 22 miles, we use the formula time = distance / speed.",
    "Time = 22 miles / 11 miles per hour = 2 hours."
