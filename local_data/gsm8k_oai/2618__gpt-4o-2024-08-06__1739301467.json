  "query": "Michelle is bringing sandwiches to work to give to her co-workers. She gives 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers and keeps twice this amount for herself. If she had originally made 20 sandwiches, how many sandwiches does she have left to give to her other co-workers?",
  "steps": [
    "Michelle gives 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers.",
    "She keeps twice the amount she gives away for herself. Twice 4 is 8 sandwiches.",
    "She originally made 20 sandwiches, so I need to calculate how many sandwiches are left after she gives 4 away and keeps 8.",
    "Subtract the 4 sandwiches given away from the original 20 sandwiches: 20 - 4 = 16 sandwiches.",
    "Next, subtract the 8 sandwiches she keeps for herself: 16 - 8 = 8 sandwiches.",
    "Michelle has 8 sandwiches left to give to her other co-workers."
