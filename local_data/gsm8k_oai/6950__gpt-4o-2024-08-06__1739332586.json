  "query": "Jerusha earned 4 times as much money as Lottie. Together they earned $85. How many dollars did Jerusha earn? Use L to represent Lottie's earnings.",
  "steps": [
    "Let L represent Lottie's earnings.",
    "Jerusha earned 4 times as much as Lottie, so Jerusha's earnings are represented as 4L.",
    "Together they earned $85, so the equation becomes L + 4L = 85.",
    "Combine like terms: L + 4L = 5L.",
    "This equation now is 5L = 85.",
    "To solve for L, divide both sides by 5: L = 85 / 5.",
    "Calculate 85 divided by 5, which equals 17.",
    "So, Lottie's earnings are $17.",
    "Now calculate Jerusha's earnings by substituting L = 17 into Jerusha's earnings expression, which is 4L.",
    "Jerusha's earnings are 4 * 17.",
    "Calculate 4 * 17, which equals 68."
