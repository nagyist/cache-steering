  "query": "Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment. Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment. If Grant's apartment has 2 rooms, how many rooms does Danielle's apartment have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many rooms Heidi's apartment has. According to the problem, Grant's apartment has 1/9 as many rooms as Heidi's apartment.",
    "I know that Grant's apartment has 2 rooms.",
    "If Grant's apartment is 1/9 the size of Heidi's, then Heidi's apartment must have 2 * 9 = 18 rooms.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many rooms Danielle's apartment has. The problem states that Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's.",
    "Since Heidi has 18 rooms, that means Danielle's apartment must have 18 / 3 = 6 rooms."
