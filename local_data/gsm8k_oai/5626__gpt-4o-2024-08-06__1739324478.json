  "query": "In the last student council election, the winner got 55% of the votes and the loser got the rest. If the school has 2000 students, but only 25% of them voted, how many more votes did the winner get than the loser?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students actually voted. Since 25% of the 2000 students voted, I'll calculate 25% of 2000.",
    "25% of 2000 is calculated as (25/100) * 2000 = 500 students.",
    "Now, I know that 500 students voted in total. The problem states that the winner got 55% of the votes.",
    "To find out how many votes the winner received, I'll calculate 55% of 500.",
    "55% of 500 is calculated as (55/100) * 500 = 275 votes.",
    "The loser would get the remaining votes. Since the total number of votes is 500, the loser gets 500 - 275 = 225 votes.",
    "Now, I have the number of votes both the winner and the loser received: 275 and 225, respectively.",
    "To find out how many more votes the winner got than the loser, I'll subtract the number of votes the loser received from the number of votes the winner received.",
    "275 - 225 = 50 votes.",
    "Therefore, the winner got 50 more votes than the loser."
