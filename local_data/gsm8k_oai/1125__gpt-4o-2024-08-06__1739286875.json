  "query": "Sharon wants to get kitchen supplies. She admired Angela's kitchen supplies which consist of 20 pots, 6 more than three times as many plates as the pots, and half as many cutlery as the plates. Sharon wants to buy half as many pots as Angela, 20 less than three times as many plates as Angela, and twice as much cutlery as Angela. What is the total number of kitchen supplies Sharon wants to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Angela has 20 pots.",
    "Angela has 6 more than three times as many plates as pots. First, calculate three times the pots: 3 * 20 = 60.",
    "Add 6 to get the number of plates Angela has: 60 + 6 = 66.",
    "Angela has half as many cutlery as plates. Calculate half of the plates: 66 / 2 = 33.",
    "Now, for Sharon's kitchen supplies: she wants half as many pots as Angela. Calculate half of Angela's pots: 20 / 2 = 10.",
    "Sharon wants 20 less than three times the plates Angela has. First, calculate three times Angela's plates: 3 * 66 = 198.",
    "Subtract 20 to find the number of plates Sharon wants: 198 - 20 = 178.",
    "Sharon wants twice as much cutlery as Angela. Calculate twice the amount of Angela's cutlery: 2 * 33 = 66.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of kitchen supplies Sharon wants: 10 pots + 178 plates + 66 cutlery.",
    "Add these numbers together: 10 + 178 + 66 = 254."
