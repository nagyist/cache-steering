  "query": "Stella\u2019s antique shop has 3 dolls, 2 clocks and 5 glasses for sale. She sells the dolls for $5 each. The clocks are priced at $15 each. The glasses are priced at $4 each. If she spent $40 to buy everything and she sells all of her merchandise, how much profit will she make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total revenue from selling the dolls. Stella has 3 dolls priced at $5 each.",
    "3 dolls * $5/doll = $15",
    "Now, I will calculate the total revenue from selling the clocks. Stella has 2 clocks priced at $15 each.",
    "2 clocks * $15/clock = $30",
    "Next, I will calculate the total revenue from selling the glasses. Stella has 5 glasses priced at $4 each.",
    "5 glasses * $4/glass = $20",
    "Now, I will sum up the revenues from selling the dolls, clocks, and glasses to find the total sales revenue.",
    "$15 (from dolls) + $30 (from clocks) + $20 (from glasses) = $65",
    "Stella spent $40 to buy all the merchandise. I will subtract her total cost from the total revenue to calculate the profit.",
    "$65 (total revenue) - $40 (total cost) = $25"
  ],
  "solution": "25"
