  "query": "Daragh had 20 stuffed bears. She took out her favorite 8 bears and then equally divided the other bears among her 3 sisters. Daragh's youngest sister, Eden, already had 10 stuffed bears. How many stuffed bears does Eden have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bears are left after Daragh removes her favorite 8 bears from the total of 20 bears.",
    "Subtracting the 8 favorite bears from the total, 20 - 8 = 12 bears remain.",
    "These 12 bears are to be equally divided among Daragh's 3 sisters.",
    "To find how many bears each sister gets, I divide the remaining bears by 3.",
    "12 bears divided by 3 equals 4 bears.",
    "Each sister, including the youngest sister Eden, receives 4 additional bears.",
    "Eden already had 10 stuffed bears before receiving any additional bears from Daragh.",
    "To find the total number of bears Eden now has, I add the 4 new bears to her existing 10 bears.",
    "Eden's total is 10 + 4 = 14 stuffed bears."
