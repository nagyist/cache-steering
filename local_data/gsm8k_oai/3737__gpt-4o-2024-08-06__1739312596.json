  "query": "Patricia has 4 barrels of 7 gallons each. All of them are empty, and there's only one faucet with a flow rate of 3.5 gallons per minute. How many minutes will it take to fill all 4 barrels?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total capacity of the barrels.",
    "Each barrel has a capacity of 7 gallons.",
    "There are 4 barrels.",
    "So, the total capacity is 4 barrels \u00d7 7 gallons/barrel.",
    "Calculating the total capacity: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 gallons.",
    "Next, I need to consider the flow rate of the faucet.",
    "The flow rate is 3.5 gallons per minute.",
    "I need to determine how long it will take to fill 28 gallons with a flow rate of 3.5 gallons per minute.",
    "To find the time, I divide the total gallons by the flow rate.",
    "Divide 28 gallons by 3.5 gallons per minute.",
    "28 \u00f7 3.5 = 8 minutes.",
    "It will take 8 minutes to fill all 4 barrels."

  "solution": "8"
