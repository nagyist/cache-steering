  "query": "Gilbert grows herbs in his yard to use in his cooking. At the beginning of the spring, he planted three basil bushes, a parsley plant, and two kinds of mint. Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds from a flower and made an extra basil plant grow. However, a rabbit came by the garden near the end of spring and ate all the mint. How many herb plants did Gilbert have when spring ended?",
  "steps": [
    "At the beginning of spring, Gilbert planted three basil bushes.",
    "He also planted a parsley plant.",
    "In addition, he planted two kinds of mint.",
    "Halfway through spring, one of the basil plants dropped seeds resulting in an extra basil plant.",
    "This means the number of basil plants increased from 3 to 4.",
    "Near the end of spring, a rabbit came and ate all the mint.",
    "Since there were two kinds of mint, and both were eaten, Gilbert has 0 mint plants left.",
    "Now, let's count the total herb plants Gilbert has: 4 basil plants and 1 parsley plant.",
    "Adding these, Gilbert has 4 + 1 = 5 herb plants when spring ended."
