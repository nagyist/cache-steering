  "query": "Roman the Tavernmaster has $20 worth of gold coins. He sells 3 gold coins to Dorothy. After she pays him, he has $12. How many gold coins does Roman have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Roman originally has $20 worth of gold coins.",
    "After selling 3 gold coins to Dorothy, he has $12.",
    "The difference in gold coins worth is $20 - $12 = $8.",
    "The 3 gold coins sold to Dorothy are worth $8.",
    "This means each gold coin is worth $8 / 3.",
    "Calculating the value of each gold coin: $8 / 3 = $2.67 (approximately).",
    "Roman initially had $20 worth of coins, and knowing each is worth $2.67, we calculate the initial number of coins.",
    "The initial number of gold coins is $20 / $2.67.",
    "Calculating Roman\u2019s initial number of gold coins: $20 / $2.67 \u2248 7.5 coins. (Let's check this assumption since coins should be a whole number).",
    "The error suggests that the nominal value per coin calculation might have been inaccurate over such an arithmetic division since currency in coins can\u2019t be fractional.",
    "Let\u2019s correct to a whole number that fits: If each coin was worth $4, initially $20 / $4 = 5 coins.",
    "When 3 coins are sold: Original 5 - 3 leaves Roman with 2."
