  "query": "Carrie and her mom go to the mall to buy new clothes for school. Carrie buys 4 shirts, 2 pairs of pants, and 2 jackets. Each shirt costs $8. Each pair of pants costs $18. Each jacket costs $60. If Carrie\u2019s mom pays for half of the total cost of all the clothes, how much does Carrie pay for the clothes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the cost of the shirts. Carrie buys 4 shirts, and each shirt costs $8.",
    "The total cost for the shirts is 4 shirts * $8 per shirt = $32.",
    "Next, I will calculate the cost of the pants. Carrie buys 2 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $18.",
    "The total cost for the pants is 2 pairs * $18 per pair = $36.",
    "Now, I will calculate the cost of the jackets. Carrie buys 2 jackets, and each jacket costs $60.",
    "The total cost for the jackets is 2 jackets * $60 per jacket = $120.",
    "Now, I will find the total cost of all the clothes by adding up the costs of the shirts, pants, and jackets.",
    "Total cost = $32 (shirts) + $36 (pants) + $120 (jackets) = $188.",
    "Carrie\u2019s mom pays for half of the total cost. To find out how much Carrie pays, I need to divide the total cost by 2 to find the half that the mom pays.",
    "Half of the total cost is $188 / 2 = $94.",
    "Carrie pays the other half, which is $94."

  "solution": "94"
