    "The baker initially has 10 cheesecakes on display.",
    "Out of these 10, the baker has sold 7 cheesecakes.",
    "To find out how many cheesecakes are left on display, subtract the sold cheesecakes from the original number on display: 10 - 7 = 3.",
    "There are 3 cheesecakes left on display.",
    "In addition to the 3 cheesecakes on display, there are 15 more cheesecakes in the fridge.",
    "To find the total number of cheesecakes left to be sold, add the cheesecakes on display and those in the fridge: 3 + 15 = 18."
