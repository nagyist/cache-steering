  "query": "There are 14 kindergartners and 24 first graders and some second graders in Ms. Watson's class. Overall Ms. Watson has 42 students. How many second graders are in Ms. Watson\u2019s class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of students already counted among the kindergartners and first graders.",
    "There are 14 kindergartners.",
    "There are 24 first graders.",
    "The total number of kindergartners and first graders is 14 + 24.",
    "Calculating that gives me 38.",
    "There are 38 students already counted.",
    "Ms. Watson has a total of 42 students in her class.",
    "To find the number of second graders, I subtract the number of kindergartners and first graders (38) from the total number of students (42).",
    "42 - 38 = 4",
    "Therefore, there are 4 second graders in Ms. Watson\u2019s class."
