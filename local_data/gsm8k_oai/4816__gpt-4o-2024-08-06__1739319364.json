  "query": "Mrs. Crocker made 11 pieces of fried chicken for Lyndee and her friends. If Lyndee only ate one piece but each of her friends got to eat 2 pieces, how many friends did Lyndee have over?",
  "steps": [
    "Lyndee ate 1 piece of fried chicken, reducing the total number of pieces to 11 - 1 = 10 pieces for her friends.",
    "Each friend ate 2 pieces.",
    "To find out how many friends Lyndee had, I need to divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces per friend.",
    "10 pieces of chicken divided by 2 pieces per friend results in 10 / 2 = 5 friends."

  "solution": "5"
