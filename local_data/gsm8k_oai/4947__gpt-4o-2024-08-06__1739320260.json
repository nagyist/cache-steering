  "query": "Tony bought 3 lottery tickets and chose identical numbers on each ticket. He finds out that 5 of the numbers on each lottery ticket are winning numbers. If each winning number is worth $20 then how much money, in dollars, has Tony won in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Tony wins for each winning number.",
    "The problem states that each winning number is worth $20.",
    "Tony has 5 winning numbers on each ticket.",
    "To find the amount won per ticket, I need to multiply the value of each winning number by the number of winning numbers per ticket.",
    "$20 per winning number times 5 winning numbers equals $100 per ticket.",
    "Tony bought 3 tickets, and he has the same winning numbers on each ticket.",
    "I need to multiply the amount won per ticket by the total number of tickets to find the total amount of money won.",
    "$100 per ticket times 3 tickets equals $300 in total winnings."
