  "query": "Kennedy\u2019s car can drive 19 miles per gallon of gas. She was able to drive 15 miles to school, 6 miles to the softball park, 2 miles to a burger restaurant, 4 miles to her friend\u2019s house, and 11 miles home before she ran out of gas. How many gallons of gas did she start with?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total distance Kennedy drove before running out of gas.",
    "Kennedy drove 15 miles to school.",
    "Then she drove 6 miles to the softball park.",
    "Next, she drove 2 miles to the burger restaurant.",
    "After that, she drove 4 miles to her friend's house.",
    "Finally, she drove 11 miles home.",
    "I add all these distances together: 15 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 11.",
    "The total distance is 38 miles.",
    "Kennedy's car drives 19 miles per gallon.",
    "To find out how many gallons of gas she started with, I need to divide the total miles driven by the miles per gallon.",
    "I divide 38 miles by 19 miles per gallon.",
    "38 \u00f7 19 equals 2 gallons."
