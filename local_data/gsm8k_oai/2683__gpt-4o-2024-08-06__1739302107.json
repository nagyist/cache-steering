  "query": "Alexandra bought 8 magazines at the bookstore on Friday. On Saturday, she went back and bought 12 more. Sunday morning, she saw that the store was having a sale and she bought four times the number of magazines she did on Friday. Later that day she discovered that her dog had chewed up 4 of the magazines. How many magazines does she have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many magazines Alexandra bought on Friday.",
    "On Friday, she bought 8 magazines.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many magazines she bought on Saturday.",
    "On Saturday, she bought 12 magazines.",
    "I need to calculate how many magazines she bought on Sunday morning.",
    "On Sunday morning, she bought four times the number of magazines she did on Friday.",
    "That means she bought 4 * 8 = 32 magazines on Sunday morning.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of magazines she bought over the three days.",
    "I will add the magazines bought on each day: 8 (Friday) + 12 (Saturday) + 32 (Sunday).",
    "Calculating this gives 8 + 12 + 32 = 52 magazines.",
    "According to the problem, 4 magazines were chewed up by her dog.",
    "To find out how many magazines she has now, I need to subtract the 4 chewed-up magazines from the 52 magazines she had.",
    "52 - 4 = 48 magazines remaining."

  "solution": "48"
