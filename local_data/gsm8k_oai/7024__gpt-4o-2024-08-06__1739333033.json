  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the rice.",
    "Vicente bought 5 kilograms of rice.",
    "Each kilogram of rice costs $2.",
    "The total cost of the rice is 5 kilograms multiplied by $2 per kilogram.",

    "Each pound of meat costs $5.",
    "The total cost of the meat is 3 pounds multiplied by $5 per pound.",
