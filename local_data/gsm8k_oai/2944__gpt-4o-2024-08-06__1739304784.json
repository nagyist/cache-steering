  "query": "Jane runs 3 kilometers in two hours. What is her speed in meters per minute?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters.",
    "There are 1,000 meters in a kilometer.",
    "So, 3 kilometers is equal to 3 * 1,000 = 3,000 meters.",
    "Next, I need to convert the time from hours to minutes.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "So, 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I have the distance in meters and the time in minutes: 3,000 meters and 120 minutes.",
    "To find the speed in meters per minute, I need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in minutes.",
    "3,000 meters divided by 120 minutes equals 25 meters per minute."

  "solution": "25"
