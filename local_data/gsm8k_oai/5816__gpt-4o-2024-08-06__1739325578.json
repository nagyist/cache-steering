  "query": "If eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, and each movie ticket is sold at $30, calculate the total amount of money Chandler will pay if he buys eight movie tickets and five football game tickets.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total cost of eight movie tickets.",
    "Each movie ticket costs $30.",
    "So, the total cost for eight movie tickets is 8 times $30.",
    "8 times $30 equals $240.",
    "Eight movie tickets cost $240, which is stated as being 2 times the cost of one football game ticket.",
    "Let's denote the cost of one football game ticket as F.",
    "We know that 2 times F equals $240.",
    "So, to find the cost of one football game ticket, I will divide $240 by 2.",
    "$240 divided by 2 equals $120.",
    "Now, I have determined that each football game ticket costs $120.",
    "Chandler buys five football game tickets.",
    "The total cost for the five football game tickets is 5 times $120.",
    "5 times $120 equals $600.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount Chandler will pay for both the eight movie tickets and five football game tickets.",
    "The total amount for the movie tickets is $240.",
    "The total amount for the football game tickets is $600.",
    "I will add these two amounts together to find the total cost.",
    "$240 plus $600 equals $840."

  "solution": "840"
