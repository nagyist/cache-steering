  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the tax amount on the earbuds.",
    "The tax rate is 15%, and the cost of the earbuds is $200.",
    "To find the tax amount, I will calculate 15% of $200.",
    "15% in decimal form is 0.15.",
    "I will multiply $200 by 0.15 to find the tax amount.",
    "$200 * 0.15 = $30.",
    "Now, I need to add this tax amount to the original price to find the total cost after tax.",
    "The original price is $200 and the tax is $30.",
    "$200 + $30 = $230."
