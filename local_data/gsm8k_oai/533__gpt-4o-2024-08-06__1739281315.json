  "query": "There were 100 jelly beans in a bag to be given away on Halloween. Out of the 40 children taking part in the Halloween celebration, 80% were allowed to draw jelly beans from the bag. Each child drew two jelly beans out of the bag. How many jelly beans remained in the bag after the children took their share?",
  "steps": [
    "There were initially 100 jelly beans in the bag.",
    "Out of the 40 children, 80% were allowed to draw jelly beans.",
    "To find 80% of 40 children, calculate 0.8 * 40.",
    "0.8 * 40 = 32 children.",
    "Each of the 32 children drew two jelly beans.",
    "Calculate the total number of jelly beans these children took: 32 children * 2 jelly beans per child = 64 jelly beans.",
    "To find how many jelly beans remained, subtract the number taken from the initial amount: 100 jelly beans - 64 jelly beans.",
    "100 - 64 = 36 jelly beans remain in the bag."
