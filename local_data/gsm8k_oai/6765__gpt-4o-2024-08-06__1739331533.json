  "query": "Hunter saw 5 frogs sitting on top lily pads in the pond. Three more frogs climbed out of the water onto logs floating in the pond. Then two dozen baby frogs hopped onto a big rock jutting out from the pond.  How many frogs did Hunter see in the pond?",
  "steps": [
    "Hunter initially saw 5 frogs sitting on lily pads.",
    "Next, 3 more frogs climbed onto logs in the pond.",
    "So far, Hunter has seen 5 + 3 frogs.",
    "5 + 3 = 8 frogs.",
    "Then, 24 baby frogs hopped onto a big rock in the pond.",
    "Adding these, Hunter sees 8 + 24 frogs.",
    "8 + 24 = 32 frogs."
