  "query": "James was 2/3s as tall as his uncle who is 72 inches. He gets a growth spurt that makes him gain 10 inches.  How much taller is his uncle than James now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how tall James was before the growth spurt. James was 2/3 as tall as his uncle.",
    "James's uncle is 72 inches tall.",
    "To find 2/3 of 72, calculate: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 72 \\).",
    "\\( 72 \\div 3 = 24 \\).",
    "Then multiply 24 by 2 to find James's original height: \\( 24 \\times 2 = 48 \\).",
    "So, James was originally 48 inches tall.",
    "Next, add the 10 inches he grew from the growth spurt to his original height.",
    "James's new height is \\( 48 + 10 = 58 \\) inches.",
    "Now, find out how much taller his uncle is than James now.",
    "The uncle is 72 inches tall, and James is now 58 inches tall.",
    "Subtract James's height from his uncle's height: \\( 72 - 58 \\).",
    "\\( 72 - 58 = 14 \\)."

  "solution": "14"
