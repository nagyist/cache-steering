  "query": "Miss Walter has 50 gold stickers. She also has twice as many silver stickers as gold stickers, and 20 fewer bronze stickers than silver stickers.  She wants to give the same number of stickers to each of her 5 students. How many stickers will each student receive?",
  "steps": [
    "Miss Walter has 50 gold stickers.",
    "Miss Walter has twice as many silver stickers as gold stickers.",
    "Twice the number of gold stickers is 50 * 2 = 100 silver stickers.",
    "Miss Walter has 20 fewer bronze stickers than silver stickers.",
    "Subtracting 20 from the number of silver stickers gives 100 - 20 = 80 bronze stickers.",
    "Now, add the total number of gold, silver, and bronze stickers.",
    "Gold: 50 stickers, Silver: 100 stickers, Bronze: 80 stickers.",
    "Total number of stickers = 50 + 100 + 80",
    "Adding these together, we get 50 + 100 = 150. Then, 150 + 80 = 230 stickers.",
    "There are 5 students, and Miss Walter wants to give the same number of stickers to each student.",
    "We need to divide the total number of stickers by the number of students, i.e., 230 \u00f7 5.",
    "230 divided by 5 equals 46."

  "solution": "46"
