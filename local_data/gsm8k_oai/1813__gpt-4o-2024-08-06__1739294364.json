  "query": "Carrie harvested 200 tomatoes and 350 carrots on her farm. If she can sell a tomato for $1 and a carrot for $1.50, how much money can she make if she sells all of her tomatoes and carrots?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Carrie can make from selling the tomatoes.",
    "She harvested 200 tomatoes, and each tomato sells for $1.",
    "To find the total revenue from the tomatoes, I multiply the number of tomatoes by the price per tomato: 200 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $200.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much money Carrie can make from selling the carrots.",
    "She harvested 350 carrots, and each carrot sells for $1.50.",
    "To find the total revenue from the carrots, I multiply the number of carrots by the price per carrot: 350 carrots * $1.50/carrot.",
    "350 * 1.50 = 525. So, Carrie makes $525 from the carrots.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of money Carrie can make from selling both the tomatoes and the carrots.",
    "I add the revenue from the tomatoes to the revenue from the carrots: $200 (from tomatoes) + $525 (from carrots) = $725."
  ],
  "solution": "725"
