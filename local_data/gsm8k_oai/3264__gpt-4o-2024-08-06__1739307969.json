  "query": "Sammy has 8 gifts to wrap. Each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon. Unfortunately, she has no available ribbon so Tom let her use his 15-meter long ribbon. How many meters of ribbon will be left from Tom's ribbon?",
  "steps": [
    "Sammy needs to wrap 8 gifts.",
    "Each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon.",
    "So, I need to calculate the total ribbon required for 8 gifts.",
    "Multiplying 8 gifts by 1.5 meters per gift gives me 8 * 1.5 = 12 meters of ribbon needed.",
    "Tom allowed Sammy to use his ribbon which is 15 meters long.",
    "Sammy needs 12 meters, so I will subtract the 12 meters from the 15 meters Tom has.",
    "15 meters - 12 meters = 3 meters.",
    "Therefore, 3 meters of ribbon will be left after Sammy wraps the gifts."

  "solution": "3"
