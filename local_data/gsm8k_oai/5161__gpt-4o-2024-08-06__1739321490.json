  "query": "Smaug the dragon hoards 100 gold coins, 60 silver coins, and 33 copper coins. If each silver coin is worth 8 copper coins, and each gold coin is worth 3 silver coins, what is the total value of Smaug's hoard expressed as a number of copper coins?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the value of the gold coins in terms of copper coins.",
    "I know each gold coin is worth 3 silver coins.",
    "I also know each silver coin is worth 8 copper coins.",
    "This means each gold coin is worth 3 silver coins * 8 copper coins/silver coin = 24 copper coins.",
    "Smaug has 100 gold coins. So the total value of the gold coins in copper coins is 100 gold coins * 24 copper coins/gold coin = 2400 copper coins.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the value of the silver coins in terms of copper coins.",
    "Smaug has 60 silver coins.",
    "Each silver coin is worth 8 copper coins.",
    "Therefore, the total value of the silver coins in copper coins is 60 silver coins * 8 copper coins/silver coin = 480 copper coins.",
    "Now, I have to add the value of the copper coins Smaug already has.",
    "Smaug has 33 copper coins.",
    "Adding the value of the gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins together gives: 2400 copper coins + 480 copper coins + 33 copper coins.",
    "Calculating this gives: 2913 copper coins."

  "solution": "2913"
