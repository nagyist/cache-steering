  "query": "A Moroccan restaurant received 3 different shipments of couscous. The first two shipments of 7 and 13 pounds arrived on the same day. The next day's shipment was 45 pounds of couscous. If it takes 5 pounds of couscous to make a dish, how many dishes did the restaurant make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total amount of couscous received in the three shipments.",
    "The first shipment was 7 pounds.",
    "The second shipment was 13 pounds.",
    "The third shipment was 45 pounds.",
    "I need to add these amounts together to find the total amount of couscous: 7 + 13 + 45.",
    "7 + 13 = 20 pounds.",
    "Now, adding the third shipment: 20 + 45.",
    "20 + 45 = 65 pounds.",
    "The restaurant has a total of 65 pounds of couscous.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many dishes the restaurant can make.",
    "Each dish requires 5 pounds of couscous.",
    "I need to divide the total couscous by the amount needed for one dish: 65 \u00f7 5.",
    "65 \u00f7 5 = 13.",
    "The restaurant can make 13 dishes."

  "solution": "13"
