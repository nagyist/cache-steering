  "query": "There are 325 students in a local high school.  40 percent of the students have glasses, how many students do not have glasses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of students that have glasses.",
    "I know that 40 percent of the students have glasses.",
    "There are 325 students in total.",
    "I will calculate 40 percent of 325.",
    "40 percent as a decimal is 0.40.",
    "I will multiply 325 by 0.40 to find the number of students with glasses.",
    "325 * 0.40 = 130",
    "130 students have glasses.",
    "Next, I need to find how many students do not have glasses.",
    "I will subtract the number of students with glasses from the total number of students.",
    "325 - 130 = 195",
    "There are 195 students who do not have glasses."
