  "query": "Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice. He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it. How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark has to let the bread rise for 120 minutes the first time.",
    "Mark has to let the bread rise for another 120 minutes the second time.",
    "The total time for the two rising phases is 120 minutes + 120 minutes.",
    "120 minutes + 120 minutes equals 240 minutes.",
    "Next, Mark spends 10 minutes kneading the bread.",
    "Then, Mark spends 30 minutes baking the bread.",
    "To find the total time, I need to add the two rising phases, kneading, and baking times together.",
    "240 minutes (rising) + 10 minutes (kneading) + 30 minutes (baking) equals 280 minutes."

  "solution": "280"
