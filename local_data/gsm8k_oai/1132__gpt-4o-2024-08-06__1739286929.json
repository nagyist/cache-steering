    "The original number of employees in the factory was 852.",
    "25% more workers have been hired, so I need to calculate 25% of 852.",
    "To find 25% of 852, I calculate 0.25 * 852.",
    "0.25 * 852 = 213.",
    "Now, I need to add the newly hired workers to the original number of employees.",
    "852 + 213 = 1065."
