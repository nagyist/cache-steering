  "query": "Martha needs to paint all four walls in her 12 foot by 16 foot kitchen, which has 10 foot high ceilings. Each wall needs one coat of primer and two coats of paint. If Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour, how many hours will it take her to paint the kitchen?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total area of the walls that Martha needs to paint.",
    "The kitchen has four walls. Two walls will have dimensions of 12 feet by 10 feet, and the other two walls will have dimensions of 16 feet by 10 feet because the ceiling is 10 feet high.",
    "I'll calculate the area of the two 12-foot by 10-foot walls first. The area of one such wall is 12 feet * 10 feet = 120 square feet.",
    "Since there are two walls of this size, their total area is 2 * 120 = 240 square feet.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the area of the two 16-foot by 10-foot walls. The area of one such wall is 16 feet * 10 feet = 160 square feet.",
    "Since there are two walls of this size, their total area is 2 * 160 = 320 square feet.",
    "Now, I'll add the areas of all four walls together: 240 square feet + 320 square feet = 560 square feet.",
    "Martha needs to apply one coat of primer and two coats of paint on the walls, making a total of three coats.",
    "The total area that needs to be covered with paint would therefore be 560 square feet * 3 coats = 1680 square feet.",
    "Martha can paint 40 square feet per hour, so I need to calculate how many hours it takes to paint 1680 square feet.",
    "I'll divide the total square feet by the painting rate: 1680 square feet \u00f7 40 square feet/hour = 42 hours."
