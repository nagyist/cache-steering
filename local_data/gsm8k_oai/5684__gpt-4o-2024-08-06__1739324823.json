  "query": "The kindergartners each need to bring one mini tissue box to class for the school year.  There are three kindergartner groups with 9, 10, and 11 students respectively.  Each mini tissue box contains 40 tissues.  How many tissues do the kindergartner groups bring together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of kindergartners by adding the students in each group.",
    "The first group has 9 students.",
    "The second group has 10 students.",
    "The third group has 11 students.",
    "Add these numbers together: 9 + 10 + 11.",
    "9 + 10 is 19.",
    "19 + 11 is 30.",
    "There are 30 kindergartners in total.",
    "Each kindergartner brings one mini tissue box.",
    "Each mini tissue box contains 40 tissues.",
    "Calculate the total number of tissues by multiplying the number of kindergartners by the number of tissues per box: 30 * 40.",
    "30 multiplied by 40 is equal to 1200."
