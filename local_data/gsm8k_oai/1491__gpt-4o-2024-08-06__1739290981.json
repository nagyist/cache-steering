  "query": "Mr Julien's store has 400 marbles remaining after the previous day's sales. Twenty customers came into the store, and each bought 15 marbles. How many marbles remain in the store?",
  "steps": [
    "Mr Julien's store originally has 400 marbles.",
    "There are 20 customers who each buy 15 marbles.",
    "To find out how many marbles were sold, I need to multiply the number of customers by the number of marbles each bought.",
    "20 customers x 15 marbles each = 300 marbles sold.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the number of marbles sold from the original number of marbles to find out how many remain.",
    "400 marbles initially - 300 marbles sold = 100 marbles remaining."

  "solution": "100"
