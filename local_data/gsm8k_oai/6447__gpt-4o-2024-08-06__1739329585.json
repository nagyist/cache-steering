  "query": "A fruit stand is selling apples for $2 each. Emmy has $200 while Gerry has $100. If they want to buy apples, how many apples can Emmy and Gerry buy altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many apples Emmy can buy with her $200.",
    "Each apple costs $2, so to find out how many apples Emmy can buy, I divide her total money by the cost per apple.",
    "$200 divided by $2 per apple equals 100 apples.",
    "Now I need to determine how many apples Gerry can buy with his $100.",
    "Similarly, I divide Gerry's total money by the cost per apple.",
    "$100 divided by $2 per apple equals 50 apples.",
    "To find out how many apples Emmy and Gerry can buy altogether, I need to add the number of apples each can purchase.",
    "Emmy can buy 100 apples, and Gerry can buy 50 apples, so together they can buy 100 + 50 apples.",
    "100 plus 50 equals 150 apples."
