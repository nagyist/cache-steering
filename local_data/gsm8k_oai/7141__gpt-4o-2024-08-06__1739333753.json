  "query": "Normally Ann can frost a cake in 5 minutes. However, today she has a sprained wrist and it takes her 8 minutes to frost a cake. How much longer would it take her to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how long it would normally take Ann to frost 10 cakes.",
    "It normally takes her 5 minutes to frost one cake.",
    "So, for 10 cakes, it would normally take her 5 minutes per cake times 10 cakes.",
    "5 minutes/cake * 10 cakes = 50 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it takes her to frost 10 cakes with her sprained wrist.",
    "With her sprained wrist, it takes her 8 minutes to frost one cake.",
    "So, for 10 cakes, it would take her 8 minutes per cake times 10 cakes.",
    "8 minutes/cake * 10 cakes = 80 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much longer it takes her now compared to normal.",
    "It normally takes her 50 minutes, and with the sprained wrist, it takes her 80 minutes.",
    "The difference is 80 minutes - 50 minutes.",
    "80 minutes - 50 minutes = 30 minutes."
