  "query": "Stacy has 2 more than triple as many berries as Steve. Steve has one half as many berries as Skylar. If Skylar has 20 berries, how many berries does Stacy have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by determining how many berries Steve has. We know that Skylar has 20 berries.",
    "According to the problem, Steve has one half as many berries as Skylar.",
    "So, if Skylar has 20 berries, then Steve has \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) berries.",
    "Next, we need to find out how many berries Stacy has. Stacy has 2 more than triple the number of berries Steve has.",
    "First, let's find triple the number of berries Steve has: \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\).",
    "Adding 2 more berries to that, Stacy has \\( 30 + 2 = 32 \\) berries."
