  "query": "The world record for longest fingernails is 26 inches. Sandy, who just turned 12 this month, has a goal for tying the record. Her fingernails are 2 inches long. Her fingernails grow at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per month. How old will she be when she achieves the world record?",
  "steps": [
    "Sandy's current age is 12 years.",
    "Her current fingernail length is 2 inches.",
    "The target fingernail length is 26 inches.",
    "The difference between the target length and her current length is 26 inches - 2 inches = 24 inches.",
    "Her fingernail growth rate is one-tenth of an inch per month.",
    "To find out how many months it will take to grow 24 inches, I need to divide the length difference by the growth rate: 24 inches / (0.1 inches per month) = 240 months.",
    "I need to convert the number of months into years. There are 12 months in a year, so I divide 240 months by 12 months per year.",
    "240 months / 12 months per year = 20 years.",
    "Sandy needs an additional 20 years to achieve the record.",
    "Sandy is currently 12 years old, so in 20 years, she will be 12 + 20 = 32 years old."
