  "query": "Nathan bought one large box of bananas. He saw that there are six bunches with eight bananas in a bunch and five bunches with seven bananas in a bunch. How many bananas did Nathan have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many bananas are in the six bunches with eight bananas each.",
    "Each of the six bunches has 8 bananas.",
    "To find the total number of bananas in these six bunches, I multiply 6 by 8.",
    "6 x 8 = 48",
    "So, there are 48 bananas in the six bunches with eight bananas each.",
    "Next, I will find out how many bananas are in the five bunches with seven bananas each.",
    "Each of the five bunches has 7 bananas.",
    "To find the total number of bananas in these five bunches, I multiply 5 by 7.",
    "5 x 7 = 35",
    "So, there are 35 bananas in the five bunches with seven bananas each.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of bananas Nathan has.",
    "I add the number of bananas in both groups of bunches.",
    "48 (bananas from the first group) + 35 (bananas from the second group) = 83",
    "Nathan has a total of 83 bananas."

  "solution": "83"
