  "query": "The total number of books on four shelves, with 400 books each, is the same as the distance in miles that Karen bikes back to her home from the library. Calculate the total distance that Karen covers if she bikes from her home to the library and back.",
  "steps": [
    "I know that each shelf has 400 books.",
    "There are four shelves, each with 400 books.",
    "To find the total number of books on the shelves, I need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf.",
    "I calculate 4 shelves * 400 books per shelf = 1600 books.",
    "The total number of books, 1600, is the distance in miles that Karen bikes from the library to her home.",
    "Karen bikes the same distance from her home to the library, making the trip to the library another 1600 miles.",
    "To find the total distance Karen covers, I add the distances for the round trip.",
    "So, the total distance is 1600 miles to the library + 1600 miles back home.",
    "The sum is 3200 miles."

  "solution": "3200"
