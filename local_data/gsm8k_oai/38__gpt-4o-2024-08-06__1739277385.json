  "query": "Artemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the tea to water ratio that Artemis uses.",
    "For her mom's 8-ounce cup of tea, she uses 1 ounce of tea.",
    "This implies a ratio of 1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of water.",
    "Artemis needs to make 6-ounce cups of tea for each of the 12 people at the party.",
    "First, calculate the total amount of water needed.",
    "Each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, so for 12 people, that's 12 * 6 = 72 ounces of water.",
    "Using the ratio, for every 8 ounces of water, 1 ounce of tea is needed.",
    "I calculate the tea needed for 72 ounces of water using the ratio: 72 ounces of water / 8 ounces of water per 1 ounce of tea.",
    "72 / 8 = 9 ounces of tea."
