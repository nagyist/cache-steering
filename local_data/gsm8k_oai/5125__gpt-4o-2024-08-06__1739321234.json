  "query": "Jonathan ran 7.5 kilometers. Mercedes ran twice that distance and Davonte ran 2 kilometers farther than Mercedes. How many kilometers did Mercedes and Davonte run in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how far Mercedes ran. It's given that Mercedes ran twice the distance Jonathan ran.",
    "Jonathan ran 7.5 kilometers, so I need to calculate 7.5 km times 2.",
    "7.5 km times 2 equals 15 kilometers. Therefore, Mercedes ran 15 kilometers.",
    "Next, I need to determine how far Davonte ran. It's stated that Davonte ran 2 kilometers farther than Mercedes.",
    "Mercedes ran 15 kilometers, so Davonte ran 15 kilometers plus 2 kilometers.",
    "15 kilometers plus 2 kilometers equals 17 kilometers. Thus, Davonte ran 17 kilometers.",
    "The question asks for the total distance run by Mercedes and Davonte combined.",
    "I need to add the distances run by both Mercedes and Davonte, which are 15 kilometers and 17 kilometers respectively.",
    "15 kilometers plus 17 kilometers equals 32 kilometers."

  "solution": "32"
