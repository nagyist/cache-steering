  "query": "At the Taylor family reunion, there were 45 kids and 123 adults. When they sat down to eat, there were 14 tables. How many people sat at each table?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of people at the family reunion.",
    "There were 45 kids and 123 adults.",
    "So, the total number of people is 45 + 123.",
    "I calculate 45 + 123 to get the total number of people.",
    "45 + 123 equals 168.",
    "Now I know that there are 168 people in total.",
    "There were 14 tables available for the people to sit at.",
    "To find out how many people sat at each table, I need to divide the total number of people by the number of tables.",
    "I will divide 168 by 14.",
    "168 divided by 14 equals 12.",
    "Therefore, 12 people sat at each table."
