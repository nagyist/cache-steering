    "Darma can eat 20 peanuts in 15 seconds.",
    "6 minutes is equal to 6 * 60 seconds, which is 360 seconds.",
    "I need to determine how many 15-second intervals fit into 360 seconds.",
    "I divide 360 by 15, which is 24.",
    "Darma can eat 20 peanuts in each 15-second interval.",
    "If there are 24 intervals of 15 seconds in 360 seconds, and Darma eats 20 peanuts per interval, I multiply 24 by 20.",
    "24 * 20 equals 480."
