  "query": "Mark realizes that a lot of the friends on his friends list are people he doesn't talk to anymore.  He keeps 40% of his friends list and then contacts the rest.  Of those only 50% respond.  He removes everyone who did not respond.  If he had 100 friends how many does he have left after the removal?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark starts with 100 friends.",
    "He keeps 40% of his friends list.",
    "40% of 100 is 0.40 * 100 = 40 friends.",
    "He contacts the remaining friends, which is 100 - 40 = 60 friends.",
    "Of those contacted, only 50% respond.",
    "50% of 60 friends is 0.50 * 60 = 30 friends.",
    "Mark removes the friends who did not respond. He gets responses from 30 friends.",
    "The total number of friends left is the friends he kept plus those who responded, which is 40 + 30 = 70 friends."
