  "query": "An avant-garde sushi house sells jellyfish for a certain amount and eel for nine times that amount. If the combined cost of one order each kind of sushi is $200, how much does the eel cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's introduce a variable to help us solve the problem. Let x be the cost of one order of jellyfish.",
    "According to the problem, the cost of one order of eel is nine times the cost of jellyfish. Therefore, the cost of one order of eel is 9x.",
    "The combined cost of one order of jellyfish and one order of eel is given as $200.",
    "We can set up the equation for the total cost: x + 9x = 200.",
    "Simplify the equation: 10x = 200.",
    "Solve for x by dividing both sides by 10: x = 200 / 10.",
    "Calculate the value of x: x = 20.",
    "Now that we know the cost of one order of jellyfish is $20, we can find the cost of one order of eel.",
    "The cost of one order of eel is 9 times the cost of jellyfish, so calculate 9 * 20.",
    "9 * 20 = 180."

  "solution": "180"
