  "query": "Mrs. Dunbar was creating floral arrangements for her niece's wedding.  She needed to make 5 bouquets and 7 table decorations.  She uses 12 white roses in each table decoration and 5 white roses in each bouquet.  How many white roses in total does she need to complete all bouquets and table decorations?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the quantities involved for each type of arrangement: bouquets and table decorations.",
    "Mrs. Dunbar is making a total of 5 bouquets.",
    "Each bouquet requires 5 white roses.",
    "Now I calculate the total number of white roses needed for the bouquets.",
    "5 bouquets \u00d7 5 white roses per bouquet = 25 white roses.",
    "Next, Mrs. Dunbar is creating 7 table decorations.",
    "Each table decoration requires 12 white roses.",
    "Now I calculate the total number of white roses needed for the table decorations.",
    "7 table decorations \u00d7 12 white roses per table decoration = 84 white roses.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of white roses required for both bouquets and table decorations.",
    "I add the roses needed for the bouquets and the roses needed for the table decorations.",
    "25 white roses (bouquets) + 84 white roses (table decorations) = 109 white roses."
