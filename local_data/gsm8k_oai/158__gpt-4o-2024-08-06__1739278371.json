  "query": "Jerome is taking a 150-mile bicycle trip. He wants to ride 12 miles for 12 days. How long will he ride on the 13th day to finish his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerome's goal is to complete a 150-mile bicycle trip.",
    "He plans to ride 12 miles each day for 12 days.",
    "First, calculate the total distance Jerome will cover in 12 days.",
    "Multiply the number of miles he plans to ride each day by the number of days: 12 miles/day * 12 days = 144 miles.",
    "So, in 12 days, Jerome will have ridden 144 miles.",
    "Next, determine how many miles he still needs to ride to reach his 150-mile goal.",
    "Subtract the total miles covered in 12 days from the goal: 150 miles - 144 miles = 6 miles.",
    "Therefore, on the 13th day, Jerome needs to ride 6 miles to reach his goal of 150 miles."
