  "query": "A family is going to the amusement park. The adult tickets cost $22 for admission, and the tickets for children cost $7. The family consists of 2 adults and 2 children. What is the total price the family will pay for admission?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the adult tickets.",
    "There are 2 adults, and each adult ticket costs $22.",
    "So, I multiply 2 (adults) by $22 (cost per adult ticket).",
    "2 * $22 = $44",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the children's tickets.",
    "There are 2 children, and each children's ticket costs $7.",
    "So, I multiply 2 (children) by $7 (cost per children's ticket).",
    "2 * $7 = $14",
    "Now, I add the total cost of adult tickets and children's tickets together.",
    "$44 (adult tickets) + $14 (children's tickets)",
    "$44 + $14 = $58"
  ],
  "solution": "58"
