  "query": "Tom decided to go on a trip. During this trip, he needs to cross a lake, which in one direction takes 4 hours. During this time, Tom needs an assistant to help him with the crossing. Hiring an assistant costs $10 per hour. How much would Tom have to pay for help with crossing the lake back and forth?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, I need to consider the total duration Tom needs assistance for crossing the lake.",
    "First, let's consider the time it takes to cross the lake in one direction. It's given that crossing the lake takes 4 hours one way.",
    "Since Tom needs to cross the lake both ways (back and forth), I need to consider both the forward and return trips.",
    "The forward trip takes 4 hours, and the return trip also takes 4 hours.",
    "So, the total time for both trips is 4 hours (one way) + 4 hours (return) = 8 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of hiring an assistant for this duration.",
    "Hiring an assistant costs $10 per hour.",
    "Therefore, for 8 hours, the cost will be 8 hours * $10 per hour.",
    "Now, I'll calculate this: 8 * $10 = $80.",
    "So, Tom would have to pay a total of $80 for help with crossing the lake back and forth."

  "solution": "80"
