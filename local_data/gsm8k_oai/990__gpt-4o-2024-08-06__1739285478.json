  "query": "Grace started her own landscaping business. She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns, $11 for pulling weeds and $9 for putting down mulch. In September she mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours. How much money did she earn in September?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the amount of money Grace earned from mowing lawns.",
    "She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns.",
    "She worked 63 hours mowing lawns.",
    "To find the total earnings from mowing, I will multiply the hourly rate by the hours worked: 63 hours * $6/hour.",
    "63 * 6 = 378",
    "Grace earned $378 from mowing lawns.",
    "Next, I will calculate the amount of money Grace earned from pulling weeds.",
    "She charges $11 an hour for pulling weeds.",
    "She worked 9 hours pulling weeds.",
    "To find the total earnings from pulling weeds, I will multiply the hourly rate by the hours worked: 9 hours * $11/hour.",
    "9 * 11 = 99",
    "Grace earned $99 from pulling weeds.",
    "Now, I will calculate the amount of money Grace earned from putting down mulch.",
    "She charges $9 an hour for putting down mulch.",
    "She worked 10 hours putting down mulch.",
    "To find the total earnings from putting down mulch, I will multiply the hourly rate by the hours worked: 10 hours * $9/hour.",
    "10 * 9 = 90",
    "Grace earned $90 from putting down mulch.",
    "Now I need to find the total earnings for the entire month of September by adding the earnings from each activity.",
    "Grace earned $378 from mowing lawns, $99 from pulling weeds, and $90 from putting down mulch.",
    "To find the total, I will add these amounts together: 378 + 99 + 90.",
    "378 + 99 = 477",
    "477 + 90 = 567",
    "Grace earned a total of $567 in September."
