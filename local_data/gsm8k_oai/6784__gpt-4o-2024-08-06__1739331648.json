  "query": "Our small city has two buses.  Each bus can have a capacity of 1/6 as much as the train, which has a capacity of 120 people.  What is the combined capacity of the two buses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the capacity of one bus.",
    "Each bus has a capacity of 1/6 as much as the train.",
    "The capacity of the train is 120 people.",
    "To find the capacity of one bus, I calculate 1/6 of 120.",
    "1/6 of 120 is 120 / 6.",
    "120 / 6 equals 20.",
    "So, one bus has a capacity of 20 people.",
    "Now, I'm asked for the combined capacity of the two buses.",
    "Each bus can hold 20 people, and there are two buses.",
    "20 people per bus * 2 buses equals 40 people."

  "solution": "40"
