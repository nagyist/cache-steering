  "query": "How many legs does a spider have if it has two times more than double the number of legs a human has?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many legs a human has. A typical human has 2 legs.",
    "Now, I'll calculate double the number of legs for a human. Double 2 legs is 2 times 2, which equals 4 legs.",
    "The problem states the spider has two times more than this doubled number. I'll interpret \"two times more than\" as multiplying the doubled number by 2 again. So, 4 times 2 equals 8."
  ],
  "solution": "8"
