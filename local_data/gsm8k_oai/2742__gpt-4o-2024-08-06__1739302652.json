  "query": "Henley bought 300 candies and shared them with her two brothers. However, they realized 40% of them were sour, and they had to separate those out. If they then shared the good candies equally, how many candies did each get?",
  "steps": [
    "Henley originally bought 300 candies.",
    "40% of these candies are sour.",
    "To find out how many candies are sour, I calculate 40% of 300.",
    "40% of 300 is 0.40 * 300.",
    "0.40 * 300 equals 120 sour candies.",
    "To find out how many good candies are there, I subtract the sour candies from the total candies.",
    "300 total candies - 120 sour candies = 180 good candies.",
    "Henley and her two brothers share the 180 good candies equally.",
    "There are three people (Henley and her two brothers).",
    "To find out how many candies each person gets, I divide the 180 good candies by 3.",
    "180 \u00f7 3 equals 60."

  "solution": "60"
