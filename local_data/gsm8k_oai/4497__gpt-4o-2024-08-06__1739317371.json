  "query": "Paddy's Confidential has 600 cans of stew required to feed 40 people. How many cans would be needed to feed 30% fewer people?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people 30% fewer than 40 people are.",
    "30% of 40 is calculated as 40 * 0.30.",
    "40 * 0.30 is 12.",
    "30% fewer people than 40 is 40 - 12.",
    "40 - 12 equals 28 people.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cans are needed for these 28 people, given that 600 cans feed 40 people.",
    "I calculate how many cans are needed per person by dividing 600 by 40.",
    "600 / 40 equals 15 cans per person.",
    "To find out how many cans are needed for 28 people, I multiply the number of people by the cans per person.",
    "28 * 15 equals 420."

  "solution": "420"
