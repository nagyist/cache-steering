  "query": "Gabriel is looking at her marble sets. She sees that in the first set 10% of her marbles are broken. In the second set, 20% of the marbles are broken. The first set contains 50 marbles. The second set contains 60. How many marbles are broken in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Gabriel has two sets of marbles. I need to find out how many marbles are broken in total from both sets.",
    "First, I will calculate the number of broken marbles in the first set.",
    "The first set contains 50 marbles and 10% of them are broken.",
    "To find 10% of 50, I multiply 50 by 0.10.",
    "50 times 0.10 is 5.",
    "So, 5 marbles are broken in the first set.",
    "Next, I will calculate the number of broken marbles in the second set.",
    "The second set contains 60 marbles and 20% of them are broken.",
    "To find 20% of 60, I multiply 60 by 0.20.",
    "60 times 0.20 is 12.",
    "So, 12 marbles are broken in the second set.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of broken marbles from both sets.",
    "I will add the broken marbles from the first set (5) to the broken marbles from the second set (12).",
    "5 + 12 equals 17."
