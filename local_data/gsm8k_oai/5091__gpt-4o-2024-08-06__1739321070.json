  "query": "Paul uses 1 can of frosting to frost a layer cake.  He uses a half can of frosting for a single cake, or a single pan of brownies, or a dozen cupcakes.  For Saturday, he needs to have 3 layer cakes, 6 dozen cupcakes, 12 single cakes and 18 pans of brownies ready and frosted for customer pick up.  How many cans of frosting will he need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much frosting is used for each type of baked good.",
    "A layer cake uses 1 can of frosting.",
    "A single cake uses 0.5 cans of frosting.",
    "A pan of brownies uses 0.5 cans of frosting.",
    "A dozen cupcakes use 0.5 cans of frosting.",
    "Now I will calculate the frosting needed for each type of baked good.",
    "Paul needs 3 layer cakes. Since each uses 1 can, he will need 3 * 1 = 3 cans for the layer cakes.",
    "Paul needs 6 dozen cupcakes. Since each dozen uses 0.5 cans, he will need 6 * 0.5 = 3 cans for the cupcakes.",
    "Paul needs 12 single cakes. Since each uses 0.5 cans, he will need 12 * 0.5 = 6 cans for the single cakes.",
    "Paul needs 18 pans of brownies. Since each uses 0.5 cans, he will need 18 * 0.5 = 9 cans for the pans of brownies.",
    "Now, I need to sum all the frosting needed for the various baked goods.",
    "The total amount of frosting needed is 3 (layer cakes) + 3 (cupcakes) + 6 (single cakes) + 9 (brownies) = 21 cans."
