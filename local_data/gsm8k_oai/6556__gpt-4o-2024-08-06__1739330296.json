  "query": "Danielle wants to make her own popsicles. She finds out she needs popsicle sticks, molds, and juice. She has $10 for supplies. She buys one set of molds for $3 and a pack of 100 popsicle sticks for $1. Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles and costs $2. How many popsicle sticks will she be left with if she makes as many as she can?",
  "steps": [
    "Danielle starts with $10.",
    "She buys one set of molds for $3. So, she spends $3.",
    "After buying the molds, she has $10 - $3 = $7 left.",
    "She buys a pack of 100 popsicle sticks for $1.",
    "After buying the popsicle sticks, she has $7 - $1 = $6 left.",
    "Each bottle of juice costs $2 and makes 20 popsicles.",
    "With $6 remaining, she can buy $6 \u00f7 $2 = 3 bottles of juice.",
    "Each bottle makes 20 popsicles, so 3 bottles make 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 popsicles.",
    "To make 60 popsicles, she needs 60 popsicle sticks.",
    "She initially bought a pack of 100 popsicle sticks.",
    "After making 60 popsicles, she uses 60 sticks, leaving her with 100 - 60 = 40 popsicle sticks."
