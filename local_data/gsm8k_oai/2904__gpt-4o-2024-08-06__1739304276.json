  "query": "Mark spent 220 dollars to fix his car.  It needed two parts that cost 20 dollars each, and labor cost .5 dollars a minute. How many hours did the mechanic work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that Mark spent a total of 220 dollars on fixing his car.",
    "I know the cost of the two parts, which is 20 dollars each.",
    "The total cost for the two parts is 2 parts * 20 dollars each = 40 dollars.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the cost incurred due to labor.",
    "To find the labor cost, I deduct the parts cost from the total cost: 220 dollars - 40 dollars = 180 dollars.",
    "Labor costs .5 dollars per minute.",
    "To find out how many minutes the mechanic worked, I divide the labor cost by the cost per minute: 180 dollars / 0.5 dollars per minute.",
    "180 divided by 0.5 equals 360 minutes.",
    "Now I need to convert minutes into hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To convert minutes to hours, I divide the number of minutes by 60: 360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour.",
    "360 divided by 60 equals 6."

  "solution": "6"
