  "query": "A used car lot has 24 cars and motorcycles (in total) for sale. A third of the vehicles are motorcycles, and a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. How many tires are on the used car lot\u2019s vehicles in all?",
  "steps": [
    "To start, I need to find out how many motorcycles there are.",
    "I'm told that a third of the vehicles are motorcycles.",
    "The total number of vehicles is 24.",
    "I calculate the number of motorcycles by finding a third of 24.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8.",
    "So, there are 8 motorcycles on the lot.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many cars are on the lot.",
    "The total number of vehicles is 24, and there are 8 motorcycles.",
    "Therefore, the number of cars is 24 - 8 = 16.",
    "Now, I should calculate the total number of tires.",
    "Motorcycles typically have 2 tires each.",
    "There are 8 motorcycles.",
    "Therefore, the motorcycles have a total of 8 x 2 = 16 tires.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of tires on the cars.",
    "Cars typically have 4 tires each.",
    "There are 16 cars on the lot.",
    "So, the cars have a total of 16 x 4 = 64 tires.",
    "I also need to account for the spare tires.",
    "A quarter of the cars have a spare tire.",
    "I calculate a quarter of 16 to find how many cars have a spare tire.",
    "16 divided by 4 equals 4.",
    "So, 4 cars have a spare tire.",
    "Since each spare tire is one additional tire per car, there are 4 extra tires from the spare tires.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of tires on the lot.",
    "The total number of tires from motorcycles is 16.",
    "The total number of tires from cars is 64.",
    "Adding the spare tires, I have 16 + 64 + 4 = 84."
