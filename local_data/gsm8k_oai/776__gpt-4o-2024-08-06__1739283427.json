  "query": "Amber worked for 12 hours last weekend. Armand worked one-third as long and Ella worked twice as long. How many hours did the 3 people work in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Amber worked for 12 hours.",
    "Armand worked one-third as long as Amber.",
    "To find how many hours Armand worked, calculate one-third of 12 hours.",
    "12 divided by 3 equals 4 hours.",
    "So, Armand worked for 4 hours.",
    "Ella worked twice as long as Amber.",
    "To find how many hours Ella worked, calculate twice of 12 hours.",
    "2 times 12 equals 24 hours.",
    "So, Ella worked for 24 hours.",
    "Now I need to find the total hours worked by all three.",
    "Add the hours for Amber, Armand, and Ella: 12 + 4 + 24.",
    "12 + 4 equals 16.",
    "16 + 24 equals 40.",
    "The total number of hours worked by all three people is 40."
