  "query": "A cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider what percentage of germs is killed by each spray.",
    "The first spray kills 50% of the germs.",
    "The second spray kills 25% of the germs.",
    "5% of the germs are killed by both sprays concurrently. This means there is an overlap when using both sprays.",
    "To find the total percentage of germs killed by using both sprays, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.",
    "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, I calculate the total percentage of germs killed by adding the percentage of germs killed by each spray and then subtracting the percentage of overlapping germs.",
    "The total percentage of germs killed by both sprays is 50% + 25% - 5% = 70%.",
    "Now, I need to find out the percentage of germs that remain.",
    "If 70% of the germs are killed, then 100% - 70% = 30% of the germs are left."

  "solution": "30"
