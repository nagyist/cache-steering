  "query": "Keanu bought some fish from the store for his pets. He gave his cat half as many fish as he gave to his dog. If he gave his dog 40 fish, and each fish cost him $4, calculate the total amount of money he spent at the store to buy all the fish.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fish Keanu gave to his dog.",
    "According to the problem, Keanu gave 40 fish to his dog.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many fish he gave to his cat.",
    "Keanu gave his cat half as many fish as he gave to his dog.",
    "Since he gave 40 fish to his dog, he would give half of 40 to his cat.",
    "Calculating half of 40 gives me 20 fish for his cat.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of fish Keanu bought.",
    "Keanu bought 40 fish for his dog and 20 fish for his cat.",
    "Adding these together gives me 40 + 20 = 60 fish in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for all of these fish.",
    "Each fish costs $4.",
    "Multiplying the total number of fish (60) by the cost per fish ($4) will give me the total amount of money spent.",
    "60 fish times $4 per fish equals $240."
  ],
  "solution": "240"
