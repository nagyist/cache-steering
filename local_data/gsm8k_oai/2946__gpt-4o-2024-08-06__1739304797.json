  "query": "Two sisters go to the movies.  Movie tickets are $8 per person.  If the sisters brought $25 with them, how much change will they receive after buying the tickets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the movie tickets for both sisters.",
    "Movie tickets cost $8 per person, and there are two sisters, so I need to multiply the ticket price by the number of sisters: $8 * 2.",
    "Calculating $8 * 2 gives me $16.",
    "I now know that the total cost for the tickets is $16.",
    "The sisters brought $25 with them.",
    "To find the change they will receive, I need to subtract the total cost of the tickets from the amount they brought: $25 - $16.",
    "Calculating $25 - $16 gives me $9.",
    "The sisters will receive $9 in change after buying their tickets."
