  "steps": [
    "James takes 2 Tylenol tablets every 6 hours.",
    "Each tablet is 375 mg.",
    "First, calculate the total mg for one dose: \\(2 \\times 375 = 750\\) mg per dose.",
    "He takes one dose every 6 hours, so we need to find out how many doses he takes in a day.",
    "There are 24 hours in a day.",
    "We divide 24 hours by 6 hours per dose: \\(24 / 6 = 4\\) doses per day.",
    "Now, calculate the total mg taken in a day: \\(4 \\times 750 = 3000\\) mg per day."
