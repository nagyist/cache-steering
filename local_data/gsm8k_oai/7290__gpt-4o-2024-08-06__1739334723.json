  "query": "A building has 300 units. Half the units are residential and the other half are split evenly between offices and restaurants. How many restaurants are there in the building?",
  "steps": [
    "The building has a total of 300 units.",
    "Half of the units are residential. So, the number of residential units is 300 divided by 2.",
    "300 divided by 2 equals 150. So, there are 150 residential units.",
    "The other half of the units are split evenly between offices and restaurants. So, there are 150 units split between offices and restaurants.",
    "Since the 150 units are split evenly between offices and restaurants, we divide 150 by 2 to determine the number of restaurant units.",
    "150 divided by 2 equals 75."
  ],
  "solution": "75"
