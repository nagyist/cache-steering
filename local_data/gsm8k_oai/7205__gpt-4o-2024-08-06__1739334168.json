  "query": "Marc bought 5 model cars that cost $20 each and 5 bottles of paint that cost $10 each. He also bought 5 paintbrushes that cost $2 each. How much did Marc spend in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Calculate the total cost of the model cars first. Each model car costs $20 and Marc bought 5 of them.",
    "The total cost for the model cars is 5 cars * $20/car = $100.",
    "Next, calculate the total cost of the paint. Each bottle of paint costs $10 and Marc bought 5 of them.",
    "The total cost for the paint is 5 bottles * $10/bottle = $50.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost of the paintbrushes. Each paintbrush costs $2 and Marc bought 5 of them.",
    "The total cost for the paintbrushes is 5 brushes * $2/brush = $10.",
    "To find the total amount Marc spent, add the costs of the model cars, paint, and paintbrushes together.",
    "The total spent is $100 (model cars) + $50 (paint) + $10 (paintbrushes) = $160."
