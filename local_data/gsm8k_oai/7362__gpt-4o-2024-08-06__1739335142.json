  "query": "The sum of the ages of three boys is 29. If two of the boys are the same age and the third boy is 11 years old, how old are the other two boys?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the combined ages of the two boys that are the same age.",
    "The total sum of the ages of all three boys is 29.",
    "One of the boys is 11 years old.",
    "So, I subtract the age of the third boy from the total sum: 29 - 11 = 18.",
    "Now, I know that the sum of the ages of the two boys that are the same age is 18.",
    "Since these two boys are the same age, I need to divide 18 by 2 to find their individual ages.",
    "18 divided by 2 is 9.",
    "Therefore, each of the two boys is 9 years old."

  "solution": "9"
