  "query": "Chad saves 40% of the money he earns/receives in a year.  This year, he made $600 mowing yards and received $250.00 for his birthday/holidays.  He also made $150.00 by selling some old video games and another $150.00 doing odd jobs.  How much will he save?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out Chad's total earnings for the year.",
    "He made $600 mowing yards.",
    "He received $250 for his birthday/holidays.",
    "He made $150 by selling old video games.",
    "He made another $150 doing odd jobs.",
    "Now, I add up all these amounts to find his total earnings.",
    "$600 (mowing) + $250 (gifts) + $150 (video games) + $150 (odd jobs) = $1150.",
    "Chad's total earnings for the year is $1150.",
    "He saves 40% of his total earnings.",
    "To find out how much Chad saves, I need to calculate 40% of $1150.",
    "40% as a decimal is 0.40.",
    "I multiply $1150 by 0.40 to find out how much he saves.",
    "$1150 * 0.40 = $460."
