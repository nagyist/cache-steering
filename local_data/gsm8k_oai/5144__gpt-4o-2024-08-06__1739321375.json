  "query": "Johny traveled South 40 miles, then turned East and traveled for 20 more miles than the distance he took to travel to the south. If he turned North and traveled twice the distance he had traveled to the East, calculate the total distance his journey took.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total distance Johny traveled in each direction.",
    "He initially traveled South 40 miles.",
    "Next, Johny turned East and traveled 20 more miles than he did to the south.",
    "He traveled South 40 miles, so 20 more than this would be \\(40 + 20 = 60\\) miles East.",
    "After that, he turned North and traveled twice the distance he traveled to the East.",
    "He traveled 60 miles East. Twice this distance would be \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) miles North.",
    "Now, I add up all the distances to get the total journey distance.",
    "The total distance is \\(40\\) miles (South) + \\(60\\) miles (East) + \\(120\\) miles (North).",
    "Calculate the sum: \\(40 + 60 + 120 = 220\\) miles."

  "solution": "220"
