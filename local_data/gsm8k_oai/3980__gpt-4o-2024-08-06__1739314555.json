  "query": "Several birds were sitting in the branches of a crape myrtle tree.  There were three times more cardinals than bluebirds, but half as many swallows as bluebirds. If there were 2 swallows, what is the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree?",
  "steps": [
    "We know there are 2 swallows.",
    "Since the number of swallows is half the number of bluebirds, we set the number of bluebirds as a variable, B.",
    "Using the information about the swallows, we can write the equation: 0.5 * B = 2.",
    "Solving for B, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get: B = 4.",
    "Now we know there are 4 bluebirds.",
    "It is given that there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds.",
    "Therefore, the number of cardinals is 3 times the number of bluebirds: C = 3 * B = 3 * 4.",
    "Calculating this gives C = 12 cardinals.",
    "Now we determine the total number of birds by adding the numbers of each bird type.",
    "The total number of birds is the sum of swallows, bluebirds, and cardinals: 2 + 4 + 12.",
    "Add them together: 2 + 4 = 6, and then 6 + 12 = 18."

  "solution": "18"
