  "query": "A farmer has 51 cows. The farmer adds five new cows to its herd and then sells a quarter of the herd. How many cows does the farmer have left?",
  "steps": [
    "The farmer starts with 51 cows.",
    "The farmer adds 5 cows to the herd.",
    "Now the farmer has 51 + 5 = 56 cows.",
    "The farmer sells a quarter of the herd.",
    "A quarter of 56 is calculated as 56 / 4.",
    "56 / 4 = 14, so the farmer sells 14 cows.",
    "To find how many cows the farmer has left, subtract the cows sold from the current total: 56 - 14.",
    "56 - 14 = 42 cows."
