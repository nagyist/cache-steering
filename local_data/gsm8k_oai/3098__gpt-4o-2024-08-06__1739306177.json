  "query": "The ages of three brothers are consecutive integers with the sum of 96.  How old is the youngest brother?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the age of the youngest brother be \\( x \\).",
    "Then, the ages of the next two brothers are \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x + 2 \\).",
    "The sum of their ages is \\( x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) \\).",
    "Simplify the expression: \\( x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 3x + 3 \\).",
    "We know the sum of their ages is 96, so set the equation \\( 3x + 3 = 96 \\).",
    "Subtract 3 from both sides: \\( 3x = 96 - 3 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( 3x = 93 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 93 / 3 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 93 / 3 \\) to find \\( x \\).",
    "\\( 93 / 3 \\) equals 31."
