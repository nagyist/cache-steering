  "query": "Danny is bringing his sailboat out to the ocean. When he uses his 24 square foot sail he goes 50 MPH. When he uses his 12 square foot sail he goes 20 MPH. He plans to travel 200 miles. How many hours faster is the bigger sail than the smaller one?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the time it takes for Danny to travel 200 miles with each sail.",
    "Let me start with the 24 square foot sail, where Danny's speed is 50 MPH.",
    "To find the time, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "Using the formula, time with the 24 square foot sail = 200 miles / 50 MPH.",
    "200 miles divided by 50 MPH equals 4 hours.",
    "Now, I'll determine the time it takes with the 12 square foot sail, where Danny's speed is 20 MPH.",
    "Using the same formula, time with the 12 square foot sail = 200 miles / 20 MPH.",
    "200 miles divided by 20 MPH equals 10 hours.",
    "Next, I'll find the difference in time between using the two sails.",
    "Time with the 12 square foot sail is 10 hours and with the 24 square foot sail is 4 hours.",
    "The difference in time is 10 hours - 4 hours.",
    "This equals 6 hours."
