  "query": "The city of Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria. Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon. If Richmond has 3000 people, how many people are there in Beacon?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many people are in Victoria. I know that Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria.",
    "Richmond has 3000 people.",
    "Therefore, Victoria must have 3000 - 1000 = 2000 people.",
    "Next, I know that Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon.",
    "Since Victoria has 2000 people, I set up the equation: 4 times the population of Beacon equals 2000.",
    "To find the population of Beacon, I divide 2000 by 4.",
    "2000 divided by 4 equals 500.",
    "I have found the population of Beacon to be 500 people."

  "solution": "500"
