  "query": "Rica's group won in a dance competition. She got 3/8 of the prize money. From Rica's prize money, she spent 1/5 of it and is now left with $300. How much was the prize money that her group won?",
  "steps": [
    "Rica received 3/8 of the total prize money.",
    "Rica spent 1/5 of her portion of the prize money.",
    "This means she was left with 4/5 of her portion.",
    "Rica initially had a prize amount of P, so she spent P/5, leaving her with 4P/5.",
    "We know that 4P/5 = $300.",
    "Let's solve the equation 4P/5 = 300 for P.",
    "Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the denominator: 4P = 1500.",
    "Divide both sides by 4 to isolate P: P = 375.",
    "Rica's share of the prize money was $375.",
    "Since Rica's share was 3/8 of the total prize money, we can set up the equation 3/8 * Total Money = 375.",
    "Let's solve for the total money. Multiply both sides by 8 to clear the fraction: 3 * Total Money = 3000.",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for the total money: Total Money = 1000.",
    "Therefore, the total prize money that her group won was $1000."

  "solution": "1000"
