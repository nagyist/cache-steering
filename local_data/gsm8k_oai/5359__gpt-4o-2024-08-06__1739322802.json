  "query": "Cassie is an athletic person and tries to drink at least 12 cups of water a day to stay hydrated while being active. Her water bottle holds 16 ounces. There are 8 ounces of water in a cup. How many times does Cassie have to refill her water bottle a day to make sure she drinks 12 cups?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many ounces of water Cassie needs to drink in a day. She wants to drink 12 cups of water.",
    "There are 8 ounces of water in a cup. So, I will multiply 12 cups by 8 ounces per cup.",
    "12 cups * 8 ounces per cup = 96 ounces. Cassie needs to drink 96 ounces of water in a day.",
    "Next, I will determine how many ounces Cassie can drink from a single full water bottle. Her bottle holds 16 ounces.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many times Cassie needs to fill her 16-ounce water bottle to drink a total of 96 ounces.",
    "I divide the total amount of water she needs, 96 ounces, by the amount her bottle holds, 16 ounces.",
    "96 ounces \u00f7 16 ounces per bottle = 6. Cassie needs to refill her water bottle 6 times to drink her required 96 ounces."

  "solution": "6"
