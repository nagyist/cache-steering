  "query": "Chad bought 6 packages of cat food and 2 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 9 cans, and each package of dog food contained 3 cans. How many more cans of cat food than dog food did Chad buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cans of cat food Chad bought.",
    "He bought 6 packages of cat food.",
    "Each package contains 9 cans.",
    "So, 6 packages of cat food means 6 times 9 cans of cat food.",
    "6 times 9 is 54 cans of cat food.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cans of dog food Chad bought.",
    "He bought 2 packages of dog food.",
    "Each package contains 3 cans.",
    "So, 2 packages of dog food means 2 times 3 cans of dog food.",
    "2 times 3 is 6 cans of dog food.",
    "Chad bought 54 cans of cat food and 6 cans of dog food.",
    "To find out how many more cans of cat food than dog food Chad bought, I subtract the number of dog food cans from the number of cat food cans.",
    "54 cans of cat food minus 6 cans of dog food is 48 cans."
