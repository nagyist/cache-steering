  "query": "Lucas went to the store with $20 and needed to buy 3 avocados that cost $2 each. How much change does he bring home?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the avocados.",
    "Each avocado costs $2, and Lucas wants to buy 3 avocados.",
    "I calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost per avocado by the number of avocados: $2 * 3 = $6.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much change Lucas will have after the purchase.",
    "Lucas initially had $20.",
    "He spent $6 on avocados.",
    "To find the change, I subtract the total cost of the avocados from the money Lucas had: $20 - $6 = $14.",
    "Lucas brings home $14 in change."
