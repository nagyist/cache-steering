  "query": "Mara and Riley went to a carnival, Mara rode the bumper car two times, Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and they both rode the Ferris wheel three times. If a ticket for a bumper car cost $2, a ticket for a space shuttle cost $4, and a ticket for a Ferris wheel cost $5, how much money did they spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of Mara's bumper car rides.",
    "Mara rode the bumper car 2 times, and each ride costs $2.",
    "The total cost for Mara's bumper car rides is 2 rides * $2/ride = $4.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the cost of Riley's space shuttle rides.",
    "Riley rode the space shuttle 4 times, and each ride costs $4.",
    "The total cost for Riley's space shuttle rides is 4 rides * $4/ride = $16.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the Ferris wheel rides that both Mara and Riley took.",
    "They both rode the Ferris wheel 3 times, and each ride costs $5.",
    "Both Mara and Riley riding the Ferris wheel means 2 people * 3 rides = 6 total rides.",
    "The total cost for the Ferris wheel rides is 6 rides * $5/ride = $30.",
    "Now, I need to add all the costs together to find the total amount spent.",
    "The total amount spent is Mara's bumper car cost ($4) + Riley's space shuttle cost ($16) + Ferris wheel cost ($30).",
    "Adding these amounts: $4 + $16 + $30 = $50."

  "solution": "50"
