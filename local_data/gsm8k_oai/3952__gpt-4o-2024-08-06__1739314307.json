  "query": "Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours. How far will he go in 15 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out Luis's speed in miles per hour.",
    "Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours.",
    "To find the speed, I divide the total distance by the total time.",
    "80 miles \u00f7 2 hours = 40 miles per hour.",
    "Now I know Luis is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour.",
    "The question asks how far he will go in 15 minutes.",
    "15 minutes is a quarter of an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).",
    "To find the distance covered in 15 minutes, I calculate 1/4 of the speed for an hour.",
    "1/4 of 40 miles per hour is 40 miles per hour \u00d7 1/4 = 10 miles.",
    "Luis will go 10 miles in 15 minutes."
