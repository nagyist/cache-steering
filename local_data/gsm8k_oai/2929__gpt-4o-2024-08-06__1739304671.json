  "query": "Hermione, Luna, and Celestia combined have 83 spelling badges. If Hermione has 14 and Luna has 17, how many spelling badges does Celestia have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem and the information given. Hermione, Luna, and Celestia together have 83 spelling badges.",
    "I know Hermione has 14 spelling badges.",
    "I also know Luna has 17 spelling badges.",
    "The next step is to find out how many badges Hermione and Luna have together.",
    "I need to add Hermione's and Luna's badges together: 14 + 17.",
    "14 + 17 equals 31.",
    "So, Hermione and Luna together have 31 spelling badges.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many spelling badges Celestia has.",
    "The total combined badges they have is 83, and Hermione and Luna have 31 of those.",
    "To find out how many badges Celestia has, I subtract the combined total of Hermione and Luna from the overall total.",
    "I need to calculate 83 - 31.",
    "83 - 31 equals 52."
