  "query": "20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the distance each bird travels during the first season from lake Jim to lake Disney.",
    "The distance between lake Jim and lake Disney is 50 miles.",
    "Each bird travels 50 miles in the first season.",
    "Next, determine the distance each bird travels during the second season from lake Disney to lake London.",
    "The distance between lake Disney and lake London is 60 miles.",
    "Each bird travels 60 miles in the second season.",
    "Calculate the total distance each bird travels over the two seasons.",
    "Each bird travels 50 miles in the first season and 60 miles in the second season.",
    "So, the total distance each bird travels is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.",
    "Now, determine the total distance traveled by all 20 birds over the two seasons.",
    "Each bird travels 110 miles, and there are 20 birds.",
    "Multiply the total distance each bird travels by the number of birds: 110 miles \u00d7 20 birds.",
    "110 miles \u00d7 20 = 2200 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "2200"
