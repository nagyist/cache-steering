  "query": "Tim host a show and they film multiple episodes per day.  Each episode is 20 minutes long and it takes 50% longer than that to film each episode.  Each week they show 5 episodes.  How many hours would it take to film 4 weeks of episodes?",
  "steps": [
    "The show films episodes that are each 20 minutes long.",
    "Filming takes 50% longer than the episode length.",
    "50% of 20 minutes is 20 * 0.5 = 10 minutes.",
    "So, filming each episode takes 20 + 10 = 30 minutes.",
    "Each week, they air 5 episodes.",
    "In 4 weeks, they would air 5 episodes per week * 4 weeks = 20 episodes.",
    "Each episode takes 30 minutes to film, so 20 episodes would take 20 * 30 = 600 minutes to film.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To convert 600 minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 600 / 60 = 10 hours."
