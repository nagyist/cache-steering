  "query": "Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flowers in total were initially planted.",
    "Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each.",
    "That means in total they initially planted 2 daughters * 5 flowers = 10 flowers.",
    "Next, I need to account for the growth of the flowers.",
    "As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more.",
    "So, the total flowers became 10 original + 20 grown = 30 flowers.",
    "Now, I need to account for the flowers that died.",
    "Of these, 10 flowers died.",
    "Thus, the final number of flowers is 30 - 10 = 20 flowers.",
    "Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets.",
    "To find how many flowers ended up in each basket, I need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of baskets.",
    "20 flowers divided by 5 baskets result in 20 / 5 = 4 flowers per basket."
