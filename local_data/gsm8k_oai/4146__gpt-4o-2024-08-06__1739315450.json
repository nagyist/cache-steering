  "query": "At Roosevelt high school there are 600 students in the senior class. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. Of the students in the marching band, half of them play a brass instrument. Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students are in the marching band. The problem states that a fifth of the senior class is in the marching band.",
    "There are 600 students in the senior class. To find a fifth of them, I divide 600 by 5.",
    "600 divided by 5 equals 120. So, there are 120 students in the marching band.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of the marching band students play a brass instrument. The problem states that half of the marching band students play a brass instrument.",
    "Half of 120 is 120 divided by 2.",
    "120 divided by 2 equals 60. So, 60 students play a brass instrument.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many of the brass instrument players play the saxophone. A fifth of them play the saxophone.",
    "A fifth of 60 is 60 divided by 5.",
    "60 divided by 5 equals 12. So, 12 students play the saxophone.",
    "Finally, of those who play the saxophone, I need to find out how many play the alto saxophone. A third of the saxophone players play the alto saxophone.",
    "A third of 12 is 12 divided by 3.",
    "12 divided by 3 equals 4. Thus, 4 students play the alto saxophone."
