  "query": "Ariana heard the news that a new grocery store had opened up in their town, so she decided to buy some flowers for her house. She bought a bunch of 40 flowers, 2/5 of which were roses, 10 were tulips, and the rest were carnations. How many carnations did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Ariana bought a bunch of 40 flowers in total.",
    "2/5 of these flowers are roses.",
    "To find the number of roses, calculate 2/5 of 40.",
    "2/5 of 40 is equal to (2/5) * 40 = 16 roses.",
    "Ariana also bought 10 tulips.",
    "Now, I need to find how many flowers are carnations.",
    "First, find the total number of roses and tulips combined: 16 roses + 10 tulips = 26 flowers.",
    "Subtract the number of roses and tulips from the total number of flowers to find the number of carnations: 40 total flowers - 26 = 14 carnations."
