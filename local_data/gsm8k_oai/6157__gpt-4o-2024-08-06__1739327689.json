  "query": "A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the expected outcomes from the magician's performances.",
    "The question states that he performed the act 100 times.",
    "Out of these 100 performances, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears.",
    "This means that in 100 / 10 = 10 performances, no one reappeared.",
    "One-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one.",
    "This means that in 100 / 5 = 20 performances, two people reappeared.",
    "For the remaining performances where these two conditions do not apply, one person reappears.",
    "Since 10 performances had no reappearance and 20 had two people reappear, that leaves 100 - 10 - 20 = 70 performances where one person reappeared.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of people who reappeared:",
    "In the 10 performances where no one reappeared, 0 people reappeared.",
    "In the 20 performances where two people reappeared, 20 * 2 = 40 people reappeared.",
    "In the 70 performances where one person reappeared, 70 * 1 = 70 people reappeared.",
    "Adding these up gives 0 + 40 + 70 = 110 people reappeared in total."

  "solution": "110"
