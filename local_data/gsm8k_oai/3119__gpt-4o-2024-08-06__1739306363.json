  "query": "Nick has 60 cans. Each can takes up 30 square inches of space before being compacted and 20% of that amount after being compacted. How much space do all the cans take up after being compacted?",
  "steps": [
    "I have to find out the space occupied by each can after being compacted.",
    "Each can takes up 30 square inches of space before being compacted.",
    "After being compacted, each can takes up 20% of the original space.",
    "To find the compacted space of one can, I need to calculate 20% of 30 square inches.",
    "20% of 30 is calculated as (20/100) * 30.",
    "(20/100) * 30 = 6 square inches.",
    "So each can occupies 6 square inches after being compacted.",
    "I need to find the total space for all 60 cans after being compacted.",
    "Each compacted can occupies 6 square inches, and there are 60 cans.",
    "The total space is 60 cans * 6 square inches per can.",
    "Calculate 60 * 6.",
    "60 * 6 = 360."

  "solution": "360"
