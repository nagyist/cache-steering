  "query": "Biff and Kenneth decide to compete in a 500-yard rowboat race.  If Biff rows at a speed of 50 yards per minute and Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute, how many yards past the finish line will Kenneth be when Biff crosses the finish line?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it will take for each of them to complete the 500-yard race.",
    "For Biff: Biff's speed is 50 yards per minute.",
    "Time taken by Biff to finish the race = Total Distance / Speed = 500 yards / 50 yards per minute = 10 minutes.",
    "For Kenneth: Kenneth's speed is 51 yards per minute.",
    "Time taken by Kenneth to finish the race = Total Distance / Speed = 500 yards / 51 yards per minute.",
    "Before calculating, I should consider whether the division would result in a simple or complex number.",
    "500 divided by 51 is approximately 9.8039 minutes.",
    "Now, since we want to find out how far Kenneth is past the finish line when Biff crosses, we need to calculate where Kenneth is at 10 minutes.",
    "In 10 minutes, Kenneth will row 51 yards per minute * 10 minutes = 510 yards.",
    "Kenneth will finish the 500-yard race in approximately 9.8039 minutes.",
    "Since Kenneth finishes in less time than Biff, he will be rowing past the finish line when Biff finishes.",
    "The distance Kenneth rows in 10 minutes is 510 yards.",
    "Therefore, when Biff crosses the finish line, Kenneth would have rowed 510 yards in total.",
    "Finally, I just need to calculate how many yards past the finish line Kenneth is.",
    "Kenneth is 510 yards - 500 yards = 10 yards past the finish line when Biff crosses."
