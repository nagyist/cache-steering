  "query": "For a school fundraiser, Chandler needs to sell 12 rolls of wrapping paper. So far, he has sold 3 rolls to his grandmother, 4 rolls to his uncle, and 3 rolls to a neighbor. How many more rolls of wrapping paper does Chandler need to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "Chandler's goal is to sell 12 rolls of wrapping paper in total.",
    "He has already sold 3 rolls to his grandmother.",
    "He then sold 4 rolls to his uncle.",
    "Next, he sold 3 rolls to a neighbor.",
    "To find out how many rolls he has sold so far, I will add the rolls sold to each person: 3 + 4 + 3.",
    "Calculating that gives 3 + 4 = 7.",
    "Adding the rolls sold to the neighbor: 7 + 3 = 10 rolls.",
    "Chandler has sold a total of 10 rolls so far.",
    "To find out how many more rolls Chandler needs to sell, I will subtract the number of rolls already sold from his goal: 12 - 10.",
    "12 - 10 = 2 rolls."
