  "query": "Jerry has three times as many stickers as George. George has 6 fewer stickers than his brother Fred. If Fred has 18 stickers, how many stickers does Jerry have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many stickers George has.",
    "Fred has 18 stickers.",
    "George has 6 fewer stickers than Fred.",
    "Subtract 6 from 18 to find the number of stickers George has.",
    "18 - 6 = 12. So, George has 12 stickers.",
    "Next, determine how many stickers Jerry has.",
    "Jerry has three times as many stickers as George.",
    "Multiply the number of stickers George has by 3.",
    "12 * 3 = 36. So, Jerry has 36 stickers."
