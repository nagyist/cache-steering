  "query": "Jenny is older than Charlie by five years, while Charlie is older than Bobby by three years. How old will Charlie be when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how old Charlie will be when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby, first, I need to establish their current ages in terms of Bobby's age. Let's say Bobby is B years old.",
    "Since Charlie is older than Bobby by 3 years, Charlie's current age is B + 3 years.",
    "Jenny is older than Charlie by 5 years. Therefore, Jenny's current age is the age of Charlie plus 5 years, which is (B + 3) + 5 = B + 8 years.",
    "Now, I need to set up the condition when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby. That means:\nJenny's age = 2 * Bobby's age.",
    "Substitute Jenny's current age and Bobby's age into the condition:\nB + 8 = 2 * B.",
    "Solve the equation B + 8 = 2B to find Bobby's current age.",
    "Subtract B from both sides:\n8 = B.",
    "Therefore, Bobby is currently 8 years old.",
    "Using Bobby's current age, calculate Charlie's age: B + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11.",
    "Charlie is currently 11 years old.",
    "Since we want to find out how old Charlie will be when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby, I need to double-check the current ages: \nIf Bobby is 8, then Jenny should be 16 to be twice Bobby's current age.",
    "On reevaluating, since Jenny (Bobby + 8) equals Jenny twice Bobby (2 * 8), Bobby's age holds, making Charlie's corresponding age 11.",
    "Therefore, Charlie will be 11 years old when Jenny is twice Bobby's age."
