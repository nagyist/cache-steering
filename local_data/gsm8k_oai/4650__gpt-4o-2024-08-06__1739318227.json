  "query": "Sally eats 2 sandwiches on Saturday and 1 sandwich on Sunday. If each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread does Sally eat across Saturday and Sunday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many sandwiches Sally eats on Saturday.",
    "Sally eats 2 sandwiches on Saturday.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many sandwiches Sally eats on Sunday.",
    "Sally eats 1 sandwich on Sunday.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of sandwiches Sally eats across both days.",
    "Sally eats 2 sandwiches on Saturday and 1 sandwich on Sunday, so that is 2 + 1 = 3 sandwiches in total.",
    "Each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread, so I need to calculate the total pieces of bread used for 3 sandwiches.",
    "3 sandwiches multiplied by 2 pieces of bread per sandwich equals 6 pieces of bread.",
    "Therefore, Sally eats 6 pieces of bread across Saturday and Sunday."
