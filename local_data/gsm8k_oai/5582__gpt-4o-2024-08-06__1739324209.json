  "query": "Taipei 101 in Taiwan is 1,673 feet tall with 101 floors. Suppose the first to 100th floors have height each equal to 16.5 feet, how high is the 101st floor?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the total height of Taipei 101 is 1,673 feet.",
    "I also know that the first 100 floors each have a height of 16.5 feet.",
    "To find the total height of the first 100 floors, I need to multiply 100 by 16.5.",
    "100 times 16.5 is 1,650.",
    "The total height of the first 100 floors is 1,650 feet.",
    "To find the height of the 101st floor, I must subtract the height of the first 100 floors from the total building height.",
    "1,673 minus 1,650 equals 23."
