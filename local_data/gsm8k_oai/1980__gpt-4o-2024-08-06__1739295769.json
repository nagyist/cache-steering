  "query": "Janeth bought 5 bags of round balloons with 20 balloons in each bag. She also bought 4 bags of long balloons with 30 balloons in each bag. While blowing up the balloons, 5 round balloons burst. How many balloons are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many round balloons Janeth bought in total.",
    "She bought 5 bags of round balloons, with each bag containing 20 balloons.",
    "So, the total number of round balloons is 5 bags * 20 balloons/bag = 100 balloons.",
    "Next, I find out how many long balloons she bought in total.",
    "She bought 4 bags of long balloons, with each bag containing 30 balloons.",
    "So, the total number of long balloons is 4 bags * 30 balloons/bag = 120 balloons.",
    "Now, I add the total number of round balloons and long balloons to find out how many balloons Janeth had initially.",
    "The total number of balloons she initially had is 100 round balloons + 120 long balloons = 220 balloons.",
    "I need to account for the round balloons that burst.",
    "5 round balloons burst, so the remaining number of round balloons is 100 - 5 = 95.",
    "The total number of balloons left is the sum of the remaining round balloons and all the long balloons, as none of them burst.",
    "Therefore, the total number of balloons left is 95 round balloons + 120 long balloons = 215 balloons."

  "solution": "215"
