  "query": "Mr. Rainwater has some goats, 9 cows and some chickens. He has 4 times as many goats as cows and 2 times as many goats as chickens. How many chickens does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the number of goats Mr. Rainwater has.",
    "According to the problem, Mr. Rainwater has 9 cows.",
    "He has 4 times as many goats as cows.",
    "To find the number of goats, multiply the number of cows by 4.",
    "9 cows \u00d7 4 = 36 goats",
    "Now, let's figure out the number of chickens.",
    "The problem states that Mr. Rainwater has 2 times as many goats as chickens.",
    "We can write this as: Number of goats = 2 \u00d7 Number of chickens.",
    "We know that the number of goats is 36.",
    "So, 36 = 2 \u00d7 Number of chickens.",
    "To find the number of chickens, divide 36 by 2.",
    "Number of chickens = 36 / 2 = 18"
  ],
  "solution": "18"
