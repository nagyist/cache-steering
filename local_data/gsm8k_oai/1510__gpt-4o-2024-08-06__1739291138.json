  "query": "Ben's hockey team is 60% boys and the rest are girls. Half the girls are juniors and the other half are seniors. If the team has 50 players, how many junior girls are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many players on the team are girls.",
    "The problem states that 60% of the team are boys, which means the remaining 40% are girls.",
    "To find the number of girls, I calculate 40% of 50 players.",
    "40% of 50 is calculated as 0.40 * 50.",
    "0.40 * 50 is 20, so there are 20 girls on the team.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these girls are juniors.",
    "The problem states that half the girls are juniors and the other half are seniors.",
    "Half of the 20 girls are juniors, so I calculate half of 20.",
    "Half of 20 is calculated as 20 / 2.",
    "20 / 2 is 10."
