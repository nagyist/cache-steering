  "query": "Barbara Blackburn can type 212 words per minute.  Due to Carpal tunnel syndrome, Barbara cannot use her left hand for a while so her typing speed is now 40 words less per minute. If she is supposed to type a document with 3440 words, how many minutes will it take her to finish typing the document?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate Barbara's new typing speed after the reduction due to Carpal tunnel syndrome.",
    "Her original typing speed is 212 words per minute.",
    "The reduction in her typing speed is 40 words per minute.",
    "So, I subtract 40 from 212 to find her new typing speed.",
    "212 - 40 = 172 words per minute.",
    "Now I need to determine how many minutes it will take her to type a 3440-word document at her new speed.",
    "I can use the formula: time = total words / typing speed.",
    "Plugging in the values, time = 3440 words / 172 words per minute.",
    "Doing the division, 3440 \u00f7 172 = 20.",
    "It will take Barbara 20 minutes to finish typing the document."

  "solution": "20"
