  "query": "Free Christmas decorations are being given out to families. Each box of decorations contains 4 pieces of tinsel, 1 Christmas tree and 5 snow globes. If 11 families receive a box of decorations and another box is given to the community center, how many decorations have been handed out?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many boxes of decorations are handed out. There are 11 families receiving a box each and 1 additional box given to the community center.",
    "So, the total number of boxes of decorations handed out is 11 (families) + 1 (community center) = 12 boxes.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of decorations in one box. Each box contains 4 pieces of tinsel, 1 Christmas tree, and 5 snow globes.",
    "Adding these together, each box has 4 + 1 + 5 = 10 decorations.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of decorations handed out by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of decorations in each box.",
    "So, 12 boxes \u00d7 10 decorations per box = 120 decorations."
