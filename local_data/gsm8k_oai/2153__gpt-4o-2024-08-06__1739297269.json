  "query": "Felicia is baking a cake. She needs 2 cups of flour, a cup of white sugar, a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a 1/2 cup of oil. Her only measuring scoop is 1/4 cup. How many times does she fill it to complete the measurements?",
  "steps": [
    "Felicia needs to measure 2 cups of flour.",
    "1 cup is equivalent to 4 quarters (1/4 cups).",
    "So, 2 cups of flour is equivalent to 2 x 4 = 8 times filling the 1/4 cup.",
    "Next, Felicia needs 1 cup of white sugar.",
    "1 cup of white sugar is equivalent to 4 quarters (1/4 cups).",
    "So, she fills the 1/4 cup 4 times for the white sugar.",
    "Felicia also needs 1/4 cup of brown sugar.",
    "Since she needs exactly 1/4 cup of brown sugar, she fills the scoop 1 time for that.",
    "Finally, Felicia needs 1/2 cup of oil.",
    "1/2 cup is equivalent to 2 quarters (1/4 cups).",
    "So, she fills the 1/4 cup 2 times for the oil.",
    "Now, let's add up all the times she filled the scoop: 8 (flour) + 4 (white sugar) + 1 (brown sugar) + 2 (oil).",
    "The total number of times she fills the 1/4 cup is 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 15 times."
