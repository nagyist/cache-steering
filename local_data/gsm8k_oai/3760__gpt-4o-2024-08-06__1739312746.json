  "query": "Clementine, Jake, and Tory make cookies for the school bake sale. Clementine baked 72 cookies. Jake baked twice as many cookies as Clementine. Tory baked half as many cookies as Jake and Clementine combined. They sell their cookies for $2 each. If they sell all their cookies, how much money do they make?",
  "steps": [
    "Clementine baked 72 cookies.",
    "Jake baked twice as many cookies as Clementine, so Jake baked 2 * 72 = 144 cookies.",
    "The total number of cookies baked by Clementine and Jake is 72 + 144 = 216 cookies.",
    "Tory baked half as many cookies as Jake and Clementine combined, so Tory baked 216 / 2 = 108 cookies.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cookies baked by all three: Clementine, Jake, and Tory.",
    "The total number of cookies is 72 (Clementine) + 144 (Jake) + 108 (Tory) = 324 cookies.",
    "Each cookie sells for $2.",
    "If they sell all 324 cookies, the total amount of money they make is 324 * 2 = 648 dollars."

  "solution": "648"
