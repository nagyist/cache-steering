  "query": "James and Lisa ordered 2 small pizzas. Each pizza has 6 slices. James ate 2/3 of all the slices. How many slices of pizza did James eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of slices from the two pizzas.",
    "Each pizza has 6 slices, and there are 2 pizzas.",
    "So, 2 pizzas x 6 slices per pizza = 12 slices in total.",
    "James ate 2/3 of all the slices.",
    "To find out how many slices James ate, I need to calculate 2/3 of 12 slices.",
    "2/3 of 12 slices is calculated as (2/3) x 12.",
    "(2/3) x 12 = (2 x 12) / 3.",
    "2 x 12 = 24.",
    "Next, I divide 24 by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8."
