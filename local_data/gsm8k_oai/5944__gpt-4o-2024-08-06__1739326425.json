  "query": "A farmer is checking his fields to make sure all of his crops are growing as they should. Rows of corn stalks should produce 9 corn cobs each, and rows of potatoes should produce 30 potatoes each. As he\u2019s checking crop quality, he notices that there are more pests than usual and they have destroyed some of his crops. He thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed by the pests. If the farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks and 5 rows of potatoes, how many crops does the farmer still have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many corn cobs the farmer should have without any destruction. Since each row of corn produces 9 corn cobs and there are 10 rows, I multiply 9 by 10.",
    "9 corn cobs/row * 10 rows = 90 corn cobs.",
    "Next, I calculate how many potatoes the farmer should have without any destruction. Since each row of potatoes produces 30 potatoes and there are 5 rows, I multiply 30 by 5.",
    "30 potatoes/row * 5 rows = 150 potatoes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of crops before any destruction. This includes both the corn cobs and the potatoes.",
    "90 corn cobs + 150 potatoes = 240 total crops.",
    "The farmer mentioned that half of his crops have been destroyed by pests. Therefore, to find out how many crops remain, I need to find half of the total number of crops that haven't been destroyed.",
    "Since half of the crops have been destroyed, the other half are still intact. I calculate half of 240.",
    "240 total crops / 2 = 120 crops remaining."

  "solution": "120"
