  "steps": [
    "Jeremy received $50 from his uncle to spend on basketball equipment.",
    "Let's calculate the total cost of the 5 jerseys. Each jersey costs $2, so for 5 jerseys, we multiply 5 by 2.",
    "5 jerseys * $2 per jersey = $10.",
    "Next, we account for the cost of the basketball, which is $18.",
    "Now, let's add the cost of the pair of shorts, which is $8.",
    "To find the total amount spent, we add the costs of all items: $10 for the jerseys + $18 for the basketball + $8 for the shorts.",
    "$10 + $18 + $8 = $36.",
    "Jeremy spent a total of $36.",
    "To find out how much money Jeremy has left, subtract the total amount spent from the amount he was given.",
    "$50 (initial amount) - $36 (amount spent) = $14.",
    "Jeremy has $14 left."
