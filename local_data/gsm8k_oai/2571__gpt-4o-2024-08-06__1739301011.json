  "query": "Eric has a chicken farm with 4 chickens. His chickens lay 3 eggs each day. If Eric collects all the eggs after 3 days, then how many eggs will Eric have collected?",
  "steps": [
    "Eric has 4 chickens.",
    "Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day.",
    "I need to calculate how many eggs the chickens lay in one day.",
    "Multiply the number of chickens (4) by the number of eggs per chicken per day (3).",
    "4 chickens * 3 eggs per chicken = 12 eggs per day.",
    "Now, calculate how many eggs Eric collects over 3 days.",
    "Multiply the number of eggs per day (12) by the number of days (3).",
    "12 eggs per day * 3 days = 36 eggs."
