  "query": "Danielle bought a new house for $280k. She paid a $40k deposit on the house, and pays the rest using a mortgage that is spread out over 10 years. Danielle makes equal payments every month and at the end of the 10 years, the entire balance will be paid off. How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Danielle took on the mortgage, which is the total house price minus the deposit.",
    "The house price is $280k, and the deposit is $40k.",
    "So, the mortgage amount is $280k - $40k.",
    "I calculate $280k - $40k, which equals $240k.",
    "Danielle's mortgage is for $240,000.",
    "Next, I must determine how many payments Danielle will make over the 10 years.",
    "A mortgage of 10 years with monthly payments means 10 years \u00d7 12 months/year.",
    "I calculate 10 \u00d7 12, which equals 120 months.",
    "Danielle will make 120 monthly payments to pay off the mortgage.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much each monthly payment is.",
    "The total amount paid through the mortgage is $240k, and this is spread across 120 monthly payments.",
    "So I divide $240,000 by 120 to find the monthly payment.",
    "I calculate $240,000 \u00f7 120 = $2,000.",
    "So, Danielle pays $2,000 each month.",
    "Since we need the answer in thousands of dollars, I convert $2,000 to thousands.",
    "$2,000 is equivalent to 2 in thousands of dollars."
