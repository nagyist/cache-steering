  "query": "A dime has the same value as 10 pennies and a nickel has the same value as 5 pennies. How many pennies will Grace have by exchanging her 10 dimes and 10 nickels?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by calculating the total value of the dimes in terms of pennies.",
    "A single dime equals 10 pennies.",
    "Grace has 10 dimes.",
    "Multiply 10 dimes by 10 pennies per dime: 10 * 10 = 100.",
    "So, 10 dimes are worth 100 pennies.",
    "Next, calculate the total value of the nickels in terms of pennies.",
    "A single nickel equals 5 pennies.",
    "Grace has 10 nickels.",
    "Multiply 10 nickels by 5 pennies per nickel: 10 * 5 = 50.",
    "So, 10 nickels are worth 50 pennies.",
    "Now, add the value of the dimes and nickels to find the total number of pennies.",
    "The total is 100 pennies from dimes plus 50 pennies from nickels.",
    "Add these values together: 100 + 50 = 150."

  "solution": "150"
