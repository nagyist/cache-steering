  "query": "Sandra wants to buy some sweets. She saved $10 for this purpose. Her mother gave her an additional $4, and her father twice as much as her mother. One candy costs $0.5, and one jelly bean $0.2. She wants to buy 14 candies and 20 jelly beans. How much money will she be left with after the purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "Sandra initially saved $10.",
    "Her mother gave her an additional $4.",
    "Her father gave her twice as much as her mother, which means he gave her 2 x $4 = $8.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sandra has: $10 + $4 + $8.",
    "Adding it together gives Sandra a total of $22.",
    "Sandra wants to buy 14 candies. Each candy costs $0.5. The total cost for candies is 14 x $0.5.",
    "Multiplying gives a total cost for candies of $7.",
    "Sandra also wants to buy 20 jelly beans. Each jelly bean costs $0.2. The total cost for jelly beans is 20 x $0.2.",
    "Multiplying gives a total cost for jelly beans of $4.",
    "Now, let's find out the total cost for candies and jelly beans together: $7 + $4.",
    "Adding these costs gives a total of $11 for all the sweets.",
    "Sandra initially had $22 and spent $11 on the sweets. To find out how much money Sandra is left with, subtract the amount spent from the total amount she had.",
    "Sandra is left with $22 - $11.",
    "Finally, calculating the remaining money gives us $11."
