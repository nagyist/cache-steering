  "query": "In a studio audience of 100 people, 40% of these people have an envelope taped underneath their chairs.  20% of these people will have \"You Won\" in their envelope, the rest will have empty envelopes.  How many people will win a prize?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of people in the audience. The problem states there are 100 people in the audience.",
    "Next, calculate how many people have envelopes taped under their chairs. Since 40% of the 100 people have envelopes, I will multiply 100 by 0.4.",
    "100 multiplied by 0.4 equals 40. So, 40 people have envelopes under their chairs.",
    "Now calculate how many of these 40 people will have \"You Won\" in their envelope. The problem states that 20% of the people with envelopes will have \"You Won\", so I multiply 40 by 0.2.",
    "40 multiplied by 0.2 equals 8. Therefore, 8 people will win a prize."

  "solution": "8"
