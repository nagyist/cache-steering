  "query": "Vivi bought fabric to make new pillows for her bed. She spent $75 on checkered fabric and $45 on plain fabric. If both fabrics cost $7.50 per yard, how many total yards of fabric did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much she spent on both types of fabric together.",
    "She spent $75 on checkered fabric.",
    "She spent $45 on plain fabric.",
    "The total amount spent on both fabrics is $75 + $45.",
    "Calculating $75 + $45 gives me a total amount of $120.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of yards of fabric she bought.",
    "Both fabrics cost $7.50 per yard.",
    "To find the total number of yards she bought, I divide the total amount spent by the cost per yard.",
    "So, I divide $120 by $7.50.",
    "$120 \u00f7 $7.50 equals 16.",
    "Thus, Vivi bought a total of 16 yards of fabric."
