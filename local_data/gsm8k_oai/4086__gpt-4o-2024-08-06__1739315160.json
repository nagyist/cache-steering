  "query": "The number of dishes Sandrine washed was 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked. Also, the number of bananas Charles cooked was 3 times the number of pears he picked. If Charles picked 50 pears, how many dishes did Sandrine wash?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bananas Charles cooked.",
    "I know that the number of bananas Charles cooked is 3 times the number of pears he picked.",
    "Charles picked 50 pears.",
    "Therefore, the number of bananas Charles cooked is 3 times 50.",
    "3 times 50 equals 150.",
    "So, Charles cooked 150 bananas.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many dishes Sandrine washed.",
    "The number of dishes Sandrine washed is 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked.",
    "Charles cooked 150 bananas.",
    "Therefore, Sandrine washed 150 + 10 dishes.",
    "150 + 10 equals 160."
  ],
  "solution": "160"
