  "query": "Mary is making a spinach quiche. She takes 40 ounces of raw spinach and cooks it until it's 20% of its initial volume. If she mixes the spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs, what is the total volume of the quiche?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary starts with 40 ounces of raw spinach.",
    "When she cooks it, the spinach reduces to 20% of its initial volume.",
    "To find the cooked weight of the spinach, calculate 20% of 40 ounces.",
    "20% of 40 ounces is 0.2 * 40 = 8 ounces.",
    "Next, she adds 6 ounces of cream cheese to the cooked spinach.",
    "She also adds 4 ounces of eggs to the mixture.",
    "Now, add these amounts to determine the total volume of the mixture.",
    "The cooked spinach is 8 ounces, the cream cheese is 6 ounces, and the eggs are 4 ounces.",
    "The total volume is 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 ounces."
