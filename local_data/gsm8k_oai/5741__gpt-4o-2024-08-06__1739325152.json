  "query": "Keesha wants to get her hair and nails done for prom.  Hair updos cost $50 and manicures cost $30.  How much will these two services cost her with a 20% tip for each beautician?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the hair updo and manicure without tips.",
    "The hair updo costs $50.",
    "The manicure costs $30.",
    "To find the total cost before tips, I add the cost of the hair updo and the manicure: $50 + $30 = $80.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the tip for each service separately, then add them to the total cost.",
    "The tip for the hair updo is 20% of $50.",
    "20% of $50 can be calculated as (20/100) * $50 = $10.",
    "The tip for the manicure is 20% of $30.",
    "20% of $30 can be calculated as (20/100) * $30 = $6.",
    "Now, I add both tips together: $10 + $6 = $16.",
    "Finally, I add the total tips to the initial total cost to get the final amount Keesha will pay: $80 + $16 = $96."
