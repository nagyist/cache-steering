  "steps": [
    "Anya washes 32 hairs down the drain when she washes her hair.",
    "When Anya brushes her hair, she brushes out half of what she washes.",
    "Half of 32 hairs is 32 / 2 = 16 hairs.",
    "So Anya loses 32 hairs from washing and 16 hairs from brushing.",
    "Total hair loss is 32 + 16 = 48 hairs.",
    "Anya needs to end up with one more hair than she started with.",
    "This means she needs to regain the 48 lost hairs plus 1 extra hair.",
    "To have one more hair than she started with, she should grow back 48 + 1 = 49 hairs."
