  "query": "Madeline has 10 flowers. If 4 flowers are red, 2 flowers are white, and the rest are blue, what percentage of flowers are blue?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the number of blue flowers, I first need to find how many flowers are accounted for by red and white flowers.",
    "Madeline has 4 red flowers and 2 white flowers.",
    "Adding these together, 4 + 2 gives 6 flowers.",
    "Madeline has 10 flowers in total.",
    "To find the number of blue flowers, subtract the number of red and white flowers from the total: 10 - 6.",
    "So there are 4 blue flowers.",
    "To find the percentage of flowers that are blue, divide the number of blue flowers by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100.",
    "Divide 4 blue flowers by the total of 10 flowers: 4/10.",
    "This results in 0.4.",
    "Multiply 0.4 by 100 to convert to a percentage: 0.4 * 100.",
    "This results in 40.",
    "Therefore, the percentage of flowers that are blue is 40%."
