  "query": "Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?",
  "steps": [
    "The total price of the meal is $67.",
    "They have a coupon for $4.",
    "I need to subtract the coupon value from the total price to find the discounted price.",
    "$67 - $4 equals $63.",
    "The discounted price of the meal is $63.",
    "There are three people: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan.",
    "They are splitting the cost evenly among three people.",
    "I need to divide the total discounted price by 3 to find out how much each person needs to pay.",
    "$63 divided by 3 equals $21."
