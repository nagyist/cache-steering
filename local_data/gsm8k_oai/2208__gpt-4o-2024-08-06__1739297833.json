  "query": "Steve is building a bench for the playground and needs 6 lengths of wood that measure 4 feet and 2 lengths of wood that measure 2 feet. How many feet of wood does Steve need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Steve needs 6 lengths of wood that each measure 4 feet.",
    "To find the total feet of wood for the 4-foot lengths, I multiply 6 (the number of lengths) by 4 (the length of each piece).",
    "6 times 4 is 24.",
    "Steve also needs 2 lengths of wood that each measure 2 feet.",
    "To find the total feet of wood for the 2-foot lengths, I multiply 2 (the number of lengths) by 2 (the length of each piece).",
    "2 times 2 is 4.",
    "Now, I add the total feet of wood for the 4-foot lengths and the 2-foot lengths together.",
    "24 (feet from the 4-foot pieces) plus 4 (feet from the 2-foot pieces) equals 28 feet."

  "solution": "28"
