  "steps": [
    "Bob buys 50 feet of rope initially.",
    "He uses a 5th of it for a piece of art.",
    "A 5th of 50 feet is 50 / 5 = 10 feet.",
    "After using 10 feet, he has 50 - 10 = 40 feet left.",
    "Bob gives half of the remaining 40 feet to his friend.",
    "Half of 40 feet is 40 / 2 = 20 feet.",
    "After giving away 20 feet, Bob has 20 feet left.",
    "Bob cuts the remaining 20 feet into 2-foot sections.",
    "The number of 2-foot sections in 20 feet is 20 / 2 = 10 sections."
