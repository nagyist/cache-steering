  "query": "A patient is receiving treatment through a saline drip which makes 20 drops per minute. If the treatment lasts 2 hours, and every 100 drops equal 5 ml of liquid, how many milliliters of treatment will the patient receive after the 2 hours have passed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how many minutes are in 2 hours.",
    "2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, determine how many drops fall in 120 minutes at the rate of 20 drops per minute.",
    "The number of drops is 20 drops/minute * 120 minutes = 2400 drops.",
    "Next, calculate how many groups of 100 drops are in 2400 drops because every 100 drops equal 5 ml.",
    "Divide 2400 drops by 100 to find the number of groups, which is 2400 / 100 = 24 groups.",
    "Now, convert these groups into milliliters. Each group represents 5 ml.",
    "24 groups * 5 ml/group = 120 ml."
  ],
  "solution": "120"
