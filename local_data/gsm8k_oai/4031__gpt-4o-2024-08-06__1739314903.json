  "query": "Cheryl placed 300 strawberries into 5 buckets. After she did that she decided to take 20 out of each bucket so they wouldn't get smashed. How many strawberries were left in each bucket?",
  "steps": [
    "Cheryl initially placed 300 strawberries into 5 buckets.",
    "To find out how many strawberries she placed in each bucket initially, I should divide the total number of strawberries by the number of buckets.",
    "300 strawberries divided by 5 buckets is 60 strawberries per bucket.",
    "Cheryl then decided to take 20 strawberries out of each bucket.",
    "To find out how many strawberries were left in each bucket, I need to subtract the 20 strawberries she removed from the 60 strawberries initially in each bucket.",
    "60 strawberries - 20 strawberries = 40 strawberries.",
    "Therefore, there are 40 strawberries left in each bucket."
