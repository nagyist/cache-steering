  "query": "Jacoby wants to save money for a trip to Brickville. He needs to have $5000 total to go on his trip. He works a job earning $20 per hour and works 10 hours. He then finds he can sell cookies for $4 each, and he sells 24 pieces of cookies. With the money he has so far, he buys a lottery ticket for $10 and wins $500. Finally, he gets $500 from both of his sisters as a gift. How much more, in dollars, does Jacob need to go to Brickville?",
  "steps": [
    "Jacoby works for 10 hours at a rate of $20 per hour.",
    "Calculating his earnings from work: 10 hours * $20/hour = $200.",
    "Next, he sells cookies at $4 each and sells 24 pieces.",
    "Calculating his earnings from selling cookies: 24 cookies * $4/cookie = $96.",
    "Adding his work and cookie earnings: $200 + $96 = $296.",
    "He buys a lottery ticket for $10, so subtracting that cost: $296 - $10 = $286.",
    "He wins $500 from the lottery, so adding that: $286 + $500 = $786.",
    "Both of his sisters give him $500 each, adding that: $786 + $500 + $500 = $1786.",
    "Jacoby needs $5000 total for his trip.",
    "Subtracting what he has from what he needs: $5000 - $1786 = $3214."

  "solution": "3214"
