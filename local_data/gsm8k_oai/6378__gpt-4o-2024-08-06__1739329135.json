  "query": "All 20 of Grant\u2019s baby teeth have fallen out and he has a total of $54 from the tooth fairy. Every time he lost a tooth, he put it under his pillow for the tooth fairy, except for one that he dropped on the way home from school and another he swallowed accidentally. The tooth fairy left Grant $20 when he lost his first tooth. How much did the tooth fairy leave him per tooth after his first tooth, assuming equal money exchanged for each tooth thereafter?",
  "steps": [
    "Grant lost a total of 20 baby teeth.",
    "Of these 20 teeth, 1 was dropped and 1 was swallowed, so he only received money for 18 teeth.",
    "For his first tooth, the tooth fairy left him $20.",
    "The total amount of money Grant received is $54.",
    "After receiving $20 for his first tooth, Grant received $54 - $20 = $34 for the remaining 17 teeth.",
    "To find out how much the tooth fairy left him per tooth after the first one, divide the $34 by the 17 remaining teeth.",
    "$34 divided by 17 equals $2."
