  "query": "Alison bought some storage tubs for her garage. She bought 3 large ones and 6 small ones, for $48 total. If the large tubs cost $6, how much do the small ones cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Alison bought 3 large tubs.",
    "The cost of each large tub is $6.",
    "To find the total cost of the large tubs, I multiply the number of large tubs by the cost of each.",
    "3 large tubs * $6 per tub = $18",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much of the total $48 was spent on the large tubs.",
    "$18 was spent on the large tubs.",
    "To find out how much was spent on the small tubs, I'll subtract the large tubs' cost from the total cost.",
    "$48 total - $18 for large tubs = $30 for small tubs",
    "Alison bought 6 small tubs.",
    "To find the cost of each small tub, I divide the total spent on small tubs by the number of small tubs.",
    "$30 total for small tubs / 6 small tubs = $5 per small tub"
