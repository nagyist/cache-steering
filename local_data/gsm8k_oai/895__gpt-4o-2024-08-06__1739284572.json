  "query": "Henrietta is repainting her house. The walls in the living room take up 600 square feet. She has three bedrooms. The walls in each bedroom take up 400 square feet. If one gallon of paint can cover 600 square feet, how many gallons of paint does Henrietta need to paint her house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total area that needs to be painted in the living room.",
    "The living room has walls that take up 600 square feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total area that needs to be painted in all the bedrooms.",
    "There are three bedrooms, each with walls that take up 400 square feet.",
    "The total area for the bedrooms is 3 bedrooms * 400 square feet/bedroom = 1200 square feet.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total area that needs to be painted in the entire house.",
    "The total area is the sum of the living room and the bedrooms: 600 square feet + 1200 square feet = 1800 square feet.",
    "Next, I will determine how many gallons of paint are needed for 1800 square feet.",
    "One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet.",
    "To find the number of gallons needed, I divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon: 1800 square feet / 600 square feet/gallon = 3 gallons."
