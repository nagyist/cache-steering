  "query": "A lumberjack is chopping down trees so he can sell firewood. Each tree he chops produces 4 logs each, and each log is then chopped into 5 pieces of firewood. If the lumberjack has chopped 500 pieces of firewood, how many trees did he chop down?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pieces of firewood each tree produces.",
    "Each tree produces 4 logs.",
    "Each log is chopped into 5 pieces of firewood.",
    "Therefore, each tree produces 4 logs * 5 pieces of firewood per log = 20 pieces of firewood.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many trees are needed to produce 500 pieces of firewood.",
    "The number of trees required is the total number of firewood pieces divided by the number of pieces each tree produces.",
    "This means I have to divide 500 pieces of firewood by 20 pieces per tree.",
    "500 divided by 20 equals 25."
  ],
  "solution": "25"
