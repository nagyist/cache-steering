  "query": "Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?",
  "steps": [
    "Anna spent 1/4 of her money, so the amount she has left is 3/4 of her original amount.",
    "She has $24 left, which represents 3/4 of her original amount.",
    "Let's represent the original amount of money she had as x.",
    "Since $24 is 3/4 of x, I can set up the equation: (3/4)x = 24.",
    "To find x, I need to solve the equation: (3/4)x = 24.",
    "To isolate x, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.",
    "Multiplying both sides by 4/3 gives: x = 24 * (4/3).",
    "Calculating 24 * (4/3), I multiply 24 by 4 to get 96, and then divide by 3 to get 32.",
    "So, x = 32.",
    "Anna originally had $32."
