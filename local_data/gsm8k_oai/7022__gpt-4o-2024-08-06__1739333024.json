  "query": "Suki bought 6.5 bags of coffee beans that each weighed 22 kilograms. Jimmy bought 4.5 bags of coffee beans that each weighed 18 kilograms. Suki and Jimmy combined their coffee beans and then repackaged them into 8-kilogram containers. How many containers did they use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many kilograms of coffee beans Suki bought.",
    "Suki bought 6.5 bags, and each bag weighed 22 kilograms.",
    "I calculate the total weight of the coffee beans Suki bought: 6.5 bags * 22 kg/bag.",
    "Multiplying 6.5 by 22 gives me 143 kilograms.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many kilograms of coffee beans Jimmy bought.",
    "Jimmy bought 4.5 bags, and each bag weighed 18 kilograms.",
    "I calculate the total weight of the coffee beans Jimmy bought: 4.5 bags * 18 kg/bag.",
    "Multiplying 4.5 by 18 gives me 81 kilograms.",
    "Now, I find the total weight of coffee beans combined by adding the weights from Suki and Jimmy.",
    "143 kg (Suki's coffee) + 81 kg (Jimmy's coffee) equals 224 kilograms.",
    "I need to determine how many 8-kilogram containers they used to repack 224 kilograms of coffee beans.",
    "I divide the total weight of 224 kilograms by 8 kilograms per container.",
    "224 divided by 8 equals 28.",
    "Therefore, they used 28 containers."
