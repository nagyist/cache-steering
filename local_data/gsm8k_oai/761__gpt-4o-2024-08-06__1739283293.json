    "Joan starts with a total of $60.",
    "Joan plans to purchase 2 containers of hummus at $5 each.",
    "Calculating the cost for 2 containers of hummus: 2 * $5 = $10.",

    "Calculating the total cost of hummus, chicken, bacon, and vegetables: $10 (hummus) + $20 (chicken) + $10 (bacon) + $10 (vegetables) = $50.",
