  "query": "A camping site recorded a total of 150 campers for the past three weeks. Two weeks ago, there were 40 campers which was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago. How many campers were there last week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total number of campers recorded for the past three weeks, which is 150.",
    "I'm given that two weeks ago, there were 40 campers.",
    "It is mentioned that two weeks ago, the number of campers was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago.",
    "So, three weeks ago, the number of campers was 40 - 10 = 30.",
    "Now I have the number of campers for three weeks ago, which is 30, and for two weeks ago, which is 40.",
    "The total number of campers for the three weeks is 150.",
    "To find out the number of campers last week, I can set up the equation: 30 (three weeks ago) + 40 (two weeks ago) + x (last week) = 150.",
    "By simplifying, I have 70 + x = 150.",
    "To solve for x, the number of campers last week, I'll subtract 70 from both sides: x = 150 - 70.",
    "This gives me x = 80."

  "solution": "80"
