  "query": "If there are 8 slices in a large pizza, how many slices will remain if Mary orders 2 large pizzas and eats 7 slices?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many slices there are in total from 2 large pizzas.",
    "Each large pizza has 8 slices.",
    "If Mary orders 2 large pizzas, she gets 2 x 8 slices.",
    "2 times 8 is 16, so Mary has 16 slices in total.",
    "Mary eats 7 slices.",
    "To find out how many slices remain, I need to subtract the number of slices Mary eats from the total number of slices.",
    "16 total slices minus 7 eaten slices equals 9 remaining slices."

  "solution": "9"
