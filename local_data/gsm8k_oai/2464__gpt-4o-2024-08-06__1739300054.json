  "query": "A mother is making her own bubble mix out of dish soap and water for her two-year-old son.  The recipe she is following calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water.  If the container she hopes to store the bubble mix in can hold 40 ounces of liquid, and there are 8 ounces in a cup of water, how many tablespoons of soap should she add to the container (assuming that the soap itself doesn't count towards the capacity of the container)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how many cups of water the 40-ounce container can hold.",
    "Since there are 8 ounces in a cup, I divide 40 ounces by 8 ounces per cup to find the number of cups.",
    "40 ounces \u00f7 8 ounces per cup = 5 cups.",
    "The recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water.",
    "If we have 5 cups of water, we need to multiply the number of cups by the tablespoons of soap per cup.",
    "5 cups \u00d7 3 tablespoons of soap per cup = 15 tablespoons of soap.",
    "I should add 15 tablespoons of soap to the 40-ounce container."

  "solution": "15"
