  "query": "Janet wanted to move out of her parents' house and rent her own apartment.  She had $2,225 saved.  She found an apartment that cost $1,250 per month that was perfect for her.  The landlord said that she needed to be able to pay 2 months' rent in advance to rent the place and she would also need to put down a deposit of $500.  How much more money did Janet need in order to rent the apartment?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Janet needs to pay at the start.",
    "Janet needs to pay 2 months' rent in advance.",
    "The rent per month is $1,250.",
    "So, 2 months' rent would be 2 times $1,250.",
    "Calculating this: 2 * $1,250 equals $2,500.",
    "Additionally, Janet needs to pay a deposit of $500.",
    "To find the total upfront cost, I add the 2 months' rent and the deposit together.",
    "$2,500 (two months' rent) + $500 (deposit) equals $3,000.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much more money Janet needs.",
    "Janet currently has $2,225 saved.",
    "I subtract her current savings from the total amount required.",
    "$3,000 (total amount needed) - $2,225 (amount saved) equals $775.",
    "So, Janet needs $775 more to rent the apartment."

  "solution": "775"
