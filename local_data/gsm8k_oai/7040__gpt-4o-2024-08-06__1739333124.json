  "query": "There are 20 dolphins in the aqua park. One-fourth of the dolphins are fully trained. Two-third of the remaining dolphins are currently in training and the rest will be trained next month. How many dolphins will be trained next month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dolphins are fully trained.",
    "One-fourth of the 20 dolphins are fully trained.",
    "Calculate one-fourth of 20: 20 divided by 4 equals 5.",
    "There are 5 fully trained dolphins.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many dolphins are not fully trained.",
    "Subtract the number of fully trained dolphins from the total dolphins: 20 minus 5 equals 15.",
    "There are 15 dolphins that are not fully trained.",
    "Two-thirds of these 15 dolphins are currently in training.",
    "Calculate two-thirds of 15: 15 divided by 3 equals 5, then 5 times 2 equals 10.",
    "There are 10 dolphins currently in training.",
    "Now, find out how many dolphins will be trained next month.",
    "Subtract the number of dolphins currently in training from the dolphins that are not fully trained: 15 minus 10 equals 5.",
    "Therefore, there will be 5 dolphins trained next month."
