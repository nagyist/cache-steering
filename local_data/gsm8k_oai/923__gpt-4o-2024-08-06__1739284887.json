  "query": "John has to get a new blanket.  He decides to have a 7 foot by 8-foot quilt made.  The quilt costs $40 per square foot.  How much does his quilt cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the area of the quilt in square feet.",
    "The quilt is rectangular, and its dimensions are 7 feet by 8 feet.",
    "To find the area, I multiply the length by the width.",
    "Area = 7 feet * 8 feet.",
    "Calculating the multiplication: 7 * 8 = 56.",
    "The area of the quilt is 56 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to find out the cost of the quilt.",
    "The cost per square foot is given as $40.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the area by the cost per square foot.",
    "Cost = 56 square feet * $40 per square foot.",
    "Calculating the multiplication: 56 * 40.",
    "First, I can calculate 56 * 4 = 224.",
    "Since I multiplied 56 by 4, I now add a zero to find 56 * 40 = 2240.",
    "The total cost of the quilt is $2240."
  ],
  "solution": "2240"
