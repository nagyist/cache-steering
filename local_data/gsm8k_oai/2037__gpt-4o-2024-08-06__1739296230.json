  "query": "Rhonda, Sally, and Diane are members of their school's track team.  The three of them run the 600-meter relay race together. Rhonda runs the first 200 meters of the race, Sally runs the second 200 meters of the race, and Diane runs the final 200 meters of the race. Rhonda can run 200 meters in 24 seconds.  Sally takes two seconds longer to run the same distance, while Diane can run 200 meters three seconds faster than Rhonda.  How many seconds does it take for the three of them to run the 600-meter relay race?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm given that the race is split into three 200-meter segments run by Rhonda, Sally, and Diane.",
    "Rhonda's time for 200 meters is 24 seconds.",
    "Sally takes 2 seconds longer than Rhonda, so her time for 200 meters is 24 + 2 = 26 seconds.",
    "Diane runs 3 seconds faster than Rhonda, so her time for 200 meters is 24 - 3 = 21 seconds.",
    "To find the total time for the 600-meter relay, I need to sum their individual times: 24 seconds (Rhonda) + 26 seconds (Sally) + 21 seconds (Diane).",
    "Calculating the total time: 24 + 26 + 21 = 71 seconds."

  "solution": "71"
