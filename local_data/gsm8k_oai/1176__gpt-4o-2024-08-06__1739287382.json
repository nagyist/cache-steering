  "query": "Paula wants to ride the go-karts 1 time and the bumper cars 4 times. It costs 4 tickets to ride the go-karts and 5 tickets to ride the bumper cars. How many tickets does Paula need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tickets are required for one ride on the go-karts.",
    "The go-karts cost 4 tickets per ride.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tickets are required for one ride on the bumper cars.",
    "The bumper cars cost 5 tickets per ride.",
    "Paula wants to ride the go-karts 1 time.",
    "So, the total tickets needed for the go-karts is 1 ride * 4 tickets per ride = 4 tickets.",
    "Paula wants to ride the bumper cars 4 times.",
    "So, the total tickets needed for the bumper cars is 4 rides * 5 tickets per ride = 20 tickets.",
    "Now, I will add the tickets needed for the go-karts and the bumper cars together.",
    "4 tickets (go-karts) + 20 tickets (bumper cars) = 24 tickets."

  "solution": "24"
