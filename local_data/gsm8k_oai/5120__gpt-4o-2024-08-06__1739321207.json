  "query": "Marcy spends 12 minutes petting her cat and 1/3 of that time combing it. How many minutes does she spend with her cat in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much time Marcy spends combing her cat.",
    "I know she spends 1/3 of the time she spends petting her cat on combing.",
    "She spends 12 minutes petting her cat.",
    "1/3 of 12 minutes is calculated by dividing 12 by 3.",
    "12 divided by 3 is 4.",
    "So, Marcy spends 4 minutes combing her cat.",
    "Now, I need to find the total time she spends with her cat.",
    "To do this, I add the time spent petting and the time spent combing.",
    "12 minutes (petting) + 4 minutes (combing) equals 16 minutes."

  "solution": "16"
