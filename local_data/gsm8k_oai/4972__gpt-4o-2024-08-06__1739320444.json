  "query": "Amanda had 7 candy bars. She gave 3 to her sister. The next day, Amanda won some prize money and bought another 30 candy bars. She gave her sister 4 times as many candy bars as she did the first time. How many candy bars did Amanda keep for herself altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Amanda initially had 7 candy bars.",
    "She gave 3 candy bars to her sister, so 7 - 3 = 4 candy bars left.",
    "The next day, Amanda bought 30 more candy bars.",
    "Amanda now had 4 + 30 = 34 candy bars.",
    "She then gave her sister 4 times as many candy bars as she did the first time: 4 * 3 = 12 candy bars.",
    "After giving away 12 candy bars, Amanda had 34 - 12 = 22 candy bars left for herself."
