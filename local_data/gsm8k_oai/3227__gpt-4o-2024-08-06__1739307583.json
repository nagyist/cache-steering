  "query": "Raj's house has an area equal to 1,110 square feet. It has 4 bedrooms that each measure 11 x 11 feet. There are 2 bathrooms that are 6 x 8 feet each. The kitchen and living area complete the home and they have the same sized area. How many square feet is the area of the kitchen?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is 11 feet by 11 feet.",
    "11 times 11 equals 121 square feet for one bedroom.",
    "There are 4 bedrooms. Multiply the area of one bedroom by 4.",
    "121 square feet times 4 equals 484 square feet for all bedrooms combined.",
    "Next, calculate the area of one bathroom. The area of one bathroom is 6 feet by 8 feet.",
    "6 times 8 equals 48 square feet for one bathroom.",
    "There are 2 bathrooms. Multiply the area of one bathroom by 2.",
    "48 square feet times 2 equals 96 square feet for both bathrooms combined.",
    "Now, add the total area of the bedrooms and the bathrooms to determine the combined area of these rooms.",
    "484 square feet plus 96 square feet equals 580 square feet for the bedrooms and bathrooms combined.",
    "Subtract the combined area of the bedrooms and bathrooms from the total area of the house to find the combined area of the kitchen and living area.",
    "1,110 square feet minus 580 square feet equals 530 square feet for the kitchen and living area combined.",
    "The kitchen and living area have the same size. Divide the combined area by 2 to find the area of the kitchen.",
    "530 square feet divided by 2 equals 265 square feet for the kitchen."
