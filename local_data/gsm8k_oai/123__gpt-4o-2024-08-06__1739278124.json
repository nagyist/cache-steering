  "query": "A bulk warehouse is offering 48 cans of sparkling water for $12.00 a case.  The local grocery store is offering the same sparkling water for $6.00 and it only has 12 cans.  How much more expensive, per can, in cents, is this deal at the grocery store?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is being asked. I need to find the cost per can at both the warehouse and the grocery store, then compare them to find how much more expensive the grocery store is per can.",
    "Let's start with the warehouse. They are selling 48 cans for $12.00.",
    "To find the cost per can at the warehouse, I'll divide the total cost by the number of cans.",
    "$12.00 divided by 48 cans equals $0.25 per can at the warehouse.",
    "Now, I'll find the cost per can at the grocery store. The grocery store is selling 12 cans for $6.00.",
    "To find the cost per can at the grocery store, I'll divide the total cost by the number of cans.",
    "$6.00 divided by 12 cans equals $0.50 per can at the grocery store.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much more expensive the grocery store is per can compared to the warehouse.",
    "The difference in cost per can is $0.50 (grocery store) - $0.25 (warehouse).",
    "The difference is $0.25 per can.",
    "Since the question asks for the difference in cents, I need to convert $0.25 into cents.",
    "$0.25 equals 25 cents."
