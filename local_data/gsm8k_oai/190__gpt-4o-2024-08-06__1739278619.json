  "query": "Last year Dallas was 3 times the age of his sister Darcy. Darcy is twice as old as Dexter who is 8 right now. How old is Dallas now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine Dexter's age. Right now, Dexter is 8 years old.",
    "Darcy's current age is twice that of Dexter since the problem states Darcy is twice as old as Dexter.",
    "Calculate Darcy's age: 2 times 8 equals 16. So, Darcy is currently 16 years old.",
    "The problem states that last year, Dallas was 3 times the age of Darcy from last year.",
    "Last year, Darcy was one year younger than she is now. Since she is currently 16, last year she was 16 - 1 = 15 years old.",
    "Since last year, Dallas was 3 times Darcy's age at that time, calculate 3 times 15.",
    "3 times 15 equals 45. So, last year, Dallas was 45 years old.",
    "To find out how old Dallas is now, add 1 year to his age from last year.",
    "45 plus 1 equals 46. So, Dallas is now 46 years old."

  "solution": "46"
