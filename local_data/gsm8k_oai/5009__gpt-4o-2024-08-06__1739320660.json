  "query": "L\u00e9a bought one book for $16, three binders for $2 and six notebooks for $1. Calculate the total cost of her purchases.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by calculating the cost of one book. L\u00e9a bought one book for $16.",
    "The cost of the book is $16.",
    "Next, let's find out the total cost for the binders. She bought three binders for $2 each.",
    "For the binders, calculate 3 binders times $2 per binder: 3 * 2 = 6. So, the cost for the binders is $6.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total cost for the notebooks. L\u00e9a bought six notebooks for $1 each.",
    "For the notebooks, calculate 6 notebooks times $1 per notebook: 6 * 1 = 6. So, the cost for the notebooks is $6.",
    "Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent: the book cost is $16, the binders cost $6, and the notebooks cost $6.",
    "Add 16 + 6 + 6 to find the total cost: 16 + 6 = 22, then 22 + 6 = 28."
