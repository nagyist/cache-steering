  "steps": [
    "James buys 20 coins at $15 each.",
    "The total cost of the coins is 20 coins * $15 = $300.",
    "The value of the coins increases by 2/3.",
    "2/3 of $15 is calculated as (2/3) * $15.",
    "(2/3) * $15 = $10.",
    "The new value of each coin is $15 + $10 = $25.",
    "To recoup his original investment, James needs to make back $300.",
    "At the new value of $25 per coin, we calculate how many coins he needs to sell to get $300.",
    "$300 divided by $25 per coin = 12 coins."
