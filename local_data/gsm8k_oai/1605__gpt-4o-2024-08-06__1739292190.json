  "query": "There are 92 students altogether. Twenty of them ride the school bus home together, 5/8 of the remaining ride their own bike home, and the rest whose houses are near the school walk home. How many students are walking home?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of students who do not ride the school bus home.",
    "There are 92 students in total and 20 ride the bus. So, the number of students who do not ride the bus is 92 - 20.",
    "92 - 20 = 72. This means 72 students do not ride the school bus home.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these 72 students ride their own bike home.",
    "According to the problem, 5/8 of these students ride their own bike home.",
    "I calculate 5/8 of 72 to find how many students ride their own bike.",
    "5/8 * 72 = 45. This means 45 students ride their own bike home.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many students are left to walk home.",
    "There were 72 students who did not ride the school bus, and I found that 45 of them ride their own bikes.",
    "Therefore, the number of students who walk home is 72 - 45.",
    "72 - 45 = 27. So, 27 students walk home."

  "solution": "27"
