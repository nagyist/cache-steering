  "query": "Adlai has 2 dogs and 1 chicken. How many animal legs are there in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many legs one dog has.",
    "Dogs have four legs each.",
    "Adlai has 2 dogs.",
    "To find the total number of legs of the dogs, I multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog: 2 dogs \u00d7 4 legs/dog = 8 legs.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many legs a chicken has.",
    "Chickens have two legs each.",
    "Adlai has 1 chicken.",
    "To find the total number of legs of the chicken, I multiply the number of chickens by the number of legs per chicken: 1 chicken \u00d7 2 legs/chicken = 2 legs.",
    "Now, I have the total number of legs for the dogs and the chicken: 8 dog legs + 2 chicken legs.",
    "I add the number of dog legs and chicken legs together: 8 + 2 = 10 legs."
