  "query": "Jeanine bought 18 pencils and Clare bought half as many pencils. If Jeanine gave one third of his pencils to Abby, how many more pencils than Clare does Jeanine have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeanine bought 18 pencils.",
    "Clare bought half as many pencils as Jeanine.",
    "Half of 18 is 9, so Clare bought 9 pencils.",
    "Jeanine gave one third of her pencils to Abby.",
    "One third of 18 is 6, so Jeanine gave 6 pencils to Abby.",
    "After giving away 6 pencils, Jeanine has 18 - 6 = 12 pencils left.",
    "Now I need to find out how many more pencils Jeanine has than Clare.",
    "Jeanine has 12 pencils, and Clare has 9 pencils.",
    "12 - 9 = 3"
