  "query": "Out of the 200 apples in an orchard, 40 percent were rotten. Also, 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled. How many rotten apples in the orchard did not smell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of rotten apples.",
    "40 percent of 200 apples were rotten, so I multiply 200 by 0.40.",
    "200 * 0.40 = 80 rotten apples.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of those rotten apples smelled.",
    "70 percent of the rotten apples smelled, so I multiply 80 by 0.70.",
    "80 * 0.70 = 56 apples smelled.",
    "To find the number of rotten apples that did not smell, I subtract the number of smelly rotten apples from the total number of rotten apples.",
    "80 - 56 = 24 rotten apples did not smell."
