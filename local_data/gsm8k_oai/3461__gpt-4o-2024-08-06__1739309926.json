  "query": "In San Diego Zoo, the lion consumes 25 kilograms of meat, and the tiger consumes 20 kilograms of meat per day. If they have 90 kilograms of meat, how many days will the meats last?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total daily consumption of meat by both the lion and the tiger.",
    "The lion consumes 25 kilograms of meat per day.",
    "The tiger consumes 20 kilograms of meat per day.",
    "To find the total daily consumption, I will add the lion's and the tiger's daily consumption together.",
    "25 kilograms (lion) + 20 kilograms (tiger) = 45 kilograms of meat per day.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many days the 90 kilograms of meat will last for both animals.",
    "Divide the total amount of meat by the total daily consumption: 90 kilograms \u00f7 45 kilograms/day.",
    "90 \u00f7 45 = 2."

  "solution": "2"
