  "query": "My brother and I have thirty minutes to go to school, without being late. It takes us 15 minutes to arrive at the school gate, and another 6 minutes to get to the school building. How much time do we have to get to our room, without being late?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the total time it takes to get to the room at school.",
    "We have 30 minutes in total to get to school.",
    "Out of these 30 minutes, 15 minutes are needed to get to the school gate.",
    "So after reaching the school gate, 30 - 15 = 15 minutes remain.",
    "From the school gate, it takes another 6 minutes to reach the school building.",
    "Subtracting these 6 minutes from the remaining 15 minutes, 15 - 6 = 9 minutes remain.",
    "Therefore, we have 9 minutes left to get to the room without being late."

  "solution": "9"
