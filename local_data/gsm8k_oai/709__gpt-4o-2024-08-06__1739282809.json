    "Theresa has 3 sons, and each has a plate with 3 meatballs.",
    "Calculate how many meatballs each son eats: two-thirds of 3 meatballs per plate.",
    "Two-thirds of 3 meatballs is calculated as (2/3) * 3.",
    "Calculate (2/3) * 3: multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, then divide by 3.",
    "6 divided by 3 equals 2. Each son eats 2 meatballs.",
    "Determine how many meatballs are left on each plate. Originally 3 meatballs, and 2 have been eaten.",
    "3 meatballs - 2 meatballs = 1 meatball remains on each plate.",
    "Each of the 3 sons has 1 meatball left on their plate.",
    "Calculate the total number of remaining meatballs: 1 meatball per son times 3 sons.",
    "1 * 3 = 3 meatballs."
