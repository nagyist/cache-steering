  "query": "Every day, Lou works out by running three miles on a circular track that is one-quarter of a mile long.  His wife, Rosie, also runs on the same track at the same time as her husband, but she runs at twice the speed of her husband.  During their workout, how many times does Rosie circle the track?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many laps Lou runs to complete his workout. Lou runs three miles on a track that is one-quarter of a mile long.",
    "Since the track is one-quarter of a mile, Lou completes one lap per one-quarter mile.",
    "To find out how many laps he completes in 3 miles, I calculate 3 miles divided by one-quarter mile per lap.",
    "3 miles is the same as 12 quarters of a mile, because 3 divided by 0.25 equals 12.",
    "So, Lou runs 12 laps around the track to complete his workout.",
    "Next, I need to examine how fast Rosie runs and how many laps she completes in the same workout duration.",
    "Rosie runs at twice the speed of Lou, so she completes each lap in half the time it takes Lou.",
    "Since Lou runs 12 laps, and Rosie runs at twice his speed, she will run twice as many laps in the same amount of time.",
    "Thus, Rosie completes 2 times 12 laps.",
    "2 times 12 is 24."

  "solution": "24"
