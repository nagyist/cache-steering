  "query": "A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does it make in two hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many turns the wheel makes in one minute.",
    "The wheel makes 6 turns in 30 seconds.",
    "Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I should double the number of turns for 30 seconds to get the number of turns in one minute.",
    "So, in one minute, the wheel makes 6 x 2 = 12 turns.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many minutes are in two hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in one hour.",
    "Thus, in two hours, there are 60 x 2 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of turns the wheel makes in 120 minutes.",
    "The wheel makes 12 turns per minute.",
    "So, in 120 minutes, it will make 12 x 120 turns.",
    "Calculating 12 x 120 gives us 1440."

  "solution": "1440"
