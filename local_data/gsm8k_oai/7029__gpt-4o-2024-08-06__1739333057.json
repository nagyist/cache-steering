  "query": "Hilton had a box of 26 marbles that he was playing with.  He found 6 marbles while he was playing, but afterward realized that he had lost 10 marbles.  Lori felt bad and gave Hilton twice as many marbles as he lost.  How many marbles did Hilton have in the end?",
  "steps": [
    "Hilton started with 26 marbles.",
    "He found 6 more marbles, so I need to add these to his original count.",
    "26 marbles + 6 marbles = 32 marbles.",
    "Hilton then lost 10 marbles, so I need to subtract these from his current total.",
    "32 marbles - 10 marbles = 22 marbles.",
    "Lori gave Hilton twice as many marbles as he lost. Since he lost 10 marbles, Lori gave him 2 x 10 marbles = 20 marbles.",
    "I need to add these 20 marbles to Hilton's remaining marbles.",
    "22 marbles + 20 marbles = 42 marbles."
