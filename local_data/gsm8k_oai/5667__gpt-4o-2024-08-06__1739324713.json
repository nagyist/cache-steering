  "query": "Leonard and his brother Michael bought presents for their father. Leonard bought a wallet at $50 and two pairs of sneakers at $100 each pair, while Michael bought a backpack at $100 and two pairs of jeans at $50 each pair. How much did they spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total amount Leonard spent on his purchases.",
    "Leonard bought a wallet for $50.",
    "Leonard also bought two pairs of sneakers, each costing $100.",
    "The cost of the two pairs of sneakers is $100 multiplied by 2, which equals $200.",
    "Adding the cost of the wallet and the sneakers, Leonard spent $50 + $200 = $250.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total amount Michael spent on his purchases.",
    "Michael bought a backpack for $100.",
    "Michael also bought two pairs of jeans, each costing $50.",
    "The cost of the two pairs of jeans is $50 multiplied by 2, which equals $100.",
    "Adding the cost of the backpack and the jeans, Michael spent $100 + $100 = $200.",
    "Now, I will combine the amounts Leonard and Michael spent to find the total amount spent.",
    "Leonard spent $250 and Michael spent $200.",
    "The total amount spent by Leonard and Michael is $250 + $200 = $450."
