  "query": "While planning to finish reading a 140-page book in one week, Jessy initially decides to read 3 times daily, 6 pages each time, every day of the week. How many more pages should she read per day to actually achieve her goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Jessy has 140 pages to read in total and intends to finish it in 7 days.",
    "First, calculate how many pages Jessy needs to read per day to finish the book in a week. Divide the total pages by the number of days: 140 pages / 7 days = 20 pages per day.",
    "Jessy plans to read 3 times a day, 6 pages each time. Calculate how many pages she reads per day with this plan: 3 times/day * 6 pages/time = 18 pages per day.",
    "Compare the pages she needs to read per day (20 pages) with the pages she currently plans to read per day (18 pages).",
    "The difference is 20 pages/day - 18 pages/day = 2 pages/day.",
    "Therefore, Jessy needs to read 2 more pages per day to meet her goal of finishing the book in 7 days."
