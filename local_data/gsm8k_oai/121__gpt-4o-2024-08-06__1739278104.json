  "query": "Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate how many blocks Stella and Twinkle load in the first four hours since they are filling up the truck at the rate of 250 blocks per hour each.",
    "Stella's rate is 250 blocks per hour, and Twinkle's rate is also 250 blocks per hour. Together, they fill 500 blocks per hour (250 + 250).",
    "Since they work for four hours, I multiply their combined rate by the number of hours: 500 blocks/hour * 4 hours = 2000 blocks.",
    "Now, I will find out how many blocks are left to fill the truck. The truck capacity is 6000 blocks, and 2000 blocks have already been filled.",
    "I subtract the filled blocks from the total capacity: 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks.",
    "Next, I consider the scenario when 6 more people join Stella and Twinkle. This totals to 8 people filling the truck (Stella, Twinkle, and 6 others).",
    "Each person fills at 250 blocks per hour, and so with 8 people, it becomes 8 * 250 = 2000 blocks per hour.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many more hours they need to fill the remaining 4000 blocks with 8 people working.",
    "I divide the remaining blocks by the new combined rate: 4000 blocks / 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours.",
    "So, they work 4 hours initially, then an additional 2 hours with the full team.",
    "The total time taken is 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours."
