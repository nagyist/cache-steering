  "query": "Teddy is a pillow-maker.  He uses 3 less than 5 pounds of fluffy foam material to make each pillow.  If Teddy has three tons of fluffy foam material, how many pillows can he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many pounds of fluffy foam material Teddy uses for one pillow.",
    "According to the problem, Teddy uses 3 less than 5 pounds of material per pillow.",
    "I will calculate 3 less than 5 pounds, which is 5 pounds minus 3 pounds.",
    "5 - 3 is 2.",
    "So, Teddy uses 2 pounds of material for each pillow.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much material Teddy has in pounds.",
    "I know that there are 2,000 pounds in a ton.",
    "Teddy has three tons of material.",
    "To calculate the total pounds of material, I will multiply 3 tons by 2,000 pounds per ton.",
    "3 times 2,000 is 6,000.",
    "Teddy has 6,000 pounds of material.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pillows Teddy can make using the 6,000 pounds of material, with each pillow requiring 2 pounds.",
    "To find this, I divide the total pounds of material by the pounds per pillow.",
    "So I will divide 6,000 by 2.",
    "6,000 divided by 2 is 3,000."

  "solution": "3,000"
