  "query": "Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the time it would take Diego to run around the entire block if he hadn't been tripped.",
    "Diego runs half the block in 2.5 minutes. So, to run the full block, he'd need twice that time.",
    "To find Diego's full block time: \\( 2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\) minutes.",
    "Now, Carlos's full block time is 3 minutes.",
    "To compute the average time for both racers, I need to convert these times into seconds because the question asks for the average time in seconds.",
    "Convert Carlos's time to seconds: \\( 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\) seconds.",
    "Convert Diego's time to seconds: \\( 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\) seconds.",
    "To find the average time, add both times and divide by the number of racers. So, the sum of both times is \\( 180 + 300 = 480 \\) seconds.",
    "Divide the total time by the number of racers (2): \\( \\frac{480}{2} = 240 \\) seconds."

  "solution": "240"
