  "query": "Nine members of the crafts club are making 2 necklaces each. It takes 50 beads to make each necklace. How many beads will they need in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many necklaces each craft club member is making. Each member is making 2 necklaces.",
    "There are 9 members in the crafts club.",
    "To find how many necklaces are made in total, I multiply the number of members by the number of necklaces each member makes: 9 members * 2 necklaces/member = 18 necklaces.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many beads are needed for each necklace. It takes 50 beads to make one necklace.",
    "Now, to find the total number of beads needed for all the necklaces, I multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace: 18 necklaces * 50 beads/necklace = 900 beads."
