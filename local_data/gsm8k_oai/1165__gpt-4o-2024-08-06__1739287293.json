  "query": "Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the area of one side of one roof.",
    "Each side of the roof is a rectangle with dimensions 20 feet by 40 feet.",
    "The area of one side is 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet.",
    "Each roof has two sides, so the total area for one roof is 800 square feet * 2 = 1600 square feet.",
    "Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs, so I need to calculate the total area for all 3 roofs.",
    "The total area for all 3 roofs is 1600 square feet per roof * 3 roofs = 4800 square feet.",
    "He needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof.",
    "To find the total number of shingles needed, multiply the total area by the number of shingles per square foot.",
    "4800 square feet * 8 shingles/square foot = 38400 shingles."

  "solution": "38400"
