  "query": "Johan has a ten-bedroom house with 8 walls in each room. He paints 3/5 of the rooms in the house green and paints the rest of the rooms with purple color. How many walls in the house did he paint purple?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of rooms in Johan's house. He has a ten-bedroom house, so there are 10 rooms.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these rooms are painted green. Johan paints 3/5 of the rooms green.",
    "To find out how many rooms are painted green, I multiply the total number of rooms by the fraction painted green: 10 rooms * (3/5) = 6 rooms.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many rooms are painted purple. If 6 of the rooms are painted green, then the remaining rooms are painted purple.",
    "To find the number of rooms painted purple, I subtract the number of green rooms from the total number of rooms: 10 - 6 = 4 rooms.",
    "Each room has 8 walls, and I need to calculate how many walls are painted purple.",
    "I multiply the number of purple rooms by the number of walls per room to get the total number of purple walls: 4 rooms * 8 walls = 32 walls."
