  "query": "Grayson drives a motorboat for 1 hour at 25 mph and then 0.5 hours for 20 mph. Rudy rows in his rowboat for 3 hours at 10 mph. How much farther, in miles, does Grayson go in his motorboat compared to Rudy?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the distance Grayson travels in his motorboat.",
    "Grayson first drives for 1 hour at a speed of 25 mph.",
    "To find the distance for this leg of the trip, I use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "Distance for the first leg is 25 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 25 miles.",
    "Next, Grayson drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 20 mph.",
    "Using the same formula, distance for the second leg is 20 mph \u00d7 0.5 hour = 10 miles.",
    "I add the distances of both legs to find the total distance Grayson travels.",
    "Total distance traveled by Grayson = 25 miles + 10 miles = 35 miles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the distance Rudy rows in his rowboat.",
    "Rudy rows for 3 hours at a speed of 10 mph.",
    "Using the formula again, the distance Rudy covers is 10 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 30 miles.",
    "To find out how much farther Grayson goes compared to Rudy, I subtract the distance Rudy travels from the distance Grayson travels.",
    "Difference in distance = 35 miles - 30 miles = 5 miles."
