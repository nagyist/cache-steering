  "query": "Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the cost of the cheddar cheese. Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10.",
    "Next, determine the cost of the cream cheese. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, half of this amount is $10 / 2 = $5.",
    "Now, find the cost of the cold cuts. The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese costs $10, twice this amount is $10 x 2 = $20.",
    "To find the total cost of all the ingredients, add the prices of the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts together. The total cost is $10 (cheddar) + $5 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts).",
    "Calculate the total: $10 + $5 + $20 = $35."
