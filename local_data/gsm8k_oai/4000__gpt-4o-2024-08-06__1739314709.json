  "query": "Jenny and Mark are throwing bottle caps. Jenny's bottlecap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went. Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. How much further did Mark's bottle cap go than Jenny's?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled.",
    "Jenny's bottle cap initially flew 18 feet.",
    "Then it flew an additional 1/3 of 18 feet after bouncing off the street light.",
    "1/3 of 18 feet is 18 / 3 = 6 feet.",
    "Adding the 6 feet to the initial 18 feet, Jenny's bottle cap flew a total of 18 + 6 = 24 feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled.",
    "Mark's bottle cap initially flew 15 feet.",
    "After bouncing off the window, it flew twice that distance, which is 2 * 15 = 30 feet.",
    "Adding the 30 feet to the initial 15 feet, Mark's bottle cap flew a total of 15 + 30 = 45 feet.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much further Mark's bottle cap traveled compared to Jenny's.",
    "Mark's bottle cap went 45 feet, and Jenny's bottle cap went 24 feet.",
    "The difference in distance is 45 feet - 24 feet = 21 feet."
