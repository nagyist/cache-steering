  "query": "The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure on earth for almost 4000 years.  It is 20 feet taller than 500 feet, and 234 feet wider than it is tall.  What is the sum of the height and width of the Great Pyramid of Giza in feet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the height of the Great Pyramid. It is 20 feet taller than 500 feet.",
    "So, I add 20 feet to 500 feet to find the height: 500 + 20 = 520 feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the width of the Great Pyramid. It is 234 feet wider than it is tall.",
    "I will add 234 feet to the height (520 feet) to find the width: 520 + 234 = 754 feet.",
    "Now, I need to determine the sum of the height and width of the Great Pyramid.",
    "I add the height (520 feet) and the width (754 feet) together: 520 + 754 = 1274 feet."

  "solution": "1274"
