  "query": "Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe\u2019s wins to Max\u2019s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3.",
    "Chloe won 24 times. According to the ratio, 8 parts of the total ratio corresponds to Chloe\u2019s 24 wins.",
    "To find out how many wins correspond to each part of the ratio, I divide Chloe\u2019s wins by 8.",
    "So, 24 divided by 8 equals 3. Therefore, each part of the ratio equals 3 wins.",
    "Max's ratio part is 3, according to the ratio 8:3.",
    "To find Max\u2019s wins, I multiply Max's ratio part, which is 3, by the number of wins each part represents, which is also 3.",
    "3 multiplied by 3 is 9.",
    "Therefore, Max won 9 times."
