  "query": "5 squirrels collected 575 acorns. If each squirrel needs 130 acorns to get through the winter, how many more acorns does each squirrel need to collect?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many acorns each squirrel currently has on average.",
    "There are 575 acorns total and 5 squirrels.",
    "I divide 575 acorns by 5 squirrels.",
    "575 divided by 5 equals 115 acorns.",
    "Each squirrel currently has 115 acorns on average.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many more acorns each squirrel needs to reach 130 acorns.",
    "To find out how many more acorns are needed, subtract the current acorns (115) from the required acorns (130).",
    "130 minus 115 equals 15 acorns.",
    "Each squirrel needs to collect 15 more acorns."
