  "query": "There were 63 Easter eggs in the yard.  Hannah found twice as many as Helen.  How many Easter eggs did Hannah find?",
  "steps": [
    "There are 63 Easter eggs in total.",
    "We need to find out how many eggs Hannah found, given that she found twice as many as Helen.",
    "Let's denote the number of eggs Helen found as x.",
    "Then the number of eggs Hannah found is 2x.",
    "Hannah and Helen together found 3x eggs because x (Helen's eggs) + 2x (Hannah's eggs) = 3x.",
    "The problem states they found 63 eggs in total.",
    "So, we have the equation: 3x = 63.",
    "To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "63 \u00f7 3 = 21.",
    "So, Helen found 21 eggs.",
    "Hannah found twice as many eggs as Helen, so she found 2 * 21 eggs.",
    "2 * 21 equals 42."

  "solution": "42"
