  "steps": [
    "First, I have to calculate the total number of pieces of gum.",
    "John has 54 pieces of gum.",
    "Cole has 45 pieces of gum.",
    "Aubrey has 0 pieces of gum.",
    "The total number of pieces of gum is 54 + 45 + 0.",
    "54 + 45 equals 99.",
    "The total number of pieces of gum is 99.",
    "Now, I need to divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of people sharing them.",
    "There are 3 people sharing the gum: John, Cole, and Aubrey.",
    "I need to divide 99 by 3.",
    "99 divided by 3 equals 33.",
