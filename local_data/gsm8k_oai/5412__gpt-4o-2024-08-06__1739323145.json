  "query": "There are 30 players on a football team. The coach has 8 liters of water. She pours 200 milliliters of water for every player so they can get hydrated. Unfortunately, there was a water spill and 250ml of water was spilled. How much water was left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much water is poured for all the players.",
    "There are 30 players on the team.",
    "Each player receives 200 milliliters of water.",
    "I multiply the number of players by the amount of water each gets: 30 players * 200 milliliters/player = 6000 milliliters.",
    "I know the initial amount of water the coach has is 8 liters.",
    "I have to convert 8 liters to milliliters, because the water measurement for the players is in milliliters.",
    "1 liter = 1000 milliliters, so 8 liters = 8000 milliliters.",
    "Now, I need to account for the water that was spilled.",
    "There was a spill of 250 milliliters of water.",
    "Therefore, the total water distributed and spilled is 6000 milliliters + 250 milliliters = 6250 milliliters.",
    "To find out how much water is left, I subtract the total water distributed and spilled from the initial amount.",
    "8000 milliliters - 6250 milliliters = 1750 milliliters."

  "solution": "1750"
