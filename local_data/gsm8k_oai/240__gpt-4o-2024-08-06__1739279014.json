  "query": "Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls and 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls. Each pack contained 18 bouncy balls. How many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls did Kate buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many red bouncy balls Kate bought.",
    "Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls.",
    "Each pack contains 18 bouncy balls.",
    "To find the total number of red bouncy balls, I need to multiply 7 packs by 18 bouncy balls per pack.",
    "Calculating: 7 * 18 = 126",
    "Kate bought 126 red bouncy balls.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many yellow bouncy balls Kate bought.",
    "Kate bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls.",
    "Again, each pack contains 18 bouncy balls.",
    "To find the total number of yellow bouncy balls, I need to multiply 6 packs by 18 bouncy balls per pack.",
    "Calculating: 6 * 18 = 108",
    "Kate bought 108 yellow bouncy balls.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls Kate bought.",
    "I can find this by subtracting the number of yellow bouncy balls from the number of red bouncy balls.",
    "Calculating: 126 - 108 = 18",
    "Kate bought 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls."
