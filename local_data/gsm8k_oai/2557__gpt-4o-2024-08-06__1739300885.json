  "query": "If olivine has 5 more precious stones than agate and diamond has 11 more precious stones than olivine, how many precious stones do they have together if agate has 30 precious stones?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many precious stones olivine has. According to the question, olivine has 5 more precious stones than agate.",
    "Agate has 30 precious stones.",
    "So, olivine has 30 + 5 = 35 precious stones.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many precious stones diamond has. The question states that diamond has 11 more precious stones than olivine.",
    "Since olivine has 35 precious stones, diamond has 35 + 11 = 46 precious stones.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of precious stones by adding the number of stones each one has: agate, olivine, and diamond.",
    "Agate has 30 stones, olivine has 35 stones, and diamond has 46 stones.",
    "The total is 30 + 35 + 46.",
    "First, 30 + 35 = 65.",
    "Next, 65 + 46 = 111."
