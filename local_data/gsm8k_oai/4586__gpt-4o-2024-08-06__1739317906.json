  "query": "Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.",
  "steps": [
    "Cameron has started with a total of 400 A4 pieces of paper.",
    "I need to determine how many of these papers did not meet the printing quality criteria. This is given as 40% of the total papers.",
    "To find 40% of 400, I will multiply 400 by 0.40.",
    "400 times 0.40 equals 160. Therefore, 160 papers are invalid.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of valid documents by subtracting the number of invalid papers from the total papers.",
    "400 minus 160 equals 240.",
    "Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240."

  "solution": "240"
