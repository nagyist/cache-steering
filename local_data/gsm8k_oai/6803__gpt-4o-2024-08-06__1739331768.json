  "query": "Kim spends $25,000 to open a store.  She makes $4000 a month in revenue and her expenses are $1500 a month.  How long would it take to pay back the cost to open the store?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the net monthly profit, which is the revenue minus the expenses.",
    "The revenue is $4000 per month and the expenses are $1500 per month.",
    "The net monthly profit is $4000 - $1500 = $2500.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many months it will take for the net profit to equal the initial investment of $25,000.",
    "I divide the initial investment of $25,000 by the net monthly profit of $2500.",
    "$25,000 \u00f7 $2500 = 10 months.",
    "It will take Kim 10 months to earn back the initial investment from her net profits."
