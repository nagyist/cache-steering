  "query": "It takes David 10 minutes to wash 4 windows.  David's house has 64 windows.  How many minutes will it take David to wash all of the windows?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many windows David can wash in one minute.",
    "If David takes 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, I can calculate the rate of windows per minute by dividing the number of windows by the number of minutes.",
    "So, I divide 4 windows by 10 minutes.",
    "The rate is 4/10, which simplifies to 0.4 windows per minute.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how long it will take David to wash 64 windows.",
    "Since David washes 0.4 windows per minute, I need to divide the total number of windows by the rate to find the total time.",
    "I divide 64 windows by 0.4 windows per minute.",
    "64 divided by 0.4 is 160.",
    "Thus, it will take David 160 minutes to wash all 64 windows."

  "solution": "160"
