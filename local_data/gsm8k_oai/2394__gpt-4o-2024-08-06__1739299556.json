  "query": "Jason is tired of the neighborhood animals raiding his trash. He pepper-sprays some raccoons and 6 times as many squirrels. If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the variables first. Let the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, he pepper-sprays 6 times as many squirrels as raccoons. Thus, the number of squirrels he pepper-sprays is \\( 6x \\).",
    "The total number of animals he pepper-sprays is 84, which is the sum of the raccoons and squirrels he sprays. So we can write the equation: \\( x + 6x = 84 \\).",
    "Combine the terms on the left side: \\( 7x = 84 \\).",
    "Now, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 7: \\( x = \\frac{84}{7} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{84}{7} \\), which is 12. Therefore, \\( x = 12 \\).",
    "Thus, Jason pepper-sprays 12 raccoons."
