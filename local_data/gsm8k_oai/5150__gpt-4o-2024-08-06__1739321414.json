  "query": "Paul went to the sporting goods store to buy a tennis racket.  His favorite brand was having a sale that offered customers a deal to buy one racket at full price and get the second racket for half off the full price.   If he purchased two rackets that were each originally marked at a full price of $60, how much did he spend on the two rackets, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul wants to buy two tennis rackets of a brand that has a sale.",
    "The sale states that if a customer buys one racket at full price, the second racket can be purchased for half off its full price.",
    "The full price of each tennis racket is $60.",
    "To find the total cost, I calculate the price he pays for the first racket. Since the first racket is sold at full price, the cost is $60.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the price of the second racket. It is sold at half its full price.",
    "Half of $60 is $30.",
    "Paul buys two rackets in total, so I add the cost of the first racket and the cost of the second racket together.",
    "The first racket cost $60 and the second racket cost $30.",
    "Thus, the total cost is $60 + $30.",
    "$60 + $30 equals $90."

  "solution": "90"
