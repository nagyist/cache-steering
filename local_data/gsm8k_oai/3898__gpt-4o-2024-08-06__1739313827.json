  "query": "Susie opens a pizza store. She charges $3 per slice and $15 for a whole pizza. If she was able to sell 24 slices of pizza and 3 whole pizzas, how much money did she earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Susie earned from selling the slices of pizza.",
    "She sold 24 slices of pizza, and each slice costs $3.",
    "To find the total from the slices, I multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 24 slices * $3 per slice.",
    "24 * 3 = $72.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money Susie earned from selling the whole pizzas.",
    "She sold 3 whole pizzas, and each pizza costs $15.",
    "To find the total from the whole pizzas, I multiply the number of whole pizzas by the price per pizza: 3 pizzas * $15 per pizza.",
    "3 * 15 = $45.",
    "Now, I add together the money earned from the slices and the whole pizzas to find the total earnings.",
    "$72 (from slices) + $45 (from whole pizzas) = $117."

  "solution": "117"
