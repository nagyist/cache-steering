  "query": "A cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph.  The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem describes two animals, a cheetah and a gazelle, running at different speeds.",
    "The cheetah's speed is given as 60 miles per hour, and the gazelle's speed is 40 miles per hour.",
    "The cheetah is faster than the gazelle, so it can catch up to it.",
    "I also know that 1 mile per hour is approximately 1.5 feet per second.",
    "First, I need to convert the speeds of both animals from miles per hour to feet per second.",
    "The cheetah's speed in feet per second is 60 mph * 1.5 feet/s per mph = 90 feet/s.",
    "The gazelle's speed in feet per second is 40 mph * 1.5 feet/s per mph = 60 feet/s.",
    "Next, I need to find the relative speed of the cheetah compared to the gazelle.",
    "To find the relative speed, I subtract the gazelle's speed from the cheetah's speed: 90 feet/s - 60 feet/s = 30 feet/s.",
    "Now, I know that the relative speed is 30 feet per second, which means the cheetah is gaining 30 feet on the gazelle every second.",
    "The initial distance between the cheetah and the gazelle is 210 feet.",
    "To find out how long it takes for the cheetah to catch up, I divide the initial distance by the relative speed.",
    "Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 210 feet / 30 feet/s",
    "Time = 7 seconds"

  "solution": "7"
