  "query": "Jane's mother agreed to pay her $.50 for every flower bulb that Jane planted.  Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs and half that amount of iris bulbs.  She also planted 30 daffodil bulbs and three times that amount of crocus bulbs.  How much money did Jane earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many iris bulbs Jane planted. She planted half the number of iris bulbs compared to the tulip bulbs.",
    "Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs. Half of 20 is 10.",
    "So, Jane planted 10 iris bulbs.",
    "Next, I need to know how many crocus bulbs Jane planted. She planted three times as many crocus bulbs as she planted daffodil bulbs.",
    "Jane planted 30 daffodil bulbs. Three times 30 is 90.",
    "So, Jane planted 90 crocus bulbs.",
    "Now let's add up all the bulbs Jane planted: tulip, iris, daffodil, and crocus bulbs.",
    "20 tulip bulbs + 10 iris bulbs + 30 daffodil bulbs + 90 crocus bulbs = 150 total bulbs.",
    "Jane earns $.50 for each bulb she plants.",
    "To find out how much money Jane earns, I need to multiply the total number of bulbs by $.50.",
    "150 bulbs * $.50 per bulb = $75."
  ],
  "solution": "75"
