  "query": "James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much James gets paid for driving 600 miles.",
    "James is paid $0.50 per mile.",
    "To find the total payment, I multiply the rate per mile by the total number of miles: 600 miles * $0.50/mile = $300.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many gallons of gas are needed for the trip.",
    "The truck gets 20 miles per gallon.",
    "For 600 miles, James uses 600 miles / 20 miles/gallon = 30 gallons of gas.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost of the gas.",
    "Gas costs $4.00 per gallon.",
    "The total cost for gas is 30 gallons * $4.00/gallon = $120.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the cost of gas from the payment James receives.",
    "The profit is $300 - $120 = $180."
  ],
  "solution": "180"
