  "query": "For a fundraiser, Nellie needs to sell 45 rolls of gift wrap. So far, she has sold 1 roll to her grandmother, 10 rolls to her uncle, and 6 rolls to a neighbor. How many more rolls of gift wrap does Nellie need to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of rolls that Nellie has sold so far.",
    "Nellie sold 1 roll to her grandmother.",
    "Nellie sold 10 rolls to her uncle.",
    "Nellie sold 6 rolls to a neighbor.",
    "Now, I add these numbers together: 1 + 10 + 6.",
    "1 + 10 is 11.",
    "11 + 6 is 17.",
    "Nellie has sold a total of 17 rolls so far.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many more rolls she needs to sell. The goal is to sell 45 rolls.",
    "I subtract the number of rolls sold from the goal: 45 - 17.",
    "45 - 17 is 28."
