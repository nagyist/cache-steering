  "query": "Juliet is 3 years older than her sister Maggie but 2 years younger than her elder brother Ralph. If Juliet is 10 years old, what is the sum of Maggie's and Ralph's ages?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Juliet is 10 years old.",
    "Juliet is 3 years older than her sister Maggie, so I can calculate Maggie's age by subtracting 3 from Juliet's age.",
    "Maggie's age = 10 - 3 = 7 years old.",
    "Juliet is 2 years younger than her elder brother Ralph. Therefore, I can find Ralph's age by adding 2 to Juliet's age.",
    "Ralph's age = 10 + 2 = 12 years old.",
    "Now, I need to find the sum of Maggie's and Ralph's ages.",
    "The sum of Maggie's and Ralph's ages = 7 + 12 = 19."
