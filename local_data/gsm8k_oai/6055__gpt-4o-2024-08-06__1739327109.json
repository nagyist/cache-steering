  "query": "Cristobal read 15 more than three times the pages that Beatrix read. If Beatrix read 704 pages, how many more pages did Cristobal read?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, let's first understand the relationship between the number of pages Cristobal and Beatrix read.",
    "I know that Cristobal read 15 more than three times the pages that Beatrix read.",
    "Beatrix read 704 pages.",
    "To find the pages Cristobal read, I first need to calculate three times the number of pages Beatrix read.",
    "Three times 704 pages is calculated as \\( 3 \\times 704 \\).",
    "Multiplying 3 by 704 gives me 2112. So, three times the number of pages Beatrix read is 2112 pages.",
    "Cristobal read 15 more than this amount, so I need to add 15 to 2112.",
    "Adding 15 to 2112 gives me 2127.",
    "So, Cristobal read 2127 pages in total.",
    "To find how many more pages Cristobal read compared to Beatrix, I need to subtract the pages Beatrix read from the pages Cristobal read.",
    "Subtracting 704 from 2127 gives me 1423."

  "solution": "1423"
