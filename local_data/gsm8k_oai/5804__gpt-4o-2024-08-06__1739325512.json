  "query": "Ziggy is a club DJ. Typically, Ziggy gets 30 song requests every night. Half the songs requested are electropop. A third of that amount are requests for dance music. Five song requests are rock music, and song requests for oldies are three less in number than rock requests. Ziggy plays a DJ\u2019s choice song half the number of times he plays an oldie. Ziggy also sometimes gets rap song requests. Typically, how many rap songs does Ziggy get requested every night?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of electropop requests. Since half of the 30 song requests are electropop, that is 30 / 2 = 15 requests.",
    "Next, determine the number of dance requests. A third of the electropop requests are dance music requests. So, 15 / 3 = 5 dance music requests.",
    "We know there are 5 rock music requests each night.",
    "Next, find the number of oldies requests. There are 3 less oldies requests compared to rock requests. Since there are 5 rock requests, that means 5 - 3 = 2 oldies requests.",
    "Determine the number of DJ\u2019s choice songs. Ziggy plays a DJ\u2019s choice song half the number of times he plays an oldie. Since there are 2 oldies requests, there are 2 / 2 = 1 DJ's choice song request.",
    "Now, add up all the known requests: Electropop (15) + Dance (5) + Rock (5) + Oldies (2) + DJ's choice (1) = 28 known requests.",
    "The total number of song requests per night is 30. To find the number of rap song requests, subtract the number of known requests from the total requests. So, 30 - 28 = 2 rap song requests."
