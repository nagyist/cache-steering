  "query": "Carla had 400 chickens on her chicken farm. However, 40% of the chicken died due to a certain disease. How many chickens were there if she bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died due to disease?",
  "steps": [
    "Carla started with 400 chickens on her farm.",
    "I need to find out how many chickens died, which is 40% of 400.",
    "To calculate 40% of 400, I use the formula: percentage times the total number (0.40 * 400).",
    "0.40 times 400 equals 160. So, 160 chickens died due to disease.",
    "I'm told Carla bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died.",
    "Ten times 160 chickens equals 1600 chickens.",
    "Carla initially had 400 chickens, from which 160 died. This initially left her with 240 chickens.",
    "After purchasing 1600 new chickens, I add this number to the 240 surviving chickens.",
    "240 plus 1600 equals 1840."

  "solution": "1840"
