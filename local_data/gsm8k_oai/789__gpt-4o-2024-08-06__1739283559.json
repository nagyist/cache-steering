  "query": "James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?",
  "steps": [
    "James' pain subsided after 3 days.",
    "The injury takes at least 5 times the 3 days to fully heal.",
    "5 times 3 days is 15 days.",
    "After the injury heals, he wants to wait another 3 days before working out again.",
    "Adding 3 days to the 15 days healing time gives 18 days before he can work out again.",
    "He plans to wait 3 weeks to start lifting heavy again after working out.",
    "3 weeks is equivalent to 21 days.",
    "Adding the 21 days to the 18 days he waits before working out gives a total of 39 days."
