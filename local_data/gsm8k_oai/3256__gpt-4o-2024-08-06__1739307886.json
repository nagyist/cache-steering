    "Bert made 12 sandwiches initially.",
    "On the first day, Bert ate half of 12 sandwiches.",
    "Half of 12 is calculated as 12 / 2 = 6 sandwiches.",
    "So, Bert ate 6 sandwiches on the first day.",
    "The number of sandwiches left after the first day is 12 - 6 = 6 sandwiches.",
    "On the second day, Bert ate 2 sandwiches less than the 6 he ate on the first day.",
    "So, Bert ate 6 - 2 = 4 sandwiches on the second day.",
    "The number of sandwiches left after the second day is 6 - 4 = 2 sandwiches."
