  "query": "When Doctor Lindsay works in her office, she usually sees 4 adult patients and 3 child patients every hour. If the cost for an adult's office visit is $50, and the cost for a child's office visit is $25, how much money, in dollars, does Doctor Lyndsay receive in a typical 8-hour day for seeing all her patients?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Doctor Lindsay receives from seeing 4 adult patients.",
    "The cost for an adult's office visit is $50.",
    "For 4 adult patients, the total would be 4 multiplied by $50.",
    "4 x $50 = $200 per hour from adult patients.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much money Doctor Lindsay receives from seeing 3 child patients.",
    "The cost for a child's office visit is $25.",
    "For 3 child patients, the total would be 3 multiplied by $25.",
    "3 x $25 = $75 per hour from child patients.",
    "Now, I add the money received from adult patients and child patients to find out how much Doctor Lindsay earns per hour.",
    "$200 (from adults) + $75 (from children) = $275 per hour.",
    "Doctor Lindsay works for 8 hours a day.",
    "To find out how much she earns in an 8-hour day, I need to multiply the hourly earnings by 8.",
    "$275 per hour x 8 hours = $2,200 per day."

  "solution": "2200"
