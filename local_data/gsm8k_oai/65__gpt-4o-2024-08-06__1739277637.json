  "query": "Lee mows one lawn and charges $33. Last week he mowed 16 lawns and three customers each gave him a $10 tip. How many dollars did Lee earn mowing lawns last week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Lee earns from mowing one lawn without tips.",
    "Lee charges $33 for mowing one lawn.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Lee earned from mowing 16 lawns.",
    "Lee mowed 16 lawns and charges $33 per lawn, so I multiply 16 by 33.",
    "16 lawns * $33 per lawn = $528.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total amount of tips Lee received.",
    "Three customers each gave Lee a $10 tip.",
    "3 customers * $10 per tip = $30 in tips.",
    "Next, I need to determine Lee's total earnings by adding his earnings from mowing lawns to the tips he received.",
    "$528 from mowing lawns + $30 in tips = $558."
