  "query": "Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends.  He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.   And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy.  How many stickers does Colton have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Colton started with 72 dolphin stickers.",
    "He gave 4 stickers to each of his 3 friends.",
    "4 stickers/friend * 3 friends = 12 stickers given to 3 friends.",
    "He gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave all three friends total.",
    "Mandy received 12 + 2 = 14 stickers.",
    "Justin received 10 less than Mandy.",
    "Justin received 14 - 10 = 4 stickers.",
    "Total stickers given = 12 (to 3 friends) + 14 (to Mandy) + 4 (to Justin) = 30 stickers.",
    "Stickers left with Colton = Initial stickers - Stickers given away.",
    "Stickers left with Colton = 72 - 30 = 42 stickers."
