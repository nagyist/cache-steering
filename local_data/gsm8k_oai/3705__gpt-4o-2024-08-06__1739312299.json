  "query": "One of the activities in Grade 6 PE class is to get the average weight of the students from each group. In one of the groups, the average weight of five girls is 45 kg while the average weight of five boys is 55 kg. What is the average weight of the ten students from that group?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total weight of the five girls. If the average weight is 45 kg, then the total weight of the girls is 5 times 45 kg.",
    "Total weight of the girls = 5 * 45 = 225 kg.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total weight of the five boys. If the average weight is 55 kg, then the total weight of the boys is 5 times 55 kg.",
    "Total weight of the boys = 5 * 55 = 275 kg.",
    "Now, I will find the total weight of all ten students by adding the total weight of the girls and the boys.",
    "Total weight of all students = 225 kg + 275 kg = 500 kg.",
    "To find the average weight of all ten students, I will divide the total weight by the number of students, which is 10.",
    "Average weight of all students = 500 kg / 10 = 50 kg."
