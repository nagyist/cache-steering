  "query": "Karl, Ryan, and Ben are fond of collecting stickers. Karl has 25 stickers. Ryan has 20 more stickers than Karl. Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan. They placed all their stickers in one sticker book. How many stickers did they place altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stickers Ryan has.",
    "Ryan has 20 more stickers than Karl. Karl has 25 stickers.",
    "I add 20 to Karl's 25 stickers to find out how many stickers Ryan has.",
    "25 + 20 = 45, so Ryan has 45 stickers.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many stickers Ben has.",
    "Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan. Ryan has 45 stickers.",
    "I subtract 10 from Ryan's 45 stickers to find out how many stickers Ben has.",
    "45 - 10 = 35, so Ben has 35 stickers.",
    "Now I will find the total number of stickers they placed in the sticker book.",
    "I add together all of Karl's, Ryan's, and Ben's stickers: 25 + 45 + 35.",
    "First, I add Karl's and Ryan's stickers together: 25 + 45 = 70.",
    "Next, I add Ben's stickers to the previous total: 70 + 35.",
    "70 + 35 = 105."
