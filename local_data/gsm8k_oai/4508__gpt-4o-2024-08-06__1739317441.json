  "query": "A YouTube video got 3000 likes and 100 more than half as many dislikes. If the video gets 1000 more dislikes and 0 more likes how many dislikes does the video have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let me first determine how many dislikes the video originally had.",
    "The video got 100 more than half as many dislikes as the number of likes.",
    "The video has 3000 likes.",
    "Half of 3000 likes is 3000 / 2 = 1500.",
    "The number of dislikes is 100 more than half of 3000.",
    "So, the number of original dislikes is 1500 + 100 = 1600.",
    "According to the problem, the video gets 1000 more dislikes.",
    "The new total number of dislikes is the original 1600 dislikes plus an additional 1000 dislikes.",
    "1600 + 1000 = 2600."
