  "query": "In one month in the Smith house, Kylie uses 3 bath towels, her 2 daughters use a total of 6 bath towels, and her husband uses a total of 3 bath towels. If the washing machine can fit 4 bath towels for one load of laundry, how many loads of laundry will the Smiths need to do to clean all of their used towels?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of bath towels used by the entire Smith family in one month.",
    "Kylie uses 3 bath towels.",
    "Her 2 daughters use a total of 6 bath towels.",
    "Her husband uses 3 bath towels.",
    "To find the total number of towels, I add up the towels used by each person: 3 (Kylie) + 6 (daughters) + 3 (husband).",
    "The total number of towels is 3 + 6 + 3 = 12.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many loads of laundry are needed to wash 12 towels, given the washing machine can fit 4 towels per load.",
    "To find the number of loads, I divide the total number of towels by the capacity of each load: 12 towels / 4 towels per load.",
    "12 divided by 4 is 3.",
    "Therefore, the Smiths need to do 3 loads of laundry to wash all the bath towels."
