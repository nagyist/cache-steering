  "query": "Paul and his sister Paula went to the cookie store to buy some cookies. Paula bought 3 fewer cookies than Paul, who bought 45 cookies. How many cookies do they have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul bought 45 cookies.",
    "Paula bought 3 fewer cookies than Paul.",
    "To find out how many cookies Paula bought, subtract 3 from the number of cookies Paul bought.",
    "45 - 3 = 42",
    "Paula bought 42 cookies.",
    "Now, to find the total number of cookies they have together, add Paul's cookies to Paula's cookies.",
    "45 (Paul's cookies) + 42 (Paula's cookies) = 87"
