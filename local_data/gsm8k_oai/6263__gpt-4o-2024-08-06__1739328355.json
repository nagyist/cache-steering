  "query": "Freddie and his team are collecting blankets for three days to be donated to the Children Shelter Organization. There are 15 people on the team. On the first day, each of them gave 2 blankets. On the second day, they tripled the number they collected on the first day by asking door-to-door. On the last day, they set up boxes at schools and got a total of 22 blankets. How many blankets did they collect for the three days for donation?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many blankets were collected on the first day.",
    "There are 15 people on the team, and each of them gave 2 blankets on the first day.",
    "I will multiply the number of people by the number of blankets each gave: 15 * 2.",
    "15 * 2 = 30 blankets were collected on the first day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many blankets were collected on the second day.",
    "On the second day, they tripled the number of blankets collected on the first day.",
    "I will triple the 30 blankets from the first day: 30 * 3.",
    "30 * 3 = 90 blankets were collected on the second day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many blankets were collected on the third day.",
    "On the third day, they collected 22 blankets from the school donation boxes.",
    "Now, I will add up the blankets from all three days to find the total collected.",
    "Total blankets = blankets from first day + blankets from second day + blankets from third day.",
    "Total blankets = 30 + 90 + 22.",
    "30 + 90 = 120.",
    "120 + 22 = 142."
