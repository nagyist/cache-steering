  "steps": [
    "Abe finds 4 ants on the sidewalk.",
    "Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. Since Abe sees 4 ants, 50% of 4 is 2. Therefore, Beth sees 4 + 2 = 6 ants.",
    "CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. So, CeCe sees 2 * 4 = 8 ants.",
    "Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe. Therefore, Duke finds 4 / 2 = 2 ants.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the ants found by the four children. Abe finds 4 ants, Beth finds 6 ants, CeCe finds 8 ants, and Duke finds 2 ants.",
    "The total number of ants is 4 + 6 + 8 + 2.",
    "Calculating the total, 4 + 6 is 10. Then 10 + 8 is 18. Finally, 18 + 2 is 20."
