  "query": "Dave weighs 175 pounds and can bench press three times his body weight.  Craig can only bench press 20% of the amount Dave can.  Mark is new and can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig.  How much can Mark bench press?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much weight Dave can bench press.",
    "Dave's bench press weight is three times his body weight.",
    "Dave weighs 175 pounds.",
    "To find out how much Dave can bench press, multiply his weight by 3.",
    "175 pounds * 3 = 525 pounds",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Craig can bench press.",
    "Craig can bench press 20% of the amount Dave can.",
    "To get 20% of 525 pounds, multiply 525 by 0.20.",
    "525 * 0.20 = 105 pounds",
    "Craig can bench press 105 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Mark can bench press.",
    "Mark can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig.",
    "Subtract 50 pounds from Craig's bench press weight of 105 pounds.",
    "105 pounds - 50 pounds = 55 pounds",
    "Mark can bench press 55 pounds."
