  "query": "Terry drives at a speed of 40 miles per hour. He drives daily forth and back from his home to his workplace which is 60 miles away from his home. How many hours does Terry spend driving from home to the workplace and then back?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total distance Terry drives in one day.",
    "The distance from home to the workplace is 60 miles.",
    "Since Terry travels to the workplace and back home, he makes a round trip.",
    "The round trip distance is 60 miles to the workplace plus 60 miles back home.",
    "Calculate the round trip distance: 60 miles + 60 miles = 120 miles.",
    "Next, use Terry's driving speed to calculate the time spent driving.",
    "Terry drives at a speed of 40 miles per hour.",
    "The time spent driving is calculated by dividing the total distance by the speed.",
    "Calculate the time: 120 miles \u00f7 40 miles per hour = 3 hours."
