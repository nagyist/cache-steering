  "query": "Bill and Phil are firehouse Dalmatians. Bill has one less than twice as many spots as Phil. If they have 59 spots combined, how many spots does Bill have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's use variables to represent the number of spots. Let P represent the number of spots Phil has.",
    "According to the problem, Bill has one less than twice as many spots as Phil. So, we can write an expression for Bill's spots: B = 2P - 1.",
    "The total number of spots for both Dalmatians is given as 59. So, we can write the equation: P + B = 59.",
    "We can substitute the expression for B from step 2 into the equation from step 3: P + (2P - 1) = 59.",
    "Now we simplify the equation: P + 2P - 1 = 59, which simplifies further to 3P - 1 = 59.",
    "Add 1 to both sides to isolate terms with P: 3P = 60.",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for P: P = 20.",
    "Now that we have the number of spots for Phil (P = 20), we substitute back into the expression for Bill's spots: B = 2P - 1 = 2(20) - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39.",
    "Finally, we conclude that Bill has 39 spots."
