  "query": "Danny helps his friends carpool to work. He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate the distance to the first friend's house. Danny drives 8 miles to get there.",
    "To get to the second friend's house, Danny drives half of the distance from home to the first friend's house. Half of 8 miles is 4 miles.",
    "Now, I calculate the total distance driven so far, which is the sum of the distances to the first and second friend's houses. That's 8 miles + 4 miles = 12 miles.",
    "Danny then drives 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. So, I multiply the total distance driven so far by 3. That is 12 miles * 3 = 36 miles.",
    "The question asks for the distance Danny drives between the second friend's house and work, which is the 36 miles calculated in the previous step."

  "solution": "36"
