  "query": "Tom spends $250 to buy gems in a game he plays.  The game gives 100 gems for each dollar you spend.  Since he bought so many gems he got a 20% bonus of more gems. How many gems did he end up with?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom spends $250 to buy gems.",
    "The game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent.",
    "First, I need to calculate how many gems Tom gets without the bonus.",
    "250 dollars multiplied by 100 gems per dollar equals 25,000 gems.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the 20% bonus on the gems.",
    "20% of 25,000 gems is calculated as 0.20 times 25,000.",
    "0.20 times 25,000 is 5,000 gems.",
    "To find the total number of gems, I add the bonus gems to the initial amount.",
    "25,000 gems plus 5,000 bonus gems equals 30,000 gems."

  "solution": "30,000"
