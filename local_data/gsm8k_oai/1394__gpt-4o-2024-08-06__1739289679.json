  "query": "Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens. If Jen has 150 ducks, how many total birds does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many chickens Jen has.",
    "Let's denote the number of chickens as \\( c \\).",
    "According to the problem, Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens.",
    "The equation can be set up as: 4c + 10 = 150, where 150 is the number of ducks Jen has.",
    "Now, I need to solve this equation for \\( c \\).",
    "First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 4c = 140.",
    "Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( c \\): \\( c = 35 \\).",
    "Jen has 35 chickens.",
    "I must now calculate the total number of birds she has.",
    "Total birds are the sum of ducks and chickens.",
    "Jen has 150 ducks and 35 chickens.",
    "So, the total number of birds is 150 + 35.",
    "Calculate 150 + 35 = 185."

  "solution": "185"
