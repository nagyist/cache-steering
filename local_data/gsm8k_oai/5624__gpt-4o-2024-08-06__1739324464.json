    "I need to find out how much Jerry has already paid off in total.",
    "Two months ago, Jerry paid $12.",
    "Last month, he paid $3 more than he did two months ago.",
    "So, last month he paid $12 + $3 = $15.",
    "Now, I will add the amounts paid in the two months to find the total payment.",
    "The total amount paid is $12 + $15 = $27.",
    "Jerry's total debt was $50.",
    "To find out how much he still has to pay, I subtract the total amount paid from the total debt.",
    "$50 - $27 = $23."
