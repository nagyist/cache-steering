  "query": "Jenna is adding black dots to a bunch of white blouses. Each blouse gets 20 dots, and each dot takes 10 ml of black dye. How many 400-ml bottles of dye does Jenna need to buy to dye 100 blouses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dots Jenna will be putting on the 100 blouses.",
    "Each blouse gets 20 dots, so for 100 blouses that would be 100 blouses * 20 dots per blouse.",
    "Calculating the total number of dots: 100 * 20 = 2000 dots.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total amount of dye needed for these dots.",
    "Each dot takes 10 ml of black dye. So for 2000 dots, the total dye needed will be 2000 dots * 10 ml per dot.",
    "Calculating the total amount of dye: 2000 * 10 = 20000 ml of dye.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 400-ml bottles Jenna needs to buy to get 20000 ml of dye.",
    "To find out how many bottles are needed, I will divide the total ml of dye needed by the ml per bottle: 20000 ml / 400 ml per bottle.",
    "Calculating the number of bottles: 20000 / 400 = 50 bottles."

  "solution": "50"
