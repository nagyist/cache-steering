  "query": "The flowers cost $9, the clay pot costs $20 more than the flower, and the bag of soil costs $2 less than the flower.  How much does it cost to plant the flowers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine the cost of the clay pot. The problem states that the clay pot costs $20 more than the flowers.",
    "The flowers cost $9. So, the clay pot costs $9 + $20.",
    "Calculating $9 + $20 gives me $29. Thus, the clay pot costs $29.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the cost of the bag of soil. The problem states that the bag of soil costs $2 less than the flowers.",
    "The flowers cost $9. So, the bag of soil costs $9 - $2.",
    "Calculating $9 - $2 gives me $7. Thus, the bag of soil costs $7.",
    "Now, I'll find the total cost to plant the flowers, which includes the cost of the flowers, the clay pot, and the bag of soil.",
    "I need to sum $9 (flowers), $29 (clay pot), and $7 (bag of soil).",
    "Calculating $9 + $29 + $7 gives me $45."
