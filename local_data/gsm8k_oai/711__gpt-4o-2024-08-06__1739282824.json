  "query": "Alice and Emily are selling oranges at the farmer's market. Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. In total, they sold 180 oranges. How many oranges did Alice sell?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of oranges Emily sold be \\( x \\).",
    "Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, Alice sold \\( 2x \\) oranges.",
    "The total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180.",
    "So, the equation becomes \\( 2x + x = 180 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation to \\( 3x = 180 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 3: \\( x = \\frac{180}{3} \\).",
    "Calculating \\( \\frac{180}{3} \\) gives \\( x = 60 \\).",
    "Emily sold 60 oranges, and Alice sold twice as many as Emily, so Alice sold \\( 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\) oranges."

  "solution": "120"
