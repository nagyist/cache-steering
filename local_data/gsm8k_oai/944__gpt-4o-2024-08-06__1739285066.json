    "Kylie starts with 5 daisies.",
    "Her sister gives her 9 more daisies.",
    "To find out how many daisies Kylie has after receiving from her sister, I add 5 and 9.",
    "5 + 9 equals 14.",
    "Kylie now has 14 daisies.",
    "Kylie gives half of her daisies to her mother.",
    "To find out how many daisies she gives away, I need to calculate half of 14.",
    "Half of 14 is 14 divided by 2.",
    "14 divided by 2 equals 7.",
    "Kylie gives 7 daisies to her mother.",
    "To find out how many daisies Kylie has left, I subtract 7 from 14.",
    "14 - 7 equals 7."
