  "query": "During a recent three-day trip to Italy, Keziah and her mom went mushroom picking. They sold all the mushrooms they picked on the first day for a total of $58. The day after, they picked 12 mushrooms. On the last day, they picked double the mushrooms they had picked the previous day. If the price per mushroom was $2, what is the total number of mushrooms they picked?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many mushrooms they picked on the second day. The problem states that they picked 12 mushrooms on the second day.",
    "Next, let's determine how many mushrooms they picked on the third day. They picked double the amount they picked on the second day. So, they picked 2 * 12 = 24 mushrooms on the third day.",
    "Now, let's figure out how many mushrooms they picked on the first day. They sold all the mushrooms for a total of $58, and the price per mushroom was $2. To find out how many mushrooms they picked, we divide the total amount by the price per mushroom: $58 \u00f7 $2 = 29 mushrooms.",
    "To find the total number of mushrooms picked over the three days, we add the number of mushrooms picked each day: 29 (first day) + 12 (second day) + 24 (third day).",
    "Now, add these numbers to get the total: 29 + 12 + 24 = 65."
