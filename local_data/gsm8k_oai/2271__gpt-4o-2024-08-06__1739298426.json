  "query": "Last year, Peter organized a Fun Run for his community project and 200 people signed up. Forty people did not show up to run. This year, there will be twice as many runners as last year. How many people will run this year?",
  "steps": [
    "Last year, there were 200 people who signed up for the Fun Run.",
    "Out of those 200 people, 40 people did not show up to run.",
    "To find out how many people actually ran last year, I need to subtract the number of no-shows from the total sign-ups.",
    "200 sign-ups - 40 no-shows = 160 people who ran last year.",
    "The problem states that this year, there will be twice as many runners as last year.",
    "So, I need to calculate twice the number of runners from last year.",
    "160 runners from last year x 2 = 320 runners this year."

  "solution": "320"
