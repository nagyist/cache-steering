  "query": "Georgie needs 3 avocados to make her grandmother's guacamole recipe. If she already had 5 avocados and her sister buys another 4 avocados, how many servings of guacamole can Georgie make?",
  "steps": [
    "Georgie needs 3 avocados for each serving of guacamole.",
    "She already has 5 avocados.",
    "Her sister buys another 4 avocados for her.",
    "I need to find the total number of avocados Georgie now has.",
    "5 avocados + 4 avocados = 9 avocados.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many servings of guacamole Georgie can make with 9 avocados.",
    "Since each serving requires 3 avocados, I will divide the total number of avocados by the number of avocados needed per serving.",
    "9 avocados \u00f7 3 avocados per serving = 3 servings."
