  "query": "The basketball team sold 50 cupcakes for $2 each and 40 cookies for $0.5 each. Then the money from their sales was used to buy two basketballs that cost $40 each. The rest of the money was used to buy 20 bottles of energy drinks. How much does a bottle of energy drink cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money made from selling cupcakes.",
    "The team sold 50 cupcakes for $2 each.",
    "So, I multiply 50 cupcakes by $2 per cupcake.",
    "50 * 2 = $100 from cupcakes.",
    "Next, I calculate the total money made from selling cookies.",
    "The team sold 40 cookies for $0.5 each.",
    "So, I multiply 40 cookies by $0.5 per cookie.",
    "40 * 0.5 = $20 from cookies.",
    "Now, I will find the total sales from both cupcakes and cookies.",
    "I add the money from cupcakes and cookies: $100 + $20.",
    "$100 + $20 = $120 total sales.",
    "Next, the team bought two basketballs, each costing $40.",
    "I multiply 2 basketballs by $40 per basketball.",
    "2 * 40 = $80 spent on basketballs.",
    "Now, I subtract the cost of the basketballs from the total sales to find out the remaining money.",
    "$120 - $80 = $40 remaining.",
    "Finally, the remaining money was used to buy 20 bottles of energy drinks.",
    "I need to find out how much one bottle of energy drink costs.",
    "I divide the remaining amount, $40, by the number of bottles, 20.",
    "40 / 20 = $2 per bottle."
