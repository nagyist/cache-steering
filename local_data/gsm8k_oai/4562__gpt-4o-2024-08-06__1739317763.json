  "query": "Maynard's dog dug 8 holes in the lawn.  Maynard filled in 75% of the hole with dirt.  How many holes remain unfilled?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of holes dug by Maynard's dog, which is given as 8.",
    "Next, calculate 75% of these 8 holes to find out how many holes are filled with dirt.",
    "75% of 8 holes can be calculated by multiplying 8 by 0.75.",
    "8 multiplied by 0.75 is equal to 6.",
    "This means 6 holes were filled in with dirt.",
    "To find out how many holes remain unfilled, subtract the number of filled holes from the total number of holes.",
    "Subtracting 6 filled holes from 8 total holes gives us 8 - 6.",
    "The result is 2."
