  "query": "Avery puts 4 shirts in the donation box.  He adds twice as many pants as shirts in the box.  He throws in half as many shorts as pants in the box. In total, how many pieces of clothes is Avery donating?",
  "steps": [
    "Avery starts with 4 shirts.",
    "He adds twice as many pants as shirts. Therefore, he adds 2 * 4 = 8 pants.",
    "He throws in half as many shorts as pants. Therefore, he adds 8 / 2 = 4 shorts.",
    "Now I need to sum up all the pieces of clothing: 4 shirts + 8 pants + 4 shorts.",
    "Adding them together gives 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 pieces of clothing."
