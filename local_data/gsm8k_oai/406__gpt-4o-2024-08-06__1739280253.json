  "query": "Joseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the duration of the first movie. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.",
    "Next, I need to find the duration of the second movie. It is 30 minutes longer than the first movie.",
    "The duration of the first movie is 90 minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes).",
    "The second movie is 30 minutes longer than 90 minutes, so it lasts 90 + 30 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total time spent making popcorn and fries.",
    "They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.",
    "They spent twice as long making fries, so they spent 10 x 2 = 20 minutes making fries.",
    "Now, I will add the durations of the two activities: 10 minutes for popcorn and 20 minutes for fries, for a total of 30 minutes.",
    "Now, I can calculate the total time spent on both movies and cooking. The movies' total time is 90 + 120 = 210 minutes.",
    "So the total time for cooking and watching movies is 210 + 30 = 240 minutes.",
    "To convert 240 minutes into hours, I divide by 60.",
    "240 divided by 60 equals 4 hours."
