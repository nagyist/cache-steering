  "query": "Three local dance studios have 376 students. The first two have 110 and 135 students. How many students does the third studio have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know there are a total of 376 students among the three dance studios.",
    "The first studio has 110 students.",
    "The second studio has 135 students.",
    "To find out how many students the third studio has, I need to add the number of students from the first and second studios.",
    "110 + 135 is the sum of students in the first two studios.",
    "110 + 135 equals 245.",
    "There are 376 students in total.",
    "To find the number of students in the third studio, I subtract the total number of students in the first two studios from the total number of students.",
    "376 - 245 gives the number of students in the third studio.",
    "376 - 245 equals 131."
