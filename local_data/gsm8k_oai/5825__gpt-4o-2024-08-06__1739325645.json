  "query": "To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many slices are required for the entire family of 8.",
    "Since 20 slices make a meal for one person, I need to multiply 20 by the number of people, which is 8.",
    "20 slices per person times 8 people equals 160 slices.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices.",
    "Each tomato is cut into 8 slices.",
    "I divide the total number of required slices, 160, by the number of slices per tomato, which is 8.",
    "160 divided by 8 equals 20."
  ],
  "solution": "20"
