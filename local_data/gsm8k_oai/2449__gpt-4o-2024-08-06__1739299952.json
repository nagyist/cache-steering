  "query": "Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?",
  "steps": [
    "Yanna bought ten shirts, and each shirt costs $5.",
    "To find the total cost of the shirts, I need to multiply the number of shirts by the cost per shirt.",
    "10 shirts * $5 per shirt = $50 for the shirts.",
    "Next, Yanna bought three pairs of sandals, and each pair costs $3.",
    "To find the total cost of the sandals, I need to multiply the number of sandals by the cost per pair.",
    "3 pairs of sandals * $3 per pair = $9 for the sandals.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total cost of both the shirts and the sandals.",
    "Total cost = $50 (shirts) + $9 (sandals)",
    "Total cost = $59",
    "Yanna gave a one hundred dollar bill, which means she originally gave $100.",
    "To find out how much change she got back, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave.",
    "Change = $100 - $59",
    "Change = $41"
