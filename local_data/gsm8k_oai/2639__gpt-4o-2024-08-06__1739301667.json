  "steps": [
    "First, I note that Mitzi brought $75 to the amusement park.",
    "She spent $30 on a ticket.",
    "Next, she spent $13 on food.",
    "Finally, she spent $23 on a T-shirt.",
    "To find out how much money she has left, I need to add up all her expenses.",
    "I start with the ticket, which cost $30.",
    "I add the cost of the food, which is $13, to the ticket cost: $30 + $13 = $43.",
    "Next, I add the cost of the T-shirt, which is $23, to the previous total: $43 + $23 = $66.",
    "Now, I know Mitzi spent a total of $66 at the amusement park.",
    "To find out how much money she has left, I subtract her total expenses from the amount she originally brought: $75 - $66.",
    "$75 - $66 equals $9."
