  "query": "Last week, a farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos which had 240 pomelos in all. This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes. How many dozens of pomelos did the farmer ship in all?",
  "steps": [
    "The farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos last week.",
    "There were 240 pomelos in 10 boxes.",
    "To find out how many pomelos are in one box, divide 240 by 10.",
    "240 \u00f7 10 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 pomelos in each box.",
    "This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes.",
    "Calculate the number of pomelos shipped this week by multiplying 24 by 20.",
    "24 \u00d7 20 = 480. So, there are 480 pomelos shipped this week.",
    "Now, add the number of pomelos from last week and this week to find the total.",
    "240 + 480 = 720. The farmer shipped 720 pomelos in all.",
    "To find out how many dozens of pomelos there are in 720, divide 720 by 12 (as a dozen equals 12).",
    "720 \u00f7 12 = 60."

  "solution": "60"
