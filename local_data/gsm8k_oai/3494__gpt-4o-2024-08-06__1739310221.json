  "query": "Jack needs to mop the bathroom and the kitchen. If the bathroom floor is 24 square feet and the kitchen floor is 80 square feet, and Jack can mop 8 square feet per minute, how many minutes does he spend mopping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total area that Jack needs to mop.",
    "The bathroom floor area is 24 square feet.",
    "The kitchen floor area is 80 square feet.",
    "Now, I will add these two areas together to find the total area.",
    "24 square feet (bathroom) + 80 square feet (kitchen) = 104 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it will take Jack to mop this total area.",
    "Jack can mop 8 square feet per minute.",
    "I will divide the total area to be mopped by the area Jack can mop per minute to find the time.",
    "104 square feet \u00f7 8 square feet per minute = 13 minutes."
