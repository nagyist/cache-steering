    "First, I need to calculate the combined weight of the bag of sugar and the bag of salt.",
    "The bag of sugar weighs 16 kg.",
    "The bag of salt weighs 30 kg.",
    "I add the weight of the bag of sugar (16 kg) to the weight of the bag of salt (30 kg).",
    "16 + 30 equals 46.",
    "The combined weight of the two bags is 46 kg.",
    "Next, I need to remove 4 kg from this combined weight.",
    "I subtract 4 kg from 46 kg.",
    "46 - 4 equals 42."
