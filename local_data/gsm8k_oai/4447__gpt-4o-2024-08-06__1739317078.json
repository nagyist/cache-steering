  "query": "Martiza is studying for the citizenship test. There are 60 questions on the test. 30 are multiple-choice and 30 are fill-in-the-blank. It takes her 15 minutes to learn each multiple-choice question and 25 minutes each to learn the fill-in-the-blank questions. How many hours will she need to study before she is ready for the test?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it will take Martiza to study the multiple-choice questions.",
    "There are 30 multiple-choice questions.",
    "It takes 15 minutes to study each multiple-choice question.",
    "I multiply 30 multiple-choice questions by 15 minutes each to get the total study time for these questions.",
    "30 questions * 15 minutes/question = 450 minutes",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it will take Martiza to study the fill-in-the-blank questions.",
    "There are 30 fill-in-the-blank questions.",
    "It takes 25 minutes to study each fill-in-the-blank question.",
    "I multiply 30 fill-in-the-blank questions by 25 minutes each to get the total study time for these questions.",
    "30 questions * 25 minutes/question = 750 minutes",
    "Now, I need to add the total study time for both types of questions together.",
    "450 minutes (multiple-choice) + 750 minutes (fill-in-the-blank) = 1200 minutes",
    "To find out how many hours Martiza needs to study, I will convert the total minutes into hours.",
    "1 hour = 60 minutes",
    "I divide the total minutes by the number of minutes in an hour to convert minutes to hours.",
    "1200 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours"
  ],
  "solution": "20"
