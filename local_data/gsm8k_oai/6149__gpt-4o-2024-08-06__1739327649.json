  "query": "A bag of chips weighs 20 ounces, and a tin of cookies weighs 9 ounces. If Jasmine buys 6 bags of chips and 4 times as many tins of cookies, how many pounds does she have to carry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many tins of cookies Jasmine buys. She buys 4 times as many tins of cookies as bags of chips.",
    "She buys 6 bags of chips. Therefore, she buys 4 times 6 tins of cookies.",
    "4 times 6 equals 24. Jasmine buys 24 tins of cookies.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total ounces for the bags of chips. One bag of chips weighs 20 ounces.",
    "Jasmine buys 6 bags of chips, so the total weight of chips is 6 times 20 ounces.",
    "6 times 20 equals 120. The total weight of chips is 120 ounces.",
    "Next, I calculate the total ounces for the tins of cookies. One tin of cookies weighs 9 ounces.",
    "Jasmine buys 24 tins of cookies, so the total weight of cookies is 24 times 9 ounces.",
    "24 times 9 equals 216. The total weight of cookies is 216 ounces.",
    "Now, I add the total weight of chips and the total weight of cookies to find the total weight Jasmine has to carry.",
    "120 ounces (chips) plus 216 ounces (cookies) equals 336 ounces.",
    "I need to convert ounces to pounds because the final answer should be in pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound.",
    "I divide 336 ounces by 16 to convert to pounds.",
    "336 divided by 16 equals 21."
