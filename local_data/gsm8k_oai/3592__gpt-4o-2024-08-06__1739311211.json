    "The problem states Tom is in a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.",
    "The Bachelor's degree (BS) takes 3 years to complete.",
    "The Ph.D. degree takes 5 years to complete.",
    "To find the total time for the full program, I add the durations of both degrees.",
    "3 years (BS) + 5 years (Ph.D.) = 8 years for the entire program.",
    "Tom completes the program in 3/4ths the time.",
    "I must calculate 3/4ths of the total 8 years.",
    "To find 3/4ths of 8, I multiply 8 by 3/4.",
    "8 * 3/4 = 24/4 = 6 years."
