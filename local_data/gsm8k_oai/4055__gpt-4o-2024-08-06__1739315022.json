  "query": "Every year, four clowns and thirty children go on a carousel. This year, the candy seller, at the carousel, had 700 candies. The candy seller then sold 20 candies, to each of the clowns and the children, who attended. How many candies did he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the main elements of the problem: there are clowns, children, and candies involved.",
    "We have 4 clowns mentioned in the problem.",
    "We also have 30 children.",
    "Calculate the total number of attendees (clowns and children): 4 (clowns) + 30 (children) = 34 attendees.",
    "Now consider the candy each person receives: each receives 20 candies.",
    "To find the total number of candies given away, multiply the number of attendees by the candies each receives: 34 (attendees) * 20 (candies each) = 680 candies.",
    "The candy seller started with 700 candies.",
    "Subtract the number of candies given away from the initial amount: 700 (initial candies) - 680 (candies given away) = 20 candies."

  "solution": "20"
