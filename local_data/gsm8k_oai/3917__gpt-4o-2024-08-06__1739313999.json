  "query": "When Jack traveled to Canada, he had to wait 20 hours to get through customs, plus 14 days in coronavirus quarantine. How many hours total did Jack have to wait?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total quarantine time in hours.",
    "Jack was in quarantine for 14 days.",
    "There are 24 hours in a day.",
    "To convert days to hours, I multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day: 14 days * 24 hours/day.",
    "14 * 24 = 336 hours. So, Jack spent 336 hours in quarantine.",
    "Next, I need to add the time Jack waited in customs to the quarantine time.",
    "Jack waited 20 hours in customs.",
    "Now, add the 20 hours from customs to the 336 hours from quarantine: 336 + 20.",
    "336 + 20 = 356."
  ],
  "solution": "356"
