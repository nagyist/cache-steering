  "query": "Alice and Bob decided to bake cookies for their first date. Alice baked 74 chocolate chip cookies and Bob baked 7 peanut butter cookies. After accidentally throwing some on the floor, Alice baked 5 more cookies and Bob baked 36 more. If they had 93 edible cookies at the end, how many were accidentally thrown on the floor?",
  "steps": [
    "Alice initially baked 74 chocolate chip cookies.",
    "Bob initially baked 7 peanut butter cookies.",
    "Alice then baked 5 more cookies, so her total is now 74 + 5 = 79 cookies.",
    "Bob baked 36 more cookies, so his total is now 7 + 36 = 43 cookies.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cookies they baked together.",
    "The total number of cookies baked by Alice and Bob is 79 + 43 = 122 cookies.",
    "At the end, they had 93 edible cookies.",
    "To find out how many cookies were thrown on the floor, I need to subtract the number of edible cookies from the total number of cookies baked.",
    "The number of cookies accidentally thrown on the floor is 122 - 93 = 29 cookies."
