  "query": "Joe\u2019s mother gave him $56 to go to the store. Joe bought 7 notebooks and 2 books. Each notebook costs $4 and each book costs $7. How much money does Joe have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Joe started with $56 given by his mother.",
    "Joe bought 7 notebooks.",
    "Each notebook costs $4.",
    "To find the total cost of the notebooks, I multiply the number of notebooks (7) by the cost per notebook ($4).",
    "7 notebooks x $4 per notebook = $28.",
    "Joe also bought 2 books.",
    "Each book costs $7.",
    "To find the total cost of the books, I multiply the number of books (2) by the cost per book ($7).",
    "2 books x $7 per book = $14.",
    "Now, I will add the total costs of the notebooks and books to find the total amount Joe spent.",
    "Total spent = $28 (notebooks) + $14 (books) = $42.",
    "Joe originally had $56.",
    "To find out how much money Joe has left, I subtract the total amount spent ($42) from the original amount ($56).",
    "$56 - $42 = $14."
