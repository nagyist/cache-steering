  "query": "Alan bought a $2000 phone online. John bought it 2% more expensive in a local store. How much did John spend on his phone?",
  "steps": [
    "Alan's phone cost $2000.",
    "John bought his phone for 2% more than Alan.",
    "To find 2% of Alan's $2000 phone, calculate: 2/100 x $2000.",
    "2% of $2000 is $40.",
    "John's phone cost is Alan's phone cost plus the additional 2%.",
    "Adding $40 to Alan's $2000 phone price gives John's phone cost: $2000 + $40.",
    "Therefore, John spent $2040 on his phone."
