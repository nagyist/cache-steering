  "query": "The epic poem currently contains 24 lines. If a person adds 3 lines to the poem every month, in how many months will the poem contain 90 lines?",
  "steps": [
    "The poem currently has 24 lines.",
    "Each month, 3 lines are added to the poem.",
    "We need the poem to have 90 lines.",
    "To find out how many more lines are needed, subtract the current number of lines from the target number of lines.",
    "90 lines (target) - 24 lines (current) = 66 lines needed.",
    "Every month, 3 lines are added, so we need to determine how many months it takes to add 66 lines.",
    "Divide the number of lines needed (66) by the number of lines added per month (3).",
    "66 \u00f7 3 = 22 months."

  "solution": "22"
