  "query": "Natalie's sister had 8 small diaries in her locker. Last summer she bought double the number of diaries she had and then lost 1/4 of what she had. How many diaries does Natalie's sister have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Natalie's sister originally had 8 small diaries.",
    "Last summer, she bought double the number of diaries she had.",
    "Doubling the original 8 diaries gives her 8 * 2 = 16 new diaries.",
    "Now she has a total of 8 (original) + 16 (new) = 24 diaries.",
    "She then lost 1/4 of her diaries.",
    "To find out how many she lost, calculate 1/4 of 24.",
    "1/4 of 24 is 24 / 4 = 6 diaries lost.",
    "Subtract the 6 lost diaries from the 24 she had after buying new ones.",
    "24 - 6 = 18 diaries remaining."

  "solution": "18"
