  "query": "Jade is building a lego tower. She has 100 pieces. Each level has to be 7 pieces wide. If she has 23 pieces left at the end, how many levels is her tower?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pieces were used in the construction of the tower.",
    "Jade started with 100 pieces.",
    "She has 23 pieces left after building the tower.",
    "The number of pieces used is the total minus the pieces left: 100 - 23.",
    "100 - 23 equals 77. So, 77 pieces were used to build the tower.",
    "Each level of the tower requires 7 pieces.",
    "To find the number of levels, I need to divide the number of used pieces by the number of pieces per level: 77 divided by 7.",
    "77 divided by 7 equals 11.",
    "Therefore, the number of levels in the tower is 11."

  "solution": "11"
