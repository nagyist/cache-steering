  "query": "Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian. Ian has half as much money as Jessica has. If Jessica has 100 dollars, how much more money does Jessica have than Rodney?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how much money Ian has. I know that Ian has half as much money as Jessica.",
    "Jessica has 100 dollars. Therefore, Ian has 100 / 2 = 50 dollars.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money Rodney has. I know that Rodney has 35 dollars more than Ian.",
    "Ian has 50 dollars, so Rodney has 50 + 35 = 85 dollars.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how much more money Jessica has than Rodney.",
    "Jessica has 100 dollars, and Rodney has 85 dollars.",
    "The difference between Jessica's and Rodney's money is 100 - 85 = 15 dollars."
