    "Elise buys a 15kg bag of dog food.",
    "She then buys another 10kg bag of dog food.",
    "The total amount of dog food she buys is 15kg + 10kg.",
    "15kg + 10kg equals 25kg.",
    "Elise now has 40kg of dog food in total.",
    "To find out how much dog food Elise already had before buying more, I subtract the total amount she bought from the current total amount she has.",
    "Subtract 25kg (total bought) from 40kg (total she has now).",
    "40kg - 25kg equals 15kg.",
    "Elise already had 15kg of dog food before the purchases."
