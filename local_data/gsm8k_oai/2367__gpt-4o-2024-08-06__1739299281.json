  "query": "In a restaurant, the chef prepared 17 meals to sell for lunch. During lunch, he sold 12 meals. After lunch, the chef prepared another 5 meals for dinner. How many meals does the chef have for dinner, assuming he can use the remaining lunch meals as well?",
  "steps": [
    "The chef initially prepared 17 meals for lunch.",
    "During lunch, 12 meals were sold.",
    "To find out how many meals are remaining from lunch, I subtract the sold meals from the initial meals: 17 - 12.",
    "17 - 12 equals 5. So, there are 5 meals remaining from lunch.",
    "After lunch, the chef prepared an additional 5 meals for dinner.",
    "To find the total meals available for dinner, I add the remaining lunch meals to the newly prepared dinner meals: 5 + 5.",
    "5 + 5 equals 10."
  ],
  "solution": "10"
