  "query": "Jerry finds six hawk feathers and 17 times as many eagle feathers as hawk feathers. If he gives 10 feathers to his sister and sells half the remaining feathers, how many does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerry finds six hawk feathers.",
    "He finds 17 times as many eagle feathers as hawk feathers.",
    "To calculate the number of eagle feathers, I need to multiply the number of hawk feathers by 17.",
    "17 times 6 equals 102. So, Jerry has 102 eagle feathers.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of feathers Jerry has.",
    "Add the hawk feathers and the eagle feathers: 6 + 102 equals 108. Jerry has 108 feathers in total.",
    "Jerry gives 10 feathers to his sister.",
    "Subtract 10 feathers from the total: 108 - 10 equals 98 feathers.",
    "He sells half of the remaining feathers.",
    "To find half, I need to divide the remaining feathers by 2.",
    "98 divided by 2 equals 49. He sells 49 feathers.",
    "Jerry has 49 feathers left after selling half."
