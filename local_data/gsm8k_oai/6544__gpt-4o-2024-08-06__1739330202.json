  "query": "George donated half his monthly income to charity and spent $20 from the other half on groceries. If he now has $100 left, how much was his monthly income?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's assume George's monthly income is X.",
    "He donated half of his income to charity, so he donated X/2.",
    "This means the other half of his income, which he kept, is also X/2.",
    "From the half he kept, he spent $20 on groceries.",
    "So, he had X/2 - 20 left after spending on groceries.",
    "According to the problem, after spending on groceries, he has $100 left.",
    "We can set up the equation: X/2 - 20 = 100.",
    "To find X, we first add 20 to both sides of the equation: X/2 = 120.",
    "Now, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 2: X = 240.",
    "I've double-checked the calculations, and they seem correct."

  "solution": "240"
