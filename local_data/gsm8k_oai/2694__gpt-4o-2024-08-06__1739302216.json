  "query": "Frank has three less than half the number of cookies as Mike. Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie. If Millie has 4 cookies, how many cookies does Frank have?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying how many cookies Millie has. Millie has 4 cookies.",
    "Next, calculate how many cookies Mike has. Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie.",
    "Multiply the number of cookies Millie has by 3: 4 cookies * 3 = 12 cookies.",
    "So, Mike has 12 cookies.",
    "Now, figure out how many cookies Frank has. Frank has three less than half the number of cookies Mike has.",
    "First, calculate half of Mike's cookies: 12 cookies / 2 = 6 cookies.",
    "Then subtract three from this result to find out how many cookies Frank has: 6 cookies - 3 = 3 cookies."
