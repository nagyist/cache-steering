  "query": "Jezebel needs to buy two dozens of red roses and 3 pieces of sunflowers for a bouquet that she is going to arrange. Each red rose costs $1.50 and each sunflower costs $3. How much will Jezebel pay for all those flowers?",
  "steps": [
    "Jezebel needs to buy two dozens of red roses.",
    "One dozen equals 12, so two dozens of red roses equals 2 * 12 = 24 red roses.",
    "Each red rose costs $1.50.",
    "To find the total cost of 24 red roses, multiply the number of roses by the cost per rose: 24 * $1.50.",
    "Calculate the total cost for the red roses: 24 * $1.50 = $36.",
    "Jezebel also needs to buy 3 pieces of sunflowers.",
    "Each sunflower costs $3.",
    "To find the total cost of 3 sunflowers, multiply the number of sunflowers by the cost per sunflower: 3 * $3.",
    "Calculate the total cost for the sunflowers: 3 * $3 = $9.",
    "Find the total cost of all the flowers by adding the cost of the red roses and the sunflowers: $36 + $9.",
    "Calculate the total: $36 + $9 = $45."
