  "query": "Mother made 2 dozen brownies and placed them on the kitchen counter to cool.  Father smelled the brownies, came into the kitchen and ate 8 of them. Then, their daughter, Mooney, wandered into the kitchen and ate 4 of the brownies. The next morning, Mother made another two dozen brownies and added them to those remaining from the day before.  After that, how many brownies were on the counter?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many brownies were initially made by Mother. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen brownies equal 24 brownies.",
    "Father ate 8 brownies from the 24. I need to subtract those 8 brownies from the initial 24 brownies.",
    "24 - 8 = 16. So, there were 16 brownies remaining after Father ate some.",
    "Then, Mooney ate 4 more brownies. I need to subtract those 4 brownies from the remaining 16 brownies.",
    "16 - 4 = 12. So, there were 12 brownies left after both Father and Mooney had some.",
    "The next morning, Mother made another two dozen brownies, which is 24 brownies, and added them to the 12 brownies that were left.",
    "I need to add the newly made 24 brownies to the 12 remaining brownies from the previous day.",
    "12 + 24 = 36. Therefore, there were 36 brownies on the counter after the additional brownies were made."

  "solution": "36"
