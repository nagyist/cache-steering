    "Initially, Alex has 4 pens in the first week.",
    "In the second week, Alex's pen collection doubles: 4 pens * 2 = 8 pens.",
    "In the third week, Alex's pen collection doubles again: 8 pens * 2 = 16 pens.",
    "In the fourth week (after a month), Alex's pen collection doubles: 16 pens * 2 = 32 pens.",
    "Jane will have 16 pens after a month.",
    "To find how many more pens Alex will have than Jane, I need to subtract the number of Jane's pens from Alex's pens: 32 pens - 16 pens = 16 pens."
