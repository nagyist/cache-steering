  "query": "Coby went on a road trip. He is traveling from Washington to Nevada but he needs to stop in Idaho which is 640 miles away from Washington and 550 miles away from Nevada to pick up some friends.  If Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour going to Idaho and at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada, how many hours did it take for him to arrive at the destination?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the time it takes for Coby to travel from Washington to Idaho.",
    "The distance from Washington to Idaho is 640 miles.",
    "Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour to Idaho.",
    "Time is calculated by dividing distance by speed.",
    "So, the time taken from Washington to Idaho is 640 miles / 80 miles per hour.",
    "640 divided by 80 equals 8.",
    "Thus, it takes 8 hours for Coby to travel from Washington to Idaho.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time it takes for Coby to travel from Idaho to Nevada.",
    "The distance from Idaho to Nevada is 550 miles.",
    "Coby is traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada.",
    "Again, time is calculated by dividing distance by speed.",
    "So, the time taken from Idaho to Nevada is 550 miles / 50 miles per hour.",
    "550 divided by 50 equals 11.",
    "Thus, it takes 11 hours for Coby to travel from Idaho to Nevada.",
    "To find the total travel time, I need to add the time taken for both segments of the trip.",
    "The time from Washington to Idaho is 8 hours, and the time from Idaho to Nevada is 11 hours.",
    "8 hours + 11 hours equals 19 hours."
