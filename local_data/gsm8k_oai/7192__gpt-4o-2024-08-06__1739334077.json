  "query": "Bobby can deadlift 300 pounds at 13.  When he is 18 he can deadlift 100 pounds more than 250% of his previous deadlift.  How many pounds did he add per year?",
  "steps": [
    "Bobby's initial deadlift at age 13 is 300 pounds.",
    "250% of 300 pounds means multiplying 300 by 2.5.",
    "2.5 times 300 equals 750 pounds.",
    "At age 18, Bobby can deadlift 100 pounds more than 750 pounds.",
    "750 pounds plus 100 pounds equals 850 pounds.",
    "The difference in deadlift between age 13 and age 18 is 850 pounds minus 300 pounds.",
    "The difference is 550 pounds.",
    "This change happened over 18 - 13 = 5 years.",
    "To find how much weight he added per year, I divide the total increase by the number of years.",
    "550 pounds divided by 5 years equals 110 pounds per year."

  "solution": "110"
