    "Start with the initial amount of money Donny has, which is $78.",
    "Subtract the cost of the kite from the total amount. The kite costs $8.",
    "$78 - $8 = $70. After buying the kite, Donny has $70 left.",
    "Next, subtract the cost of the frisbee from the remaining amount. The frisbee costs $9.",
    "$70 - $9 = $61. After buying both the kite and the frisbee, Donny has $61 left."
