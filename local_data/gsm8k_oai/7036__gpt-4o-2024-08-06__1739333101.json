  "query": "Debora has 12 more dresses than Melissa. Melissa has half the number of dresses Emily has. If Emily has 16 dresses, how many dresses do the three of them have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dresses Emily has. I already know Emily has 16 dresses.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many dresses Melissa has. It is given that Melissa has half the number of dresses Emily has.",
    "Since Emily has 16 dresses, Melissa must have 16 / 2 = 8 dresses.",
    "Now, I know that Debora has 12 more dresses than Melissa.",
    "Melissa has 8 dresses, so Debora has 8 + 12 = 20 dresses.",
    "Now I have the number of dresses each person has: Debora has 20, Melissa has 8, and Emily has 16.",
    "To find the total number of dresses the three of them have, I need to add these numbers together.",
    "Total number of dresses = 20 (Debora) + 8 (Melissa) + 16 (Emily) = 44."
