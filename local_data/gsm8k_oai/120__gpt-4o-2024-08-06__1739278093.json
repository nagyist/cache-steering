  "query": "Carrie works for $8 an hour and 35 hours a week at her job. It\u2019s been a month since she started working there. She has saved up all of her money because she wants to buy a bike for $400. How much money will she have left over after she buys her bike?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, I need to find out how much money Carrie has earned in a month.",
    "First, I need to calculate how much she makes in a week. She works 35 hours a week.",
    "She earns $8 per hour.",
    "So, I multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a week: 8 * 35.",
    "8 multiplied by 35 is 280. Hence, she earns $280 per week.",
    "Now, I calculate how much she earns in a month. A typical month has about 4 weeks.",
    "Multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to get her monthly earnings: 280 * 4.",
    "280 multiplied by 4 is 1120. So, Carrie earns $1120 in a month.",
    "Carrie wants to buy a bike for $400.",
    "I need to find out how much money she will have after buying the bike.",
    "Subtract the cost of the bike from her monthly earnings: 1120 - 400.",
    "1120 minus 400 is 720."
  ],
  "solution": "720"
