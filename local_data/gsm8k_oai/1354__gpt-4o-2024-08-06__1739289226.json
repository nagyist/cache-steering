  "query": "Archie needs to lay sod in his backyard that measures 20 yards by 13 yards. He has a shed on it that measures 3 yards by 5 yards. How many square yards of sod will Archie need for his backyard?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total area of the backyard.",
    "The backyard measures 20 yards by 13 yards.",
    "The area of the backyard is 20 * 13.",
    "20 * 13 equals 260 square yards.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the area of the shed that doesn't require sod.",
    "The shed measures 3 yards by 5 yards.",
    "The area of the shed is 3 * 5.",
    "3 * 5 equals 15 square yards.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the area of the shed from the total area of the backyard to find out how much area needs sod.",
    "260 (total backyard area) - 15 (shed area) equals 245 square yards.",
    "I have calculated that Archie needs 245 square yards of sod."

  "solution": "245"
