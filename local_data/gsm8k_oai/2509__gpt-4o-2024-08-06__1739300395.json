  "query": "Sam spends sixty minutes studying Science, eighty minutes in Math, and forty minutes in Literature.  How many hours does Sam spend studying the three subjects?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total time Sam spends studying all three subjects in minutes.",
    "Sam spends 60 minutes on Science.",
    "Sam spends 80 minutes on Math.",
    "Sam spends 40 minutes on Literature.",
    "To find the total time spent studying in minutes, I need to add all these times together: 60 + 80 + 40.",
    "60 + 80 = 140",
    "140 + 40 = 180",
    "Sam spends a total of 180 minutes studying.",
    "Now, I need to convert the total time spent from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To convert minutes to hours, divide the total minutes by 60: 180 \u00f7 60.",
    "180 \u00f7 60 = 3"
