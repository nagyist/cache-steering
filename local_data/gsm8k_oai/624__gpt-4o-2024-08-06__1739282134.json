    "Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia.",
    "To find out how many pieces Lorene has, I need to multiply the number of pieces Georgia has by 3.",
    "Lorene has 25 pieces \u00d7 3 = 75 pieces of stationery.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene.",
    "To do this, I subtract the number of pieces Georgia has from the number of pieces Lorene has.",
    "Number of pieces Lorene has: 75.",
    "Number of pieces Georgia has: 25.",
    "So, 75 - 25 = 50."
