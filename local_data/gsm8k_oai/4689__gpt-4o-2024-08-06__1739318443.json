  "query": "Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day. Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.  Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.  How many dozen eggs do the three collect total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of eggs Benjamin collects.",
    "Benjamin collects 6 dozen eggs a day.",
    "Next, I calculate how many eggs Carla collects.",
    "Carla collects 3 times the number of eggs that Benjamin collects.",
    "So, Carla collects 3 * 6 dozen = 18 dozen eggs.",
    "Now, I calculate how many eggs Trisha collects.",
    "Trisha collects 4 dozen less than Benjamin.",
    "So, Trisha collects 6 dozen - 4 dozen = 2 dozen eggs.",
    "I find the total number of dozen eggs the three collect by adding Benjamin's, Carla's, and Trisha's totals.",
    "Benjamin collects 6 dozen, Carla collects 18 dozen, and Trisha collects 2 dozen.",
    "I add these together: 6 dozen + 18 dozen + 2 dozen.",
    "6 + 18 + 2 = 26."
