  "query": "James buys jars for his honey.  He has 5 hives that each produce 20 liters of honey.  Each jar can hold .5 liters.  How many jars will he need to buy if his friend is bringing his own jars for half the honey?",
  "steps": [
    "James has 5 hives.",
    "Each hive produces 20 liters of honey.",
    "So, the total quantity of honey produced is 5 hives * 20 liters per hive = 100 liters of honey.",
    "His friend is bringing jars for half of the honey.",
    "Half of 100 liters is 50 liters.",
    "This means James needs to buy jars for the remaining 50 liters of honey.",
    "Each jar can hold 0.5 liters of honey.",
    "To find out how many jars James needs, I divide the amount of honey by the capacity of each jar.",
    "50 liters \u00f7 0.5 liters per jar = 100 jars."
