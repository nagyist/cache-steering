  "query": "Lillian went out to forage for mushrooms with her handy guidebook. She found 32 mushrooms and used her guidebook to identify which ones were poisonous and which were safe to eat. In the end, she had 9 mushrooms she could safely eat for dinner. Of the rest, she identified twice the amount she ate as poisonous, and a remaining bunch she was uncertain about. How many mushrooms was she uncertain were safe or poisonous?",
  "steps": [
    "Lillian found a total of 32 mushrooms.",
    "She identified 9 mushrooms as safe to eat.",
    "The number of poisonous mushrooms she identified was twice the amount she could eat.",
    "Twice the amount she could eat (9) is 2 * 9 = 18.",
    "The mushrooms identified are 9 (safe) + 18 (poisonous) = 27 mushrooms.",
    "The total number of mushrooms is 32, and she identified 27.",
    "The number of mushrooms she was uncertain about is 32 - 27.",
    "32 - 27 = 5."
