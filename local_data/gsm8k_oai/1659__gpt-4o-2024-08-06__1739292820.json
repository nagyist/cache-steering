  "query": "In a national park, the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines. If there are 600 pines in the national park, calculate the total number of pines and redwoods that are there.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many redwoods are there.",
    "The number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines.",
    "There are 600 pines in the national park.",
    "To find 20% of the number of pines, I calculate 20% of 600.",
    "20% of 600 is calculated as (20/100) * 600.",
    "20/100 is 0.2.",
    "So, I multiply 0.2 * 600 to get 120.",
    "This means there are 120 more redwoods than pines.",
    "I add 120 to the number of pines (600) to get the total number of redwoods.",
    "600 + 120 equals 720.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of both pines and redwoods.",
    "The total number of trees will be the sum of pines and redwoods.",
    "Therefore, I add 600 (pines) to 720 (redwoods).",
    "600 + 720 equals 1320."

  "solution": "1320"
