  "query": "Janice bought five juices for $10 in total and two sandwiches for $6 in total. How much would she need to pay, if she would only buy one sandwich and one juice?",
  "steps": [
    "Janice bought five juices for $10 in total.",
    "To find the price of one juice, I need to divide the total price of the juices by the number of juices.",
    "$10 divided by 5 juices gives $2 per juice.",
    "Next, Janice bought two sandwiches for $6 in total.",
    "To find the price of one sandwich, I need to divide the total price of the sandwiches by the number of sandwiches.",
    "$6 divided by 2 sandwiches gives $3 per sandwich.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of one sandwich and one juice.",
    "The price of one juice is $2 and the price of one sandwich is $3.",
    "Adding these two prices together gives $2 + $3.",
    "$2 + $3 equals $5."
