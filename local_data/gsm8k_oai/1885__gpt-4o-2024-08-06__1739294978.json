  "query": "Michael wants to dig a hole 400 feet less deep than twice the depth of the hole that his father dug. The father dug a hole at a rate of 4 feet per hour. If the father took 400 hours to dig his hole, how many hours will it take for Michael to dig a hole that is 400 feet less than twice as deep as his father's hole working at the same rate?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the depth of the hole that Michael's father dug.",
    "The father dug at a rate of 4 feet per hour for 400 hours.",
    "To find the depth, I multiply the rate by the time: 4 feet/hour * 400 hours.",
    "This calculation gives the depth of the father's hole as 1600 feet.",
    "Next, I need to find the depth of the hole Michael plans to dig.",
    "Michael's hole is 400 feet less deep than twice the depth of his father's hole.",
    "First, I calculate twice the depth of the father's hole: 2 * 1600 feet = 3200 feet.",
    "Michael's hole is 3200 feet - 400 feet = 2800 feet deep.",
    "Now, I'll determine how many hours it will take for Michael to dig a hole 2800 feet deep.",
    "Michael digs at the same rate as his father, which is 4 feet per hour.",
    "To find the time taken, I divide the depth by the rate: 2800 feet / 4 feet/hour.",
    "This calculation gives 700 hours."
