  "query": "The selling price of a bicycle that had sold for $220 last year was increased by 15%. What is the new price?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that the initial selling price of the bicycle was $220.",
    "I need to calculate 15% of $220 to find how much the price was increased.",
    "To find 15% of $220, I multiply 220 by 0.15.",
    "220 * 0.15 equals 33.",
    "So, the price increase is $33.",
    "To find the new price, I need to add the increase to the original price.",
    "220 + 33 equals 253."
