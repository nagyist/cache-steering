  "query": "Tina's bag contains nine apples, 5 oranges, and 17 tangerines. If she took away 2 oranges and 10 tangerines, how many more tangerines than oranges would she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many oranges are left if Tina took away 2 from her initial count of 5 oranges.",
    "5 oranges minus 2 oranges equals 3 oranges left.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tangerines are left if 10 tangerines are taken away from the initial count of 17 tangerines.",
    "17 tangerines minus 10 tangerines equals 7 tangerines left.",
    "Now, to find out how many more tangerines Tina has than oranges, I need to subtract the number of oranges from the number of tangerines.",
    "7 tangerines minus 3 oranges equals 4 more tangerines than oranges."

  "solution": "4"
