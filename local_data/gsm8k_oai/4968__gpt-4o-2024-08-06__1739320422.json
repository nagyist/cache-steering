  "query": "Tom eats a pound of carrots and twice as much broccoli.  If carrots have 51 calories per pound and broccoli has 1/3 that many calories, how many calories did he eat in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom eats 1 pound of carrots.",
    "Carrots have 51 calories per pound.",
    "Therefore, Tom consumes 51 calories from the carrots.",
    "Tom eats twice as much broccoli as carrots, meaning he eats 2 pounds of broccoli.",
    "Broccoli has 1/3 the calories of carrots per pound.",
    "1/3 of 51 calories is 17 calories (because 51 divided by 3 equals 17).",
    "Therefore, broccoli has 17 calories per pound.",
    "Tom eats 2 pounds of broccoli, so he consumes 2 times 17 calories.",
    "2 times 17 equals 34.",
    "Tom consumes 34 calories from the broccoli.",
    "To find the total calories Tom consumed, we need to add the calories from the carrots and the broccoli.",
    "Tom consumes 51 calories from the carrots and 34 calories from the broccoli.",
    "Adding these together, 51 plus 34 equals 85."
