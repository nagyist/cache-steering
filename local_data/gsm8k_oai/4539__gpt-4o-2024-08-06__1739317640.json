  "query": "At Palm Meadows, there are 13 hotel rooms. Eight of the rooms have two beds in them and the rest have three beds. How many beds are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many rooms have two beds and how many rooms have three beds.",
    "The problem states that there are 13 hotel rooms in total.",
    "It also states that 8 of these rooms have two beds.",
    "So, the remaining rooms must have three beds.",
    "To find out how many rooms have three beds, I subtract the number of two-bed rooms from the total number of rooms.",
    "13 total rooms - 8 rooms with two beds = 5 rooms with three beds.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of beds from the rooms with two beds.",
    "There are 8 rooms, each with 2 beds.",
    "8 rooms \u00d7 2 beds/room = 16 beds from the two-bed rooms.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of beds from the rooms with three beds.",
    "There are 5 rooms, each with 3 beds.",
    "5 rooms \u00d7 3 beds/room = 15 beds from the three-bed rooms.",
    "Finally, I add up all the beds to find the total number of beds in the hotel.",
    "16 beds (from two-bed rooms) + 15 beds (from three-bed rooms) = 31 beds."
