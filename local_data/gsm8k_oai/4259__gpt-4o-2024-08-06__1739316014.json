  "steps": [
    "The mother buys a box of sweets that contains 27 pieces.",
    "She kept 1/3 of the sweets for herself.",
    "1/3 of 27 is calculated as 27 / 3 = 9.",
    "The mother keeps 9 sweets, so there are 27 - 9 = 18 sweets left.",
    "The remaining 18 sweets are divided among her 3 children.",
    "The eldest child got 8 sweets.",
    "The youngest child got half as many as the eldest, so the youngest got 8 / 2 = 4 sweets.",
    "So far, the eldest and youngest have received 8 + 4 = 12 sweets.",
    "Since there were 18 sweets to be divided, the second child gets 18 - 12 = 6 sweets."
