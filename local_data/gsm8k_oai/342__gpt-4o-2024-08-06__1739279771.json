  "query": "In a 90-minute soccer game, Mark played 20 minutes, then rested after. He then played for another 35 minutes. How long was he on the sideline?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total game time, which is given as 90 minutes.",
    "Next, determine how many periods Mark played. He first played for 20 minutes.",
    "After his first period of playing, he rested. We need to calculate the rest time.",
    "Then, he played again for another 35 minutes.",
    "Calculate the total playing time: 20 minutes (first period) + 35 minutes (second period) = 55 minutes.",
    "Subtract the total playing time from the total game time to determine the time he was on the sideline: 90 minutes (total game time) - 55 minutes (total playing time) = 35 minutes."

  "solution": "35"
