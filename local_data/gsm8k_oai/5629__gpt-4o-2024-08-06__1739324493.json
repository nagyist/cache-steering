  "query": "1/3 of the townspeople have received the full COVID vaccine. 1/3 are immune because they already recovered from COVID. If 1/6 of the townspeople are both vaccinated and already had COVID, what percent of the town is immune in some way?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the percentage of the townspeople that are immune either through vaccination or by having had COVID or both.",
    "First, I note that 1/3 of the townspeople are vaccinated.",
    "Then, I notice that 1/3 have had and recovered from COVID.",
    "1/6 of the townspeople fall into both categories; these individuals are counted among both the vaccinated and the recovered.",
    "The formula to find the union of two overlapping sets is: Percentage(immune) = Percentage(vaccinated) + Percentage(recovered) - Percentage(both).",
    "Substitute the values: Percentage(immune) = 1/3 + 1/3 - 1/6.",
    "Convert these fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6.",
    "1/3 as a fraction with a denominator of 6 is 2/6.",
    "So, substitute: Percentage(immune) = 2/6 + 2/6 - 1/6.",
    "Add 2/6 and 2/6: 4/6.",
    "Then subtract 1/6 from 4/6: 3/6.",
    "Simplify 3/6 to 1/2.",
    "Convert 1/2 to a percentage: 50%."
