  "query": "Jerry's breakfast includes 6 pancakes with 120 calories each, two strips of bacon with 100 calories each, and a bowl of cereal with 200 calories. How many calories is his breakfast total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total calories from the pancakes.",
    "Jerry has 6 pancakes, and each one has 120 calories.",
    "I will multiply the number of pancakes by the calories each pancake has: \\(6 \\times 120 = 720\\).",
    "The total calories from the pancakes is 720 calories.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total calories from the bacon strips.",
    "Jerry has 2 strips of bacon, and each strip has 100 calories.",
    "I will multiply the number of bacon strips by the calories per strip: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\).",
    "The total calories from the bacon is 200 calories.",
    "Then, I will add the calories from the bowl of cereal.",
    "The cereal has 200 calories.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total calories for the entire breakfast.",
    "I will add the calories from the pancakes, bacon, and cereal: \\(720 + 200 + 200 = 1120\\)."

  "solution": "1120"
