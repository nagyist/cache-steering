  "query": "Ruth goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. She is in math class 25% of this time. How many hours per week does she spend in math class?",
  "steps": [
    "Ruth goes to school 8 hours each day.",
    "She goes to school 5 days a week.",
    "To find the total hours Ruth spends in school each week, multiply the number of hours she spends at school daily by the number of days she goes to school each week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week.",
    "8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.",
    "Ruth spends 25% of her school time in math class.",
    "To find out how many hours she spends in math class, calculate 25% of her total school hours per week.",
    "25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form.",
    "Multiply the total weekly school hours by 0.25 to find the hours spent in math class: 40 hours/week * 0.25 = 10 hours."
