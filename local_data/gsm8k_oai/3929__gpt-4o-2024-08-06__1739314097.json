  "query": "Matthew, Patrick and Alvin are eating dinner together. Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats. Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many egg rolls Patrick eats based on Alvin's consumption.",
    "Alvin ate 4 egg rolls.",
    "Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin.",
    "Calculate half of 4 to find out how many egg rolls Patrick eats.",
    "Half of 4 is 2, so Patrick eats 2 egg rolls.",
    "Next, determine how many egg rolls Matthew eats based on Patrick's consumption.",
    "Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick.",
    "Calculate 3 times 2 to find out how many egg rolls Matthew eats.",
    "Three times 2 is 6."
