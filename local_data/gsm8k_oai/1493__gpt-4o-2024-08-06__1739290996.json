  "query": "Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the travel time for each part of the journey.",
    "The first part of their journey is 100 miles, which they covered in 1 hour.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it took them to cover the remaining 300 miles.",
    "The problem doesn't specify a change in speed for the remaining journey, so I might assume they continue at the same speed.",
    "The speed for the first part of the journey is 100 miles per hour.",
    "They continue at 100 miles per hour for the remaining 300 miles.",
    "To calculate the time for 300 miles at 100 mph, I divide the miles by the speed: 300 miles / 100 mph = 3 hours.",
    "Now, I need to add up the time for both parts of the journey.",
    "The first part took 1 hour, and the second part took 3 hours.",
    "1 hour + 3 hours equals 4 hours."

  "solution": "4"
