  "query": "Marla is thinking about getting a canvas tote bag to avoid using plastic bags at the grocery store. If making the canvas bag released 600 pounds of carbon dioxide, each plastic bag released 4 ounces of carbon dioxide, and Marla uses eight bags per shopping trips, how many shopping trips will she have to make before the canvas bag is the lower-carbon solution? (There are 16 ounces in a pound.)",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's asking to find how many shopping trips Marla needs to make with a canvas bag for it to offset the carbon dioxide emissions of the plastic bags.",
    "I know that making the canvas tote bag released 600 pounds of carbon dioxide.",
    "I also know that each plastic bag used released 4 ounces of carbon dioxide.",
    "There are 16 ounces in a pound, so I need to convert the carbon dioxide emissions of each plastic bag from ounces to pounds.",
    "4 ounces per plastic bag equals 4/16 pounds of carbon dioxide per bag.",
    "Simplifying, 4/16 pounds equals 0.25 pounds of carbon dioxide per plastic bag.",
    "Marla uses eight plastic bags per shopping trip.",
    "To find out how much carbon dioxide is emitted per trip using plastic bags, I multiply the carbon dioxide emission per bag by the number of bags used per trip.",
    "That's 0.25 pounds per plastic bag times 8 bags per trip which equals 2 pounds of carbon dioxide per shopping trip.",
    "I need to determine how many trips are needed for the canvas bag's 600-pound carbon dioxide emission to be equal to or less than the number of pounds emitted by plastic bags.",
    "This means I need to find how many trips of 2 pounds each would equal 600 pounds.",
    "To find this, I divide the total pound emission for the canvas bag by the pounds emitted per trip using plastic bags.",
    "So, 600 pounds divided by 2 pounds per trip equals 300 trips.",
    "Therefore, Marla will have to make 300 shopping trips for the canvas bag to be the lower-carbon solution."
