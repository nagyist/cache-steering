  "query": "Lyanna set up a food bank to collect food to give to the homeless in her local town. In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated to the food bank by the people of her local town. In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week. If she gave out 70% of the donated food to the homeless in the third week, calculate the amount of food remaining in the food bank.",
  "steps": [
    "In the first week, the amount of food donated was 40 pounds.",
    "In the second week, donations were twice as high as the first week.",
    "Therefore, in the second week, 40 pounds * 2 = 80 pounds of food were donated.",
    "To find the total amount of food donated in the two weeks, I add the donations from both weeks.",
    "Total food donated = 40 pounds (first week) + 80 pounds (second week) = 120 pounds.",
    "In the third week, 70% of the donated food was given out.",
    "To find out how much food was given out, I calculate 70% of 120 pounds.",
    "70% of 120 pounds = 0.7 * 120 = 84 pounds.",
    "To find the remaining amount of food, I subtract the food given out from the total food donated.",
    "Remaining food = 120 pounds - 84 pounds = 36 pounds."
