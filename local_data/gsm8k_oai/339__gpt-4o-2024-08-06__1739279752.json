  "steps": [
    "Terez has a total of 44 cows on his farm.",
    "50 percent of the cows are female. To find the number of female cows, I will calculate 50 percent of 44.",
    "50 percent is the same as 0.50 or 1/2. Therefore, I need to multiply 44 by 0.50.",
    "44 multiplied by 0.50 equals 22. So, there are 22 female cows.",
    "50 percent of the female cows are pregnant. Again, I need to find 50 percent of 22.",
    "50 percent of 22 is calculated by multiplying 22 by 0.50.",
    "22 multiplied by 0.50 equals 11. So, there are 11 pregnant female cows."
