  "query": "Tomas is hoping to run a marathon next year, which is 26.3 miles. He knows that each month he trains, he can run twice as far as the month before. If he can run 3 miles during the first month of training, how many total months before the marathon should he start training to ensure he can run far enough?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Tomas starts running 3 miles in the first month.",
    "Each month, Tomas can run twice the distance he ran in the previous month.",
    "I need to find when the distance he can run equals or exceeds 26.3 miles.",
    "I'll calculate how many miles Tomas can run each month:",
    "Month 1: Tomas runs 3 miles.",
    "Month 2: Tomas runs 3 * 2 = 6 miles.",
    "Month 3: Tomas runs 6 * 2 = 12 miles.",
    "Month 4: Tomas runs 12 * 2 = 24 miles.",
    "Month 5: Tomas runs 24 * 2 = 48 miles.",
    "I now need to verify if 48 miles in Month 5 is the first month he can run at least 26.3 miles.",
    "In Month 4, Tomas runs 24 miles, which is less than 26.3 miles.",
    "In Month 5, Tomas runs 48 miles, which is more than 26.3 miles.",
    "Therefore, Tomas should start training 5 months before the marathon."
