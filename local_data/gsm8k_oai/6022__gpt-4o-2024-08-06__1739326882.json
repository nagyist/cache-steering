  "query": "Barbie and Bruno have a pile of 144 coconuts that they need to move from one side of their yard to the other side.  Barbie can carry 4 coconuts at a time, while Bruno can carry 8 coconuts at a time.  If they make trips together carrying their maximum number of coconuts each time, how many trips together would they need to make to move all of the coconuts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many coconuts Barbie and Bruno can carry together in one trip. Barbie can carry 4 coconuts, and Bruno can carry 8 coconuts.",
    "Together, Barbie and Bruno can carry 4 + 8 = 12 coconuts in one trip.",
    "The total number of coconuts they need to move is 144.",
    "To find out how many trips they need to make together, I will divide the total number of coconuts by the number of coconuts they can carry together in one trip.",
    "144 coconuts divided by 12 coconuts per trip equals 12 trips.",
    "Therefore, Barbie and Bruno need to make 12 trips together to move all of the coconuts."

  "solution": "12"
