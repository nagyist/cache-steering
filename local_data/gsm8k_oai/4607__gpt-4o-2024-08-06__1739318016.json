  "query": "Jim reads at a rate of 40 pages an hour.  He reads a total of 600 pages per week.  He increases his reading speed to 150% of its former speed but reads 4 hours less per week.  How many pages does he read a week now?",
  "steps": [
    "Jim's initial reading speed is 40 pages per hour.",
    "Jim reads 600 pages per week initially.",
    "To find out how many hours Jim reads per week initially, we divide the total pages by his reading speed: 600 pages \u00f7 40 pages/hour = 15 hours per week.",
    "Jim increases his reading speed to 150% of 40 pages per hour.",
    "150% of 40 is calculated as 40 \u00d7 1.5 = 60 pages per hour.",
    "Jim reads 4 hours less per week at this new speed, so he now reads for 15 - 4 = 11 hours per week.",
    "At his new speed of 60 pages per hour, Jim reads 60 pages/hour \u00d7 11 hours/week = 660 pages per week."

  "solution": "660"
