  "query": "In the second hour of a storm it rains 7 inches more than twice the amount it rained the first hour. The total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches. How much did it rain in the first hour?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the amount of rain in the first hour as \\( x \\) inches.",
    "According to the problem, in the second hour it rains 7 inches more than twice the amount it rained in the first hour.",
    "Therefore, the amount of rain in the second hour can be expressed as \\( 2x + 7 \\).",
    "We know that the total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches.",
    "This means that \\( x + (2x + 7) = 22 \\).",
    "Let's simplify the expression: Combine like terms to get \\( 3x + 7 = 22 \\).",
    "To isolate \\( x \\), subtract 7 from both sides: \\( 3x = 22 - 7 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( 3x = 15 \\).",
    "Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = \\frac{15}{3} \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( x = 5 \\)."
