  "steps": [
    "The total number of people vaccinated at the clinic is 650.",
    "Out of these 650 people, 80% were adults.",
    "To find the number of adults, I need to calculate 80% of 650.",
    "80% as a decimal is 0.80.",
    "Calculating 0.80 * 650 will give me the number of adults.",
    "0.80 * 650 = 520.",
    "There were 520 adults vaccinated.",
    "To find the number of vaccinated children, I need to subtract the number of adults from the total number of people.",
    "650 - 520 = 130.",
    "There were 130 children vaccinated."
