  "query": "Layla is feeding her pet fish. She has two Goldfish which each get one teaspoon of fish food. Her 3 Swordtails each get 2 teaspoons of food. Her 8 Guppies each eat half a teaspoon of food. How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Layla has 2 Goldfish.",
    "Each Goldfish gets 1 teaspoon of food.",
    "2 Goldfish x 1 teaspoon per Goldfish = 2 teaspoons.",
    "Layla has 3 Swordtails.",
    "Each Swordtail gets 2 teaspoons of food.",
    "3 Swordtails x 2 teaspoons per Swordtail = 6 teaspoons.",
    "Layla has 8 Guppies.",
    "Each Guppy gets 0.5 teaspoon of food.",
    "8 Guppies x 0.5 teaspoon per Guppy = 4 teaspoons.",
    "Now I will add up all the teaspoons of food required for each type of fish: 2 teaspoons (Goldfish) + 6 teaspoons (Swordtails) + 4 teaspoons (Guppies).",
    "2 + 6 + 4 = 12 teaspoons."
