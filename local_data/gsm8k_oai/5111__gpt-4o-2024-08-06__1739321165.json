  "steps": [
    "The eldest child is 20 years old now.",
    "The siblings are each born 5 years apart.",
    "So, the second child is 5 years younger than the eldest child.",
    "The second child is 20 - 5 = 15 years old now.",
    "The third child is 5 years younger than the second child.",
    "The third child is 15 - 5 = 10 years old now.",
    "We need to find the total ages of the siblings 10 years from now.",
    "In 10 years, the eldest child will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old.",
    "In 10 years, the second child will be 15 + 10 = 25 years old.",
    "In 10 years, the third child will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total ages of the siblings 10 years from now.",
    "Total age in 10 years = 30 + 25 + 20.",
    "Let's perform the addition: 30 + 25 = 55.",
    "Now, add the remaining age: 55 + 20 = 75."
