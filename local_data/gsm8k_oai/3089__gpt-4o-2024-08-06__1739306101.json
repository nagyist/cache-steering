  "query": "Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?",
  "steps": [
    "Tracy collects a certain number of books in the first week. Let's call this number x.",
    "In the next five weeks, Tracy collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week.",
    "This means she collects 10 * x books over the next five weeks.",
    "The total number of books Tracy collects in the six weeks is x + 10x, which simplifies to 11x.",
    "We are told that she has 99 books now.",
    "So, we can set up the equation: 11x = 99.",
    "To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11.",
    "99 divided by 11 equals 9."

  "solution": "9"
