  "query": "Gretchen's local ice cream shop offers 100 different flavors.  She was able to try a 1/4 of the flavors 2 years ago and double that amount last year.  How many more flavors will she need to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors?",
  "steps": [
    "Two years ago, Gretchen tried 1/4 of the flavors.",
    "100 flavors * 1/4 = 25 flavors were tried two years ago.",
    "Last year, she tried double the amount she tried two years ago.",
    "Double of 25 flavors = 25 * 2 = 50 flavors were tried last year.",
    "To find out how many unique flavors she has tried thus far, add the flavors she tried over the two years.",
    "25 flavors (two years ago) + 50 flavors (last year) = 75 flavors have been tried so far.",
    "There are 100 total flavors and she's already tried 75.",
    "100 total flavors - 75 flavors tried = 25 more flavors left to try."

  "solution": "25"
