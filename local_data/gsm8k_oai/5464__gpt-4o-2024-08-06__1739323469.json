  "query": "Bill milked his cow and got 16 gallons of milk. He turned 1/4 into sour cream, 1/4 into butter, and kept the rest as whole milk. It takes 4 gallons of milk to make one gallon of butter and 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream. If Bill sells butter for $5/gallon, sour cream for $6/gallon, and whole milk for $3/gallon, how much money does he make?",
  "steps": [
    "Bill started with 16 gallons of milk.",
    "He turned 1/4 of his milk into sour cream. 1/4 of 16 gallons is 16 * 1/4 = 4 gallons.",
    "He also turned 1/4 of his milk into butter. So, 1/4 of 16 gallons is 16 * 1/4 = 4 gallons for butter.",
    "For the sour cream, 2 gallons of milk make 1 gallon of sour cream. He used 4 gallons of milk for sour cream, meaning he made 4 / 2 = 2 gallons of sour cream.",
    "For the butter, 4 gallons of milk make 1 gallon of butter. He used 4 gallons of milk for butter, resulting in 4 / 4 = 1 gallon of butter.",
    "The remaining milk for whole milk is the initial 16 gallons minus the 4 gallons for sour cream and 4 gallons for butter, which is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 gallons of whole milk.",
    "Bill sells butter for $5 per gallon. He made 1 gallon of butter, so he earns 1 * 5 = $5 from butter.",
    "Bill sells sour cream for $6 per gallon. He made 2 gallons of sour cream, so he earns 2 * 6 = $12 from sour cream.",
    "Bill sells whole milk for $3 per gallon. He has 8 gallons of whole milk, so he earns 8 * 3 = $24 from whole milk.",
    "To find out the total amount Bill makes, I add the earnings from butter, sour cream, and whole milk: $5 + $12 + $24 = $41."
