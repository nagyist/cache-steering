  "query": "John and his best friend Steve bought 12 cupcakes together.  Each cupcake cost $1.50. If they split the costs evenly, how much did each person pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total cost of the cupcakes.",
    "There are 12 cupcakes.",
    "Each cupcake costs $1.50.",
    "Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cupcakes by the cost per cupcake: 12 * $1.50.",
    "12 * $1.50 = $18.00",
    "The total cost for the 12 cupcakes is $18.00.",
    "Since John and Steve split the costs evenly, divide the total cost by 2.",
    "$18.00 divided by 2 equals $9.00.",
    "Each person paid $9.00."
  ],
  "solution": "9"
