  "query": "James spends 3 hours vacuuming and 3 times as long on the rest of his chores.  How long does he spend on his chores?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the time James spends on the rest of his chores.",
    "James spends 3 hours on vacuuming.",
    "He spends 3 times the time he spent vacuuming on his other chores.",
    "So, for the other chores, James spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours.",
    "Now, I will add the time he spends vacuuming to the time he spends on the other chores.",
    "The total time spent on all chores is 3 hours (vacuuming) + 9 hours (other chores).",
    "3 + 9 equals 12."
