  "query": "Edric's monthly salary is $576. If he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, how much is his hourly rate?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a week.",
    "Edric works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, so I multiply 8 hours by 6 days.",
    "8 hours/day \u00d7 6 days/week = 48 hours/week",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a month.",
    "Since a month typically has around 4 weeks, I multiply 48 hours/week by 4 weeks/month.",
    "48 hours/week \u00d7 4 weeks/month = 192 hours/month",
    "Now I need to calculate Edric's hourly rate using his monthly salary.",
    "His monthly salary is $576, and he works 192 hours in a month.",
    "To find the hourly rate, I divide the monthly salary by the total number of hours.",
    "$576/month \u00f7 192 hours/month = $3/hour"
  ],
  "solution": "3"
