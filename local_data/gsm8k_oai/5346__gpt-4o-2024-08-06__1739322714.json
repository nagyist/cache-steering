  "query": "Henry needs to declutter his book collection of 99 books.  From his bookshelf, he was able to fill 3 boxes of 15 books each to take to a donation center.  He had 21 books in a room he could donate, 4 on his coffee table and 18 cookbooks stashed in the kitchen.  When he dropped them off, he noticed a box of books that had a  \"free to a good home\" note.  He grabbed 12 books to take back to his place.  How many books does Henry now have?",
  "steps": [
    "Henry originally had 99 books.",
    "Henry donated 3 boxes of 15 books each.",
    "3 times 15 is 45, so he donated 45 books from his bookshelf.",
    "Subtract the 45 books he donated from his original 99 books.",
    "99 minus 45 equals 54. Henry has 54 books left after donating from his bookshelf.",
    "Henry also donates 21 books from a room.",
    "Subtract 21 books from the 54 books he has left.",
    "54 minus 21 equals 33. He now has 33 books left.",
    "Henry donates 4 books from his coffee table.",
    "Subtract 4 books from the 33 books he has left.",
    "33 minus 4 equals 29. He now has 29 books left.",
    "Henry donates 18 cookbooks from the kitchen.",
    "Subtract 18 books from the 29 books he has left.",
    "29 minus 18 equals 11. He now has 11 books left.",
    "Henry picked up 12 books that were \"free to a good home.\"",
    "Add 12 books to the 11 books he has left.",
    "11 plus 12 equals 23."
