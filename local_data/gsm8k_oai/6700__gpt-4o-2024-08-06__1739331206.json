  "query": "Billy's mom sends him to get ketchup. She gives him $10 and tells him to get the best deal on ketchup that he can and to spend all $10 on ketchup. He finds a bottle with 10 oz that cost $1 each. He finds a bottle that costs $2 that contains 16 ounces. He finds a bottle with 25 ounces that costs $2.5. He finds a $5 bottle that contains 50 ounces. Finally, he finds a $10 bottle with 200 ounces. How many bottles of ketchup does he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which bottle of ketchup offers the most ounces per dollar.",
    "For the first option, the bottle is 10 ounces for $1, or 10 ounces per dollar.",
    "The next option is 16 ounces for $2, or 8 ounces per dollar.",
    "The third option is 25 ounces for $2.5, or 10 ounces per dollar.",
    "The fourth option is 50 ounces for $5, or 10 ounces per dollar.",
    "The last option is 200 ounces for $10, or 20 ounces per dollar.",
    "The $10 bottle offers the best value at 20 ounces per dollar.",
    "Billy's mom told him to spend all $10, and the $10 bottle matches that requirement.",
    "Since the $10 bottle offers the best value and matches the requirement of spending all $10, Billy should buy the $10 bottle."
