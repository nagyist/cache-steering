    "I know that Garret is currently 12 years old.",
    "Shane was 2 times older than Garret's current age twenty years ago.",
    "I calculate 2 times Garret's current age: 2 * 12 = 24.",
    "This means 20 years ago, Shane was 24 years old.",
    "To find Shane's current age, I need to add 20 years to Shane's age 20 years ago.",
    "Shane's current age is 24 + 20 = 44."
