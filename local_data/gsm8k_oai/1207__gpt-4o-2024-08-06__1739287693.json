  "query": "Nala found 5 seashells at the beach. The next day, she found another 7, and the following day, she found twice the number she got from the first two days. How many seashells does Nala have?",
  "steps": [
    "Nala initially found 5 seashells on the first day.",
    "On the second day, she found an additional 7 seashells.",
    "To find the total number of seashells after the first two days, I add the seashells from the first and second day: 5 + 7.",
    "5 + 7 equals 12 seashells after the first two days.",
    "On the third day, she found twice the number of seashells she had from the first two days.",
    "So, on the third day, she found 2 times 12 seashells.",
    "2 times 12 is 24, so she found 24 seashells on the third day.",
    "To find the total number of seashells Nala has, I add the seashells from all three days: 5 + 7 + 24.",
    "5 + 7 + 24 equals 36."
