  "query": "Donald went to a computer store. He saw a 15% reduction in the price of the laptop he wants to buy. If the laptop originally costs $800, how much will he pay for the laptop?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much the 15% reduction amounts to in dollars.",
    "To calculate the reduction, I multiply the original price, $800, by 15%.",
    "Converting 15% to a decimal gives me 0.15.",
    "Now, I multiply $800 by 0.15 to find the discount amount.",
    "$800 * 0.15 equals $120.",
    "The reduction in price is $120.",
    "Next, I need to subtract this discount from the original price.",
    "$800 - $120 equals $680.",
    "So, the final price Donald will pay for the laptop after the 15% reduction is applied is $680."
