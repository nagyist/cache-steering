  "query": "Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra, but Ken released 3 fish back into the lake. Kendra caught 30 fish and did not release any of them back into the lake. How many fish did Ken and Kendra bring home?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that Kendra caught 30 fish.",
    "Ken caught twice as many fish as Kendra.",
    "Since Kendra caught 30 fish, Ken originally caught 2 times 30.",
    "2 times 30 is 60, so Ken originally caught 60 fish.",
    "Ken released 3 fish back into the lake.",
    "If Ken released 3 fish, we subtract 3 from the 60 fish he caught.",
    "60 minus 3 equals 57 fish.",
    "Ken brought home 57 fish.",
    "Kendra brought home 30 fish.",
    "To find how many fish Ken and Kendra brought home together, I need to add the fish Ken brought home to the fish Kendra brought home.",
    "57 plus 30 equals 87."

  "solution": "87"
