  "query": "The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.",
  "steps": [
    "The number of goals scored against Barca by exactly two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league.",
    "The total number of goals scored in the league against Barca is given as 300.",
    "I need to calculate what 20% of 300 is to find the total number of goals scored by the two players.",
    "To calculate 20% of 300, I multiply 300 by 0.20.",
    "300 multiplied by 0.20 equals 60.",
    "The two players together scored 60 goals in total.",
    "The players scored an equal number of goals.",
    "Since the 60 goals are evenly divided between two players, I need to divide 60 by 2.",
    "60 divided by 2 equals 30."
