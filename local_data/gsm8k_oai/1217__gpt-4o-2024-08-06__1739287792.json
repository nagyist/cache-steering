  "query": "Camden just bought 3/4 times as many dogs as Rico, who has 10 more dogs than Justin. If Justin has 14 dogs, what's the total number of legs that Camden's dogs have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many dogs Justin has. According to the problem, Justin has 14 dogs.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many dogs Rico has. Since Rico has 10 more dogs than Justin, I add 10 to Justin's number of dogs.",
    "Rico has 14 + 10 = 24 dogs.",
    "Now, I calculate how many dogs Camden has. The problem states that Camden bought 3/4 times as many dogs as Rico.",
    "I multiply the number of Rico's dogs by 3/4 to find out how many dogs Camden has: \\(24 \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\).",
    "Calculating, \\(24 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 18\\). Thus, Camden has 18 dogs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of legs that Camden's dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, I multiply the number of dogs by 4.",
    "I multiply 18 by 4 to get the total number of legs: \\(18 \\times 4 = 72\\)."

  "solution": "72"
