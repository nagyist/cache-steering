  "query": "Jane is dividing up minnows to be carnival prizes. She bought 600 minnows, and each prize is a bowl with 3 minnows. If 800 people are going to play the game and 15% win a prize, how many minnows will be left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people will actually win a prize.",
    "15% of the 800 people who are going to play the game will win a prize.",
    "To find the number of winners, I calculate 15% of 800.",
    "15% of 800 is \\(0.15 \\times 800 = 120\\).",
    "This means 120 people will win a prize.",
    "Each prize consists of a bowl with 3 minnows.",
    "I need to determine how many minnows are used in total for the winners.",
    "Calculate the total number of minnows used by multiplying the number of winners by the number of minnows per prize: \\(120 \\times 3 = 360\\).",
    "So, 360 minnows are used for the winners.",
    "Jane originally bought 600 minnows.",
    "Now, to find the number of minnows left over, I subtract the number of minnows used from the original number: \\(600 - 360 = 240\\)."

  "solution": "240"
