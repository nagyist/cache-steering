  "query": "A trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales. To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. If she received a total donation of $310 and adds it to one-half of her profit, how much money did she make above her goal?",
  "steps": [
    "The trader made a profit of $960.",
    "To pay for her next shipment, she needs to raise $610.",
    "She splits her profit in half, so half of her profit is $960 / 2.",
    "Calculating half of her profit, we get $960 / 2 = $480.",
    "The trader also receives a donation of $310 from family and friends.",
    "She adds the donation of $310 to half of her profit, $480.",
    "Adding these two amounts: $480 + $310 = $790.",
    "Her total amount raised is $790.",
    "The goal amount she needed to raise is $610.",
    "To find out how much she made above her goal, we subtract her goal amount from the total amount raised.",
    "Subtracting: $790 - $610 = $180."

  "solution": "180"
