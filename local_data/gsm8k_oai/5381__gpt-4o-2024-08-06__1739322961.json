  "query": "Mickey and Johnny are having a contest to see who can run around their block the most. One time around the block equals 200 meters. Johnny runs around the block 4 times. Mickey runs around the block half as many times as Johnny. What is the average distance run by Johnny and Mickey?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Mickey runs around the block.",
    "Johnny runs around the block 4 times.",
    "Mickey runs half as many times as Johnny.",
    "Half of 4 is 2, so Mickey runs around the block 2 times.",
    "Next, I will calculate the distance Johnny runs.",
    "One lap around the block is 200 meters.",
    "Johnny runs 4 times, so he runs 4 * 200 meters.",
    "4 * 200 meters equals 800 meters. Johnny runs 800 meters.",
    "Now, I calculate the distance Mickey runs.",
    "Mickey runs 2 times, so he runs 2 * 200 meters.",
    "2 * 200 meters equals 400 meters. Mickey runs 400 meters.",
    "Next, I calculate the total distance run by both Johnny and Mickey.",
    "Johnny's distance is 800 meters and Mickey's distance is 400 meters.",
    "The total distance is 800 meters + 400 meters.",
    "800 meters + 400 meters equals 1200 meters.",
    "Now, I will calculate the average distance run.",
    "There are two people, so I divide the total distance by 2.",
    "1200 meters divided by 2 equals 600 meters."

  "solution": "600"
