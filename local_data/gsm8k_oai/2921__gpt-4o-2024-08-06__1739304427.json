  "query": "Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of times Martin rings the big bell be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell.",
    "The number of times he rings the small bell can be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{3}x + 4 \\).",
    "The combined total number of rings of both bells is 52.",
    "This gives us the equation: \\( x + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}x + 4\\right) = 52 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( x + \\frac{1}{3}x + 4 = 52 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( \\frac{3}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{4}{3}x \\).",
    "The equation becomes: \\( \\frac{4}{3}x + 4 = 52 \\).",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides: \\( \\frac{4}{3}x = 48 \\).",
    "Multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 48 \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\).",
    "Calculate the right side: \\( x = 36 \\)."
