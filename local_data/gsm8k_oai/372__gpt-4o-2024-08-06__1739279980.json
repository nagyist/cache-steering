  "query": "TJ ran a 10K race last Saturday. He ran the first half in 20 minutes. He completed the second half in 30 minutes. What was his average time per kilometer?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total time TJ took to complete the 10K race.",
    "TJ ran the first half in 20 minutes and the second half in 30 minutes.",
    "Total time taken = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average time per kilometer.",
    "The total distance of the race is 10 kilometers.",
    "Average time per kilometer = Total time / Total distance.",
    "Average time per kilometer = 50 minutes / 10 kilometers.",
    "Average time per kilometer = 5 minutes per kilometer."
