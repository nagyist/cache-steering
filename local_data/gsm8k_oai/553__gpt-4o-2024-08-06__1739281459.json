  "query": "Emma buys 2 containers of milk every school day for lunch. She does not go to school on the weekends. How many containers of milk does she buy in 3 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many school days there are in one week. Since Emma does not go to school on weekends, that leaves 5 school days each week (Monday through Friday).",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many school days there are in 3 weeks. Since there are 5 school days in a week, 3 weeks would have 5 * 3 = 15 school days.",
    "Emma buys 2 containers of milk every school day. So, I need to calculate how many containers of milk she buys over 15 school days.",
    "The total number of containers of milk Emma buys in 3 weeks is 15 school days * 2 containers of milk per day = 30 containers of milk."

  "solution": "30"
