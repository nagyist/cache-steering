  "query": "A company is hosting a seminar. So far, 30 attendees from company A have been registered; company B has twice the number of attendees of company A; company C has 10 more attendees than company A; company D has 5 fewer attendees than company C. If a total of 185 attendees have registered, how many attendees who registered are not from either company A, B, C or D?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of attendees from each company.",
    "Start by identifying the number of attendees for company A. We know this number is 30.",
    "Next, calculate the number of attendees from company B. Company B has twice the number of attendees as company A, so B has 2 * 30 = 60 attendees.",
    "Determine the number of attendees for company C. Company C has 10 more attendees than company A, so C has 30 + 10 = 40 attendees.",
    "Now find the number of attendees from company D. Company D has 5 fewer attendees than company C, so D has 40 - 5 = 35 attendees.",
    "Sum the number of attendees from companies A, B, C, and D to find the total number of attendees from these companies: 30 (A) + 60 (B) + 40 (C) + 35 (D).",
    "Calculate this total: 30 + 60 = 90; 90 + 40 = 130; 130 + 35 = 165.",
    "The total number of registered attendees is 185, so subtract the attendees from companies A, B, C, and D to find the number of attendees who are not from these companies.",
    "185 - 165 = 20 attendees are not from company A, B, C, or D."
