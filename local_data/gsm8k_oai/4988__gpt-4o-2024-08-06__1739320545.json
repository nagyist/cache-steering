  "query": "Greg has lent his sister Tessa money on several occasions. Greg writes down all of his sister's debts in a notebook, the first time he lent her $40. A week later, Tessa paid him back half of her debt. A few days later she asked him for $10 more. How much does Tessa still owe Greg?",
  "steps": [
    "Greg initially lent Tessa $40.",
    "A week later, Tessa paid him back half of her debt. Half of $40 is $20.",
    "After paying back $20, Tessa's remaining debt is $40 - $20 = $20.",
    "A few days later, Tessa asked Greg for $10 more.",
    "Adding the new amount, Tessa's total debt is now $20 + $10 = $30."
