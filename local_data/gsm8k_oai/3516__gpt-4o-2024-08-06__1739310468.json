  "query": "In one of the teacher's meetings, it was agreed that each class will contribute $90 for a school activity. The class of Miss Evans has $14 class funds and they decided to use it to lessen the contribution of each student. If the remaining amount will be divided among 19 students, how much will each student contribute?",
  "steps": [
    "The total contribution needed from Miss Evans' class is $90.",
    "The class has $14 in their class funds.",
    "To find out how much more is needed, I need to subtract the class funds from the total contribution. So, $90 - $14 = $76.",
    "This means the class still needs to contribute $76.",
    "There are 19 students in the class who will divide the remaining contribution equally.",
    "To find out how much each student needs to contribute, I divide the remaining amount by the number of students: $76 \u00f7 19.",
    "Performing the division, $76 \u00f7 19 equals $4."

  "solution": "4"
