  "query": "Ginger owns a flower shop, where she sells roses, lilacs, and gardenias. On Tuesday, she sold three times more roses than lilacs, and half as many gardenias as lilacs.  If she sold 10 lilacs, what is the total number of flowers sold on Tuesday?",
  "steps": [
    "Ginger sold 10 lilacs.",
    "She sold three times more roses than lilacs.",
    "Three times 10 lilacs is 30 roses.",
    "She sold half as many gardenias as lilacs.",
    "Half of 10 lilacs is 5 gardenias.",
    "Now, I will add the number of each type of flower to find the total.",
    "Roses: 30, Lilacs: 10, Gardenias: 5.",
    "30 (roses) + 10 (lilacs) + 5 (gardenias) = 45."
