  "query": "James has 20 years of experience.  8 years ago John had twice as much experience as James.  Mike started when John had 16 years of experience.  What is their combined experience?",
  "steps": [
    "James currently has 20 years of experience.",
    "8 years ago, James had 20 - 8 = 12 years of experience.",
    "8 years ago, John had twice as much experience as James, which means John had 2 \u00d7 12 = 24 years of experience back then.",
    "That was 8 years ago, so now John has 24 + 8 = 32 years of experience.",
    "I need to find out how many years of experience Mike has.",
    "Mike started when John had 16 years of experience.",
    "We know John had 24 years of experience 8 years ago, which means he had 24 - 16 = 8 years of experience before that.",
    "Thus, Mike started 8 years + 8 years ago = 16 years ago.",
    "Since Mike has started 16 years ago, he has 16 years of experience now.",
    "Now I have James' experience which is 20 years, John's 32 years, and Mike's 16 years.",
    "Their combined experience is 20 + 32 + 16 = 68 years."
