  "query": "A train travels 270 miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 180 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the train's speed.",
    "The train travels 270 miles in 3 hours.",
    "To find the speed, I divide the distance by the time: 270 miles / 3 hours.",
    "270 divided by 3 equals 90.",
    "The train's speed is 90 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 180 miles at this speed.",
    "I use the speed to calculate the time by dividing the additional distance by the speed: 180 miles / 90 miles per hour.",
    "180 divided by 90 equals 2.",
    "It would take 2 additional hours to travel the extra 180 miles."

  "solution": "2"
