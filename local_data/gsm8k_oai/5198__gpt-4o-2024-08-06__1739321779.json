  "query": "Lisa was collecting socks to donate to a homeless shelter. She bought 12 pairs at a discount store. Sandra, her friend, came over and brought her 20 pairs of socks. Her cousin showed up with one-fifth the number of pairs that Sandra bought. After work, Lisa\u2019s mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa started with. How many pairs of socks did Lisa end up with?",
  "steps": [
    "Lisa initially bought 12 pairs of socks at the discount store.",
    "Sandra brought Lisa 20 pairs of socks.",
    "Her cousin brought one-fifth of the number of pairs that Sandra brought. So, that's one-fifth of 20 pairs.",
    "To calculate one-fifth of 20, divide 20 by 5, which is 4 pairs.",
    "Lisa\u2019s mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa initially started with. Lisa started with 12 pairs.",
    "Three times the number of pairs Lisa initially had is 3 times 12, which equals 36 pairs.",
    "Adding 8 more to this number results in 36 + 8 = 44 pairs.",
    "Now, let's add all the socks together: \nLisa started with 12 pairs, \nSandra brought 20 pairs, \nHer cousin brought 4 pairs, \nLisa's mom brought 44 pairs.",
    "Summing them up: 12 + 20 + 4 + 44.",
    "12 + 20 = 32.",
    "32 + 4 = 36.",
    "36 + 44 = 80."

  "solution": "80"
