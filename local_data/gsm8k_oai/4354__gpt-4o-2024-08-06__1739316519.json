  "query": "Joe goes camping with his dad on a Friday. Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows, and Joe has four times as much marshmallows as his dad. If Joe\u2019s dad roasts a third of his marshmallows, and Joe roasts half of his marshmallows, how many marshmallows did they roast in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows.",
    "Joe has four times as many marshmallows as his dad.",
    "To calculate the number of marshmallows Joe has, I\u2019ll multiply the number of marshmallows Joe's dad has by four.",
    "Joe has 21 marshmallows * 4 = 84 marshmallows.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many marshmallows Joe's dad roasts.",
    "Joe\u2019s dad roasts a third of his marshmallows.",
    "To find out how many marshmallows Joe\u2019s dad roasts, I'll calculate 1/3 of 21.",
    "Joe\u2019s dad roasts 21 / 3 = 7 marshmallows.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many marshmallows Joe roasts.",
    "Joe roasts half of his marshmallows.",
    "To find out how many marshmallows Joe roasts, I'll calculate 1/2 of 84.",
    "Joe roasts 84 / 2 = 42 marshmallows.",
    "Now, to find the total number of marshmallows roasted by both, I'll add the marshmallows roasted by Joe and his dad.",
    "Total roasted = marshmallows roasted by Joe + marshmallows roasted by Joe\u2019s dad.",
    "Total roasted = 42 + 7 = 49 marshmallows."
