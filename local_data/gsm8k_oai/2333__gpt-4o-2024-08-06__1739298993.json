  "query": "Milo is making a giant loaf of bread, and the recipe calls for pounds of eggs instead of telling him the number. He needs 6 pounds in total. He looks up online that an egg weighs 1/16 of a pound. If he needs 6 pounds of eggs, how many dozen should he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that Milo needs 6 pounds of eggs in total.",
    "I know from the problem statement that each egg weighs 1/16 of a pound.",
    "To find out how many eggs Milo needs in total, I should divide the total weight needed (6 pounds) by the weight of one egg (1/16 pound).",
    "6 pounds divided by 1/16 pound per egg equals 6 * 16.",
    "Calculating the multiplication, 6 * 16 equals 96.",
    "This means Milo needs 96 eggs in total.",
    "Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, I need to find out how many dozens 96 eggs make.",
    "To find the number of dozens, I divide the total number of eggs (96) by the number of eggs in one dozen (12).",
    "96 divided by 12 equals 8.",
    "This means Milo should buy 8 dozen eggs."
