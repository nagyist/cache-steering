  "query": "Matt rode his bike away from the house, he rode a total of 1000 feet.  Along the way, he passed a stop sign that was 350 feet away from his house.  He continued his ride and passed a second sign.  After passing the second sign he road an additional 275 feet.  How many feet are between the first and second signs?",
  "steps": [
    "Matt rode a total of 1000 feet from his house.",
    "The first stop sign is 350 feet away from his house.",
    "The second sign is some distance x feet away from the first stop sign.",
    "After passing the second sign, Matt rode an additional 275 feet.",
    "The total distance Matt rode past the second sign can be calculated as follows:\n1000 feet (total distance) - 350 feet (to the first stop sign) - 275 feet (after the second sign) = distance between the first and second sign.",
    "This calculation gives: 1000 - 350 - 275 = 375 feet.",
    "Therefore, the distance between the first and second signs is 375 feet."

  "solution": "375"
