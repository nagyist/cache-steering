  "query": "Henry has 30 more lollipops than Alison does. With 60 lollipops, Alisson has half the number of lollipops Diane has. If they combine the lollipops and eat 45 lollipops each day, calculate the total number of days it will take for them to finish the lollipops.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many lollipops Alison has. According to the problem, Alison has 60 lollipops.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many lollipops Diane has. The problem states that Alison's 60 lollipops are half of what Diane has.",
    "Since Alison has half the number that Diane has, Diane must have 60 x 2 = 120 lollipops.",
    "Now, I will find out how many lollipops Henry has. It\u2019s given that Henry has 30 more lollipops than Alison does. So, Henry has 60 + 30 = 90 lollipops.",
    "I will find the total number of lollipops combined. To do this, I add the number of lollipops for Alison, Henry, and Diane.",
    "Total lollipops = 60 (Alison) + 90 (Henry) + 120 (Diane) = 270 lollipops.",
    "They eat 45 lollipops each day. I need to calculate how many days it will take for them to finish all 270 lollipops by dividing the total number of lollipops by the number they eat each day.",
    "Number of days = 270 lollipops / 45 lollipops per day.",
    "Calculating this gives 270 / 45 = 6 days."
