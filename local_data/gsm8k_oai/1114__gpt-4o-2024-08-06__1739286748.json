  "query": "Jeff makes 10 donuts each day for 12 days. Jeff eats one of the donuts each day. Chris then comes over and eats 8 donuts. If 10 donuts fit in each box, how many boxes can Jeff fill with his donuts?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeff makes 10 donuts each day.",
    "He does this for 12 days.",
    "So, the total number of donuts Jeff makes is 10 donuts/day * 12 days = 120 donuts.",
    "Jeff eats 1 donut each day.",
    "So, in 12 days, Jeff eats 1 donut/day * 12 days = 12 donuts.",
    "The number of donuts left after Jeff eats is 120 donuts - 12 donuts = 108 donuts.",
    "Chris then eats 8 donuts.",
    "So the number of donuts left after Chris eats is 108 donuts - 8 donuts = 100 donuts.",
    "10 donuts fit in each box.",
    "I need to find out how many boxes can be filled with 100 donuts.",
    "I divide the total number of donuts by the number of donuts that fit in each box: 100 donuts \u00f7 10 donuts/box = 10 boxes."
