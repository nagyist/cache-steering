  "query": "Sherman has a 30-minute commute to the office and a 30-minute commute home every day.  On the weekends, he spends 2 hours, each day, driving his kids to their different activities.  How many hours does Sherman drive a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total time Sherman spends commuting on weekdays.",
    "He spends 30 minutes commuting to the office and 30 minutes commuting home each day.",
    "That's 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes or 1 hour per weekday.",
    "There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total weekday commute time is 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.",
    "Next, calculate the total time he spends driving on the weekends.",
    "Sherman spends 2 hours each day driving his kids on the weekends.",
    "There are 2 weekend days, so the total weekend driving time is 2 hours/day * 2 days = 4 hours.",
    "Finally, add the weekday commute time and the weekend driving time together to find the total weekly driving time.",
    "Total hours driven each week = 5 hours (weekdays) + 4 hours (weekend) = 9 hours."
