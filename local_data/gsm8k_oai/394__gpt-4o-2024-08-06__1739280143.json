  "query": "Chad sandwiches 2 crackers with a scoop of peanut butter.  He has 5 of these crackers a night before bed.  A box of crackers has 4 sleeves with each sleeve holding 28 crackers.  How many nights will 5 boxes of crackers last him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many crackers Chad uses per night. He makes 5 sandwiches, and each sandwich uses 2 crackers.",
    "Therefore, Chad uses 5 sandwiches * 2 crackers = 10 crackers per night.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many crackers are in a single box. One box has 4 sleeves and each sleeve contains 28 crackers.",
    "That means one box contains 4 sleeves * 28 crackers = 112 crackers.",
    "I need to determine how many crackers 5 boxes will have. If one box has 112 crackers, then 5 boxes will have 5 * 112 crackers.",
    "Calculating 5 * 112 gives us a total of 560 crackers for 5 boxes.",
    "Now, to find out how many nights the crackers will last, divide the total number of crackers by the number Chad uses per night.",
    "560 crackers divided by 10 crackers per night gives us 56 nights."

  "solution": "56"
