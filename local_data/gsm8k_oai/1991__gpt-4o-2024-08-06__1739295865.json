  "query": "Sally is saving up for a trip to Sea World. She already has $28 saved. It costs her $10 to park, $55 to get into the park and $25 for a meal pass. Sea World is 165 miles away and her car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas. If gas costs $3 a gallon, how much more will she have to save up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of parking at Sea World. The cost is $10.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the admission cost to the park. The admission cost is $55.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the meal pass. The meal pass costs $25.",
    "To find the total fixed costs at Sea World, I need to add the parking, admission, and meal pass costs together.",
    "The fixed costs are $10 (parking) + $55 (admission) + $25 (meal pass).",
    "Calculating the sum: $10 + $55 = $65; then $65 + $25 = $90.",
    "The total fixed costs for the park are $90.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the travel cost based on the distance and gas price.",
    "Sally's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and Sea World is 165 miles away.",
    "To find out how many gallons of gas are needed for the trip, I divide the distance by the car's miles per gallon.",
    "165 miles \u00f7 30 miles per gallon = 5.5 gallons.",
    "Since this is a round trip, I need to double the 5.5 gallons.",
    "5.5 gallons \u00d7 2 = 11 gallons.",
    "The cost of gas is $3 per gallon.",
    "To find the total gas cost, multiply the gallons by the price per gallon.",
    "11 gallons \u00d7 $3 = $33.",
    "The total travel cost for gas is $33.",
    "Now, I add the fixed costs of going to Sea World and the travel costs to find the total cost.",
    "The fixed costs are $90, and the travel costs are $33.",
    "$90 + $33 = $123.",
    "The total cost of the trip is $123.",
    "Sally has already saved $28.",
    "To find out how much more she needs to save, I subtract the amount she has saved from the total cost.",
    "$123 (total cost) - $28 (saved) = $95.",
    "Sally needs to save $95 more for her trip to Sea World."
