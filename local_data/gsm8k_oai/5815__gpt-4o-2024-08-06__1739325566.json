  "query": "Eunice spent $7500 on a used car, which is 25% less than the original price. What was the original price of the car?",
  "steps": [
    "Eunice bought the car for $7500, and this is 25% less than the original price.",
    "If $7500 is 25% less than the original price, then $7500 represents 75% of the original price.",
    "To find the original price, I need to find the number that 75% represents when it equals $7500.",
    "I'll set up an equation to represent this: 0.75 * original_price = $7500.",
    "To find the original price, I divide $7500 by 0.75.",
    "$7500 \u00f7 0.75 = $10000.",
    "Thus, the original price of the car was $10000."
