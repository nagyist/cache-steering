  "query": "In January, Bill's labrador puppy weighs 40 pounds and his dachshund puppy weighs 12 pounds. Each dog gains 25% of their starting weight over the year. What's the difference in their weight at the end of the year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much weight the labrador puppy gains in a year. The labrador's starting weight is 40 pounds.",
    "Calculate 25% of 40 pounds for the labrador: \\(0.25 \\times 40 = 10\\) pounds.",
    "The labrador ends up weighing 40 + 10 = 50 pounds at the end of the year.",
    "Next, determine how much weight the dachshund puppy gains in a year. The dachshund's starting weight is 12 pounds.",
    "Calculate 25% of 12 pounds for the dachshund: \\(0.25 \\times 12 = 3\\) pounds.",
    "The dachshund ends up weighing 12 + 3 = 15 pounds at the end of the year.",
    "Now, find the difference in their weights at the end of the year: \\(50 - 15 = 35\\) pounds."
