  "query": "John jogs at a speed of 4 miles per hour when he runs alone, but runs at 6 miles per hour when he is being dragged by his 100-pound German Shepherd dog. If John and his dog go on a run together for 30 minutes, and then John runs for an additional 30 minutes by himself, how far will John have traveled?",
  "steps": [
    "The total time given in the problem is 30 minutes with the dog and 30 minutes alone.",
    "First, calculate the distance covered with the dog.",
    "The speed when running with the dog is 6 miles per hour.",
    "Time spent with the dog is 30 minutes.",
    "Convert 30 minutes to hours, which is \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) hours.",
    "Use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time to calculate the distance with the dog: \\( 6 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ miles} \\).",
    "Now, calculate the distance covered when John runs alone.",
    "The speed when running alone is 4 miles per hour.",
    "Time spent running alone is also 30 minutes.",
    "Convert 30 minutes to hours, which remains \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) hours.",
    "Use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time to calculate the distance alone: \\( 4 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ miles} \\).",
    "Add the distances covered with the dog and alone: \\( 3 \\text{ miles} + 2 \\text{ miles} = 5 \\text{ miles} \\)."
