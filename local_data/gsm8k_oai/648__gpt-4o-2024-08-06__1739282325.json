  "query": "The school band has 30 songs in their repertoire. The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of songs in the band's repertoire is 30.",
    "The band played 5 songs in their first set.",
    "The band played 7 songs in their second set.",
    "The band will play 2 songs for their encore.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of songs the band has already played, which includes the first set, second set, and the encore.",
    "The songs already played or to be played are: 5 (first set) + 7 (second set) + 2 (encore) = 14 songs.",
    "Out of the repertoire of 30 songs, 14 have been accounted for, so I need to figure out how many songs are left to be played.",
    "The number of songs left is: 30 (total songs) - 14 (already played) = 16 songs.",
    "These 16 songs will be played in the third and fourth sets.",
    "To find the average number of songs played in the third and fourth sets, I need to divide the remaining number of songs by the number of sets, which is 2 (third and fourth sets).",
    "16 remaining songs \u00f7 2 sets = 8 songs per set on average."
