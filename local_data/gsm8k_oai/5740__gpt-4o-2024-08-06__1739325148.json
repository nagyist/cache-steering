  "query": "John and Anna bought some eBook readers. John bought 15 eBook readers less than Anna did. Unfortunately, John lost 3 eBook readers. If Anna bought 50 eBook readers, how many eBook readers do they have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Anna bought 50 eBook readers.",
    "John bought 15 fewer eBook readers than Anna did.",
    "Therefore, John bought 50 - 15 = 35 eBook readers.",
    "John lost 3 eBook readers.",
    "So, John now has 35 - 3 = 32 eBook readers.",
    "Anna still has her 50 eBook readers.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many eBook readers they have altogether.",
    "Add John's eBook readers (32) to Anna's eBook readers (50).",
    "32 + 50 = 82"
