  "query": "A choir was singing a song that involved 30 singers. In the first verse, only half of them sang. In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. How many people joined in the final third verse that the whole choir sang together?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of singers in the choir is 30.",
    "In the first verse, only half of the choir sang. Half of 30 is 30 / 2 = 15.",
    "This means 15 singers sang in the first verse.",
    "With 15 singers already singing, the remaining singers who have not sung yet are 30 - 15 = 15 singers.",
    "In the second verse, a third of the remaining singers joined in. A third of these remaining singers is 15 / 3 = 5.",
    "Thus, 5 additional singers joined in the second verse.",
    "After the second verse, there were 15 (from the first verse) + 5 (new singers in the second verse) = 20 singers singing.",
    "For the final third verse, the entire choir of 30 singers sang together.",
    "The number of new singers joining in during the final third verse is the total choir number minus those already singing.",
    "So, the number of new singers joining in the third verse is 30 - 20 = 10."
