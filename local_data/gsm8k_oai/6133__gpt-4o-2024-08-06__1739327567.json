  "query": "Jerry, Gabriel, and Jaxon ask their parents to buy them toys to play with. Jerry is bought 8 more toys than Gabriel, but Gabriel has twice as many toys as Jaxon. If Jaxon got 15 toys, what's the total number of toys they all have?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying how many toys Jaxon has. It's given in the problem that Jaxon has 15 toys.",
    "Next, calculate how many toys Gabriel has. The problem states that Gabriel has twice as many toys as Jaxon.",
    "Since Jaxon has 15 toys, Gabriel has 2 * 15 = 30 toys.",
    "Now, calculate how many toys Jerry has. Jerry has 8 more toys than Gabriel.",
    "Since Gabriel has 30 toys, Jerry has 30 + 8 = 38 toys.",
    "Finally, find the total number of toys by adding the toys each of them has: Jerry's 38 toys, Gabriel's 30 toys, and Jaxon's 15 toys.",
    "Calculate the total: 38 (Jerry) + 30 (Gabriel) + 15 (Jaxon) = 83."
