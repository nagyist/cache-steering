  "query": "Jenny wants to know whether bone meal or cow manure makes better fertilizer. The control plant with no fertilizer grows 36 inches high, the plant with bone meal grows to 125% of the height of the control plant, and the cow manure plant grows to 200% of the height of the bone meal plant. How tall is the cow manure plant in inches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the height of the control plant, which is given as 36 inches.",
    "Next, calculate the height of the plant with bone meal fertilizer, which is 125% of the control plant's height. To find 125% of 36, multiply 36 by 1.25.",
    "36 x 1.25 = 45 inches. So, the bone meal plant grows to 45 inches high.",
    "Now, calculate the height of the cow manure plant. It grows to 200% of the height of the bone meal plant. To find 200% of 45, multiply 45 by 2.",
    "45 x 2 = 90 inches. So, the cow manure plant grows to 90 inches high."
  ],
  "solution": "90"
