  "query": "Miss Darlington has a basket of 20 blueberries. She picked 9 more baskets with the same amount of berries. How many blueberries did Miss Darlington have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many blueberries are in each basket.",
    "The problem states that there are 20 blueberries in one basket.",
    "Miss Darlington picked 9 more baskets.",
    "Each of these baskets also contains 20 blueberries.",
    "To find the total blueberries in the 9 baskets, I'll multiply the number of baskets by the number of blueberries per basket.",
    "9 baskets \u00d7 20 blueberries per basket = 180 blueberries.",
    "Now, I need to add the blueberries from the original basket.",
    "The original basket has 20 blueberries.",
    "So, I'll add 20 blueberries from the original basket to the 180 blueberries from the 9 baskets.",
    "180 blueberries + 20 blueberries = 200 blueberries."

  "solution": "200"
