  "query": "Sarah bought 12 lollipops filled with caramel for a total of 3 dollars.  She offered to share one-quarter of the lollipops with her friend, Julie, but Julie insisted on reimbursing Sarah for the cost of the lollipops shared.  How much money, in cents, did Julie give Sarah to pay for the shared lollipops?",
  "steps": [
    "Sarah bought 12 lollipops for 3 dollars.",
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of one lollipop.",
    "3 dollars equals 300 cents.",
    "So, the cost of one lollipop is 300 cents divided by 12 lollipops.",
    "300 divided by 12 equals 25.",
    "This means each lollipop costs 25 cents.",
    "Sarah offered to share one-quarter of the lollipops with Julie.",
    "To find one-quarter of the lollipops, I calculate 12 lollipops divided by 4.",
    "12 divided by 4 equals 3.",
    "Sarah shared 3 lollipops with Julie.",
    "Now I need to find out how much Julie paid Sarah for these 3 lollipops.",
    "Each lollipop costs 25 cents.",
    "So, the cost for 3 lollipops is 3 multiplied by 25.",
    "3 times 25 equals 75."

  "solution": "75"
