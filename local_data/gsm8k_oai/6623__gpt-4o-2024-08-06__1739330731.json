  "query": "Farmer Steven needs to load his truck up with compost.  His tractor can scoop up compost at a rate of 75 pounds per minute.  Steven's son, Darrel, wants to help.  Using a shovel, Darrel can scoop up 10 pounds per minute.  How much time, in minutes, would it take for the two working together at the same time to load up 2550 pounds of compost into the truck?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the combined rate of Steven and Darrel working together.",
    "Steven's scooping rate is 75 pounds per minute.",
    "Darrel's scooping rate is 10 pounds per minute.",
    "Add their rates together to find the combined rate: 75 + 10 = 85 pounds per minute.",
    "Now, calculate how long it will take them to load 2550 pounds at a rate of 85 pounds per minute.",
    "Set up the equation: Time = Total Pounds / Combined Rate.",
    "Time = 2550 pounds / 85 pounds per minute.",
    "Perform the division: 2550 \u00f7 85.",
    "2550 \u00f7 85 equals 30.",
    "It will take 30 minutes for Steven and Darrel to load 2550 pounds of compost into the truck."
