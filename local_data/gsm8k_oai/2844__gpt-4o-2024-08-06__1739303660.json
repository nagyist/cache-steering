  "query": "Ethyl bought Lucy two new dolls for her doll collection.  This increased the doll collection by 25%.  After the addition of the two new dolls, how many dolls are in Lucy's collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the original number of dolls in Lucy's collection as \\( x \\).",
    "The problem states that adding two new dolls increased the collection by 25%.",
    "This means that after adding the two dolls, the total number of dolls is \\( x + 2 \\).",
    "An increase of 25% on the original collection \\( x \\) implies that the final collection is 1.25 times the original.",
    "We can represent this relationship with the equation: \\( x + 2 = 1.25x \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), let's solve the equation \\( x + 2 = 1.25x \\).",
    "Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides: \\( 2 = 0.25x \\).",
    "Now, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.25: \\( x = \\frac{2}{0.25} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{2}{0.25} = 8 \\).",
    "So, Lucy's original collection contained 8 dolls.",
    "After adding 2 new dolls, the total number of dolls in Lucy's collection is \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\)."
