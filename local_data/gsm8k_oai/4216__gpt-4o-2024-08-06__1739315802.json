    "First, I will identify the points each player earned: Draymond, Curry, Kelly, Durant, and Klay.",
    "Draymond earned 12 points.",
    "Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, so Curry earned 2 * 12 = 24 points.",
    "Kelly earned 9 points.",
    "Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, so Durant earned 2 * 9 = 18 points.",
    "Klay earned half the points as Draymond, so Klay earned 12 / 2 = 6 points.",
    "Now, I will add up the points from all the players.",
    "Points by Draymond: 12",
    "Points by Curry: 24",
    "Points by Kelly: 9",
    "Points by Durant: 18",
