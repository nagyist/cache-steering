  "steps": [
    "Brie has 12 blouses in total.",
    "75% of her blouses are in the hamper today.",
    "Calculate 75% of 12 to find how many blouses are in the hamper.",
    "75% of 12 is 0.75 * 12 = 9 blouses.",
    "Brie has 6 skirts in total.",
    "50% of her skirts are in the hamper today.",
    "Calculate 50% of 6 to find how many skirts are in the hamper.",
    "50% of 6 is 0.50 * 6 = 3 skirts.",
    "Brie has 8 slacks in total.",
    "25% of her slacks are in the hamper today.",
    "Calculate 25% of 8 to find how many slacks are in the hamper.",
    "25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 slacks.",
    "Now, add up all the pieces of clothing in the hamper (blouses, skirts, and slacks).",
    "Blouses: 9 + Skirts: 3 + Slacks: 2 = 14 pieces of clothing."
