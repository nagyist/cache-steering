  "query": "At a softball game, three players are having a sunflower eating contest. The first player eats 78 seeds. The second eats 53 seeds. The third eats 30 more seeds than the second. How many do they eat in total?",
  "steps": [
    "The first player eats 78 seeds.",
    "The second player eats 53 seeds.",
    "The third player eats 30 more seeds than the second player.",
    "The second player eats 53 seeds, so the third player eats 53 + 30 seeds.",
    "Calculating the seeds eaten by the third player: 53 + 30 = 83.",
    "Now, I need to find the total seeds eaten by all three players.",
    "First player: 78 seeds, second player: 53 seeds, third player: 83 seeds.",
    "Add the seeds each player ate: 78 + 53 + 83.",
    "Calculating: 78 + 53 = 131.",
    "Then, 131 + 83 = 214."
