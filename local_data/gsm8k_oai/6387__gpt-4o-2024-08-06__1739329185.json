  "query": "A 10 m long and 8 m wide rectangular floor is to be covered with a square carpet with 4 m sides. How many square meters of the floor are uncovered?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of the rectangular floor.",
    "The rectangle is 10 meters long and 8 meters wide.",
    "I use the formula for the area of a rectangle: length \u00d7 width.",
    "The area of the floor is 10 m \u00d7 8 m = 80 square meters.",
    "Next, I calculate the area of the square carpet.",
    "The square has sides of 4 meters.",
    "I use the formula for the area of a square: side \u00d7 side.",
    "The area of the carpet is 4 m \u00d7 4 m = 16 square meters.",
    "To find out how much of the floor is uncovered, I need to subtract the area of the carpet from the area of the floor.",
    "I subtract 16 square meters (carpet) from 80 square meters (floor).",
    "80 square meters - 16 square meters = 64 square meters."
