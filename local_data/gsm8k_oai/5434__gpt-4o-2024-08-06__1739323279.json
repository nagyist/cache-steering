  "query": "Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of apples Kylie picked be represented by \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times what Kylie picked.",
    "So, the number of apples Kayla picked can be represented as \\( 4x + 10 \\).",
    "Together, they picked a total of 340 apples. Thus, the equation is:",
    "\\( x + (4x + 10) = 340 \\).",
    "Combining like terms gives \\( 5x + 10 = 340 \\).",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate terms involving \\( x \\):\n\\( 5x = 330 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\( x = 66 \\).",
    "Kylie picked 66 apples.",
    "Substitute \\( x = 66 \\) into the expression for the number of apples Kayla picked:",
    "Kayla picked \\( 4 \\times 66 + 10 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 4 \\times 66 = 264 \\).",
    "Now, add 10 to 264 to find the total number of apples picked by Kayla:\n\\( 264 + 10 = 274 \\)."
