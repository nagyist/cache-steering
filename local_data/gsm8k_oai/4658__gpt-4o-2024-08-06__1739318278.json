  "steps": [
    "Toby received a total of $343 from his father.",
    "Toby decided to share this amount with his two brothers, giving each of them 1/7 of $343.",
    "First, I need to calculate how much 1/7 of $343 is.",
    "To find 1/7 of $343, I divide $343 by 7.",
    "$343 divided by 7 equals $49.",
    "Each brother receives $49.",
    "Toby has two brothers, so he gives $49 to each brother.",
    "That means Toby gives away a total of $49 + $49 = $98.",
    "To find out how much money Toby has left, I subtract the amount he gave away from the total amount.",
    "$343 minus $98 equals $245."
