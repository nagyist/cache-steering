  "query": "Mrs. Thompson bought 3 chickens for $3 each. She also bought a bag of potatoes. Mrs. Thompson paid $15 in total. How much did the potatoes cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the 3 chickens.",
    "Each chicken costs $3, and there are 3 chickens.",
    "3 times 3 equals 9.",
    "So, the total cost of the chickens is $9.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much Mrs. Thompson paid for the potatoes.",
    "Mrs. Thompson paid $15 in total for the chickens and the bag of potatoes.",
    "To find the cost of the potatoes, I will subtract the cost of the chickens from the total amount paid.",
    "$15 minus $9 equals $6."
