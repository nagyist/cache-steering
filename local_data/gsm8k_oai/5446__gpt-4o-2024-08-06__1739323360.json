  "query": "A building has 10 floors. It takes 15 seconds to go up the stairs to the even-numbered floors and 9 seconds to go up to the odd-numbered floors.  This includes getting to the first floor. How many minutes does it take to get to the 10th floor?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to list the floors the person has to go through: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.",
    "I start at floor 0 and need to go to floor 10.",
    "For even-numbered floors (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), it takes 15 seconds to go from one floor to the next.",
    "For odd-numbered floors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), it takes 9 seconds to go from one floor to the next.",
    "First, I will count how many times I encounter even-numbered floors: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, which are 5 times.",
    "Therefore, for even-numbered floors, it takes 5 * 15 = 75 seconds in total.",
    "Next, I will count how many times I encounter odd-numbered floors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, which are 5 times.",
    "Therefore, for odd-numbered floors, it takes 5 * 9 = 45 seconds in total.",
    "The total time taken to go from floor 0 to floor 10 is the sum of the times for even and odd floors: 75 + 45 = 120 seconds.",
    "Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I convert 120 seconds to minutes: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes."
