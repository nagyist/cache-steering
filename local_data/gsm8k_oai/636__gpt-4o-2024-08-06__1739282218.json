  "query": "Tina is working on her homework when she realizes she's having a hard time typing out her answers on her laptop because a lot of the keys are sticky. She is trying to get her homework done before dinner, though, so she needs to decide if she has time to clean her keyboard first. Tina knows her assignment will only take 10 minutes to complete. Dinner will be ready at 5:30 p.m. Tina decides to time how long it takes to remove and clean one key and will then multiply that time by how many keys she needs to fix. She counts 15 keys that are sticky and times it to take 3 minutes to clean one. After Tina has cleaned one key, there are 14 left to clean. How many minutes total will it take for Tina to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes to clean all the remaining sticky keys. Tina has already cleaned 1 key, so there are 14 keys left to clean.",
    "Cleaning one key takes 3 minutes.",
    "I will multiply the time it takes to clean one key (3 minutes) by the number of keys left (14 keys) to find the total cleaning time.",
    "3 minutes/key * 14 keys = 42 minutes. So, it takes 42 minutes to clean the remaining 14 keys.",
    "Now, I have to add the time it takes to complete the homework to the cleaning time. The homework takes 10 minutes.",
    "42 minutes (cleaning time) + 10 minutes (homework time) = 52 minutes.",
    "So, the total time for Tina to clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment is 52 minutes."

  "solution": "52"
