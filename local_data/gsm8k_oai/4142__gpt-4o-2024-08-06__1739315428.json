  "query": "Quinten sees three buildings downtown and decides to estimate their heights. He knows from a book on local buildings that the one in the middle is 100 feet tall. The one on the left looks like it is 80% of the height of the middle one. The one on the right looks 20 feet shorter than if the building on the left and middle were stacked on top of each other. How tall does Quinten estimate their total height to be?",
  "steps": [
    "Quinten knows the middle building is 100 feet tall.",
    "He estimates the left building to be 80% of the middle building's height.",
    "80% of 100 feet is calculated as 0.8 * 100 = 80 feet.",
    "So the left building is estimated to be 80 feet tall.",
    "He estimates that the building on the right is 20 feet shorter than the combined height of the left and middle buildings stacked.",
    "The combined height of the left (80 feet) and middle (100 feet) buildings is 80 + 100 = 180 feet.",
    "20 feet shorter than 180 feet would be 180 - 20 = 160 feet.",
    "So the right building is estimated to be 160 feet tall.",
    "Now, to find their total estimated height, add the heights of the three buildings: 80 + 100 + 160.",
    "80 + 100 = 180; 180 + 160 = 340 feet."
