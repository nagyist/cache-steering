  "query": "Three different 6th grade classes are combining for a square dancing unit.  If possible, the teachers would like each male student to partner with a female student for the unit.  The first class has 17 males and 13 females, while the second class has 14 males and 18 females, and the third class has 15 males and 17 females.  When the classes are combined, how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of male and female students across all three classes.",
    "To do this, I will add the number of males from each class first: 17 males from the first class, 14 males from the second class, and 15 males from the third class.",
    "17 + 14 + 15 = 46 males in total.",
    "Now, I'll add the number of females: 13 females from the first class, 18 females from the second class, and 17 females from the third class.",
    "13 + 18 + 17 = 48 females in total.",
    "With these totals, there are 46 males and 48 females in total.",
    "To find out how many students cannot be partnered with a student of the opposite gender, I'll determine the difference between the number of males and females.",
    "The difference is 48 females - 46 males = 2 more females than males.",
    "This means 2 females will be left without a male partner."
