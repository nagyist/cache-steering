  "query": "Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the average speed in minutes per kilometer for the friends.",
    "The total distance covered by the group is 21 kilometers, and the total time taken is 3.5 hours.",
    "I need to convert the total time into minutes because Birgit's speed is given in minutes per kilometer.",
    "3.5 hours is equal to 3.5 * 60 = 210 minutes.",
    "Now, I divide the total time by the total distance to find the average time per kilometer.",
    "210 minutes / 21 kilometers = 10 minutes per kilometer.",
    "Birgit was 4 minutes per kilometer faster than the average.",
    "So, Birgit's speed is 10 - 4 = 6 minutes per kilometer.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it would take her to cover 8 kilometers.",
    "At 6 minutes per kilometer, the time taken to cover 8 kilometers is 6 * 8.",
    "6 * 8 = 48 minutes."

  "solution": "48"
