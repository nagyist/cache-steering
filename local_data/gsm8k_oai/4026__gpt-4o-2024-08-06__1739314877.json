  "query": "Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu has. If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of silver dollars Mr. Chiu has. Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.",
    "Next, determine how many silver dollars Mr. Phung has, given that he has 16 more than Mr. Chiu. Calculate Mr. Phung's silver dollars: 56 (Mr. Chiu's silver dollars) + 16 = 72.",
    "Now, find out how many silver dollars Mr. Ha has, knowing he has 5 more than Mr. Phung. Calculate Mr. Ha's silver dollars: 72 (Mr. Phung's silver dollars) + 5 = 77.",
    "To determine the total number of silver dollars among the three, add the amount each has: 56 (Mr. Chiu) + 72 (Mr. Phung) + 77 (Mr. Ha).",
    "Perform the addition: 56 + 72 = 128.",
    "Add the result to Mr. Ha's total: 128 + 77 = 205."
