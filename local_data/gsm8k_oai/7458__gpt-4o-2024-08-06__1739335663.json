  "query": "Polly and Gerald went for a fun afternoon riding mini race cars at the munchkin track, which is a one-quarter mile circular track. Polly managed to circle the track 12 times in one half hour, but Gerald's car was malfunctioning, and he only moved at an average speed half of what Polly did.  What speed did Gerald's car average, in miles per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the distance Polly traveled. The track is a quarter of a mile long, and she circled the track 12 times.",
    "To find the total distance Polly traveled, I multiply the number of laps (12) by the distance per lap (0.25 miles).",
    "12 laps * 0.25 miles per lap = 3 miles. Polly traveled a total of 3 miles.",
    "Polly traveled this distance in half an hour (0.5 hours).",
    "To find Polly's average speed, I divide the total distance she traveled by the time it took: Speed = Distance / Time.",
    "Polly's speed = 3 miles / 0.5 hours = 6 miles per hour.",
    "Gerald's car moved at an average speed that is half of Polly's speed.",
    "So, Gerald's speed = 6 miles per hour / 2 = 3 miles per hour."
