  "query": "Manex is a tour bus driver. He has to drive 55 miles to the destination and drive going back to the starting point on a different way that is 10 miles farther. If he can drive 1 mile for 2 minutes and stayed 2 hours at the destination, how long will it take the bus driver to do the entire tour in hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total distance that Manex will drive.",
    "The distance to the destination is 55 miles.",
    "The distance back is 10 miles farther than the destination, so it will be 55 miles + 10 miles = 65 miles.",
    "Now, I will add these distances to find the total driving distance.",
    "Total driving distance is 55 miles + 65 miles = 120 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time it takes him to drive the entire distance.",
    "He drives 1 mile in 2 minutes.",
    "To find the time for 120 miles, I'll multiply the number of miles by the time per mile.",
    "120 miles * 2 minutes/mile = 240 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to convert the driving time from minutes to hours.",
    "240 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.",
    "I also need to account for the 2-hour stay at the destination.",
    "Total time for the entire tour is the driving time plus the time stayed at the destination.",
    "Total time = 4 hours (driving) + 2 hours (stay) = 6 hours."

  "solution": "6"
