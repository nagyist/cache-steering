  "query": "Megan is an actress. She was the lead actress in 80% of her work. In total, Megan participated in 100 plays. How many times Megan was not the lead actress?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Megan was the lead actress in 80% of the plays she participated in.",
    "Megan participated in a total of 100 plays.",
    "To find out how many plays she was the lead actress in, I need to calculate 80% of 100 plays.",
    "I calculate 80% by multiplying 100 by 0.80.",
    "100 multiplied by 0.80 is 80.",
    "This means Megan was the lead actress in 80 plays.",
    "To find out how many times she was not the lead actress, I subtract the number of plays she was the lead in from the total number of plays.",
    "100 plays minus 80 plays is 20 plays."

  "solution": "20"
