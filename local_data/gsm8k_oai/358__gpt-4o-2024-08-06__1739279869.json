  "query": "Carl has a jar full of marbles. He takes out 12 marbles to play a game with, but he accidentally drops them and 1/2 the marbles get lost. So Carl takes out 10 more marbles. While he is playing his game his mother comes home with another bag of marbles for him, which has 25 marbles in it. If Carl can't find his lost marbles, then how many marbles is he going to put in the jar after he plays his game, from both his original marbles and the new ones?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl initially takes out 12 marbles from the jar to play a game.",
    "Carl accidentally drops the 12 marbles and half of them get lost.",
    "Half of 12 marbles is 12 / 2 = 6 marbles.",
    "Therefore, 6 marbles are lost and 12 - 6 = 6 marbles remain with Carl.",
    "Carl takes out 10 more marbles from the jar, so he now has 6 + 10 = 16 marbles to play with.",
    "Carl's mother comes home with another bag of marbles containing 25 marbles.",
    "After playing his game, Carl returns the 16 marbles he still has to the jar.",
    "He also has 25 new marbles from his mother's bag to put into the jar.",
    "The total number of marbles Carl will put back into the jar is 16 (from his original play) + 25 (from the new bag).",
    "16 + 25 = 41 marbles."

  "solution": "41"
