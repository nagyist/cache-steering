  "query": "Olga has an aquarium with fish in 5 different colors. There are 12 yellow ones, half as many blue ones, and twice as many green ones as yellow ones. How many fish does Olga have in her aquarium?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Olga has 12 yellow fish.",
    "Half as many blue fish as yellow fish mean there are 12 / 2 blue fish.",
    "12 / 2 = 6, which is the number of blue fish.",
    "Twice as many green fish as yellow ones mean there are 12 * 2 green fish.",
    "12 * 2 = 24, which is the number of green fish.",
    "To find out the total number of fish, I need to add up all the fish: yellow, blue, and green.",
    "Adding up the fish: 12 (yellow) + 6 (blue) + 24 (green) = total fish.",
    "12 + 6 + 24 = 42."

  "solution": "42"
