  "query": "It's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn pi\u00f1ata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, find the cost of the Reese's.",
    "There are 4 bags of Reese's, each costing $9.",
    "Multiply 4 bags by $9 per bag: 4 * 9 = 36.",
    "The cost of the Reese's is $36.",
    "Next, find the cost of the Snickers.",
    "There are 3 bags of Snickers, each costing $5.",
    "Multiply 3 bags by $5 per bag: 3 * 5 = 15.",
    "The cost of the Snickers is $15.",
    "Now, find the cost of the Skittles.",
    "There are 5 bags of Skittles, each costing $7.",
    "Multiply 5 bags by $7 per bag: 5 * 7 = 35.",
    "The cost of the Skittles is $35.",
    "Sum up the costs of all the treats: Reese's at $36, Snickers at $15, and Skittles at $35.",
    "36 + 15 + 35 = 86.",
    "The total cost of the treats is $86.",
    "Add the cost of the unicorn pi\u00f1ata to the total cost of the treats.",
    "The pi\u00f1ata costs $13.",
    "Add $86 (total cost of treats) and $13 (cost of the pi\u00f1ata): 86 + 13 = 99."

  "solution": "99"
