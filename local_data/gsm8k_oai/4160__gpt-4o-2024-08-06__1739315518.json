  "query": "Hannah harvests 5 strawberries daily for the next whole month of April, which has 30 days. If she gives away 20 strawberries to her friends and 30 strawberries are stolen, how many strawberries does she have by the end of April?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of strawberries Hannah harvests in April.",
    "April has 30 days and Hannah harvests 5 strawberries each day.",
    "To find the total number of strawberries harvested, I multiply 30 days by 5 strawberries per day.",
    "30 days \u00d7 5 strawberries per day = 150 strawberries.",
    "Next, I need to account for the strawberries Hannah gives away to her friends.",
    "Hannah gives away 20 strawberries.",
    "I subtract the 20 strawberries given away from the total harvested.",
    "150 strawberries - 20 strawberries = 130 strawberries.",
    "Now, I need to consider the stolen strawberries.",
    "30 strawberries are stolen.",
    "I subtract the 30 stolen strawberries from the remaining strawberries.",
    "130 strawberries - 30 strawberries = 100 strawberries."

  "solution": "100"
