  "query": "An artist uses 3 ounces of paint for every large canvas they cover, and 2 ounces of paint for every small canvas they cover.\u00a0 They have completed 3 large paintings and 4 small paintings.\u00a0 How many ounces of paint have they used?",
  "steps": [
    "The artist uses 3 ounces of paint for each large canvas.",
    "The artist completed 3 large paintings.",
    "To find the amount of paint used for large paintings, multiply the number of large paintings by the amount of paint per large painting: 3 large paintings x 3 ounces per painting.",
    "3 x 3 = 9 ounces of paint used for large paintings.",
    "The artist uses 2 ounces of paint for each small canvas.",
    "The artist completed 4 small paintings.",
    "To find the amount of paint used for small paintings, multiply the number of small paintings by the amount of paint per small painting: 4 small paintings x 2 ounces per painting.",
    "4 x 2 = 8 ounces of paint used for small paintings.",
    "Add the ounces of paint used for large paintings and small paintings to get the total: 9 ounces + 8 ounces.",
    "9 + 8 = 17 ounces.",
    "Double-checking the calculations:\n- Large paintings: 3 paintings x 3 ounces = 9 ounces.\n- Small paintings: 4 paintings x 2 ounces = 8 ounces.\n- Total paint: 9 ounces + 8 ounces = 17 ounces."
