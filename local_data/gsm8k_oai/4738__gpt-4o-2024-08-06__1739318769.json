  "query": "There are 2000 pinecones on the ground. 20% are eaten by reindeer. Twice as many are eaten by squirrels as reindeer. 25% of the remainder are collected to make fires. How many pinecones are left?",
  "steps": [
    "There are initially 2000 pinecones.",
    "First, I need to find out how many pinecones are eaten by reindeer.",
    "20% of 2000 pinecones are eaten by reindeer.",
    "To calculate this, I take 20% of 2000.",
    "20% of 2000 is 0.20 \u00d7 2000 = 400 pinecones.",
    "So, 400 pinecones are eaten by reindeer.",
    "Next, I determine how many pinecones are eaten by squirrels.",
    "Squirrels eat twice as many pinecones as reindeer.",
    "Twice 400 pinecones is 2 \u00d7 400 = 800 pinecones.",
    "So, 800 pinecones are eaten by squirrels.",
    "Now I find out how many pinecones remain after reindeer and squirrels have eaten.",
    "The total number of eaten pinecones is 400 + 800 = 1200 pinecones.",
    "Subtracting the eaten pinecones from the initial amount gives 2000 - 1200 = 800 pinecones remaining.",
    "25% of the remaining pinecones are collected to make fires.",
    "I calculate 25% of 800 pinecones.",
    "25% of 800 is 0.25 \u00d7 800 = 200 pinecones.",
    "200 pinecones are collected to make fires.",
    "I subtract the collected pinecones from the remaining ones after the animals ate.",
    "So the final number of pinecones left is 800 - 200 = 600 pinecones."
