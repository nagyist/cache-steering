  "query": "Apple and peach trees are planted in the orchard of the Grange Poser farm. The orchard has 30 apple trees that each give 150 kg of apples and 45 peach trees that each produce an average of 65 kg of fruit. What is the total mass of fruit harvested in this orchard?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total mass of apples harvested.",
    "There are 30 apple trees and each tree gives 150 kg of apples.",
    "The total mass of apples is 30 trees * 150 kg/tree.",
    "30 * 150 = 4500",
    "The total mass of apples harvested is 4500 kg.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total mass of peaches harvested.",
    "There are 45 peach trees and each tree produces 65 kg of fruit.",
    "The total mass of peaches is 45 trees * 65 kg/tree.",
    "45 * 65 = 2925",
    "The total mass of peaches harvested is 2925 kg.",
    "To find the total mass of fruit harvested, I need to add the mass of the apples and the peaches.",
    "4500 kg (apples) + 2925 kg (peaches) = 7425 kg."

  "solution": "7425"
