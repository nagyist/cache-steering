  "query": "The sky currently has 4 times as many cirrus clouds as cumulus clouds, and 12 times as many cumulus clouds as cumulonimbus clouds.  If the sky currently has 3 cumulonimbus clouds, how many cirrus clouds are in the sky at this moment?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationships between the different types of clouds.",
    "We know there are 12 times as many cumulus clouds as cumulonimbus clouds.",
    "The number of cumulus clouds can be determined by multiplying the number of cumulonimbus clouds by 12.",
    "There are 3 cumulonimbus clouds.",
    "Thus, the number of cumulus clouds is 3 multiplied by 12.",
    "3 multiplied by 12 equals 36.",
    "So, there are 36 cumulus clouds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of cirrus clouds, which is 4 times the number of cumulus clouds.",
    "There are 36 cumulus clouds.",
    "The number of cirrus clouds is 36 multiplied by 4.",
    "36 multiplied by 4 equals 144."

  "solution": "144"
