  "query": "Jenny makes and freezes pans of lasagna all week so she can sell them at the market on the weekend.  It costs Jenny $10.00 in ingredients to make 1 pan of lasagna.  If she makes and sells 20 pans over the weekend at $25.00 apiece, how much does she make after factoring in expenses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Jenny makes from selling 20 pans of lasagna.",
    "She sells each pan for $25.00. Therefore, for 20 pans, the revenue is 20 pans \u00d7 $25.00/pan.",
    "Calculate the total revenue: 20 \u00d7 25 = 500.",
    "Jenny\u2019s total revenue from selling 20 pans is $500.00.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for Jenny to make the 20 pans.",
    "It costs $10.00 to make 1 pan. Therefore, for 20 pans, the total cost is 20 pans \u00d7 $10.00/pan.",
    "Calculate the total cost: 20 \u00d7 10 = 200.",
    "Jenny\u2019s total cost for making 20 pans is $200.00.",
    "To find out how much Jenny makes after expenses, subtract the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "That calculation is $500.00 (revenue) - $200.00 (cost).",
    "Perform the subtraction: 500 - 200 = 300."

  "solution": "300"
