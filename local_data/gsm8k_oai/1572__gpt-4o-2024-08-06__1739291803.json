  "query": "Barbara got a great deal on a new chest of drawers, but she has to take a lot of paper out of the drawers to be able to use it. She found 3 bundles of colored paper, 2 bunches of white paper, and 5 heaps of scrap paper. If a bunch holds 4 sheets of paper, a bundle holds 2 sheets of paper, and a heap holds 20 sheets of paper, how many sheets of paper did Barbara remove from the chest of drawers?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper Barbara removed from the chest.",
    "First, I will calculate the total number of sheets in the colored paper bundles.",
    "There are 3 bundles of colored paper, and each bundle holds 2 sheets of paper.",
    "So, the total number of sheets of colored paper is 3 bundles \u00d7 2 sheets/bundle = 6 sheets.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of sheets in the bunches of white paper.",
    "There are 2 bunches of white paper, and each bunch holds 4 sheets of paper.",
    "So, the total number of sheets of white paper is 2 bunches \u00d7 4 sheets/bunch = 8 sheets.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of sheets in the heaps of scrap paper.",
    "There are 5 heaps of scrap paper, and each heap holds 20 sheets of paper.",
    "So, the total number of sheets of scrap paper is 5 heaps \u00d7 20 sheets/heap = 100 sheets.",
    "Finally, I will add all the sheets together to find the total number of sheets Barbara removed.",
    "The total is 6 sheets (colored) + 8 sheets (white) + 100 sheets (scrap) = 114 sheets."

  "solution": "114"
