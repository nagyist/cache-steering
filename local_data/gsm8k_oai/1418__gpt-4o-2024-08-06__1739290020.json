  "query": "Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the canvas. The canvas costs three times more than the brushes, and the brushes cost $20.",
    "The cost of the canvas is 3 times $20, which is $60.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the paint. The paint costs $8 per liter, and Maria needs at least 5 liters.",
    "The total cost for the paint is 5 liters times $8 per liter, which is $40.",
    "Now, I will add the cost of brushes, canvas, and paint to find out the total expenses.",
    "The total cost for all materials is $20 (brushes) + $60 (canvas) + $40 (paint) = $120.",
    "Maria plans to sell the painting for $200.",
    "To find out how much money Maria will earn, I need to subtract the total cost from the selling price.",
    "The money earned, or profit, would be $200 - $120 = $80."
