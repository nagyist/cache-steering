    "Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money. The first step is to determine how much money she had in the beginning, which I'll call \\( x \\).",
    "She spent 3/7 of her money, which means she had 4/7 of her money left.",
    "The 4/7 of her money, or \\(\\frac{4}{7}x\\), is what she still has, and this equals $24.",
    "I need to find \\( x \\) by solving the equation \\(\\frac{4}{7}x = 24\\).",
    "To solve for \\( x \\), I multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 4/7, which is 7/4.",
    "Multiplying both sides by 7/4 gives me \\( x = 24 \\times \\frac{7}{4} \\).",
    "Now, I calculate \\( 24 \\times \\frac{7}{4} \\).",
    "First, I multiply 24 by 7, which equals 168.",
    "Then, I divide 168 by 4 to find \\( x \\).",
    "168 divided by 4 equals 42, so \\( x = 42 \\).",
    "Jenny originally had $42.",
    "The question asks for half of her original amount.",
    "Half of her original amount, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 42 \\), is 21."
