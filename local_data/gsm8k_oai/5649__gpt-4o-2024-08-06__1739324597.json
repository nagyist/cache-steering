  "query": "Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela. Angela has 8 more than Allison, who has 28 marbles. How many marbles do Albert and Allison have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many marbles Angela has.",
    "We know that Allison has 28 marbles.",
    "Angela has 8 more marbles than Allison.",
    "So, I calculate Angela's marbles by adding 8 to Allison's 28 marbles.",
    "28 + 8 = 36",
    "Angela has 36 marbles.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many marbles Albert has.",
    "Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela.",
    "To find the number of marbles Albert has, I multiply Angela's marbles by 3.",
    "36 * 3 = 108",
    "Albert has 108 marbles.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of marbles Albert and Allison have together.",
    "Albert has 108 marbles and Allison has 28 marbles.",
    "So, I add their marbles together.",
    "108 + 28 = 136"

  "solution": "136"
