  "query": "Alex makes luxury dresses out of silk. Each dress needs 5 meters of silk and Alex has 600 meters of silk in storage. His friends also want to learn how to make these dresses so Alex gives all 5 of them 20 meters of silk each. He uses the rest to make dresses himself. How many dresses can Alex make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much silk Alex gives to his friends.",
    "There are 5 friends, and each receives 20 meters of silk.",
    "So, Alex gives a total of \\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\) meters of silk to his friends.",
    "Next, I'll subtract the amount of silk given to the friends from the total amount Alex had initially.",
    "Alex initially had 600 meters of silk. After giving 100 meters to his friends, he has \\(600 - 100 = 500\\) meters of silk left.",
    "Now I need to determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk.",
    "Each dress requires 5 meters of silk.",
    "So, the number of dresses Alex can make is calculated by dividing the remaining silk by the amount needed per dress.",
    "Alex has 500 meters of silk left, and each dress requires 5 meters.",
    "Therefore, the number of dresses Alex can make is \\(500 \\div 5 = 100\\)."

  "solution": "100"
