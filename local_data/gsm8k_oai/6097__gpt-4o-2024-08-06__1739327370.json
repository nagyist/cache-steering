  "query": "John has 25 horses.  He feeds each horse twice a day and feeds them 20 pounds of food at each feeding.  He buys half ton bags of food.  How many of those will he have to buy in 60 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much food is consumed by each horse in one day.",
    "Each horse is fed twice a day, and each feeding requires 20 pounds of food.",
    "Therefore, one horse eats 20 pounds per feeding \u00d7 2 feedings per day = 40 pounds of food per day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much total food is consumed by all 25 horses in one day.",
    "If each horse eats 40 pounds per day, then 25 horses eat 25 horses \u00d7 40 pounds per horse per day = 1,000 pounds of food per day.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much food is consumed in 60 days.",
    "The total amount of food consumed in 60 days would be 1,000 pounds per day \u00d7 60 days = 60,000 pounds of food.",
    "Each bag of food is half a ton. Since 1 ton is 2,000 pounds, half a ton is 1,000 pounds.",
    "I need to determine how many half-ton bags are needed to meet the 60,000 pounds of food requirement.",
    "To do this, I need to divide the total pounds of food by the pounds per bag: 60,000 pounds \u00f7 1,000 pounds per bag = 60 bags."

  "solution": "60"
