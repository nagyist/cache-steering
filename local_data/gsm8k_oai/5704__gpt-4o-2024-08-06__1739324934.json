  "query": "The total cost of Olivia\u2019s groceries was $42. The bananas cost her $12, the bread cost her $9, and the milk cost her $7. The only other groceries she bought were apples. In dollars, how much money did the apples cost her?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know the total cost of Olivia's groceries. It is $42.",
    "Next, I need to add up the costs of the items that are specifically mentioned: bananas, bread, and milk.",
    "The cost of the bananas is $12.",
    "The cost of the bread is $9.",
    "The cost of the milk is $7.",
    "Now, I add these costs together: $12 + $9 + $7.",
    "First, I add $12 and $9 together. That is $21.",
    "Then I add the result to $7. So, $21 + $7.",
    "$21 + $7 equals $28.",
    "Now, I know that the total cost of the other items except apples is $28.",
    "To find the cost of the apples, I subtract the total cost of other groceries from the total grocery cost.",
    "So, $42 (total) minus $28 (other groceries).",
    "$42 - $28 equals $14.",
    "Thus, the apples cost her $14."

  "solution": "14"
