  "query": "Macy has a goal of running a total of 24 miles per week. If she runs 3 miles per day, how many miles does Macy have left to run after 6 days so that she could meet her goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Macy wants to run a total of 24 miles per week.",
    "She runs 3 miles each day.",
    "To find out how many miles she runs in 6 days, I need to multiply the number of miles she runs per day (3 miles) by the number of days (6 days).",
    "3 miles/day * 6 days = 18 miles.",
    "Macy has already run 18 miles in 6 days.",
    "Her goal is to run 24 miles in total.",
    "To find out how many miles Macy has left to run, I subtract the miles she has already run (18 miles) from her goal (24 miles).",
    "24 miles - 18 miles = 6 miles."
