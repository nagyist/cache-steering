  "query": "Isabella and Alexis went to the mall to buy some pants and dresses. Alexis bought 3 times more pants and dresses than Isabella. If Alexis bought 21 pairs of pants and 18 dresses, how many pairs of pants and dresses did Isabella buy in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total items Alexis bought. She bought 21 pairs of pants and 18 dresses.",
    "I calculate the total items Alexis bought by adding the pairs of pants and dresses: 21 + 18 = 39.",
    "Alexis bought 3 times more items than Isabella did.",
    "To find how many items Isabella bought, I need to divide the total number of items Alexis bought by 3.",
    "I divide 39 by 3: 39 / 3 = 13.",
    "Therefore, Isabella bought 13 items in total."

  "solution": "13"
