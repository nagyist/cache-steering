  "query": "Yesterday, David and William were invited to a party. David broke 2 glasses, while his friend William broke 4 times the number of glasses David broke. How many glasses were broken?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying how many glasses David broke, which is 2 glasses.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many glasses William broke. Since William broke 4 times the number David broke, I multiply the number of glasses David broke by 4.",
    "David broke 2 glasses. 4 times 2 is 8, so William broke 8 glasses.",
    "To find the total number of broken glasses, I add the glasses David broke to the glasses William broke.",
    "David broke 2 glasses and William broke 8 glasses. Adding them together gives 2 + 8 = 10."

  "solution": "10"
