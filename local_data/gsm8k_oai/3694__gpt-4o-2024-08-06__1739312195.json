  "query": "For many years, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.   But today scientists say one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay.  If there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay,  how many Pelicans remain in Shark Bite Cove?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining the initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove as \\( P \\).",
    "According to the problem, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay, which is 60, is twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove: 60 = 2P.",
    "From 60 = 2P, we can solve for P: P = 60 / 2 = 30. So, initially, there were 30 pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.",
    "Now, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. One-third of 30 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10 \\).",
    "When 10 pelicans move to Pelican Bay, the remaining number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove is 30 - 10 = 20."
