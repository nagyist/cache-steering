  "query": "Hilary is collecting her toenails in a jar to gross out her sister. She can fit 100 toenails in the jar, unless they are from her two big toes, which are twice as big as the rest. She has already filled it with 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails. How many regular toenails can she fit into the remainder of the jar?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many more toenails can fit into the jar.",
    "I know the jar can fit a total equivalent of 100 regular toenails.",
    "I also know that each big toenail is twice the size of a regular toenail.",
    "Hilary has already added 20 big toenails. Since each big toenail counts as two regular toenails, these account for 20 x 2 = 40 regular toenails in terms of space.",
    "Additionally, she has 40 regular toenails in the jar.",
    "The combined space taken by the toenails in the jar is 40 regular-space (big toenails) + 40 regular toenails = 80 equivalent regular toenails.",
    "This implies that 20 equivalent spaces for regular toenails remain in the jar (since 100 total - 80 used = 20 spaces).",
    "Therefore, Hilary can fit 20 more regular toenails into the jar."

  "solution": "20"
