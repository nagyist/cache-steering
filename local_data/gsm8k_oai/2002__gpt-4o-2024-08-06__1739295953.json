  "query": "The United States flag has 50 stars, one for every state in the union, and 13 stripes, which represent the original 13 colonies.  Pete, inspired by history, decided to make his own flag.  He used circles, to represent how many scoops of ice cream he can consume in one sitting, and squares, to represent the number of brownies he has hidden beneath his bed.  For circles, he used 3 less than half the number of stars on the US flag, and for squares, he used six more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag.  What is the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of circles Pete used. The US flag has 50 stars, so I take half of that number.",
    "Half of 50 is 25.",
    "Pete used 3 less than half of 50 stars, so I subtract 3 from 25.",
    "25 - 3 equals 22.",
    "Therefore, Pete used 22 circles on his flag.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of squares. The US flag has 13 stripes.",
    "Twice the number of stripes, 13, is calculated by multiplying 13 by 2.",
    "13 * 2 equals 26.",
    "Pete used 6 more than twice the number of stripes, so I add 6 to 26.",
    "26 + 6 equals 32.",
    "As a result, Pete used 32 squares on his flag.",
    "To find the combined total number of circles and squares, I add the number of circles and squares together.",
    "22 circles + 32 squares equals 54."
