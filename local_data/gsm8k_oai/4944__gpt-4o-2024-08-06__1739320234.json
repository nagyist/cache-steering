  "query": "Patrick buys a season pass for each of his sons to visit the local amusement park as often as they want.  The passes were $100.00 each.  The oldest son went to the park 35 times over the summer and the youngest went 15 times.  What was the cost per trip to the park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Patrick spent on season passes.",
    "Each season pass costs $100.00.",
    "Patrick has two sons, so he bought two season passes.",
    "The total cost for the passes is 2 passes x $100/pass = $200.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of trips to the park.",
    "The oldest son went 35 times, and the youngest son went 15 times.",
    "Adding the number of trips for both sons: 35 trips + 15 trips = 50 trips.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost per trip by dividing the total cost by the total number of trips.",
    "The cost per trip is $200 (total cost) divided by 50 trips (total trips).",
    "$200 / 50 = $4."

  "solution": "4"
