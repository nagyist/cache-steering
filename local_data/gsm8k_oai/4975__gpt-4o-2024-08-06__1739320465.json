  "query": "Angela has a collection of 24 pieces of rare action figures. She sold off a quarter of them at the pawnshop and gave one-third of the remainder to her daughter. How many does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Angela originally has 24 pieces of rare action figures.",
    "She sold off a quarter of them at the pawnshop. One quarter of 24 is calculated as 24 divided by 4.",
    "24 divided by 4 equals 6. Angela sold 6 action figures.",
    "After selling, Angela has 24 - 6 action figures left.",
    "24 - 6 equals 18. Angela now has 18 action figures remaining.",
    "She gave one-third of the remaining figures to her daughter. One-third of 18 is calculated as 18 divided by 3.",
    "18 divided by 3 equals 6. Angela gave 6 action figures to her daughter.",
    "After giving the figures to her daughter, Angela has 18 - 6 action figures left.",
    "18 - 6 equals 12. Angela has 12 action figures remaining."
