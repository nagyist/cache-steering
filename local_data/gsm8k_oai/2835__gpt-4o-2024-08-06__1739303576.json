  "query": "Surfers enjoy going to the Rip Curl Myrtle Beach Surf Festival. There were 1500 surfers at the Festival on the first day, 600 more surfers on the second day than the first day, and 2/5 as many surfers on the third day as the first day. What is the average number of surfers at the Festival for the three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how many surfers attended the festival on each day.",
    "There were 1500 surfers on the first day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many surfers were there on the second day.",
    "There were 600 more surfers on the second day than the first day, so there were 1500 + 600 = 2100 surfers on the second day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many surfers attended on the third day.",
    "The third day had 2/5 as many surfers as the first day.",
    "To find out how many surfers were on the third day, I calculate (2/5) * 1500 = 600.",
    "Now I know the number of surfers on each day: 1500 on the first day, 2100 on the second day, and 600 on the third day.",
    "I will add these numbers together to find the total number of surfers over the three days.",
    "The total number of surfers is 1500 + 2100 + 600 = 4200.",
    "To find the average number of surfers per day, I divide the total number of surfers by the number of days (3).",
    "4200 \u00f7 3 = 1400."

  "solution": "1400"
