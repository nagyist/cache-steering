  "steps": [
    "Start with the initial number of people on the bus. There were 50 people on the bus initially.",
    "At the first stop, 15 people got off the bus. So, subtract 15 from 50.",
    "50 - 15 = 35. Now there are 35 people on the bus after the first stop.",
    "At the next stop, 8 people got off and 2 got on. First, subtract the 8 people who got off.",
    "35 - 8 = 27. Now there are 27 people on the bus after those people got off.",
    "Now add the 2 people who got on the bus.",
    "27 + 2 = 29. Now there are 29 people on the bus after the second stop.",
    "At the third stop, 4 people got off and 3 people got on. First, subtract the 4 people who got off.",
    "29 - 4 = 25. Now there are 25 people on the bus after those people got off.",
    "Now add the 3 people who got on the bus.",
    "25 + 3 = 28. Now there are 28 people on the bus after the third stop."
