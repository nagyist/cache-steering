  "query": "When Nathan is cold, he adds an extra blanket to his bed. Each blanket warms him up by 3 degrees. One night, he was cold enough that he added half of the 14 blankets in his closet on his bed. How many degrees did the blankets warm Nathan up?",
  "steps": [
    "Nathan has a total of 14 blankets in his closet.",
    "He uses half of these blankets when he is cold.",
    "Half of 14 blankets is calculated as 14 divided by 2.",
    "14 divided by 2 is 7, so Nathan uses 7 blankets.",
    "Each blanket warms him up by 3 degrees.",
    "To find the total warmth provided by the blankets, multiply the number of blankets (7) by the warmth provided per blanket (3 degrees).",
    "7 multiplied by 3 is 21."

  "solution": "21"
