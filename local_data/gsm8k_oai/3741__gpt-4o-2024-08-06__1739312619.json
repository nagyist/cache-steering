    "His daily goal is 10,000 steps.",
    "I need to find out how many sets of 2,000 steps are in 10,000 steps.",
    "To do this, I divide 10,000 by 2,000.",
    "10,000 divided by 2,000 equals 5.",
    "Roger needs to complete 5 sets of 2,000 steps to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",
    "Since he takes 30 minutes for each set of 2,000 steps, I need to multiply 5 by 30 to find out the total time.",
    "5 sets times 30 minutes per set equals 150 minutes."
