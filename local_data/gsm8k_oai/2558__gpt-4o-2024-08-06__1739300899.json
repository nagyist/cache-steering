  "query": "James can make a beret from 3 spools of yarn. If he has 12 spools of red yarn, 15 spools of black yarn, and 6 spools of blue yarn, how many berets can he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many berets James can make with the red yarn.",
    "James has 12 spools of red yarn.",
    "Since it takes 3 spools to make one beret, I need to divide 12 by 3.",
    "12 divided by 3 equals 4.",
    "This means James can make 4 berets using the red yarn.",
    "Next, I'll determine how many berets James can make with the black yarn.",
    "James has 15 spools of black yarn.",
    "Again, it takes 3 spools to make one beret, so I need to divide 15 by 3.",
    "15 divided by 3 equals 5.",
    "This means James can make 5 berets using the black yarn.",
    "Now, I'll determine how many berets James can make with the blue yarn.",
    "James has 6 spools of blue yarn.",
    "It still takes 3 spools to make one beret, so I need to divide 6 by 3.",
    "6 divided by 3 equals 2.",
    "This means James can make 2 berets using the blue yarn.",
    "Finally, I'll add the number of berets he can make from each color of yarn together.",
    "James can make 4 berets with red, 5 with black, and 2 with blue yarn.",
    "4 plus 5 plus 2 equals 11."
