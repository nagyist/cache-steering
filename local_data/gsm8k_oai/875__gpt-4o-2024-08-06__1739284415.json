  "query": "To get the printer to work, Jerry needs to add a black-and-white cartridge and three color cartridges. If each color cartridge costs $32 and each black-and-white cartridge costs $27, how much does he pay total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of one black-and-white cartridge.",
    "The problem states that a black-and-white cartridge costs $27.",
    "Now, I need to determine the cost of one color cartridge.",
    "The problem states that each color cartridge costs $32.",
    "Jerry needs to buy one black-and-white cartridge.",
    "So the total cost for the black-and-white cartridge is $27.",
    "Jerry needs to buy three color cartridges.",
    "To find the total cost of the color cartridges, I multiply the cost of one color cartridge by the number of cartridges: $32 * 3.",
    "First, multiply 32 by 3.",
    "32 * 3 = 96",
    "The total cost for the color cartridges is $96.",
    "Now, I add the total cost of the black-and-white cartridge to the total cost of the color cartridges.",
    "27 (black-and-white cartridge) + 96 (color cartridges) = 123",
    "Thus, the total amount Jerry needs to pay is $123."

  "solution": "123"
