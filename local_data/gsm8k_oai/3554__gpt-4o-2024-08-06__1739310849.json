  "query": "There are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish in an aquarium exhibit. If there are 90 fish total, how many pufferfish are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number of pufferfish as \\( P \\).",
    "According to the problem, there are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish.",
    "Therefore, the number of swordfish can be expressed as \\( 5P \\).",
    "The total number of fish is the sum of swordfish and pufferfish, which is given as 90.",
    "This can be expressed by the equation: \\( P + 5P = 90 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms: \\( 6P = 90 \\).",
    "To find the number of pufferfish, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: \\( P = \\frac{90}{6} \\).",
    "Calculate the division: \\( P = 15 \\)."
