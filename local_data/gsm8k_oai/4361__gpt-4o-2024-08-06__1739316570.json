  "query": "The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first define the situation. Each tripodasaurus has 1 head and 3 legs.",
    "I'm told there are a total of 20 heads and legs combined in this flock.",
    "Each tripodasaurus contributes 1 head and 3 legs, so in total, each contributes 4 to the head and leg count.",
    "If each tripodasaurus contributes 4 to the count and the total count is 20, dividing 20 by 4 should give me the number of tripodasauruses.",
    "20 divided by 4 equals 5.",
    "This means there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock."

  "solution": "5"
