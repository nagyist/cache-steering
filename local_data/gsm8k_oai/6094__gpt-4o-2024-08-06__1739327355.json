  "query": "Walter goes to the zoo, where he spends a certain amount of time looking at the seals, eight times as long looking at the penguins, and 13 minutes looking at the elephants. If he spent 2 hours and 10 minutes at the zoo, how many minutes did he spent looking at the seals?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's convert the total time Walter spent at the zoo into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is 120 minutes. So, 2 hours and 10 minutes is 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes.",
    "Let the time spent looking at the seals be S minutes.",
    "According to the problem, Walter spends 8 times as long looking at the penguins as he does looking at the seals.",
    "So, the time spent looking at the penguins is 8S minutes.",
    "He looks at the elephants for 13 minutes.",
    "The total time spent at the zoo is the time spent on seals, plus the time spent on penguins, plus the time spent on elephants.",
    "This gives us the equation: S + 8S + 13 = 130.",
    "Combining like terms, we get 9S + 13 = 130.",
    "Subtract 13 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms with S: 9S = 130 - 13.",
    "Perform the subtraction: 130 - 13 = 117.",
    "So, 9S = 117.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for S: S = 117 / 9.",
    "Perform the division: 117 divided by 9 equals 13."

  "solution": "13"
