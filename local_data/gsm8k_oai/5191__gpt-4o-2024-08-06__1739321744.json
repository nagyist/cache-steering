  "query": "Paul is collecting license plates from different states. He has plates from 40 different states. For each percentage point of total US states that he has, his parents will give him $2. How much does he earn from them?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total number of states in the United States.",
    "There are 50 states in the United States.",
    "Paul has license plates from 40 different states.",
    "I need to calculate the percentage of total states that Paul has plates from.",
    "The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of states he has plates from by the total number of states, and then multiplying by 100.",
    "So, the percentage is (40 / 50) * 100.",
    "40 divided by 50 is 0.8.",
    "0.8 multiplied by 100 is 80.",
    "Paul has plates from 80% of the total US states.",
    "For each percentage point, he earns $2.",
    "So, I need to multiply the percentage by the amount he earns per percentage point.",
    "80% multiplied by $2 is $160."
  ],
  "solution": "160"
