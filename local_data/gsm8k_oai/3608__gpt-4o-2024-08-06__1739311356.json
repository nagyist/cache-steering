  "query": "A caf\u00e9 has a few orders to cook and also needs to makes sandwiches for a group of customers that arrived. 3 local offices have each ordered 10 bacon sandwiches and half of the group that has arrived have asked for 4 bacon sandwiches each. If the caf\u00e9 makes a total of 54 bacon sandwiches, how many customers are in the group of customers that arrived?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many bacon sandwiches have been ordered by the 3 local offices.",
    "Each office ordered 10 bacon sandwiches. Therefore, 3 offices ordering 10 each amounts to 3 * 10 = 30 bacon sandwiches.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many bacon sandwiches are needed for the group of customers that arrived.",
    "The total number of bacon sandwiches made by the caf\u00e9 is 54. Out of these, 30 sandwiches were ordered by the 3 offices.",
    "I will subtract the sandwiches ordered by the offices from the total sandwiches to find how many were made for the group.\n54 - 30 = 24 sandwiches were made for the group.",
    "Half of the group asks for 4 bacon sandwiches each. Let x be the total number of customers in the group.",
    "If half the group (x/2) asks for 4 sandwiches each, then the total sandwiches for them would be (x/2)*4 sandwiches.",
    "Equating the sandwiches ordered by the group to their consumption, we have:\n(x/2) * 4 = 24.",
    "To solve for x, simplify the equation: \n2x = 24.",
    "Now, solve for x: \nx = 24 / 2 = 12 customers."
