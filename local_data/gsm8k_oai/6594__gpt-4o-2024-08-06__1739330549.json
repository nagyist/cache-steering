  "query": "Max needs 65 paper plates for the barbecue party.  He already has 22 green paper plates and 24 blue paper plates. How many more paper plates does he need?",
  "steps": [
    "Max needs a total of 65 paper plates.",
    "Max already has 22 green paper plates.",
    "Max also has 24 blue paper plates.",
    "To find out how many paper plates Max already has in total, I need to add the number of green plates and blue plates together.",
    "Adding 22 green plates and 24 blue plates gives me 46 paper plates in total that Max already has.",
    "Max needs 65 paper plates in total for the party.",
    "To find out how many more paper plates Max needs, I need to subtract the total number of plates he already has (46) from the total number he needs (65).",
    "65 minus 46 equals 19.",
    "Therefore, Max needs 19 more paper plates."
