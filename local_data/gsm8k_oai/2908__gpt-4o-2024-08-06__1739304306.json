  "query": "Andrew holds a bake sale to fundraise for charity. The bake sale earns a total of $400. Andrew keeps $100 to cover the cost of ingredients. He donates half of the remaining total to the local homeless shelter, and the other half to the local food bank. Andrew also decides to donate $10 from his own piggy bank to the local homeless shelter. How much money in total does Andrew donate to the homeless shelter?",
  "steps": [
    "The total earned from the bake sale is $400.",
    "Andrew keeps $100 to cover the cost of ingredients.",
    "Subtract the $100 cost from the total: $400 - $100 = $300.",
    "Andrew decides to donate half of the remaining $300 to the local homeless shelter.",
    "Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150.",
    "Andrew donates $150 to the local homeless shelter from the bake sale funds.",
    "Additionally, Andrew donates $10 from his own piggy bank to the homeless shelter.",
    "Total donation to the homeless shelter is $150 (from the bake sale) + $10 (from piggy bank) = $160."
