  "query": "The recipe for a four-person cake requires 2 eggs and 4 cups of milk. Tyler wants to use this recipe to make a cake for eight people. If Tyler has 3 eggs in the fridge, how many more eggs does Tyler need to buy?",

    "The recipe is for a four-person cake, requiring 2 eggs.",
    "Tyler wants to bake a cake for eight people.",

    "Doubling the requirement of 2 eggs gives us 2 eggs * 2 = 4 eggs.",
    "Tyler currently has 3 eggs in the fridge.",
    "Calculate the difference: 4 eggs needed - 3 eggs available = 1 egg short."
