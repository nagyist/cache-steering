  "query": "Bald Mountain received 1.5 meters of snow last week. During a blizzard, Billy Mountain received 3.5 meters of snow and Mount Pilot received 126 centimeters of snow. How many more centimeters of snow did Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot have then Bald Mountain?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert Bald Mountain's snow from meters to centimeters because the final calculation should be in centimeters.",
    "Bald Mountain received 1.5 meters of snow. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so I multiply 1.5 by 100.",
    "1.5 meters * 100 = 150 centimeters. So, Bald Mountain received 150 centimeters of snow.",
    "Next, I need to convert Billy Mountain's snow from meters to centimeters.",
    "Billy Mountain received 3.5 meters of snow. Multiply 3.5 by 100 to convert it to centimeters.",
    "3.5 meters * 100 = 350 centimeters. So, Billy Mountain received 350 centimeters of snow.",
    "Mount Pilot received 126 centimeters of snow, which is already in the correct unit.",
    "I will now add the snow received by Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot to find out how much snow they received together.",
    "Billy Mountain's 350 centimeters + Mount Pilot's 126 centimeters = 476 centimeters.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many more centimeters of snow Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot received compared to Bald Mountain.",
    "Subtract Bald Mountain's 150 centimeters from the combined 476 centimeters of Billy Mountain and Mount Pilot.",
    "476 centimeters - 150 centimeters = 326 centimeters."
