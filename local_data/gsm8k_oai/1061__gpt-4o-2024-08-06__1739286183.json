  "query": "John Smith buys 3 cakes for $12 each and splits the cost with his brother.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "John Smith bought 3 cakes.",
    "Each cake costs $12.",
    "To find the total cost of the cakes, I need to multiply the number of cakes by the cost per cake.",
    "Multiplying 3 cakes by $12 per cake gives me a total cost of $36.",
    "John splits the cost with his brother, which means they will divide the total cost equally between both of them.",
    "They will divide $36 by 2 to find out how much each person pays.",
    "Dividing $36 by 2 gives me $18."
