  "query": "Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many pieces of wood are used to make 24 tables.",
    "Each table takes 12 pieces of wood.",
    "So, for 24 tables, the wood used is 24 tables * 12 pieces of wood per table.",
    "24 * 12 is 288.",
    "Gerald uses 288 pieces of wood to make 24 tables.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much wood Gerald has left after making the tables.",
    "He started with 672 pieces of wood.",
    "After making the tables, he has 672 - 288 pieces of wood left.",
    "672 - 288 is 384.",
    "Gerald has 384 pieces of wood remaining.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many chairs he can make with the remaining wood.",
    "Each chair takes 8 pieces of wood.",
    "To find out how many chairs can be made, divide the remaining wood by the number of pieces needed per chair.",
    "384 pieces of wood / 8 pieces per chair is the calculation required.",
    "384 \u00f7 8 equals 48."
  ],
  "solution": "48"
