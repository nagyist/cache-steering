  "query": "John builds a toy bridge to support various weights.  It needs to support 6 cans of soda that have 12 ounces of soda.  The cans weigh 2 ounces empty.  He then also adds 2 more empty cans.  How much weight must the bridge hold up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the weight of the filled cans of soda.",
    "Each filled can has 12 ounces of soda.",
    "Each can weighs an additional 2 ounces when empty, making the total weight of a filled can 12 + 2 = 14 ounces.",
    "There are 6 filled cans, so I multiply 6 by 14 ounces per can.",
    "6 filled cans * 14 ounces each = 84 ounces.",
    "Now I need to calculate the weight of the 2 empty cans.",
    "Each empty can weighs 2 ounces.",
    "2 empty cans * 2 ounces each = 4 ounces.",
    "To find the total weight, I add the weight of the filled cans and the empty cans together.",
    "84 ounces (filled cans) + 4 ounces (empty cans) = 88 ounces."

  "solution": "88"
