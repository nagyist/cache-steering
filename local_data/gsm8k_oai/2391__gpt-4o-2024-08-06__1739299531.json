  "query": "Every week, Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of his students on Monday. He made 40 pieces of chocolate candy last Monday. This upcoming Monday, 3 of Lucas' students will not be coming to class. How many pieces of chocolate candy will Lucas make for his class on Monday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students Lucas has based on the number of candies he made last Monday.",
    "Lucas made 40 pieces of chocolate candy last Monday, and he makes 4 pieces for each student.",
    "To find the number of students, I'll divide the total number of candies by the number of candies per student: 40 \u00f7 4.",
    "40 \u00f7 4 equals 10, so Lucas has 10 students.",
    "Next, I need to account for the fact that 3 students will not be coming to class this upcoming Monday.",
    "Since 3 students won't attend, Lucas will be making candy for 10 - 3 = 7 students this upcoming Monday.",
    "With 7 students, Lucas will need to make 4 pieces of candy per student.",
    "To find out how many pieces of candy he will make, I multiply 7 students by 4 pieces of candy per student: 7 \u00d7 4.",
    "7 \u00d7 4 equals 28."
  ],
  "solution": "28"
