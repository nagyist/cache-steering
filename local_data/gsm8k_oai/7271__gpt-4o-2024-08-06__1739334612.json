  "query": "Cristina, John, Clarissa and Sarah want to give their mother a photo album for her birthday. Cristina brings 7 photos, John brings 10 photos and Sarah brings 9 photos. If the photo album has 40 slots available, how many photos does Clarissa need to bring in order to complete the photo album?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of photos brought by Cristina, John, and Sarah.",
    "Cristina brings 7 photos.",
    "John brings 10 photos.",
    "Sarah brings 9 photos.",
    "Now, I'll add these numbers together to find the total number of photos from Cristina, John, and Sarah.",
    "7 (Cristina) + 10 (John) + 9 (Sarah) = 26 photos.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many more photos are needed to fill the 40 slots in the album.",
    "The total slots available in the photo album are 40.",
    "Subtract the total number of photos already available from Cristina, John, and Sarah from the total slots in the album.",
    "40 (total slots) - 26 (photos from Cristina, John, and Sarah) = 14 photos needed.",
    "This means Clarissa needs to bring 14 more photos to complete the photo album."
