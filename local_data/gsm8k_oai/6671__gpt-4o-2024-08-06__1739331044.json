    "The total number of people at the party is 100.",
    "Fifty percent of the attendees are women.",
    "Fifty percent of 100 is calculated as 0.50 * 100 = 50.",

    "Thirty-five percent of 100 is calculated as 0.35 * 100 = 35.",

    "The total number of women and men together is 50 + 35 = 85.",
    "The total attendees are 100, and the sum of women and men is 85.",
    "The number of children is the total attendees minus the number of women and men together.",
    "So, the number of children is 100 - 85 = 15."
