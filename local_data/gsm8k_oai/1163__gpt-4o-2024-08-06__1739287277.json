  "query": "Trevor buys three bouquets of carnations. The first included 9 carnations, and the second included 14 carnations. If the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, how many carnations were in the third bouquet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of bouquets Trevor buys. He buys three bouquets.",
    "The first bouquet contains 9 carnations.",
    "The second bouquet contains 14 carnations.",
    "The problem states that the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12.",
    "I need to find out the total number of carnations across all bouquets in order to calculate the average.",
    "The formula to find the total number of carnations is: Total carnations = Average number of carnations * Number of bouquets.",
    "Substituting the known values into the formula: Total carnations = 12 carnations/bouquet * 3 bouquets = 36 carnations.",
    "I have already accounted for the carnations in the first and second bouquets: 9 + 14 = 23 carnations.",
    "To find the number of carnations in the third bouquet, I subtract the total number of carnations in the first and second bouquets from the overall total.",
    "36 carnations (total) - 23 carnations (first and second bouquets) = 13 carnations."
