  "query": "There are 14 girls, 11 boys, and their parents at a park. If they split into 3 equally sized playgroups, each group contains 25 people. How many parents were at the park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand the problem involves people at a park: girls, boys, and parents.",
    "There are 14 girls and 11 boys.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of girls and boys, which is 14 + 11.",
    "14 + 11 equals 25.",
    "The problem states that each playgroup has 25 people.",
    "These 25 people already account for all the girls and boys, since we calculated that there are 25 girls and boys combined.",
    "This implies that the total of 25 people in each playgroup contains no extra girls or boys; it's solely them.",
    "If the total number of people in each group is 25, and all 3 groups together include people already accounted for, I need to consider the total number of groups.",
    "With 3 equally sized groups, the total number of people at the park across all groups is 3 multiplied by 25.",
    "3 multiplied by 25 equals 75.",
    "These 75 people are made up of the 25 girls and boys we already mentioned, along with parents.",
    "If the girls and boys total to 25, then the remainder of the 75 people must be parents.",
    "So, I subtract the 25 girls and boys from the total of 75 people.",
    "75 minus 25 equals 50."

  "solution": "50"
