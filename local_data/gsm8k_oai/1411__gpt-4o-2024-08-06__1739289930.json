  "query": "Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many words fit on each full page of Leo's notebook.",
    "Each line can hold 10 words.",
    "There are 20 lines on each page.",
    "Therefore, each page can hold 10 words per line x 20 lines = 200 words.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many words Lucas has already written.",
    "Lucas has filled one and a half pages.",
    "One full page equals 200 words.",
    "Half a page would be half of 200 words, which is 100 words.",
    "So, Lucas has written 200 words + 100 words = 300 words.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many words Lucas still needs to write.",
    "The total word count required for the story is 400 words.",
    "Lucas has written 300 words so far.",
    "Therefore, the number of words Lucas has left to write is 400 words - 300 words."
