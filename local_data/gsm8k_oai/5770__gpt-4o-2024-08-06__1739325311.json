  "query": "Mark has an egg farm. His farm supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs and another store with 30 eggs each day. How many eggs does he supply these two stores in a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the quantities involved. A dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs.",
    "Mark supplies the first store with 5 dozen eggs. To find out how many eggs that is, I need to multiply 5 dozen by 12.",
    "5 dozen eggs is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.",
    "Now, I know that Mark supplies 60 eggs to the first store each day.",
    "Mark also supplies 30 eggs to the second store each day.",
    "To find out how many eggs he supplies to both stores in a single day, I need to add the eggs supplied to each store.",
    "Mark supplies 60 eggs to the first store and 30 eggs to the second store. 60 + 30 = 90 eggs.",
    "He supplies a total of 90 eggs to both stores in one day.",
    "To find out how many eggs he supplies in a week, I need to multiply the daily total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).",
    "90 eggs per day multiplied by 7 days a week equals 630 eggs per week."

  "solution": "630"
