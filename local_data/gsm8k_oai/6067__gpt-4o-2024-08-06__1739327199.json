  "steps": [
    "First, I'll find out how many of Michael's pets are dogs.",
    "25% of his 36 pets are dogs.",
    "To find 25% of 36, I'll calculate 36 * 0.25.",
    "36 * 0.25 = 9",
    "So, Michael has 9 dogs.",
    "Next, I'll find out how many of Michael's pets are cats.",
    "50% of his 36 pets are cats.",
    "To find 50% of 36, I'll calculate 36 * 0.50.",
    "36 * 0.50 = 18",
    "So, Michael has 18 cats.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many bunnies Michael has.",
    "He has a total of 36 pets, with 9 being dogs and 18 being cats.",
    "I'll subtract the number of dogs and cats from the total number of pets to find the number of bunnies.",
    "36 - 9 - 18 = 9",
    "Therefore, Michael has 9 bunnies."
