  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Marly has in $20 bills.",
    "Marly has ten $20 bills.",
    "10 times $20 is $200.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total amount of money in $10 bills.",
    "Marly has eight $10 bills.",
    "8 times $10 is $80.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total amount of money in $5 bills.",
    "Marly has four $5 bills.",
    "4 times $5 is $20.",
    "Now, I need to sum up all the amounts to find the total amount of money Marly has.",
    "$200 (from the $20 bills) plus $80 (from the $10 bills) plus $20 (from the $5 bills) equals $300.",
    "Now, I need to convert the total amount of $300 into $100 bills.",
    "$300 divided by $100 per bill results in 3 pieces of $100 bills."
