  "query": "Ellen is in charge of parking at a golf tournament. Once the main lot is full, she must direct cars to park in the overflow lot. She must transport the patrons who parked in the overflow lot up to the main lot using a golf cart. Ellen can fit 3 patrons in a golf cart. There are 12 patrons who came in cars and 27 from a bus waiting in the overflow parking lot. How many golf carts does Ellen need to transport them?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of patrons waiting in the overflow parking lot.",
    "There are 12 patrons from cars.",
    "There are 27 patrons from a bus.",
    "I add these two numbers to find the total number of patrons.",
    "12 (from cars) + 27 (from bus) = 39 patrons total.",
    "Ellen can transport 3 patrons at a time using one golf cart.",
    "I need to divide the total number of patrons by the capacity of one golf cart.",
    "39 patrons \u00f7 3 patrons per cart = 13 golf carts."
