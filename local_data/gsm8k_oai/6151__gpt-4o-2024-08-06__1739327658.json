  "query": "Justin can run 2 blocks in 1.5 minutes. If he is 8 blocks from home, in how many minutes can he run home?",
  "steps": [
    "Justin can run 2 blocks in 1.5 minutes.",
    "I need to determine how long it will take Justin to run 8 blocks.",
    "First, I should calculate Justin's speed in blocks per minute.",
    "Justin runs 2 blocks in 1.5 minutes, so his speed is \\( \\frac{2 \\text{ blocks}}{1.5 \\text{ minutes}} \\).",
    "To find his speed in blocks per minute, I divide 2 by 1.5.",
    "2 divided by 1.5 equals approximately 1.333 blocks per minute.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how long it will take to run 8 blocks at this speed.",
    "I use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "The distance is 8 blocks, and the speed is 1.333 blocks per minute.",
    "I divide 8 by 1.333 to find the time in minutes.",
    "8 divided by 1.333 is approximately 6.",
    "I double-check to ensure there are no calculation errors.",
    "The calculation appears correct, as 8 divided by 1.333 is indeed approximately 6."
