  "query": "When Michelle makes fresh pasta, she first makes the dough, then she rolls it out and cuts it, and then she hangs it on racks to dry for cooking later. She needs a drying rack for each three pounds of pasta she makes, and it takes two cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough. She owns three racks right now. How many more drying racks will Michelle need if she makes pasta using three 8-cup bags of flour?",
  "steps": [
    "Michelle has three 8-cup bags of flour.",
    "Each bag contains 8 cups of flour, so she has a total of 3 bags * 8 cups/bag = 24 cups of flour.",
    "It takes 2 cups of flour to make one pound of pasta dough.",
    "To find out how many pounds of pasta she can make, I divide the total cups of flour by the cups needed per pound: 24 cups / 2 cups/pound = 12 pounds of pasta.",
    "Michelle needs one drying rack for every 3 pounds of pasta.",
    "To find out how many racks she needs for 12 pounds of pasta, I divide the total pounds by the pounds per rack: 12 pounds / 3 pounds/rack = 4 racks.",
    "Michelle currently owns 3 racks.",
    "I need to calculate how many more racks she needs by subtracting the racks she owns from the racks she needs: 4 racks needed - 3 racks owned = 1 more rack needed."
