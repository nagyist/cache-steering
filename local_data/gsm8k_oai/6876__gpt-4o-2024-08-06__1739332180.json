  "query": "Selena got a tip today that amounted to $99. She pampered herself by eating at a 5-star hotel. She indulged herself with 2 steak meals that cost $24 each plate. She also ordered 2 types of burgers which cost $3.5 each, and 3 cups of ice cream which cost $2 each. How much money will Selena be left with?",
  "steps": [
    "Selena's tip amount is $99.",
    "She ordered 2 steak meals, each costing $24. Therefore, the total cost for the steak meals is 2 * $24 = $48.",
    "She also ordered 2 burgers, each costing $3.5. The total cost for the burgers is 2 * $3.5 = $7.",
    "She ordered 3 cups of ice cream, each costing $2. The total cost for the ice cream is 3 * $2 = $6.",
    "Now, I will calculate her total expenditure. The total cost for the steak meals, burgers, and ice cream is $48 + $7 + $6 = $61.",
    "To find out how much money Selena is left with, I need to subtract her total expenditure from her tip. So, $99 (tip) - $61 (total expenditure) = $38."

  "solution": "38"
