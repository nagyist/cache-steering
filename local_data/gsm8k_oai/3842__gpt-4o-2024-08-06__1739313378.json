  "query": "Mark bought a shirt, pants, and shoes for $340. What is the price of the pants knowing that the price of a shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants and that the price of a shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the price of the pants be \\( x \\) dollars.",
    "The price of the shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants. Thus, the price of the shirt is \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\) dollars.",
    "The price of the shoes is ten dollars more than the price of the pants. Thus, the price of the shoes is \\( x + 10 \\) dollars.",
    "According to the problem, the total price of the shirt, pants, and shoes is $340.",
    "Hence, we can set up the equation: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + x + (x + 10) = 340\n\\]",
    "Combine the terms involving \\( x \\): \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + x + x = 340 - 10\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + 2x = 330\n\\]",
    "Convert \\( 2x \\) into a fraction with a denominator of 4: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{8}{4}x = 330\n\\]",
    "Combine the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{4}x = 330\n\\]",
    "Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n11x = 1320\n\\]",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 11 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1320}{11}\n\\]",
    "Calculate the division:\n\n\\[\nx = 120\n\\]"
