  "query": "Nina wants to buy a new video game with her allowance money. The game cost 50 dollars. Nina also has learned that there is a 10 percent sales tax. She receives 10 dollars a week as an allowance, and thinks she can save half of that. How many weeks will it take for Nina to be able to buy the new video game with her savings?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the video game including sales tax.",
    "The game costs 50 dollars and there is a 10 percent sales tax.",
    "10 percent of 50 dollars is 0.1 * 50 = 5 dollars.",
    "So, the sales tax adds 5 dollars to the price.",
    "Therefore, the total cost of the game including tax is 50 + 5 = 55 dollars.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much Nina saves per week.",
    "Nina receives 10 dollars per week and saves half of that.",
    "Half of 10 dollars is 10 / 2 = 5 dollars.",
    "So, Nina saves 5 dollars every week.",
    "To find out how many weeks it will take to save 55 dollars, I divide the total cost by the savings per week.",
    "55 divided by 5 dollars per week equals 11 weeks."

  "solution": "11"
