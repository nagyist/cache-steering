  "query": "Milo's parents tell him that he can win cash rewards for good grades. He will get $5 times the average grade he gets. He gets three 2s, four 3s, a 4, and a 5. How much cash does he get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total of all Milo's grades.",
    "He gets three 2s, so that contributes \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) to his total.",
    "He gets four 3s, so that contributes \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) to his total.",
    "He gets one 4, so that contributes \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) to his total.",
    "He gets one 5, so that also contributes \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) to his total.",
    "Now, I need to sum up all these contributions to find the total sum of his grades: \\(6 + 12 + 4 + 5\\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\(6 + 12 = 18\\).",
    "\\(18 + 4 = 22\\).",
    "Finally, \\(22 + 5 = 27\\).",
    "So, the total sum of his grades is 27.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of grades he received.",
    "He has three 2s, four 3s, one 4, and one 5.",
    "Therefore, the total number of grades is \\(3 + 4 + 1 + 1\\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\(3 + 4 = 7\\).",
    "\\(7 + 1 = 8\\).",
    "Adding the last one, \\(8 + 1 = 9\\).",
    "Thus, Milo received a total of 9 grades.",
    "To find the average grade, I need to divide the total sum of the grades (27) by the number of grades (9).",
    "\\(27 \\div 9 = 3\\).",
    "So, the average grade is 3.",
    "According to the cash reward plan, he will receive $5 times the average grade.",
    "This means he will receive \\(5 \\times 3\\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)."
