  "query": "Jacob loves to build things. In Jacob's toy bin there are 18 red blocks. There are 7 more yellow blocks than red blocks. There are also 14 more blue blocks than red blocks. How many blocks are there in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many yellow blocks there are.",
    "There are 7 more yellow blocks than red blocks. I know there are 18 red blocks.",
    "So, the number of yellow blocks is 18 + 7.",
    "18 + 7 equals 25.",
    "So, there are 25 yellow blocks.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many blue blocks there are.",
    "There are 14 more blue blocks than red blocks. There are 18 red blocks.",
    "So, the number of blue blocks is 18 + 14.",
    "18 + 14 equals 32.",
    "So, there are 32 blue blocks.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of blocks.",
    "I have 18 red blocks, 25 yellow blocks, and 32 blue blocks.",
    "I add these numbers together: 18 + 25 + 32.",
    "18 + 25 is 43.",
    "43 + 32 is 75.",
    "The total number of blocks is 75."
