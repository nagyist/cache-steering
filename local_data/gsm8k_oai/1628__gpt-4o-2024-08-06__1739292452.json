  "query": "TreShawn's mom needs to order pizza for her son and his two friends. She knows that TreShawn always eats 1/2 a pizza. His friend Michael eats 1/3 of a pizza and his other friend LaMar eats 1/6 of a pizza. How many pizzas does she need to order?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how much pizza each person eats individually. TreShawn eats 1/2 of a pizza.",
    "Michael eats 1/3 of a pizza.",
    "LaMar eats 1/6 of a pizza.",
    "To find the total amount of pizza needed, I need to add the fractions 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 together.",
    "To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 3, and 6.",
    "The least common denominator of 2, 3, and 6 is 6.",
    "Convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 6: 1/2 = 3/6.",
    "Convert 1/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6: 1/3 = 2/6.",
    "Since 1/6 already has a denominator of 6, it stays as 1/6.",
    "Now, add the fractions: 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6.",
    "3/6 + 2/6 is 5/6.",
    "5/6 + 1/6 is 6/6.",
    "6/6 is equivalent to 1 whole pizza."
