  "query": "A box holds 2 dozen doughnuts. If the family ate 8 doughnuts, how many doughnuts are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the number of doughnuts in one dozen.",
    "One dozen is equal to 12 items.",
    "Since the box holds 2 dozen doughnuts, I will multiply the number of doughnuts in a dozen by 2.",
    "2 dozen doughnuts equals 2 x 12, which is 24.",
    "The family ate 8 doughnuts.",
    "To find out how many doughnuts are left, I need to subtract the number of doughnuts eaten from the initial total.",
    "I subtract 8 doughnuts from 24 doughnuts.",
    "24 - 8 equals 16."

  "solution": "16"
