  "query": "In Zeoland the fine for speeding is $16 for each mile per hour the driver is traveling over the posted speed limit. In Zeoland, Jed was fined $256 for speeding on a road with a posted speed limit of 50 mph. Jed was fined for traveling at what speed in miles per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles per hour over the speed limit Jed was traveling.",
    "To find that, I will divide the total fine of $256 by the $16 fine per mile over the speed limit.",
    "$256 \u00f7 $16 = 16. So, Jed was traveling 16 miles per hour over the speed limit.",
    "The posted speed limit was 50 mph.",
    "To find Jed's actual speed, I need to add the 16 miles per hour over the speed limit to the posted speed limit of 50 mph.",
    "50 mph + 16 mph = 66 mph."

  "solution": "66"
