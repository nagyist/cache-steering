  "query": "There are 64 seventh graders at a middle school. This is 32% of the students at the school. The sixth graders comprise 38% of the students. How many sixth graders attend middle school?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the seventh graders are 32% of the total students.",
    "There are 64 seventh graders, which represents 32% of the total students.",
    "If 64 students make up 32%, then I can calculate the total number of students by dividing 64 by 32% (or 0.32).",
    "As a formula, it would be: total students = 64 / 0.32.",
    "Alright, doing the division: 64 / 0.32 equals 200.",
    "So, there are 200 total students at the middle school.",
    "Now I need to calculate the number of sixth graders, which is 38% of the total students.",
    "To find the number of sixth graders, I need to calculate 38% of 200.",
    "As a formula, it would be: number of sixth graders = 200 * 0.38.",
    "Doing the multiplication: 200 * 0.38 equals 76."

  "solution": "76"
