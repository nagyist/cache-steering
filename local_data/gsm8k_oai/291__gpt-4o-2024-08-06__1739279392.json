  "query": "Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week she used 20% less. How much fuel did she use in total for the two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week.",
    "Last week, she used 20% less than 15 gallons.",
    "To find 20% of 15 gallons, I need to calculate \\( 0.20 \\times 15 \\).",
    "Doing the multiplication, \\( 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\).",
    "This means last week she used 3 gallons less than 15 gallons.",
    "Subtracting 3 from 15 gives me the amount she used last week: \\( 15 - 3 = 12 \\).",
    "So, last week, she used 12 gallons of fuel.",
    "Now, I need to find the total fuel used over the two weeks.",
    "This is the sum of the fuel used this week and last week: \\( 15 + 12 \\).",
    "Adding the two amounts, \\( 15 + 12 = 27 \\)."

  "solution": "27"
