  "query": "Danny made chocolate cookies for his class and made sure each cookie had exactly 7 chips. He made 4 dozen in total. If the class eats half the cookies, how many chips are left uneaten?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many cookies Danny made.",
    "A dozen is 12, so 4 dozen cookies are equal to 4 x 12 cookies.",
    "4 x 12 = 48 cookies.",
    "Each cookie has 7 chips.",
    "The total number of chips is 48 cookies x 7 chips per cookie.",
    "48 x 7 = 336 chips.",
    "The class eats half of the cookies.",
    "Half of 48 cookies is 48 / 2.",
    "48 / 2 = 24 cookies eaten by the class.",
    "Each eaten cookie also has 7 chips, so the class eats 24 x 7 chips.",
    "24 x 7 = 168 chips eaten by the class.",
    "I need to find the number of chips left uneaten.",
    "Take the total number of chips and subtract the number of chips eaten.",
    "336 total chips - 168 chips eaten = 168 chips left uneaten."

  "solution": "168"
