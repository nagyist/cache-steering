  "query": "Biff is getting ready for a long bus trip. He spends $11 on the ticket, $3 on drinks and snacks, and $16 on a new pair of headphones to listen to music. Biff plans to do online tasks using the bus's WiFi during his trip. If Biff makes $12/hour working online and has to pay $2/hour to access the bus's WiFi, how many hours long will the bus ride need to be for him to break even?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Biff's total expenses. The ticket costs $11.",
    "He spends an additional $3 on drinks and snacks.",
    "He also buys a new pair of headphones for $16.",
    "Adding these costs together, Biff's total expenses are $11 + $3 + $16.",
    "$11 + $3 is $14.",
    "Adding the cost of the headphones, $14 + $16, gives $30.",
    "Biff's total expenses for the trip are $30.",
    "Next, I will calculate Biff's net earnings per hour. He makes $12/hour working online.",
    "He pays $2/hour for WiFi access.",
    "Thus, his net earnings are $12 - $2 per hour.",
    "$12 - $2 is $10.",
    "Biff earns $10 net per hour while using the bus's WiFi for online work.",
    "To break even, Biff needs to earn $30, which matches his total expenses.",
    "To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $30, I need to calculate $30 divided by his hourly net earnings of $10.",
    "$30 \u00f7 $10 equals 3."
