  "query": "Charlotte needs to know how much money to have with her when she goes to the shoe store. How much money should Charlotte bring to buy a pair of boots, if the original price is $90 and there is a discount of 20%?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the amount of money that will be deducted from the original price due to the discount.",
    "The discount is 20% of the original price.",
    "I need to convert the percentage into a decimal to calculate the amount of discount.",
    "20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form.",
    "Now, I calculate 20% of $90 by multiplying $90 by 0.20.",
    "$90 * 0.20 equals $18.",
    "The discount amount is $18.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price Charlotte needs to pay.",
    "I subtract $18 from $90.",
    "$90 - $18 equals $72.",
    "The final price of the boots after applying the discount is $72."
