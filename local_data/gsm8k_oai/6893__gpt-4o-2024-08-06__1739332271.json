  "query": "Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework while Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish it. How many minutes faster did Samuel finish his homework than Sarah?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert Sarah's time from hours to minutes because Samuel's time is already in minutes.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "Sarah took 1.3 hours, so I need to multiply 1.3 by 60 to convert her time to minutes.",
    "1.3 multiplied by 60 equals 78 minutes.",
    "Now, I have Samuel's time as 30 minutes and Sarah's converted time as 78 minutes.",
    "To find out how many minutes faster Samuel finished his homework, I need to subtract Samuel's time from Sarah's time.",
    "78 minutes minus 30 minutes equals 48 minutes."

  "solution": "48"
