  "query": "Betty is planning to host her friends over for a party. She buys drinks, cakes, and ice creams at a unit cost of $2, $10, and $5 respectively. How much does she spend if she buys 10 drinks, 5 cakes, and 100 ice creams?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the drinks Betty buys.",
    "The unit cost of a drink is $2.",
    "Betty buys 10 drinks.",
    "Multiply the number of drinks by the unit cost: 10 drinks * $2/drink = $20.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the cakes Betty buys.",
    "The unit cost of a cake is $10.",
    "Betty buys 5 cakes.",
    "Multiply the number of cakes by the unit cost: 5 cakes * $10/cake = $50.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the ice creams Betty buys.",
    "The unit cost of an ice cream is $5.",
    "Betty buys 100 ice creams.",
    "Multiply the number of ice creams by the unit cost: 100 ice creams * $5/ice cream = $500.",
    "Finally, add up the total costs for drinks, cakes, and ice creams.",
    "Total cost = $20 (drinks) + $50 (cakes) + $500 (ice creams).",
    "Calculate the total: $20 + $50 + $500 = $570."

  "solution": "570"
