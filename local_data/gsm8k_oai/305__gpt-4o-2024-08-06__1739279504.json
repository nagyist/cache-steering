  "query": "Tommy wants to earn enough money to buy 8 new books. Each book costs $5. If Tommy already has $13, how much does he need to save up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the 8 books.",
    "Each book costs $5.",
    "So, the total cost for 8 books is 8 times $5.",
    "8 times $5 equals $40.",
    "Now, I know Tommy needs $40 to buy all 8 books.",
    "Tommy already has $13.",
    "I need to subtract the amount he already has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs.",
    "$40 (total cost) minus $13 (amount Tommy already has) equals $27."
