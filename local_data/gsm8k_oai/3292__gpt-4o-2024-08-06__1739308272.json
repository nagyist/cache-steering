  "query": "A special school for deaf and blind students has a deaf student population three times the size of blind student population. If the number of deaf students is 180, how many students are there altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to interpret the relationship between the number of deaf and blind students.",
    "The problem states that the deaf student population is three times the size of the blind student population.",
    "Let's denote the number of blind students as B.",
    "The number of deaf students is then 3 times the number of blind students, which is 3B.",
    "According to the problem, the number of deaf students is 180.",
    "So, we have the equation 3B = 180.",
    "I need to solve the equation for B, which represents the number of blind students.",
    "To solve for B, I divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "B = 180 / 3",
    "B = 60",
    "Now I know there are 60 blind students.",
    "To find the total number of students, I need to add the number of deaf students and the number of blind students.",
    "The total number of students is 180 (deaf) + 60 (blind).",
    "Thus, the total number of students is 240."

  "solution": "240"
