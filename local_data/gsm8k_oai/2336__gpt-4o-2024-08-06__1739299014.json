  "query": "Latia wants to buy a Samsung TV worth $1700. She works for a delivery service company for a month earning $10 per hour for a 30-hour workweek. How many more hours does she have to work to buy the TV?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Latia earns in a week.",
    "Latia earns $10 per hour.",
    "She works 30 hours per week.",
    "So, her weekly earnings are $10/hour * 30 hours = $300.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how much she earns in a month.",
    "A month is generally 4 weeks.",
    "So, monthly earnings are 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200.",
    "The TV costs $1700.",
    "I need to find out how much more money she needs to buy the TV.",
    "She needs $1700 - $1200 = $500 more.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $500.",
    "At $10 per hour, to earn $500, she needs to work $500 / $10 per hour.",
    "$500 / $10 per hour = 50 hours."

  "solution": "50"
