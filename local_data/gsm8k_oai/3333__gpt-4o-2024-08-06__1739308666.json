  "query": "Roberta started off with 8 vinyl records.  Her friends gave her 12 records for her birthday and she bought 30 more at a garage sale.  It takes her 2 days to listen to 1 record. How many days will it take her to listen to her record collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Roberta started with 8 vinyl records.",
    "Her friends gave her 12 more records.",
    "8 + 12 = 20. Now, Roberta has 20 records.",
    "She bought 30 more records at a garage sale.",
    "20 + 30 = 50. Now, Roberta has a total of 50 records.",
    "It takes her 2 days to listen to 1 record.",
    "To find how many days it will take her to listen to 50 records, I need to multiply the number of records by the number of days it takes per record.",
    "50 records \u00d7 2 days per record = 100 days."
  ],
  "solution": "100"
