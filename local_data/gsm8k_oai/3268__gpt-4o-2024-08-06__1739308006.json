  "query": "Romeo buys five bars of chocolate at $5 each and sells these chocolates for a total of $90. If he uses packaging material that costs him $2 for each bar of chocolate, how much profit does he make for all the chocolates he sells?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the chocolates that Romeo buys.",
    "He buys five bars of chocolate at $5 each.",
    "The total cost of the chocolates is 5 bars * $5 per bar = $25.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the packaging material.",
    "The packaging material costs $2 per bar, and he uses it for 5 bars.",
    "The total cost for the packaging material is 5 bars * $2 per bar = $10.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost for Romeo, which is the sum of the cost of chocolates and the cost of packaging material.",
    "The total cost is $25 (chocolates) + $10 (packaging) = $35.",
    "Next, I calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolates.",
    "Romeo sells the chocolates for a total of $90.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "The profit is $90 (revenue) - $35 (total cost) = $55."
