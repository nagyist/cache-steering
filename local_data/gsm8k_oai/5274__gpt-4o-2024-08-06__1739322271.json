  "query": "Toms car gets 50 miles to the gallon.  He drives 75 miles per day.  If gas is $3 per gallon how much does he spend on gas in 10 days?",
  "steps": [
    "I first determine how many gallons of gas Tom uses per day.",
    "Tom drives 75 miles per day.",
    "His car gets 50 miles per gallon.",
    "To find out how many gallons he uses per day, I divide the miles driven by the miles per gallon: 75 miles / 50 miles per gallon.",
    "75 divided by 50 equals 1.5.",
    "Tom uses 1.5 gallons of gas per day.",
    "Next, I calculate how much he spends on gas per day.",
    "Gas costs $3 per gallon.",
    "If Tom uses 1.5 gallons per day, then he spends 1.5 gallons * $3 per gallon on gas each day.",
    "1.5 * 3 equals $4.50.",
    "Tom spends $4.50 on gas per day.",
    "Finally, I calculate how much he spends on gas over 10 days.",
    "I multiply the daily cost of gas by the number of days: $4.50 per day * 10 days.",
    "4.50 * 10 equals $45.00."

  "solution": "45"
