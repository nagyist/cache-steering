  "query": "A class is completing an art project. Each of the 30 students is assigned to a separate group and will need to take markers from the 22 boxes of markers. The first group has 10 students who will have 2 markers each and the second group has 15 students who will have 4 markers each. The last group takes the remaining markers and divides them equally. If each box of markers contains 5 markers, how many markers does each of the students in the last group receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many markers are in total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of markers per box.",
    "There are 22 boxes of markers, and each box contains 5 markers. So, 22 boxes * 5 markers per box = 110 markers.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many markers the first group of students will need.",
    "The first group has 10 students, and each requires 2 markers. So, 10 students * 2 markers each = 20 markers needed for the first group.",
    "Now, I calculate how many markers the second group of students will need.",
    "The second group has 15 students, and each requires 4 markers. So, 15 students * 4 markers each = 60 markers needed for the second group.",
    "I need to subtract the markers used by the first and second groups from the total number of markers to find out how many markers remain for the last group.",
    "20 markers (first group) + 60 markers (second group) = 80 markers used by the first two groups.",
    "Subtract the 80 markers from the total 110 markers to determine the remaining markers: 110 markers - 80 markers = 30 markers remaining.",
    "The last group will divide the remaining 30 markers equally among its students.",
    "The total number of students is 30; with the first group having 10 and the second group 15, the third group must have 30 - 10 - 15 = 5 students.",
    "Each student in the last group will receive an equal share of the remaining 30 markers.",
    "Divide the 30 remaining markers by the 5 students in the last group: 30 markers / 5 students = 6 markers per student."
