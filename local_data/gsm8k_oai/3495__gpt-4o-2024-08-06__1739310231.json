  "query": "In his first season at Best Hockey's team, Louie scored four goals in the last hockey match of this season. His brother has scored twice as many goals as Louie scored in the last match in each game he's played in each of the three seasons he's been on the team. Each season has 50 games.  What is the total number of goals the brothers have scored between them if, in the previous matches, Louie scored 40 goals?",
  "steps": [
    "Louie scored 4 goals in the last hockey match of this season.",
    "His brother scored twice as many goals as Louie in each game.",
    "Twice as many goals as Louie's last match is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.",
    "His brother scored 8 goals per game.",
    "His brother has played for three seasons, with each season having 50 games.",
    "The total number of games his brother has played is 3 seasons * 50 games = 150 games.",
    "His brother scored 8 goals in each of the 150 games.",
    "So, his brother's total scored goals are 8 goals/game * 150 games = 1200 goals.",
    "In previous matches, Louie scored 40 goals.",
    "Including the last match, Louie's total goals for the season add up to 40 previous + 4 last match = 44 goals.",
    "The total number of goals scored by both brothers is Louie's total + his brother's total.",
    "Louie scored 44 goals and his brother scored 1200 goals.",
    "The total number of goals between them is 44 + 1200 = 1244 goals."
