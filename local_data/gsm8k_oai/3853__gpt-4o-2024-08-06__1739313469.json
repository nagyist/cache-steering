    "First, I need to determine how many slices are in the entire cheesecake.",
    "Each slice of cheesecake contains 350 calories.",
    "The entire cheesecake contains 2800 calories.",
    "I will divide the total calories of the cheesecake by the calories per slice to find the number of slices.",
    "2800 calories \u00f7 350 calories per slice = 8 slices.",
    "Now, I know the cheesecake consists of 8 slices in total.",
    "Kiley ate 25% of the cheesecake.",
    "To find out how many slices Kiley ate, I will calculate 25% of 8 slices.",
    "25% of 8 slices = 0.25 \u00d7 8 = 2 slices.",
    "Kiley ate 2 slices of cheesecake."
