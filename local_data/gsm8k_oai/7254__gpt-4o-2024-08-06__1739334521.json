  "query": "In Henry's collection of music CDs, he has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs but twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs. If he has 23 country CDs, how many classical CDs make up his collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the number of country CDs Henry has, which is given as 23 CDs.",
    "Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs. Let the number of rock CDs be represented as R.",
    "Given that there are 3 more country CDs than rock CDs, we can express this relationship as 23 = R + 3.",
    "Solve for R by subtracting 3 from both sides, which gives us R = 23 - 3.",
    "The calculation results in R = 20. Therefore, Henry has 20 rock CDs.",
    "Henry has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs. Let the number of classical CDs be represented as C.",
    "Expressing the relationship between rock CDs and classical CDs, we have R = 2C.",
    "Substitute the value of R (which is 20) into the equation, giving us 20 = 2C.",
    "Solve for C by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives C = 20 / 2.",
    "The calculation results in C = 10."
