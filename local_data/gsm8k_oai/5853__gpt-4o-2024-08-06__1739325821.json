  "query": "In a fruit salad, there are raspberries, green grapes, and red grapes. There are seven more than 3 times the number of red grapes as green grapes. There are 5 less raspberries than green grapes. If there are 102 pieces of fruit in the salad, how many red grapes are in the salad?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number of green grapes as G.",
    "The number of red grapes is given as seven more than three times the number of green grapes. So, the number of red grapes is 3G + 7.",
    "The number of raspberries is five less than the number of green grapes, so it is G - 5.",
    "The total number of pieces of fruit is the sum of red grapes, green grapes, and raspberries. So, the equation is G + (3G + 7) + (G - 5) = 102.",
    "Simplify the equation: G + 3G + 7 + G - 5 = 102.",
    "Combine like terms: 5G + 2 = 102.",
    "Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for 5G: 5G = 100.",
    "Divide both sides by 5 to find G: G = 20.",
    "Now that we have G = 20, substitute back to find the number of red grapes: 3G + 7 = 3(20) + 7.",
    "Calculate the expression: 3(20) + 7 = 60 + 7 = 67."
