    "First, I need to determine how many kids were dancers.",
    "A fourth of the 140 kids at the junior prom were dancers.",
    "To find a fourth of 140, I'll calculate \\( \\frac{140}{4} \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{140}{4} = 35 \\) dancers.",
    "Now, I know there are 35 dancers among the kids.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of the dancer students did not slow dance.",
    "I know that 25 of the dancers participated in the slow dance.",
    "To find the number of dancers who did not slow dance, I'll subtract the 25 slow dancers from the total number of dancers.",
    "35 dancers - 25 slow dancers = 10 dancers who did not slow dance."
