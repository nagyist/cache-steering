  "query": "A quarterback throws 50 passes in one game.  He throws twice as many passes to the right of the field than he does to the left of the field.  He throws 2 more passes to the center of the field than he did to the left.  How many passes did he throw to the left side of the field?",
  "steps": [
    "Let L represent the number of passes thrown to the left side of the field.",
    "According to the problem, the quarterback throws twice as many passes to the right as to the left. So, the number of passes to the right is 2L.",
    "The problem also states he throws 2 more passes to the center than to the left. Therefore, passes to the center are L + 2.",
    "The total number of passes thrown is 50. We can set up the equation: L (passes to the left) + 2L (passes to the right) + (L + 2) (passes to the center) = 50.",
    "Simplifying the equation: L + 2L + L + 2 = 50.",
    "Combine like terms: 4L + 2 = 50.",
    "Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 4L = 48.",
    "Divide both sides by 4: L = 12."

  "solution": "12"
