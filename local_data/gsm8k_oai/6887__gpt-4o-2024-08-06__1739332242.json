  "query": "Amber buys 7 guppies for her pond.  Several days later, she sees 3 dozen baby guppies swimming around.  Two days after that, she sees 9 more baby guppies.  How many guppies does she have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Amber originally buys 7 guppies for her pond.",
    "Several days later, she sees 3 dozen baby guppies.",
    "1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12.",
    "3 x 12 is 36, so there are 36 baby guppies.",
    "Adding the original guppies and the baby guppies, the total is 7 + 36.",
    "7 + 36 is 43 guppies.",
    "Two days later, Amber sees 9 more baby guppies.",
    "Adding these 9 baby guppies to the current total, we have 43 + 9.",
    "43 + 9 equals 52."

  "solution": "52"
