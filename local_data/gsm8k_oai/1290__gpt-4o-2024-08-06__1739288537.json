  "query": "Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?",
  "steps": [
    "The ratio of blue to green to white paint is given as 1 : 2 : 5.",
    "I need to find out how much paint is used in total.",
    "I know the amount of green paint used is 6 gallons.",
    "The ratio states that for every 2 parts of green paint, there is 1 part blue and 5 parts white.",
    "The ratio 1 : 2 : 5 can be expressed as 1x : 2x : 5x, where x is a common factor.",
    "Since the green paint is 2x, and it's given to be 6 gallons, I can set up the equation 2x = 6.",
    "To solve for x, divide both sides by 2: x = 6 / 2 = 3.",
    "Now, use the value of x to find the amount of each color:",
    "Blue paint is represented as 1x, so it is 1 * 3 = 3 gallons.",
    "Green paint is represented as 2x, which we know is 6 gallons.",
    "White paint is represented as 5x, so it is 5 * 3 = 15 gallons.",
    "To find the total gallons of paint used, add the amount of each color together: 3 (blue) + 6 (green) + 15 (white).",
    "Adding these up: 3 + 6 + 15 = 24 gallons."

  "solution": "24"
