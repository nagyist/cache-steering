  "query": "Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?",
  "steps": [
    "I am given that Lake Michigan has 100 ducks.",
    "The problem states that six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond compared to Lake Michigan.",
    "Twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan would be 2 times 100.",
    "Calculating twice 100 gives me 200.",
    "I now need to add six more ducks to the 200 to find out how many ducks are at North Pond.",
    "200 plus 6 equals 206."

  "solution": "206"
