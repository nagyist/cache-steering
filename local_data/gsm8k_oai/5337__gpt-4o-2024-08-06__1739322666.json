  "query": "Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the variables.",
    "Let E represent the amount of money Evan earned.",
    "According to the problem, Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan.",
    "So, Markese earned E - 5 dollars.",
    "We know that together they earned $37.",
    "So, Evan's earnings plus Markese's earnings equal $37.",
    "That means E + (E - 5) = 37.",
    "Simplify the equation: 2E - 5 = 37.",
    "Add 5 to both sides to get 2E = 42.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for E: E = 21.",
    "Now we know Evan earned $21.",
    "Therefore, Markese earned E - 5 dollars.",
    "Plug in the value of E: Markese earned 21 - 5 dollars.",
    "Calculate Markese's earnings: 21 - 5 = 16."
