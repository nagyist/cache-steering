  "query": "Kiaan is doing home delivery of newspapers in his neighborhood of 200 homes. After an hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5 of the homes. After another 2 hours of working, he realizes he has distributed newspapers to 60 percent of the remaining homes. How many homes does he still need to distribute the newspapers to?",
  "steps": [
    "Kiaan starts with 200 homes in total.",
    "He initially distributes to 2/5 of the homes.",
    "2/5 of 200 homes is calculated as (2/5) * 200 = 80 homes.",
    "So, after an hour of work, Kiaan has distributed to 80 homes.",
    "Next, we find out how many homes are left after distributing to 80 homes.",
    "The remaining homes are 200 - 80 = 120 homes.",
    "Kiaan then distributes to 60 percent of the remaining 120 homes.",
    "60 percent of 120 homes is calculated as (60/100) * 120 = 72 homes.",
    "After distributing to these 72 homes, we need to find out how many homes are still left.",
    "The remaining homes are 120 - 72 = 48 homes."

  "solution": "48"
