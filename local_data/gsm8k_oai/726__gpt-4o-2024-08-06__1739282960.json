  "steps": [
    "We are told that Jed is 10 years older than Matt.",
    "In 10 years, Jed will be 25 years old.",
    "To find Jed's current age, we subtract 10 years from his age in 10 years.",
    "Jed's current age is 25 - 10 = 15 years old.",
    "Since Jed is 10 years older than Matt, we can determine Matt's current age by subtracting 10 years from Jed's current age.",
    "Matt's current age is 15 - 10 = 5 years old.",
    "To find the sum of their present ages, we add Jed's current age and Matt's current age.",
    "The sum of their present ages is 15 + 5 = 20 years."
