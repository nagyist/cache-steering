  "query": "Three fifths of the light bulbs in the kitchen are broken. A third of the light bulbs in the foyer are also broken. If 10 light bulbs in the foyer are broken and there are 35 light bulbs in the kitchen, then how many light bulbs are not broken in both the foyer and kitchen?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the number of light bulbs in the foyer. We know that a third of the light bulbs in the foyer are broken and that the number of broken light bulbs is 10.",
    "If 1/3 of the light bulbs are 10, then to find the total number of foyer light bulbs, we calculate: 3 x 10 = 30.",
    "Now, calculate the number of non-broken light bulbs in the foyer. Since there are 30 total light bulbs in the foyer and 10 are broken, the number of non-broken light bulbs is: 30 - 10 = 20.",
    "Next, let's address the light bulbs in the kitchen. We know that there are 35 light bulbs in the kitchen and three fifths of them are broken.",
    "To find the number of broken light bulbs in the kitchen, calculate: (3/5) x 35 = 21.",
    "Now, calculate the number of non-broken light bulbs in the kitchen: 35 - 21 = 14.",
    "Finally, add the number of non-broken light bulbs in the foyer and the kitchen: 20 + 14.",
    "The total number of non-broken light bulbs in both the foyer and kitchen is 34."
