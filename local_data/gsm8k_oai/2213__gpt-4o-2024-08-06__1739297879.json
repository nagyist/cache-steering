  "query": "Nancy agreed to pay 40% of the cost of her daughter's car insurance, which costs $80 a month. How much will Nancy pay each year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Nancy will pay each month.",
    "The monthly cost of the car insurance is $80, and Nancy agreed to pay 40% of this cost.",
    "To find 40% of $80, I multiply 80 by 0.40.",
    "80 times 0.40 equals $32. So, Nancy pays $32 each month.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Nancy will pay each year.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "I multiply $32 by 12 to find the annual payment.",
    "32 multiplied by 12 equals $384.",
    "So, Nancy will pay $384 each year."
