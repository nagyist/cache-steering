  "query": "A town is trying to clear litter from its streets. The council pays for adding 14 trash cans to the streets and also pays for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores. How many trash cans has the town paid for?",
  "steps": [
    "The council adds 14 trash cans to the streets.",
    "Next, they add twice as many trash cans to the back of stores.",
    "Twice as many as 14 is calculated as 2 times 14.",
    "2 times 14 equals 28.",
    "Therefore, 28 trash cans are added to the back of stores.",
    "Now, add the number of trash cans on the streets to the number of trash cans at the back of stores.",
    "14 (on the streets) plus 28 (at the back of stores) equals 42."

  "solution": "42"
