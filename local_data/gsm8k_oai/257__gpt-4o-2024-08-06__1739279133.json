  "query": "Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each and 30 cupcakes for $2 each. She used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. How much money does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate the total revenue from selling cookies. Hannah sold 40 cookies for $0.8 each.",
    "Multiply 40 by 0.8 to find the total revenue from cookies.",
    "40 * 0.8 = $32",
    "Next, I calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes. Hannah sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each.",
    "Multiply 30 by 2 to find the total revenue from cupcakes.",
    "30 * 2 = $60",
    "I add the revenue from cookies and cupcakes to find the total revenue.",
    "$32 + $60 = $92",
    "Now, I calculate the total cost of the measuring spoons. Hannah bought 2 sets, each costing $6.5.",
    "Multiply 2 by 6.5 to find the total cost of the measuring spoons.",
    "2 * 6.5 = $13",
    "Subtract the total cost of the measuring spoons from the total revenue to find how much money Hannah has left.",
    "$92 - $13 = $79"
