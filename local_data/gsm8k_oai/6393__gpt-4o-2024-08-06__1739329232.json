  "query": "Alex has not washed his clothes for a month; 18 shirts, 12 pants, 17 sweaters, and 13 jeans are waiting to be washed. Alex's washing machine can wash a maximum of 15 items per cycle. Each cycle takes 45 minutes. How many hours will it take the washing machine to wash all the clothes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many items in total Alex has to wash.",
    "Alex has 18 shirts, 12 pants, 17 sweaters, and 13 jeans.",
    "I will add these numbers together: 18 + 12 + 17 + 13 = 60.",
    "So, Alex has 60 items to wash in total.",
    "The washing machine can wash 15 items per cycle.",
    "I need to calculate how many cycles are required to wash all 60 items.",
    "I will divide the total number of items by the number of items per cycle: 60 / 15 = 4.",
    "This means that Alex needs 4 cycles to wash all the clothes.",
    "Each cycle takes 45 minutes.",
    "I will now multiply the number of cycles by the duration of each cycle to find the total washing time in minutes: 4 cycles * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.",
    "I need to convert the total washing time from minutes to hours.",
    "Since 60 minutes make an hour, I will divide 180 minutes by 60: 180 / 60 = 3."
