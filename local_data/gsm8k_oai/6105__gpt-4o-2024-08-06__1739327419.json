  "query": "A town council began the decade by planting cherry trees around the neighborhood to make the neighborhood look more welcoming. By the end of the decade, they have planted twice as many cherry trees as they originally planned and have now realized that falling cherry blossom leaves are causing a problem. Each tree drops 100 leaves each during the fall. If the town council originally intended to plant 7 cherry trees, how many leaves now fall from the trees?",
  "steps": [
    "The town council originally planned to plant 7 cherry trees.",
    "By the end of the decade, they have planted twice as many cherry trees as they originally planned.",
    "Twice the originally planned number of trees is 2 times 7.",
    "2 times 7 equals 14.",
    "The town council has planted 14 cherry trees.",
    "Each tree drops 100 leaves during the fall.",
    "14 trees each dropping 100 leaves results in total leaves falling = 14 times 100.",
    "14 times 100 equals 1400."

  "solution": "1400"
