  "query": "Jeff decides to install more cabinets in his kitchen.  He currently has 3 cabinets over one counter and no other cabinets.  He installs twice as many cabinets over 3 different counters each.  He then installs 5 more cabinets.  How many total cabinets does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeff starts with 3 cabinets over one counter.",
    "He installs twice as many cabinets over 3 different counters. Since he started with 3 cabinets, twice 3 equals 6 cabinets.",
    "Therefore, he installs 6 cabinets over each of the 3 different counters.",
    "6 cabinets per counter for 3 counters is 6 * 3 = 18 cabinets.",
    "Next, Jeff installs 5 more cabinets.",
    "To find the total number of cabinets, we add the original 3 cabinets to the 18 cabinets installed over the counters to get 3 + 18 = 21.",
    "Then, add the 5 additional cabinets he installs, giving us 21 + 5 = 26."
  ],
  "solution": "26"
