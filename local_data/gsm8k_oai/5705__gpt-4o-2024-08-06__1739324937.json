    "Kiki spends 60% of her money on hats when she buys twice as many hats as scarves. Therefore, she spends 40% of her money on scarves.",
    "Kiki currently has $90. I need to calculate how much money she spends on scarves.",

    "Kiki spends $36 on scarves. Each scarf costs $2.",
    "I need to find out how many scarves Kiki can buy with $36.",
    "I divide the total amount Kiki spends on scarves by the cost of one scarf: \\[ \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]."
