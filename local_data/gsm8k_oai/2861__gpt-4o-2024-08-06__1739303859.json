  "query": "The Giants baseball team is trying to make their league playoff. They have played 20 games and won 12 of them. To make the playoffs, they need to win 2/3 of their games over the season. If there are 10 games left, how many do they have to win to make the playoffs?",
  "steps": [
    "The Giants have played 20 games and won 12 of them.",
    "They have 10 games left to play this season.",
    "The total number of games they will play in the season is 20 (played) + 10 (remaining) = 30 games.",
    "To make the playoffs, they need to win 2/3 of their total games. Therefore, they need to win 2/3 of 30 games.",
    "Calculate 2/3 of 30: \n(2/3) * 30 = 20.",
    "They need to win 20 games in total to make the playoffs.",
    "The Giants have already won 12 games.",
    "To find out how many more games they need to win, subtract the games they've already won from the total needed: \n20 (total needed) - 12 (already won) = 8."
