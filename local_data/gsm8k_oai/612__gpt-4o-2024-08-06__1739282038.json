  "query": "Ali is collecting bottle caps. He has 125 bottle caps. He has red ones and green ones. If he has 50 red caps, what percentage of caps are green?",
  "steps": [
    "Ali has a total of 125 bottle caps.",
    "He has 50 red bottle caps.",
    "To find out how many caps are green, I subtract the number of red caps from the total number of caps: 125 - 50.",
    "125 - 50 equals 75.",
    "Therefore, Ali has 75 green bottle caps.",
    "To find the percentage of caps that are green, I will divide the number of green caps by the total number of caps and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.",
    "Number of green caps is 75, and the total number of caps is 125.",
    "75 divided by 125 equals 0.6.",
    "0.6 multiplied by 100 equals 60.",
    "The percentage of caps that are green is 60%."

  "solution": "60"
