    "Winwin won $50 in the lottery.",
    "First, I need to calculate the tax amount which is 20% of her winnings.",
    "20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50.",

    "Winwin paid $10 as tax.",
    "Next, I need to account for the $5 processing fee.",
    "Subtract the $10 tax from the original $50.",

    "$40 - $5 equals $35.",
