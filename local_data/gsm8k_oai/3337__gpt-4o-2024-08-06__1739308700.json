  "query": "Bill and Ted went into the forest to gather some wild mushrooms. Bill gathered 12 red mushrooms and 6 brown mushrooms.  Ted gathered 14 green mushrooms and 6 blue mushrooms.  If half of the blue mushrooms, two-thirds of the red mushrooms, and all of the brown mushrooms have white spots, how many white-spotted mushrooms did they gather?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of each type of mushroom gathered by Bill and Ted have white spots.",
    "I\u2019ll start with the red mushrooms gathered by Bill. He gathered 12 red mushrooms.",
    "According to the problem, two-thirds of the red mushrooms have white spots.",
    "Calculating two-thirds of 12: (2/3) * 12 = 8. So, 8 red mushrooms have white spots.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll consider the brown mushrooms gathered by Bill. He gathered 6 brown mushrooms.",
    "The problem states that all brown mushrooms have white spots.",
    "So, all 6 brown mushrooms have white spots.",
    "Now, I move on to the blue mushrooms gathered by Ted. He gathered 6 blue mushrooms.",
    "The problem states that half of the blue mushrooms have white spots.",
    "Calculating half of 6: 6/2 = 3. So, 3 blue mushrooms have white spots.",
    "All green mushrooms are not mentioned to have white spots, so they have none.",
    "Now, I sum up all the white-spotted mushrooms: 8 (red with spots) + 6 (brown with spots) + 3 (blue with spots) = 17."

  "solution": "17"
