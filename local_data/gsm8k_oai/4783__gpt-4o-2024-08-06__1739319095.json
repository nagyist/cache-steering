  "query": "Ryan is considering buying a new multivitamin brand.  Each pill has 50 mg of Vitamin A in it.  The recommended daily serving of Vitamin A is 200 mg.  How many pills does Ryan need to hit the recommended amount for the week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Vitamin A Ryan needs per day. The recommended daily serving is 200 mg.",
    "Each pill provides 50 mg of Vitamin A.",
    "To find out how many pills Ryan needs per day to reach 200 mg, I need to divide 200 mg by the 50 mg provided by each pill.",
    "200 mg / 50 mg = 4 pills. Ryan needs 4 pills per day to meet the recommended daily amount.",
    "Now, to find out how many pills Ryan needs for a week, I need to multiply the daily amount of pills by 7 (the number of days in a week).",
    "4 pills/day * 7 days = 28 pills."

  "solution": "28"
