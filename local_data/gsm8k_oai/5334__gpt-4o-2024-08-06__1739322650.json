  "query": "Judy uses 10 pencils during her 5 day school week. A 30 pack of pencils costs $4. How much will she spend on pencils over 45 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Judy uses 10 pencils in 5 days.",
    "First, I need to find out how many pencils Judy uses in one day.",
    "To do that, I'll divide the number of pencils she uses in 5 days by 5.",
    "10 pencils divided by 5 days is 2 pencils per day.",
    "Next, I'll determine how many pencils Judy will use in 45 days.",
    "I'll multiply 2 pencils per day by 45 days.",
    "2 pencils per day times 45 days equals 90 pencils.",
    "A 30 pack of pencils costs $4.",
    "I need to find out how many 30 packs are required for 90 pencils.",
    "I'll divide the total number of pencils needed by the number of pencils in one pack.",
    "90 pencils divided by 30 pencils per pack equals 3 packs.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total cost for 3 packs of pencils.",
    "Each pack costs $4, so 3 packs will cost 3 multiplied by $4.",
    "3 multiplied by $4 is $12."

  "solution": "12"
