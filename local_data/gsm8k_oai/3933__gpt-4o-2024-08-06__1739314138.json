  "query": "Burt spent $2.00 on a packet of basil seeds and $8.00 on potting soil.  The packet of seeds yielded 20 basil plants.  He sells each basil plant for $5.00 at the local farmer's market.  What is the net profit from his basil plants?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost Burt spent on basil seeds and potting soil.",
    "Burt spent $2.00 on basil seeds.",
    "Burt also spent $8.00 on potting soil.",
    "The total cost is the sum of the cost of seeds and soil.",
    "Total cost = $2.00 (seeds) + $8.00 (soil) = $10.00",
    "Next, I need to find out the revenue Burt makes from selling the basil plants.",
    "The packet of seeds yields 20 basil plants.",
    "Burt sells each basil plant for $5.00.",
    "To find the total revenue, multiply the number of plants by the selling price per plant.",
    "Total revenue = 20 plants * $5.00/plant = $100.00",
    "To find the net profit, I subtract the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost",
    "Net profit = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00"
  ],
  "solution": "90"
