  "query": "A bear eats up to 90 pounds of food per day to prepare for hibernation. If Victor weighs 126 pounds, how many \"Victors\" worth of food would a bear eat in 3 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much food the bear eats in one day.",
    "The bear eats up to 90 pounds of food per day.",
    "Next, I calculate how much food the bear eats in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so 90 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 630 pounds/week.",
    "Now, I calculate how much food the bear eats in 3 weeks.",
    "630 pounds/week * 3 weeks = 1890 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many Victor's worth of food this is.",
    "Victor weighs 126 pounds.",
    "I divide the total pounds of food by Victor's weight to find out how many \"Victors\" worth of food the bear eats.",
    "1890 pounds / 126 pounds/Victor = 15 Victors."

  "solution": "15"
