  "query": "There are 70 cookies in a jar. If there are only 28 cookies left after a week, and Paul took out the same amount each day, how many cookies did he take out in four days?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by finding the total number of cookies removed from the jar.",
    "Initially, there were 70 cookies, and now there are 28 cookies.",
    "Calculate the total number of cookies removed: 70 - 28 = 42 cookies.",
    "Paul took out the same amount every day for a week (7 days).",
    "To find out how many cookies Paul took out each day, divide the total cookies removed by the number of days: 42 cookies / 7 days.",
    "42 divided by 7 equals 6. So, Paul took out 6 cookies each day.",
    "Now, calculate how many cookies he took out in four days by multiplying the daily amount by 4.",
    "Multiply 6 (cookies per day) by 4 (days): 6 * 4 = 24."
