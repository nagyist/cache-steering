  "query": "If Billy rode his bike 17 times, John rode his bike twice as many times, and their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John, how many times did they ride their bikes in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times John rode his bike.",
    "According to the problem, John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy.",
    "Billy rode his bike 17 times.",
    "Therefore, John rode his bike 2 times 17, which is 34 times.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times their mother rode her bike.",
    "The problem states that their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John.",
    "John rode his bike 34 times.",
    "So, their mother rode 34 + 10 times, which is 44 times.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of times all three of them rode their bikes.",
    "Billy rode 17 times, John rode 34 times, and their mother rode 44 times.",
    "I add these numbers together: 17 + 34 + 44.",
    "17 + 34 equals 51.",
    "Now, I add 51 + 44.",
    "51 + 44 equals 95."

  "solution": "95"
