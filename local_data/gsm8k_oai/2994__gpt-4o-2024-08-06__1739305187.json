  "query": "Nadine's dog rolls around in the mud. She spends 10 minutes hosing him off outside, then shampoos him three times, which takes 15 minutes per shampoo. How long does she spend cleaning her dog total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the initial time Nadine spends on hosing off her dog. She spends 10 minutes on this activity.",
    "Next, I will calculate the time she spends shampooing her dog. She shampoos the dog three times, and each time takes 15 minutes.",
    "To find the total time spent shampooing, I multiply the number of shampoo sessions (3) by the minutes per session (15).",
    "3 times 15 is 45 minutes.",
    "I now need to add the hosing time to the shampooing time to find the total cleaning time.",
    "The hosing time is 10 minutes, and the shampooing time is 45 minutes.",
    "Adding these together, 10 minutes plus 45 minutes equals 55 minutes."
