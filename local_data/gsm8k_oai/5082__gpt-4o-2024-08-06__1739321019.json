  "query": "Lauren's social media channel makes $0.50 for every commercial that's viewed and $1.00 for every person who subscribes.  On Tuesday, 100 people watched commercials before viewing her content and 27 people subscribed.  How much money did she make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Lauren made from commercials.",
    "She made $0.50 for each commercial viewed.",
    "100 people watched commercials before viewing her content.",
    "So, the total income from commercials is 100 multiplied by $0.50.",
    "100 multiplied by $0.50 equals $50.00.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money Lauren made from subscriptions.",
    "She made $1.00 for each subscription.",
    "27 people subscribed to her channel.",
    "So, the total income from subscriptions is 27 multiplied by $1.00.",
    "27 multiplied by $1.00 equals $27.00.",
    "Now, I need to find the total money Lauren made.",
    "I will add the income from commercials and the income from subscriptions.",
    "$50.00 from commercials plus $27.00 from subscriptions equals $77.00."
