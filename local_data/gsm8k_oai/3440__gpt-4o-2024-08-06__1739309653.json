  "query": "Mica went to the grocery store and bought 2 kilograms of pasta that costs $1.5; 1/4 kilogram of ground beef costs $8 for 1 kilogram; two jars of pasta sauce costs $2 per jar. Mica also wants to buy a $6 Quesadilla for snacks.  How much money should she have with her to buy all those?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of the pasta.",
    "She bought 2 kilograms of pasta.",
    "The cost of 1 kilogram of pasta is $1.5.",
    "So, 2 kilograms will cost 2 x $1.5.",
    "Calculating the cost: 2 x $1.5 = $3.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the ground beef.",
    "She bought 1/4 kilogram of ground beef.",
    "The cost of 1 kilogram of ground beef is $8.",
    "So, 1/4 kilogram will cost 1/4 x $8.",
    "Calculating the cost: 1/4 x $8 = $2.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the pasta sauce.",
    "She bought two jars of pasta sauce.",
    "The cost of one jar of pasta sauce is $2.",
    "So, two jars will cost 2 x $2.",
    "Calculating the cost: 2 x $2 = $4.",
    "She also wants to buy a Quesadilla for $6.",
    "I need to sum all these costs to find the total amount of money she should have.",
    "Summing the costs: $3 + $2 + $4 + $6.",
    "Calculating the total: $3 + $2 = $5; $5 + $4 = $9; $9 + $6 = $15."
