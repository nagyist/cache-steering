  "query": "Bruce's aunt gave him $71 to spend on clothes at the mall. He bought 5 shirts that cost $5 each and a pair of pants that cost $26. How much money does Bruce have left to buy more clothes?",
  "steps": [
    "Bruce starts with $71.",
    "Bruce bought 5 shirts, each costing $5.",
    "To find the total cost of the shirts, multiply 5 shirts by $5 per shirt.",
    "5 shirts x $5 = $25",
    "Bruce spent $25 on the shirts.",
    "Next, Bruce buys a pair of pants for $26.",
    "Bruce's total spending so far is the sum of the cost of the shirts and the pants.",
    "Total cost = $25 (shirts) + $26 (pants) = $51",
    "To find out how much money Bruce has left, subtract his total spending from the amount he started with.",
    "$71 (initial amount) - $51 (total spending) = $20",
    "Bruce has $20 left to buy more clothes."
