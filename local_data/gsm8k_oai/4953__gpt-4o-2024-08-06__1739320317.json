  "query": "A supplier is packing cartons of canned juice. Each carton has 20 cans of juice. Out of the 50 cartons that have been packed, only 40 cartons have been loaded on a truck. How many cans of juice are left to be loaded on the truck?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cartons have not been loaded onto the truck.",
    "Out of the 50 cartons packed, 40 cartons have been loaded.",
    "To find the number of cartons left, I subtract the number of loaded cartons from the total cartons packed: 50 - 40.",
    "50 - 40 equals 10 cartons that have not been loaded onto the truck.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many cans of juice there are in these 10 cartons.",
    "Each carton contains 20 cans of juice.",
    "To find the total number of cans in the remaining cartons, I multiply the number of remaining cartons by the number of cans per carton: 10 x 20.",
    "10 x 20 equals 200 cans."

  "solution": "200"
