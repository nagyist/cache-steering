  "query": "Jeff had 300 pencils and donated 30% of them. Vicki had twice as many pencils as Jeff and donated 3/4 of his pencils. How many pencils are there remaining altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeff starts with 300 pencils.",
    "Jeff donates 30% of his 300 pencils.",
    "To calculate 30% of 300, I multiply 300 by 0.3.",
    "300 multiplied by 0.3 is 90.",
    "Jeff donates 90 pencils, so I subtract 90 from his original 300 pencils.",
    "300 minus 90 equals 210. So, Jeff has 210 pencils remaining.",
    "Vicki has twice as many pencils as Jeff originally had. So, I multiply Jeff's 300 pencils by 2.",
    "300 multiplied by 2 is 600. So, Vicki originally has 600 pencils.",
    "Vicki donates 3/4 of her pencils.",
    "To calculate 3/4 of 600, I multiply 600 by 0.75.",
    "600 multiplied by 0.75 is 450.",
    "Vicki donates 450 pencils, so I subtract 450 from her original 600 pencils.",
    "600 minus 450 equals 150. So, Vicki has 150 pencils remaining.",
    "To find the total number of pencils remaining altogether, I add the pencils Jeff and Vicki have remaining.",
    "Jeff has 210 pencils remaining, and Vicki has 150 pencils remaining.",
    "210 plus 150 equals 360."
