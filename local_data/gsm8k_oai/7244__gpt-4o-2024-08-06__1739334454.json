  "query": "A tailor purchased buttons for the clothes. She bought 90 green buttons, 10 more yellow buttons than the green buttons, and 5 fewer blue buttons than the green buttons. How many buttons did the tailor purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of green buttons the tailor bought. This is given as 90 green buttons.",
    "Next, determine the number of yellow buttons. It is stated that there are 10 more yellow buttons than green buttons.",
    "Calculate the number of yellow buttons by adding 10 to the number of green buttons: 90 + 10 = 100 yellow buttons.",
    "Then, find out how many blue buttons there are. It is stated that there are 5 fewer blue buttons than green buttons.",
    "Calculate the number of blue buttons by subtracting 5 from the number of green buttons: 90 - 5 = 85 blue buttons.",
    "Now, add the number of green, yellow, and blue buttons to find the total number of buttons purchased.",
    "Sum up all the buttons: 90 (green) + 100 (yellow) + 85 (blue) = 275 buttons."
