  "query": "Brittney can chop 15 onions in 5 minutes. Carl can chop 20 onions within that same time. How many more onions can Carl chop in 30 minutes than Brittney?",
  "steps": [
    "First, find Brittney's onion chopping rate per minute. She can chop 15 onions in 5 minutes.",
    "Brittney's rate is 15 onions / 5 minutes = 3 onions per minute.",
    "Next, calculate how many onions Brittney can chop in 30 minutes.",
    "In 30 minutes, Brittney can chop 3 onions/minute * 30 minutes = 90 onions.",
    "Now, find Carl's onion chopping rate per minute. He can chop 20 onions in 5 minutes.",
    "Carl's rate is 20 onions / 5 minutes = 4 onions per minute.",
    "Calculate how many onions Carl can chop in 30 minutes.",
    "In 30 minutes, Carl can chop 4 onions/minute * 30 minutes = 120 onions.",
    "To find how many more onions Carl can chop than Brittney in 30 minutes, subtract the number of onions Brittney can chop from the number Carl can chop.",
    "The difference is 120 onions - 90 onions = 30 onions."
