  "query": "Jaco wants to buy Christmas gifts for his 8 friends that are worth $9 each.  Also, he wants to buy gifts for his mother and father that are of the same amount. He has a $100 budget to buy all gifts. How much is Jaco's budget for each of his mother and father's gift?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Jaco will spend on gifts for his 8 friends.",
    "Each gift for his friends costs $9.",
    "So, $9 times 8 friends equals $72.",
    "Now, I know that Jaco will spend $72 on gifts for his friends.",
    "Jaco wants to buy gifts for his mother and father too.",
    "He has a total budget of $100.",
    "I need to calculate how much money is left for his mother and father\u2019s gifts.",
    "I subtract the $72 spent on friends from the $100 total budget.",
    "$100 minus $72 equals $28.",
    "This means Jaco has $28 left for gifts for his mother and father.",
    "He wants to spend the same amount on each of his parents.",
    "To find out how much he can spend on each, I divide $28 by 2.",
    "$28 divided by 2 equals $14."
