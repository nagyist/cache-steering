  "query": "Hugo's mountain has an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level.  Boris' mountain has an elevation that is 2,500 feet shorter than  Hugo's mountain.  If Hugo climbed his mountain 3 times, how many times would Boris need to climb his mountain to have climbed the same number of feet as Hugo?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the elevation of Boris' mountain.",
    "Hugo's mountain is 10,000 feet tall. Boris' mountain is 2,500 feet shorter.",
    "To find the height of Boris' mountain, I subtract 2,500 from 10,000.",
    "10,000 - 2,500 equals 7,500 feet.",
    "Boris' mountain is 7,500 feet tall.",
    "Next, I determine the total number of feet Hugo has climbed by climbing his mountain 3 times.",
    "Hugo climbs 10,000 feet each time he climbs his mountain.",
    "If he climbs it 3 times, that means he climbs 10,000 * 3 feet.",
    "10,000 * 3 equals 30,000 feet.",
    "Hugo climbs a total of 30,000 feet.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many times Boris would need to climb his mountain to reach 30,000 feet.",
    "Boris climbs 7,500 feet each time he climbs his mountain.",
    "I'll set up an equation: 7,500 times the number of climbs equals 30,000 feet.",
    "To find the number of climbs, I divide 30,000 by 7,500.",
    "30,000 divided by 7,500 equals 4.",
    "Boris would need to climb his mountain 4 times."
