  "query": "Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months. During that time, Chris got sick for one week and Cathy took her shifts. If there are four weeks in a month, how many hours did Cathy work during the 2 months?",
  "steps": [
    "Cathy was scheduled to work 20 hours per week.",
    "There are 4 weeks in a month, so in one month Cathy works 20 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 hours/month.",
    "The job period is for 2 months.",
    "Cathy would work normally for 2 months: 80 hours/month * 2 months = 160 hours.",
    "Chris was also scheduled to work 20 hours per week.",
    "Chris got sick for one week, meaning Cathy took Chris's shifts that week.",
    "In the week Chris got sick, Cathy worked an additional 20 hours.",
    "Add the additional hours Cathy worked for Chris: 160 hours (regular) + 20 hours (extra) = 180 hours."

  "solution": "180"
