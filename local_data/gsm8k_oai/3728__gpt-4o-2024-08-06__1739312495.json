  "query": "Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers.",
    "It takes Marcus 20 minutes to saute the onions, and it takes a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers.",
    "A quarter of 20 minutes is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.",
    "Therefore, it takes Marcus 5 minutes to saute the garlic and peppers.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time spent sauteing.",
    "Marcus spends 20 minutes on the onions and 5 minutes on the garlic and peppers.",
    "The total time sauteing is 20 + 5 = 25 minutes.",
    "Next, I will calculate the time it takes Marcus to let the dough rest.",
    "It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough.",
    "It takes twice as long to let it rest, so it takes 30 * 2 = 60 minutes to let the dough rest.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time spent on kneading and resting the dough.",
    "The kneading time is 30 minutes, and the resting time is 60 minutes.",
    "The total time for kneading and resting is 30 + 60 = 90 minutes.",
    "Next, I will calculate the time it takes to assemble the calzones.",
    "It takes 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones.",
    "The combined kneading and resting time is 90 minutes.",
    "1/10th of 90 minutes is 90 / 10 = 9 minutes.",
    "Therefore, it takes 9 minutes to assemble the calzones.",
    "Finally, I will add up all the time spent on the calzones.",
    "The total sauteing time is 25 minutes, the total kneading and resting time is 90 minutes, and the assembling time is 9 minutes.",
    "Adding these together, the total time is 25 + 90 + 9 = 124 minutes."
