  "query": "Jack and Jill are friends who borrow from each other often. Last week Jack borrowed  $1200 from Jill, which he promised to pay back with an interest of 10%. How much will Jack pay back?",
  "steps": [
    "Jack borrowed $1200 from Jill.",
    "He promised to pay back this amount with an interest of 10%.",
    "To find the interest amount, calculate 10% of $1200.",
    "10% of $1200 is calculated as (10/100) * 1200.",
    "(10/100) * 1200 = 120.",
    "So, the interest amount is $120.",
    "Now, add the interest amount to the original borrowed amount to find the total repayment.",
    "The total repayment is $1200 + $120.",
    "$1200 + $120 = $1320."
