  "query": "Mr. Connell harvested 60 apples from his apple tree and 3 times as many peaches from his peach tree. What is the difference between the number of the two fruits?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many peaches Mr. Connell harvested.",
    "Mr. Connell harvested 3 times as many peaches as apples.",
    "He harvested 60 apples.",
    "3 times 60 apples is 180.",
    "So, Mr. Connell harvested 180 peaches.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference between the number of peaches and apples.",
    "There are 180 peaches and 60 apples.",
    "The difference is 180 - 60.",
    "180 - 60 equals 120."
