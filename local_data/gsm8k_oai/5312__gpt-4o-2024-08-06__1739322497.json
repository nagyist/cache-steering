  "query": "Kekai's family is having a garage sale. Kekai sells 5 shirts and 5 pairs of pants. Each shirt sells for $1, and each pair of pants sells for $3. If Kekai gives his parents half of the money he earns from selling his clothes, how much money does Kekai have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total earnings from selling both the shirts and the pants.",
    "Kekai sells 5 shirts, and each shirt sells for $1. Therefore, the earnings from the shirts are 5 shirts * $1/shirt = $5.",
    "Kekai also sells 5 pairs of pants, and each pair sells for $3. Therefore, the earnings from the pants are 5 pairs * $3/pair = $15.",
    "Now, I add the earnings from the shirts and the pants together to find the total earnings: $5 (from shirts) + $15 (from pants) = $20.",
    "Kekai gives his parents half of his total earnings. Half of $20 is $20 / 2 = $10.",
    "The amount of money Kekai has left is the total earnings minus the money given to his parents: $20 - $10 = $10."

  "solution": "10"
