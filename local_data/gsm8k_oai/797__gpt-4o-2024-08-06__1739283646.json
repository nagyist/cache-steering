  "query": "Hannah has three dogs. The first dog eats 1.5 cups of dog food a day. The second dog eats twice as much while the third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog. How many cups of dog food should Hannah prepare in a day for her three dogs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note the amount of food each dog eats per day.",
    "The first dog eats 1.5 cups of food per day.",
    "The second dog eats twice as much as the first dog.",
    "To find how much the second dog eats, I multiply the first dog's amount by 2: 1.5 cups * 2 = 3 cups.",
    "The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog.",
    "To find the amount the third dog eats, I add 2.5 cups to the second dog's amount: 3 cups + 2.5 cups = 5.5 cups.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of food for all three dogs.",
    "Adding all the amounts together: 1.5 cups + 3 cups + 5.5 cups.",
    "First, I add 1.5 + 3 which equals 4.5.",
    "Then I add 4.5 + 5.5 which equals 10."

  "solution": "10"
