  "query": "Anna used four baking trays to bake cupcakes. Each tray has 20 cupcakes and each cupcake was then sold for $2. If only 3/5 of the cupcakes were sold and the rest were kept, how much did Anna earn from it?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of cupcakes baked.",
    "Each tray has 20 cupcakes, and there are 4 trays.",
    "Total cupcakes = 4 trays * 20 cupcakes/tray.",
    "Total cupcakes = 80 cupcakes.",
    "Anna sold 3/5 of the cupcakes.",
    "To find out how many cupcakes she sold, I'll calculate 3/5 of 80.",
    "(3/5) * 80 = 48 cupcakes.",
    "Now, to find the total earnings, I need to multiply the number of cupcakes sold by the price per cupcake.",
    "Each cupcake is sold for $2.",
    "Total earnings = 48 cupcakes * $2/cupcake.",
    "Total earnings = $96."
