  "query": "Yesterday Ryan got five books from the library. They were a total of 2100 pages. His brother got one book a day that was 200 pages each. They both finished them in a week. On average, how many more pages per day did Ryan read compared to his brother?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pages Ryan read in a week.",
    "Ryan got a total of 2100 pages to read.",
    "He finished reading these 2100 pages in 7 days.",
    "To find the number of pages Ryan read per day, I divide 2100 pages by 7 days.",
    "2100 divided by 7 equals 300.",
    "Ryan read 300 pages per day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pages Ryan's brother read in a week.",
    "His brother got one book a day for 7 days, each with 200 pages.",
    "The total number of pages Ryan's brother read is 200 pages per day times 7 days.",
    "200 multiplied by 7 equals 1400.",
    "Ryan's brother read 1400 pages in total.",
    "To find the number of pages Ryan's brother read per day, I divide 1400 pages by 7 days.",
    "1400 divided by 7 equals 200.",
    "Ryan's brother read 200 pages per day.",
    "To find how many more pages per day Ryan read compared to his brother, I subtract the pages his brother read per day from the pages Ryan read per day.",
    "300 pages per day minus 200 pages per day equals 100.",
    "Ryan read 100 more pages per day compared to his brother."
