  "query": "Tanesha needs to buy rope so cut into 10 pieces that are each six inches long. She sees a 6-foot length of rope that cost $5 and also sees 1-foot lengths of rope that cost $1.25 each. What is the least she has to spend to get the rope she needs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total length of rope Tanesha needs.",
    "Each piece of rope needs to be 6 inches long, and she needs 10 pieces.",
    "10 pieces * 6 inches each = 60 inches total.",
    "Next, I need to find the equivalent length in feet since the rope is sold by the foot.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot.",
    "60 inches / 12 inches per foot = 5 feet of rope needed.",
    "Now, I should compare the cost options.",
    "A 6-foot length of rope costs $5.",
    "Buying the 6-foot length will give Tanesha 6 feet of rope, which covers the 5 feet she needs.",
    "1-foot lengths cost $1.25 each.",
    "To get 5 feet of rope using 1-foot lengths, she would spend 5 * $1.25 = $6.25.",
    "Comparing options, $5 for 6 feet is cheaper than $6.25 for 5 feet.",
    "Therefore, the least she has to spend is $5."
