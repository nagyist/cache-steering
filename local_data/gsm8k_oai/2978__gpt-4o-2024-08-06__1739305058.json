  "query": "James buys 3 shirts for $60.  There is a 40% off sale.  How much did he pay per shirt after the discount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total initial cost of the shirts before considering the discount. James buys 3 shirts for a total cost of $60.",
    "Next, I calculate the original price per shirt. I do this by dividing the total cost by the number of shirts: $60 divided by 3.",
    "$60 divided by 3 is $20, so the original price per shirt is $20.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the discount amount on each shirt. The discount is 40% of the original price.",
    "40% of $20 is calculated by multiplying $20 by 0.40.",
    "$20 multiplied by 0.40 is $8. So, the discount amount is $8 per shirt.",
    "To find the discounted price per shirt, I subtract the discount amount from the original price per shirt.",
    "$20 minus $8 equals $12.",
    "Thus, the cost per shirt after the discount is $12."

  "solution": "12"
