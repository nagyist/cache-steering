  "query": "A boat carrying 20 sheep, 10 cows and 14 dogs capsized.  3 of the sheep drowned.  Twice as many cows drowned as did sheep.  All of the dogs made it to shore.  How many total animals made it to the shore?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sheep made it to the shore. I start with 20 sheep, and 3 drowned.",
    "The number of sheep that made it to the shore is 20 - 3 = 17.",
    "Next, I determine how many cows drowned. Twice as many cows drowned as sheep.",
    "Since 3 sheep drowned, twice that amount is 3 * 2 = 6 cows drowned.",
    "Initially, there were 10 cows. Therefore, the number of cows that made it to the shore is 10 - 6 = 4.",
    "All of the dogs made it to the shore, so all 14 dogs were safe.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of animals that made it to the shore by adding the sheep, cows, and dogs.",
    "The total number of animals that made it to the shore is 17 (sheep) + 4 (cows) + 14 (dogs).",
    "Adding these numbers gives 17 + 4 + 14 = 35."
