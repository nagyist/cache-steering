  "query": "Missy has an obedient dog and a stubborn dog. She has to yell at the stubborn dog four times for every one time she yells at the obedient dog. If she yells at the obedient dog 12 times, how many times does she yell at both dogs combined?",
  "steps": [
    "Missy yells at the obedient dog 12 times.",
    "She yells at the stubborn dog 4 times for each time she yells at the obedient dog.",
    "If she yells at the obedient dog 12 times, then she will yell at the stubborn dog 4 times that amount.",

    "Now, add the times she yells at both dogs together: 12 for the obedient dog plus 48 for the stubborn dog.",
