  "query": "An adult panda can eat 138 pounds of bamboo each day. A baby panda can eat 50 pounds of bamboo a day.  How many pounds of bamboo will the pandas eat in a week?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find how much bamboo an adult panda eats in a week.",
    "An adult panda eats 138 pounds of bamboo each day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "To find the weekly consumption, I multiply 138 pounds per day by 7 days.",
    "138 * 7 = 966",
    "Therefore, an adult panda eats 966 pounds of bamboo in a week.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much bamboo a baby panda eats in a week.",
    "A baby panda eats 50 pounds of bamboo each day.",
    "Again, there are 7 days in a week.",
    "To find the weekly consumption, I multiply 50 pounds per day by 7 days.",
    "50 * 7 = 350",
    "Therefore, a baby panda eats 350 pounds of bamboo in a week.",
    "The question doesn't specify the number of pandas, so I assume there's one adult and one baby panda.",
    "To find the total bamboo consumed by both pandas in a week, I add the amounts together.",
    "966 (adult) + 350 (baby) = 1316"

  "solution": "1316"
