  "query": "Tenisha had 40 dogs that she kept at home as pets. If 60% of them are female, and 3/4 of the female gives birth to 10 puppies each, calculate the total number of puppies that Tenisha remains with after donating 130 puppies to the church.",
  "steps": [
    "Tenisha had a total of 40 dogs.",
    "60% of the 40 dogs are female.",
    "To find the number of female dogs, calculate 60% of 40.",
    "60% of 40 is calculated as (60/100) * 40 = 24.",
    "Therefore, Tenisha has 24 female dogs.",
    "3/4 of these female dogs give birth to puppies.",
    "To find the number of female dogs that give birth, calculate 3/4 of 24.",
    "3/4 of 24 is (3/4) * 24 = 18.",
    "Each of these 18 female dogs gives birth to 10 puppies.",
    "To find the total number of puppies born, multiply the number of female dogs that give birth by the number of puppies each delivers: 18 * 10 = 180.",
    "So, Tenisha initially has 180 puppies.",
    "Tenisha donates 130 puppies to the church.",
    "To find out how many puppies she remains with, subtract the number of donated puppies from the total born puppies: 180 - 130.",
    "180 - 130 = 50."
