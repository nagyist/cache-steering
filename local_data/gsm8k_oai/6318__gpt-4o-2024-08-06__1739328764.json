  "query": "Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie. If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "Lexie runs a mile in 20 minutes.",
    "Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie.",
    "Since Celia is twice as fast, it takes her half the time to run a mile compared to Lexie.",
    "Half of 20 minutes is 10 minutes.",
    "So, Celia takes 10 minutes to run 1 mile.",
    "We need to find out how long it takes Celia to run 30 miles.",
    "If Celia takes 10 minutes per mile, for 30 miles, she would take 30 times as much time.",
    "Calculating 30 miles times 10 minutes per mile gives us 300 minutes."
