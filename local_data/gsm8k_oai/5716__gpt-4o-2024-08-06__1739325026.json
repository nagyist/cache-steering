  "query": "2 tablespoons of popcorn kernels will make 4 cups of popcorn.  For movie night, Joanie wants 3 cups of popcorn, Mitchell wants 4 cups of popcorn, Miles and Davis said they would split 6 cups of popcorn and Cliff said he would only eat 3 cups.  How many tablespoons of popcorn kernels will they need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cups of popcorn needed.",
    "Joanie wants 3 cups of popcorn.",
    "Mitchell wants 4 cups of popcorn.",
    "Miles and Davis want to split 6 cups of popcorn.",
    "Miles and Davis together need 6 cups of popcorn.",
    "Cliff wants 3 cups of popcorn.",
    "To find the total, I add up all the individual amounts: 3 (Joanie) + 4 (Mitchell) + 6 (Miles and Davis) + 3 (Cliff).",
    "The total cups of popcorn needed is 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 16 cups.",
    "I know that 2 tablespoons of popcorn kernels make 4 cups of popcorn.",
    "I need to calculate how many tablespoons are needed for 16 cups.",
    "First, determine how many batches of 4 cups are in 16 cups: 16 / 4 = 4 batches.",
    "Each batch requires 2 tablespoons of kernels.",
    "For 4 batches, 4 x 2 tablespoons are needed.",
    "4 x 2 = 8 tablespoons."
