  "query": "Mike buys 6 rose bushes at 75 dollars each, 2 of them are for his friend and the rest are for him.  He also buys 2 tiger tooth aloes for 100 dollars each.  How much money did he spend on plants for himself?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Mike spent on rose bushes.",
    "Mike buys 6 rose bushes at 75 dollars each.",
    "To find the total cost of the rose bushes, I multiply 6 by 75.",
    "6 * 75 = 450 dollars for all the rose bushes.",
    "Mike gives 2 rose bushes to his friend.",
    "The remaining rose bushes Mike keeps for himself are 6 - 2 = 4 rose bushes.",
    "I need to find out how much he spent on the 4 rose bushes that he keeps.",
    "Each rose bush costs 75 dollars, so for 4 rose bushes it is 4 * 75.",
    "4 * 75 = 300 dollars for the rose bushes that Mike keeps.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the amount Mike spent on the tiger tooth aloes.",
    "Mike buys 2 tiger tooth aloes at 100 dollars each.",
    "To find the total cost of the tiger tooth aloes, I multiply 2 by 100.",
    "2 * 100 = 200 dollars for the aloes.",
    "Both the rose bushes and the aloes are for Mike himself.",
    "So, I need to add the cost of the rose bushes and the aloes to find the total amount Mike spent on plants for himself.",
    "300 dollars (for rose bushes) + 200 dollars (for aloes) = 500 dollars."
