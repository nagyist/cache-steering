  "query": "One ticket to the underground costs $3. In one minute, the metro sells an average of 5 such tickets. What will be the earnings from the tickets in 6 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of one ticket, which is given as $3.",
    "Next, I am informed that on average, 5 tickets are sold per minute.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of tickets sold in 6 minutes.",
    "To find this, I'll multiply the average number of tickets sold per minute by the number of minutes: 5 tickets/minute \u00d7 6 minutes = 30 tickets.",
    "Now, I should calculate the total earnings from selling 30 tickets.",
    "The total cost is obtained by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the price per ticket: 30 tickets \u00d7 $3/ticket = $90."
