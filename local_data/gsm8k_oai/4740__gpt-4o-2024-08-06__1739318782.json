  "query": "If 3 boys each make 12 muffins for a bake sale, and 2 other girls are making 20 muffins each, how many total muffins will be for sale?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate how many muffins the 3 boys make together.",
    "Each boy makes 12 muffins and there are 3 boys.",
    "I multiply 3 (boys) by 12 (muffins per boy): 3 \u00d7 12 = 36.",
    "The 3 boys make a total of 36 muffins.",
    "Next, I determine how many muffins the 2 girls make together.",
    "Each girl makes 20 muffins and there are 2 girls.",
    "I multiply 2 (girls) by 20 (muffins per girl): 2 \u00d7 20 = 40.",
    "The 2 girls make a total of 40 muffins.",
    "Now, I add the muffins made by the boys and the girls to find the total number of muffins.",
    "I add 36 (muffins from boys) and 40 (muffins from girls): 36 + 40 = 76."

  "solution": "76"
