  "query": "Gary manages two Amazon distribution centers. The first center processes 10000 packages per day, and the second center processes three times that volume. If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, how much profit per week do the two centers make combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many packages the second center processes daily. Since it's three times the volume of the first center, I multiply 10000 by 3.",
    "10000 * 3 = 30000 packages per day for the second center.",
    "Now, I find the combined daily package volume of the two centers by adding the packages from each center.",
    "10000 + 30000 = 40000 packages per day for both centers combined.",
    "Next, I calculate the profit made per day by multiplying the number of packages processed each day by the profit Amazon makes per package, which is 5 cents or $0.05.",
    "40000 * $0.05 = $2000 profit per day.",
    "To find the weekly profit, I need to multiply the daily profit by the number of days in a week, which is 7.",
    "$2000 * 7 = $14000 profit per week."
  ],
  "solution": "14000"
