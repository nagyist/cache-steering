  "query": "Jake is watching a new show, and is worried about how much time he has spent watching it. He spent half the day on Monday watching his show, 4 hours on Tuesday watching his show, a quarter of the day on Wednesday watching his show, and he spent half as much time watching the show on Thursday as he had done in total throughout the previous few days. On Friday, he finally finished watching it. If the entire show is 52 hours long, how many hours did Jake watch on Friday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Jake watched the show on each day before Friday.",
    "On Monday, Jake spent half the day watching his show. There are 24 hours in a day. Half of that would be \\( \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) hours.",
    "On Tuesday, he watched the show for 4 hours.",
    "On Wednesday, he watched the show for a quarter of the day. A quarter of 24 hours is \\( \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\) hours.",
    "Now, I need to total the hours spent until Wednesday. On Monday, it was 12 hours, on Tuesday 4 hours, and on Wednesday 6 hours. So, the total is \\( 12 + 4 + 6 = 22 \\) hours.",
    "On Thursday, he watched half as much time as he had done throughout the previous few days. The total hours until Wednesday were 22 hours, so half of that is \\( \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\) hours.",
    "Now, let's total the hours spent until Thursday. This would be 22 hours + 11 hours = 33 hours.",
    "The entire show is 52 hours long. I need to subtract the hours he already watched from the total length to find out how many hours Jake watched on Friday.",
    "The total hours Jake watched until Thursday is 33 hours. The show is 52 hours in total, so on Friday he watched \\( 52 - 33 = 19 \\) hours."
