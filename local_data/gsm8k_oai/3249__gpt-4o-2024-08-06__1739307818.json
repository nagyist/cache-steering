  "query": "A pound of strawberries costs $2.20 and a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries. If Briget will buy 5 pounds of strawberries and 5 pounds of cherries, how much will it cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the cost of a pound of cherries. I know that a pound of cherries costs 6 times as much as strawberries.",
    "A pound of strawberries costs $2.20, so a pound of cherries costs 6 times $2.20.",
    "Calculating 6 times $2.20 gives $13.20.",
    "Now I know that a pound of cherries costs $13.20.",
    "Briget is buying 5 pounds of strawberries. I need to calculate the total cost of the strawberries.",
    "The cost of 5 pounds of strawberries is 5 times $2.20.",
    "Calculating 5 times $2.20 gives $11.00.",
    "Now I calculate the total cost of the cherries. Briget is buying 5 pounds of cherries.",
    "The cost of 5 pounds of cherries is 5 times $13.20.",
    "Calculating 5 times $13.20 gives $66.00.",
    "Finally, I need to add the cost of the strawberries and the cherries to find the total cost.",
    "The cost of the strawberries is $11.00 and the cost of the cherries is $66.00.",
    "Adding $11.00 and $66.00 gives $77.00."
