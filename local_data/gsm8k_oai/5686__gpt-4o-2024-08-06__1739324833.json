  "query": "Linda owns a store. She sells jeans at 11 dollars each and tees at 8 dollars each. If she sold 7 tees and 4 jeans in a day, how much money, in dollars, did she have at the end of the day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find how much money Linda made from selling jeans.",
    "She sold 4 jeans and each jean sells for 11 dollars.",
    "To calculate the revenue from jeans, I multiply the number sold by the price: 4 jeans * 11 dollars/jean.",
    "This gives me: 4 * 11 = 44 dollars from the jeans.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money Linda made from selling tees.",
    "She sold 7 tees and each tee sells for 8 dollars.",
    "To calculate the revenue from tees, I multiply the number sold by the price: 7 tees * 8 dollars/tee.",
    "This gives me: 7 * 8 = 56 dollars from the tees.",
    "Now I need to find the total revenue for the day by adding the money made from jeans and tees.",
    "I add the revenue from jeans and tees: 44 dollars (from jeans) + 56 dollars (from tees).",
    "This gives me: 44 + 56 = 100 dollars in total."

  "solution": "100"
