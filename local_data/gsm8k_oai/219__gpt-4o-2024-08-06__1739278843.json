  "query": "Lisa is looking to attempt a World Record. She has decided to try and match Joey Chestnut's record of eating 75 full hotdogs, buns included, in 10 minutes. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. How many hotdogs will she have to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many more hotdogs Lisa needs to eat to at least tie the record. She has eaten 20 hotdogs so far.",
    "Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs. If Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs, she needs to eat 75 - 20 = 55 more hotdogs to tie the record.",
    "Next, consider the time. The record time is 10 minutes, and Lisa is halfway through, which means 5 minutes have already passed.",
    "Therefore, Lisa has 10 - 5 = 5 minutes remaining to eat the remaining 55 hotdogs.",
    "To find out how many hotdogs per minute Lisa needs to eat, I will divide the remaining number of hotdogs by the remaining minutes: 55 hotdogs / 5 minutes.",
    "55 divided by 5 equals 11."

  "solution": "11"
