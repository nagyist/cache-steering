  "query": "To make a living, Carl needs to drive a car for 2 hours every day. After he got promoted he needs to drive for 6 more hours every week. How many hours will Carl drive in two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl needs to drive 2 hours every day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so he drives 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours each week.",
    "After his promotion, he needs to drive 6 more hours every week.",
    "So now, Carl drives 14 hours/week + 6 additional hours/week = 20 hours each week.",
    "Carl wants to know how many hours he will drive in two weeks.",
    "If Carl drives 20 hours in one week, then in two weeks, he will drive 20 hours/week * 2 weeks = 40 hours."
