  "query": "Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and her sister is twice her age. If Lexie is 8, what is the age difference between her brother and her sister?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the ages of each person involved. Lexie's current age is given as 8 years.",
    "To find her brother's age, I need to use the information that Lexie is 6 years older than her brother.",
    "If Lexie is 8 years old, then her brother is 8 - 6 = 2 years old.",
    "Next, I need to determine her sister's age. The problem states that her sister is twice Lexie's age.",
    "Lexie is 8 years old, so her sister's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.",
    "Now, I need to find the age difference between her brother and her sister.",
    "The brother is 2 years old and the sister is 16 years old.",
    "The age difference between the sister and the brother is 16 - 2 = 14 years."
