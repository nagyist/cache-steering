  "query": "Donny went to the gas station to gas up his tank. He knows his truck holds 150 liters of fuel. His truck already contained 38 liters. How much change will he get from $350 if each liter of fuel costs $3?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much more fuel Donny needs to fill the tank.",
    "The truck's tank capacity is 150 liters.",
    "It already has 38 liters of fuel.",
    "Therefore, the amount of fuel he needs to add is 150 - 38 liters.",
    "150 - 38 equals 112 liters. So, Donny needs to add 112 liters.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of 112 liters of fuel.",
    "The cost per liter is $3.",
    "Thus, the total cost for 112 liters is 112 liters * $3/liter.",
    "112 * 3 equals $336.",
    "Donny spends $336 on fuel.",
    "He paid $350 initially.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the change he will receive.",
    "The change is $350 - $336.",
    "$350 - $336 equals $14."

  "solution": "14"
