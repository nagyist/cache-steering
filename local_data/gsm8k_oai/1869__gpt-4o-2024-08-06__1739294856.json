  "query": "Francie saves up her allowance for several weeks. She receives an allowance of $5 a week for 8 weeks. Then her dad raises her allowance, and she receives $6 a week for 6 weeks. Francie uses half of the money to buy new clothes. With the remaining money, she buys a video game that costs $35. How much money does Francie have remaining after buying the video game?",
  "steps": [
    "Francie receives $5 a week for 8 weeks.",
    "To calculate the total amount she receives in that period, multiply 5 dollars by 8 weeks.",
    "5 * 8 = 40",
    "Francie receives $40 during the first 8 weeks.",
    "Next, Francie receives $6 a week for 6 weeks.",
    "To calculate the total amount she receives during those 6 weeks, multiply 6 dollars by 6 weeks.",
    "6 * 6 = 36",
    "Francie receives $36 during the next 6 weeks.",
    "To find out the total amount of money Francie has saved, add the amounts from both time periods together.",
    "40 + 36 = 76",
    "Francie has saved a total of $76.",
    "Francie uses half of her total savings to buy new clothes.",
    "To find out how much she spends on clothes, divide her total savings by 2.",
    "76 / 2 = 38",
    "Francie spends $38 on clothes, leaving her with $38 remaining.",
    "With the remaining money, Francie buys a video game that costs $35.",
    "To find out how much money Francie has after buying the video game, subtract the cost of the video game from her remaining money after buying clothes.",
    "38 - 35 = 3"
