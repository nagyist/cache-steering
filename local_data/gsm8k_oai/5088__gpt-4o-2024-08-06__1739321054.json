  "query": "Barbara went shopping in a supermarket. She bought 5 packs of tuna for $2 each and 4 bottles of water for $1.5 each. In total, she paid $56 for her shopping. How much did Barbara spend on different than the mentioned goods?",
  "steps": [
    "Barbara bought 5 packs of tuna at $2 each.",
    "The total cost for the tuna is calculated as 5 packs * $2 = $10.",
    "Barbara also bought 4 bottles of water at $1.5 each.",
    "The total cost for the water is calculated as 4 bottles * $1.5 = $6.",
    "Now, combining the totals for tuna and water, we calculate the total spent on both as $10 (tuna) + $6 (water) = $16.",
    "Barbara spent a total of $56 for all her shopping.",
    "To find out how much she spent on goods other than tuna and water, we subtract the $16 from the total $56.",
    "The amount Barbara spent on other goods is $56 - $16 = $40."

  "solution": "40"
