  "query": "Emery and Serena go to their school library, and each borrows a copy of The life of Jack Steve's book to read for their school project. If Emery can read five times as fast as Serena, and the book takes her 20 days to read, what's the average number of days the two take to read the book?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes Serena to read the book.",
    "Emery reads the book in 20 days.",
    "It's given that Emery can read five times as fast as Serena.",
    "This means that Serena takes 5 times longer to read the book than Emery does.",
    "So I calculate Serena's reading time by multiplying Emery's reading days by 5.",
    "Serena's reading time = 20 days * 5 = 100 days.",
    "Now, I need to find the average number of days Emery and Serena take to read the book.",
    "The formula for the average is the sum of the times divided by the number of people.",
    "The sum of the days it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book is 20 days (Emery) + 100 days (Serena) = 120 days.",
    "There are two people, Emery and Serena.",
    "So the average number of days is 120 days / 2 people = 60 days."

  "solution": "60"
