  "query": "Jim buys a package of 20 car washes.  Since He bought a package he only has to pay 60%.  A carwash normally costs 15 dollars.  How much did he pay for the package?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the normal price for a package of 20 car washes.",
    "A single car wash costs 15 dollars.",
    "If Jim buys 20 car washes individually, the total cost is 20 times the cost of one car wash.",
    "Therefore, 20 car washes at the normal rate would cost 20 x 15 = 300 dollars.",
    "However, Jim only has to pay 60% of this amount for the package.",
    "To find 60% of the total cost, I multiply 300 by 0.60.",
    "Calculating this, 300 x 0.60 = 180.",
    "So, Jim paid 180 dollars for the package of 20 car washes."

  "solution": "180"
