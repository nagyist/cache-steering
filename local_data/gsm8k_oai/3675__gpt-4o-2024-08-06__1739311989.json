    "George plans to borrow $100 from a loan shark for 2 weeks.",
    "The initial finance fee is 5% of the $100.",
    "I need to calculate 5% of $100, which is 0.05 \u00d7 $100 = $5.",
    "The finance fee doubles every week.",
    "After the first week, the finance fee is $5.",
    "For the second week, the finance fee doubles, so I multiply $5 by 2 to get $10.",
    "I need to add the finance fees for each week to get the total amount George will pay in fees.",
    "In the first week, the fee is $5, and in the second week, it is $10.",
    "The total finance fee for 2 weeks is $5 + $10."
