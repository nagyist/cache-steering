  "query": "Gretchen draws caricatures in the park on the weekends.  She charges $20.00 per drawing.  If she sold 24 on Saturday and 16 on Sunday, how much money did she make?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total number of caricatures Gretchen sold over the weekend.",
    "Gretchen sold 24 caricatures on Saturday.",
    "Gretchen sold 16 caricatures on Sunday.",
    "To find the total number of caricatures sold, I add the ones sold on Saturday to those sold on Sunday: 24 + 16.",
    "24 + 16 equals 40.",
    "Gretchen sold a total of 40 caricatures over the weekend.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total revenue from the caricatures.",
    "Each caricature is sold for $20.00.",
    "I multiply the total number of caricatures sold by the price per caricature: 40 * $20.00.",
    "40 * $20.00 equals $800.00."
