  "query": "On Monday, while at work on the farm, Jeremy picks 100 oranges. On Tuesday, together with his brother, they pick thrice as much. On Wednesday he feels tired and is only able to pick 70 oranges. What's the total number of oranges they have?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeremy picks 100 oranges on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, Jeremy and his brother together pick thrice as much as Monday.",
    "Thrice of 100 oranges is 3 * 100 = 300 oranges.",
    "On Wednesday, Jeremy picks 70 oranges.",
    "Calculate the total number of oranges by adding up the oranges from each day.",
    "Total number of oranges = 100 (Monday) + 300 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday).",
    "Adding these amounts gives: 100 + 300 + 70 = 470 oranges."
