  "query": "Alyana has a pizza that is cut into 16 slices. After she and her friends finish eating, there are 4 slices left. If each of them ate 2 slices of pizza, how many people ate the pizza?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how many slices of pizza were eaten.",
    "The pizza originally had 16 slices.",
    "There are 4 slices left, so the number of slices eaten is \\(16 - 4 = 12\\) slices.",
    "Each person ate 2 slices of pizza.",
    "To find out how many people ate the pizza, divide the total number of eaten slices by the number of slices per person.",
    "\\[ \\text{Number of People} = \\frac{12 \\text{ slices}}{2 \\text{ slices per person}} = 6 \\]"
  ],
  "solution": "6"
