  "query": "Carlos read 28 books in July and 30 books in August.  He needed to read 100 books during his summer vacation. If Carlos read some of the books in June, calculate the number of books that Carlos read in June to meet his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of books Carlos read in July and August.",
    "Carlos read 28 books in July and 30 books in August.",
    "The total number of books read in July and August is 28 + 30 = 58.",
    "Carlos's goal is to read 100 books during the summer vacation.",
