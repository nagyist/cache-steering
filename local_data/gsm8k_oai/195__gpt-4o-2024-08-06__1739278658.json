  "query": "Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each box and 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each box for her pizza party. She paid $200 for all the items. How much change did she get back?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the drinks.",
    "Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each.",
    "The total cost of drinks is 5 boxes * $6/box = $30.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the pizzas.",
    "Mary bought 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each.",
    "The total cost of pizzas is 10 boxes * $14/box = $140.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of both drinks and pizzas.",
    "The combined cost is $30 (drinks) + $140 (pizzas) = $170.",
    "Mary paid $200 for all the items.",
    "To find the change she received, I subtract the total cost from the amount she paid.",
    "Change = $200 (paid) - $170 (total cost) = $30."
