  "query": "Rita is reading a five-chapter book with 95 pages. Each chapter has three pages more than the previous one. How many pages does the first chapter have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let me simplify what the question is asking. I need to distribute 95 pages across five chapters, with each chapter having three more pages than the previous one.",
    "Let's assign x pages to the first chapter. Then, the pages for each subsequent chapter can be expressed in terms of x.",
    "The number of pages in the first chapter is x. \nThe number of pages in the second chapter is x + 3. \nThe number of pages in the third chapter is x + 6. \nThe number of pages in the fourth chapter is x + 9. \nThe number of pages in the fifth chapter is x + 12.",
    "Now, I will sum up the pages for all five chapters according to our expressions: \nx + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12).",
    "This simplifies to: 5x + 3 + 6 + 9 + 12.",
    "Let's add up the constants: 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30.",
    "So the equation becomes: 5x + 30 = 95.",
    "Subtract 30 from both sides to solve for x: 5x = 65.",
    "Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 13."
