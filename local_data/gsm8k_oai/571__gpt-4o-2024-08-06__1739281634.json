  "query": "Anthony and his friend Leonel read about the importance of keeping pets at home and decided to start adopting cats and dogs from the local rescue center. Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, 2/3 of which are cats. Leonel has half times as many cats as Anthony and seven more dogs than Anthony. How many animals in total do the two have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of cats Anthony has. It is given that Anthony has 2/3 of his 12 pets as cats.",
    "To find the number of cats, I calculate 2/3 of 12. I do this by multiplying 12 by 2/3.",
    "12 * (2/3) = 8. Hence, Anthony has 8 cats.",
    "Since Anthony has 12 pets in total and 8 of them are cats, the remaining pets must be dogs. Therefore, the number of dogs Anthony has is 12 - 8.",
    "12 - 8 = 4. Anthony has 4 dogs.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many cats Leonel has. It is stated that Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony.",
    "Half of Anthony's 8 cats is calculated as 8 / 2.",
    "8 / 2 = 4. Leonel has 4 cats.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of dogs Leonel has. It is mentioned that Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony.",
    "Anthony has 4 dogs, so Leonel has 4 + 7 dogs.",
    "4 + 7 = 11. Leonel has 11 dogs.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have together.",
    "Anthony has a total of 12 animals (8 cats and 4 dogs).",
    "Leonel has a total of 15 animals (4 cats and 11 dogs).",
    "The total number of animals is the sum of Anthony's and Leonel's animals, so 12 + 15.",
    "12 + 15 = 27. The total number of animals Anthony and Leonel have is 27."
