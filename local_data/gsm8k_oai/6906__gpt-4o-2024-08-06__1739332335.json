  "steps": [
    "Homer scored 400 points on the first try.",
    "On the second try, he scored 70 points fewer than the first try.",
    "Calculate the points scored on the second try: 400 - 70 = 330 points.",
    "On the third try, he scored twice the number of points from the second try.",
    "Calculate the points scored on the third try: 2 * 330 = 660 points.",
    "Now, sum up the points from all tries: 400 (first try) + 330 (second try) + 660 (third try).",
    "Add the points together: 400 + 330 + 660 = 1390 points."
