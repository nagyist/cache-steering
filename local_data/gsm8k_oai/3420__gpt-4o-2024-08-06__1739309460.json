  "query": "Jimmy has a collection of 5 action figures. Each figure is worth $15, except for one which is worth $20. He decided to sell his collection. To do it fast he decided to sell each of them for $5 less than their value. How much will Jimmy earn if he sells all the figures?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the value of each action figure when sold for $5 less than their original value.",
    "The 4 action figures worth $15 each will be sold for $15 - $5 = $10 each.",
    "The 1 action figure worth $20 will be sold for $20 - $5 = $15.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total earnings from selling the 4 action figures at $10 each.",
    "The earnings from these 4 action figures will be 4 figures * $10 = $40.",
    "Now, I will calculate the earnings from selling the figure worth $15.",
    "The earnings from this 1 figure will be 1 figure * $15 = $15.",
    "To find the total earnings, I will add the earnings from the $10 figures and the $15 figure.",
    "The total earnings will be $40 + $15 = $55."
