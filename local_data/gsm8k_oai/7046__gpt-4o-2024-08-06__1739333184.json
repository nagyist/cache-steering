  "query": "The rainy season is here, Jan collected 65 gallons of water in a barrel outside her home. She uses 7 gallons of water each to clean the two cars and uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars to water the plants. Then, she uses half of the remaining gallons of water to wash the plates and clothes. How many gallons of water does Jan use to wash her plates and clothes?",
  "steps": [
    "Jan collected a total of 65 gallons of water.",
    "She uses 7 gallons of water for each car, and she has 2 cars.",
    "Thus, she uses 7 gallons/car \u00d7 2 cars = 14 gallons to clean the cars.",
    "To water the plants, Jan uses 11 fewer gallons than the 14 gallons used for the cars.",
    "14 gallons - 11 gallons = 3 gallons for the plants.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total water used for cars and plants.",
    "Total used for cars and plants = 14 gallons (cars) + 3 gallons (plants) = 17 gallons.",
    "Let me calculate how much water is left after cleaning the cars and watering the plants.",
    "65 gallons (total) - 17 gallons (used) = 48 gallons remaining.",
    "Jan uses half of the remaining water for washing plates and clothes.",
    "Half of 48 gallons is 48 gallons \u00f7 2 = 24 gallons."

  "solution": "24"
