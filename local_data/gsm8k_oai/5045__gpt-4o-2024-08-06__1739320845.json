  "query": "Last week, Mr. Sanchez bought 6 feet of rope for their class activity. He found that he lacks rope for the activity so this week, he bought 4 feet less than last week. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, how many inches of ribbon did Mr. Sanchez buy in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many feet of rope Mr. Sanchez bought this week. Last week he bought 6 feet, and this week he bought 4 feet less.",
    "Calculate 6 - 4, which is 2. So, this week Mr. Sanchez bought 2 feet of rope.",
    "Now, add the feet of rope he bought last week and this week together. Last week he bought 6 feet and this week he bought 2 feet.",
    "Add 6 + 2 to get a total of 8 feet of rope bought altogether.",
    "Now convert the total feet of rope into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, multiply the total number of feet by 12.",
    "Multiply 8 feet by 12 inches per foot, which equals 96 inches."
  ],
  "solution": "96"
