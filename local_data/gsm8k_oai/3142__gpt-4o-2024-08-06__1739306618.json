  "query": "Three-quarters of the oil from a 4000-liter tank (that was initially full) was poured into a 20000-liter capacity tanker that already had 3000 liters of oil. How many more liters of oil would be needed to make the large tanker half-full?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much oil was poured from the 4000-liter tank.",
    "Three-quarters of 4000 liters is calculated as (3/4) * 4000 liters.",
    "(3/4) * 4000 liters equals 3000 liters.",
    "So, 3000 liters of oil was poured into the large tanker.",
    "The large tanker initially had 3000 liters of oil.",
    "After adding 3000 liters from the small tank, the total amount of oil in the large tanker becomes 3000 + 3000 liters.",
    "3000 + 3000 liters equals 6000 liters of oil in the large tanker.",
    "The capacity of the large tanker is 20000 liters.",
    "To find out how much oil is needed to make the large tanker half-full, I need to calculate half of the tanker's capacity.",
    "Half of 20000 liters is (1/2) * 20000 liters.",
    "(1/2) * 20000 liters equals 10000 liters.",
    "The amount of oil needed to make the tanker half-full is 10000 liters.",
    "Since the tanker already has 6000 liters, I will subtract the current amount of oil from the amount needed to make it half-full.",
    "10000 liters - 6000 liters equals 4000 liters."
