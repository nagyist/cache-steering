  "query": "At football tryouts, the coach wanted to see who could throw the ball the farthest.  Parker threw the ball 16 yards.  Grant threw the ball 25 percent farther than Parker and Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant.  Compared to Parker, how much farther did Kyle throw the ball?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how far Grant threw the ball. Grant threw 25 percent farther than Parker.",
    "Parker threw the ball 16 yards. To find 25 percent of 16, I calculate 0.25 multiplied by 16.",
    "0.25 multiplied by 16 is 4.",
    "Since Grant threw 25 percent farther than Parker, I add 4 to 16 to find how far Grant threw the ball.",
    "Grant threw the ball 16 + 4 = 20 yards.",
    "Next, I need to find out how far Kyle threw the ball. Kyle threw the ball 2 times farther than Grant.",
    "To find out how far Kyle threw the ball, I multiply 20 by 2.",
    "20 multiplied by 2 is 40.",
    "Kyle threw the ball 40 yards.",
    "Finally, I need to figure out how much farther Kyle threw compared to Parker.",
    "Parker threw 16 yards and Kyle threw 40 yards. To find out how much farther, I subtract 16 from 40.",
    "40 minus 16 is 24."

  "solution": "24"
