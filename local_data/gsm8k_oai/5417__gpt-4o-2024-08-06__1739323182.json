  "query": "Mary tried to improve her health by changing her diet, but her weight bounced like a yo-yo.  At first, she dropped a dozen pounds. Then, she added back twice the weight that she initially lost.  Then, she dropped three times more weight than she initially had lost.  But finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds.  If she weighed 99 pounds at the start of her change in diet, what was her final weight, in pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's identify the initial weight: Mary started at 99 pounds.",
    "First, Mary dropped a dozen pounds, which is 12 pounds.",
    "So, after losing 12 pounds, her weight was 99 - 12 = 87 pounds.",
    "Next, she added back twice the weight that she initially lost. Twice 12 pounds is 24 pounds.",
    "Adding 24 pounds to her current weight of 87 gives her a new weight of 87 + 24 = 111 pounds.",
    "Then, she dropped three times more weight than she initially had lost. Three times 12 pounds is 36 pounds.",
    "Subtracting 36 pounds from her current weight of 111 gives her a new weight of 111 - 36 = 75 pounds.",
    "Finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds. Half of 12 pounds is 6 pounds.",
    "Adding 6 pounds to her current weight of 75 gives her a final weight of 75 + 6 = 81 pounds."
