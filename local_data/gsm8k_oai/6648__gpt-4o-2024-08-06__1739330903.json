  "query": "Donna bought 3 times as many pencils as Marcia did. Marcia bought double the number of pencils as Cindi did. How many pencils did Donna and Marcia buy altogether if Cindi spent $30 on $0.50 pencils?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pencils Cindi bought. Since Cindi spent $30 on pencils that cost $0.50 each, I need to divide $30 by $0.50.",
    "$30 divided by $0.50 equals 60 pencils. So, Cindi bought 60 pencils.",
    "Marcia bought double the number of pencils as Cindi. Since Cindi bought 60 pencils, Marcia bought 2 times 60 pencils.",
    "2 times 60 equals 120. Therefore, Marcia bought 120 pencils.",
    "Donna bought 3 times as many pencils as Marcia. Since Marcia bought 120 pencils, Donna bought 3 times 120 pencils.",
    "3 times 120 equals 360. Therefore, Donna bought 360 pencils.",
    "To find out how many pencils Donna and Marcia bought altogether, I need to add the pencils they each bought.",
    "Donna bought 360 pencils and Marcia bought 120 pencils, so together they bought 360 plus 120 pencils.",
    "360 plus 120 equals 480. Therefore, Donna and Marcia bought 480 pencils altogether."

  "solution": "480"
