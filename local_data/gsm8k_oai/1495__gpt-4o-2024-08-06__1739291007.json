  "query": "In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the original cost of 10 books without any discount.",
    "Each book costs $5, so 10 books originally cost 10 * $5 = $50.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total discount Sheryll received.",
    "The discount per book is $0.5, so for 10 books, the total discount is 10 * $0.5 = $5.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the total discount from the original cost of 10 books.",
    "The original cost without discount is $50, and the total discount is $5.",
    "Therefore, Sheryll paid $50 - $5 = $45 in total."

  "solution": "45"
