  "query": "It takes 320 rose petals to make an ounce of perfume. If each rose produces 8 petals, and there are 12 roses per bush, how many bushes will Fern have to harvest to make 20 12-ounce bottles of perfume?",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine how many rose petals are required to produce 20 bottles of perfume.",
    "Each bottle contains 12 ounces of perfume.",
    "We can calculate the total ounces needed for 20 bottles by multiplying 20 bottles by 12 ounces each.",
    "20 bottles * 12 ounces per bottle = 240 ounces.",
    "We know it takes 320 rose petals to make one ounce of perfume.",
    "To find the total number of petals needed, we'll multiply the number of ounces (240) by the petals per ounce (320).",
    "240 ounces * 320 petals per ounce = 76,800 petals.",
    "Each rose produces 8 petals.",
    "To find how many roses are needed, divide the total number of petals (76,800) by the petals per rose (8).",
    "76,800 petals / 8 petals per rose = 9,600 roses.",
    "There are 12 roses per bush.",
    "To find the number of bushes needed, divide the total number of roses (9,600) by the number of roses per bush (12).",
    "9,600 roses / 12 roses per bush = 800 bushes."
