  "query": "Gabrielle sells eggs. On Monday she sells 5 crates of eggs. On Tuesday she sells 2 times as many crates of eggs as Monday. On Wednesday she sells 2 fewer crates than Tuesday. On Thursday she sells half as many crates of eggs as she sells on Tuesday. How many total crates of eggs does she sell for the 4 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Gabrielle sells 5 crates of eggs on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, she sells 2 times as many crates as Monday. So, she sells 5 * 2 = 10 crates on Tuesday.",
    "On Wednesday, she sells 2 fewer crates than on Tuesday. So, she sells 10 - 2 = 8 crates on Wednesday.",
    "On Thursday, she sells half as many crates as she sold on Tuesday. So, she sells 10 / 2 = 5 crates on Thursday.",
    "Now, I add up the crates sold over the 4 days: \nMonday: 5 crates\nTuesday: 10 crates\nWednesday: 8 crates\nThursday: 5 crates",
    "Total crates sold = 5 + 10 + 8 + 5 = 28 crates."
