  "query": "Greta worked 40 hours and was paid $12 per hour. Her friend Lisa earned $15 per hour at her job. How many hours would Lisa have to work to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Greta's total earnings for the 40 hours she worked.",
    "Greta worked 40 hours and was paid $12 per hour.",
    "To find out how much Greta earned, I multiply the number of hours she worked by her hourly wage: \\( 40 \\text{ hours} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\).",
    "Calculating that gives me: \\( 40 \\times 12 = 480 \\) dollars.",
    "So, Greta earned a total of $480 for 40 hours of work.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many hours Lisa would need to work at her rate to earn the same $480.",
    "Lisa earns $15 per hour.",
    "To find out how many hours Lisa has to work, I need to divide Greta's total earnings by Lisa's hourly wage: \\( 480 \\text{ dollars} \\div 15 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\).",
    "Calculating that gives me: \\( 480 \\div 15 = 32 \\)."

  "solution": "32"
