  "query": "Bill started reading a book on the first day of April. He read 8 pages every day and by the 12th of April, he had covered two-thirds of the book. How many pages does the book have?",
  "steps": [
    "Determine the number of days Bill has been reading by April 12th.",
    "Bill started on April 1st and read through to April 12th. That is 12 days of reading.",
    "Calculate the total number of pages Bill read in 12 days.",
    "Bill reads 8 pages each day, so in 12 days, he read 12 days \u00d7 8 pages/day = 96 pages.",
    "Bill covered two-thirds of the book in 96 pages.",
    "Let P be the total number of pages in the book. Two-thirds of the book is equal to 96 pages.",
    "Set up an equation: (2/3)P = 96.",
    "Solve for P. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction: 2P = 288.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find P: P = 144.",
    "Check the calculation: If the book is 144 pages long and Bill read two-thirds, then he would indeed read 96 pages, which matches our earlier calculation."

  "solution": "144"
