  "query": "Jenine can sharpen a pencil 5 times before it runs out. She needs to sharpen a pencil for every 1.5 hours of use. She already has ten pencils and needs to write for 105 hours. A new pencil costs $2. How much does she need to spend on more pencils to be able to write for 105 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many total hours of writing the ten pencils she has can provide.",
    "Each pencil can be sharpened 5 times and is used for 1.5 hours per sharpen, so each pencil can be used for 1.5 * 5 = 7.5 hours.",
    "With 10 pencils, she can write for 10 * 7.5 = 75 hours.",
    "She needs to write for 105 hours. Therefore, she needs 105 - 75 = 30 more hours of writing.",
    "To find out how many additional pencils she needs, I divide the additional hours by the hours one pencil provides: 30 / 7.5 = 4 pencils.",
    "Each new pencil costs $2.",
    "Thus, she needs to buy 4 pencils, and the cost will be 4 * $2 = $8."

  "solution": "8"
