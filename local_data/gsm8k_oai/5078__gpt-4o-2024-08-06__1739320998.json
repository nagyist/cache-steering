  "query": "Megan bought 2 dozen eggs. As she was walking to her car, she dropped a tray of eggs. 3 eggs broke, and twice as many cracked. What is the difference between the eggs that are still in perfect condition and those that are cracked?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eggs Megan originally had.",
    "Megan bought 2 dozen eggs. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 24 eggs.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many eggs broke and how many cracked.",
    "It is stated that 3 eggs broke, and twice as many cracked.",
    "Twice the number of broken eggs is 2 times 3, which equals 6 eggs cracked.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many eggs are still in perfect condition.",
    "To find the perfect eggs, I need to subtract the broken and cracked eggs from the total eggs.",
    "There are 3 broken eggs and 6 cracked eggs. The total damaged eggs are 3 + 6 = 9.",
    "The number of perfect eggs is 24 (total eggs) - 9 (damaged eggs) = 15.",
    "Finally, I need to find the difference between the eggs that are still in perfect condition and those that are cracked.",
    "The number of cracked eggs is 6.",
    "The difference between perfect eggs and cracked eggs is 15 (perfect eggs) - 6 (cracked eggs) = 9."

  "solution": "9"
