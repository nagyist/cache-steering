  "query": "A mechanic charges $60 an hour to repair a car.  He works 8 hours a day for 14 days on one car.  The mechanic also used $2500 in parts.  How much did the car's owner have to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "The mechanic charges $60 per hour.",
    "He works 8 hours a day.",
    "He works for 14 days.",

    "Now calculate the cost of labor: 112 hours * $60/hour = $6720.",
    "The cost of parts used is $2500.",
    "To find the total cost, add the labor cost and the parts cost: $6720 + $2500 = $9220."
