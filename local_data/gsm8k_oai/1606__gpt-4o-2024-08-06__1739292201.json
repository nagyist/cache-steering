  "query": "Maya wants to learn how to lift and right now she can only lift a fourth of what America can. America can lift 240 pounds. As Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift. America follows this and now she has hit her peak lift at 300 pounds. If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, how many more pounds can Maya lift now than when she started?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much Maya could lift initially.",
    "America can initially lift 240 pounds.",
    "Maya can lift a fourth of what America can lift.",
    "A fourth of 240 pounds is calculated as 240 / 4 = 60 pounds.",
    "So, Maya initially can lift 60 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to understand her growth until she can lift half of America's peak.",
    "America hits her peak at lifting 300 pounds.",
    "Half of America's peak (300 pounds) is calculated as 300 / 2 = 150 pounds.",
    "Maya can lift half of America's peak lift at her absolute peak, which means Maya can lift 150 pounds at her peak.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many more pounds Maya can lift now compared to when she started.",
    "Subtract Maya's initial lift from her peak lift to find the difference: 150 - 60 = 90 pounds."

  "solution": "90"
