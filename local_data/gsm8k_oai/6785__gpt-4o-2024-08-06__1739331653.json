  "query": "Hannah bought 3 sweatshirts and 2 T-shirts. Each sweatshirt cost 15$ and each t-shirt cost 10$. How much money did Hannah spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Hannah spent on sweatshirts.",
    "She bought 3 sweatshirts, and each one costs $15.",
    "So, I multiply 3 sweatshirts by $15 per sweatshirt.",
    "3 x 15 = 45",
    "Hannah spent $45 on sweatshirts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much she spent on T-shirts.",
    "She bought 2 T-shirts, and each one costs $10.",
    "So, I multiply 2 T-shirts by $10 per T-shirt.",
    "2 x 10 = 20",
    "Hannah spent $20 on T-shirts.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount she spent.",
    "I add the amount spent on sweatshirts and T-shirts.",
    "45 + 20 = 65"
