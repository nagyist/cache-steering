  "query": "Simeon drinks 64 fluid ounces of filtered water every day.  He used to drink this water in 8-ounce-servings.  But now, he drinks his water in 16-ounce servings.  How many fewer servings per day does it now take Simeon to drink his water than it used to?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many 8-ounce servings Simeon used to drink each day.",
    "Simeon drinks a total of 64 fluid ounces of water each day.",
    "I divide the total ounces by the ounces per serving to find the number of servings: 64 \u00f7 8 = 8.",
    "Simeon used to drink 8 servings of 8 ounces each day.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many 16-ounce servings Simeon drinks each day.",
    "Again, I take the total fluid ounces and divide by the new serving size: 64 \u00f7 16 = 4.",
    "Simeon now drinks 4 servings of 16 ounces each day.",
    "To find out how many fewer servings per day it takes now, I subtract the new number of servings from the old number of servings: 8 - 4 = 4.",
    "So, Simeon now has 4 fewer servings per day."

  "solution": "4"
