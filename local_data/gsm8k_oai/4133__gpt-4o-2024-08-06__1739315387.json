  "query": "Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the number of red tulips needed for the eyes. Since each eye requires 8 red tulips and there are 2 eyes, the calculation will be \\( 8 \\times 2 \\).",
    "The number of red tulips needed for the eyes is \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\).",
    "Next, I'll add the number of red tulips needed for the smile to the total red tulips count. The smile requires 18 red tulips.",
    "The total number of red tulips needed is \\( 16 + 18 \\).",
    "Calculating the sum: \\( 16 + 18 = 34 \\). So, there are 34 red tulips needed in total for the eyes and the smile.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the number of yellow tulips needed for the background. Anna needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile. Since the smile requires 18 red tulips, the calculation for yellow tulips is \\( 18 \\times 9 \\).",
    "Calculating \\( 18 \\times 9 = 162 \\), I find that 162 yellow tulips are needed for the background.",
    "Finally, I'll find the total number of tulips by adding the red and yellow tulips together. The total is \\( 34 \\) red tulips plus \\( 162 \\) yellow tulips.",
    "Calculating the sum: \\( 34 + 162 = 196 \\)."
