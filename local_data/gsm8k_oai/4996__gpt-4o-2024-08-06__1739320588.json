  "query": "Rebecca drinks half a bottle of soda a day. She bought three 6-packs of sodas the last time she was at the store. How many bottles of soda will she have left after four weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bottles of soda Rebecca bought.",
    "She bought three 6-packs of sodas.",
    "Each 6-pack contains 6 bottles.",
    "Three 6-packs means 3 x 6 = 18 bottles of soda.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Four weeks have 4 x 7 = 28 days.",
    "Rebecca drinks half a bottle of soda a day.",
    "In 28 days, she drinks 28 x 0.5 = 14 bottles of soda.",
    "Now, I subtract the number of bottles she drinks from the number she bought to find out how many she has left.",
    "She started with 18 bottles and drinks 14.",
    "18 - 14 = 4 bottles of soda left."
