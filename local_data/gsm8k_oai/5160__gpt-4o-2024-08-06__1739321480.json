  "query": "Rayden bought three times as many ducks as Lily from the market. He also bought four times as many geese as Lily. If Lily bought 20 ducks and 10 geese, how many more ducks and geese do Rayden have more than Lily altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many ducks Lily bought.",
    "I know from the problem statement that Lily bought 20 ducks.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many ducks Rayden bought.",
    "The problem states that Rayden bought three times as many ducks as Lily.",
    "So, I multiply the number of ducks Lily bought by 3: 20 ducks * 3 = 60 ducks.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many geese Lily bought.",
    "According to the problem, Lily bought 10 geese.",
    "Then, I need to determine how many geese Rayden bought.",
    "Rayden bought four times as many geese as Lily, according to the problem.",
    "So, I multiply the number of geese Lily bought by 4: 10 geese * 4 = 40 geese.",
    "Now, I compare the total number of ducks and geese Rayden bought with what Lily bought.",
    "First, I add the number of ducks and geese Lily bought: 20 ducks + 10 geese = 30 animals.",
    "Next, I add the number of ducks and geese Rayden bought: 60 ducks + 40 geese = 100 animals.",
    "Finally, I find out how many more animals Rayden has than Lily by subtracting the total number of animals Lily has from Rayden's total.",
    "100 animals (Rayden) - 30 animals (Lily) = 70 animals."
