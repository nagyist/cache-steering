  "query": "Ruby is taking dance lessons. They cost $75 for 10 classes in one pack. She can add additional classes at the price of 1/3 more than the average price of a class on the lesson in the pack. if she takes 13 total classes, how much does she pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the cost per class in the 10-class pack.",
    "The pack costs $75 for 10 classes.",
    "To find the average cost per class, divide $75 by 10 classes.",
    "$75 divided by 10 equals $7.50 per class.",
    "Next, find the cost of an additional class.",
    "An additional class costs 1/3 more than the average price of a class in the pack.",
    "1/3 of $7.50 is calculated by dividing $7.50 by 3.",
    "$7.50 divided by 3 equals $2.50.",
    "Add this amount to the original average class cost to find the cost of one additional class.",
    "$7.50 plus $2.50 equals $10.00.",
    "Ruby takes a total of 13 classes.",
    "She pays $75 for the 10 classes in the pack.",
    "She needs 3 additional classes, and each additional class costs $10.00.",
    "Multiply 3 additional classes by $10.00 per class.",
    "3 times $10.00 equals $30.",
    "Now add the cost of the pack and the cost of the additional classes.",
    "$75 plus $30 equals $105."
