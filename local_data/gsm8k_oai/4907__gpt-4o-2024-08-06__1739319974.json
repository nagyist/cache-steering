  "query": "Daleyza won a house construction project that involved the construction of three houses with several units. The first building was designed to have 4000 units, the second building 2/5 times as many units as the first building, and the third building was to have 20% more units than the second building. How many units were Daleyza contracted to build?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of units in the first building. It is given as 4000 units.",
    "Next, I will calculate the number of units for the second building. The second building is designed to have 2/5 times as many units as the first building.",
    "To find this, I multiply 4000 units by 2/5.",
    "4000 units * 2/5 = 1600 units.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of units for the third building. The third building has 20% more units than the second building.",
    "To calculate 20% more, I find 20% of 1600 units first.",
    "20% of 1600 units is calculated as 0.20 * 1600 units = 320 units.",
    "The third building will then have 1600 units + 320 units = 1920 units.",
    "Now, I add the number of units for all three buildings to find the total.",
    "There are 4000 units from the first building, 1600 units from the second building, and 1920 units from the third building.",
    "Total units = 4000 + 1600 + 1920.",
    "Total units = 7520."
  ],
  "solution": "7520"
