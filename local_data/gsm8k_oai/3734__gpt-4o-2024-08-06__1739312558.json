  "query": "Jerry is making cherry syrup. He needs 500 cherries per quart of syrup. It takes him 2 hours to pick 300 cherries and 3 hours to make the syrup. How long will it take him to make 9 quarts of syrup?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cherries are required to make 9 quarts of syrup.",
    "Jerry needs 500 cherries per quart of syrup. Therefore, for 9 quarts, he will need 9 * 500 cherries.",
    "Calculating 9 * 500 gives me 4500 cherries needed in total.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how long it will take Jerry to pick 4500 cherries.",
    "It takes Jerry 2 hours to pick 300 cherries. This means he picks 300 / 2 = 150 cherries per hour.",
    "To find out how long it takes Jerry to pick 4500 cherries, I\u2019ll divide the total number of cherries by the rate at which he picks cherries. That is, 4500 / 150.",
    "4500 divided by 150 equals 30 hours.",
    "Now I need to calculate the time it takes for Jerry to make the syrup for 9 quarts, given it takes him 3 hours to make the syrup once the cherries are picked.",
    "Since the syrup-making time is constant for any number of cherries, I multiply the 3 hours by 9 for the 9 quarts.",
    "No, wait, I made a mistake. The 3 hours for syrup-making isn't per quart, it's for the entire batch after cherries are picked. I'll fix this.",
    "Re-evaluating, Jerry will need only 3 additional hours to make syrup irrespective of the number of quarts.",
    "I\u2019ll add the time taken to pick cherries and to make syrup: 30 hours for picking cherries + 3 hours for making syrup.",
    "Thus, the total time required is 33 hours."

  "solution": "33"
