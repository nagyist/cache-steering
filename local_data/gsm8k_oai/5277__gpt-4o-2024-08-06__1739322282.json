  "query": "Isabel was helping her mom pick apples from their tree in the front yard.  Together they picked 34 apples.  They want to make apple pies.  Each apple pie needs 4 apples, but the apples have to be ripe.  6 of the apples they picked are not ripe.  How many pies can they make?",
  "steps": [
    "Isabel and her mom picked a total of 34 apples.",
    "Out of these, 6 apples are not ripe.",
    "34 - 6 gives us the number of ripe apples: 34 - 6 = 28 ripe apples.",
    "Each apple pie requires 4 apples.",
    "To find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the number of ripe apples by the number of apples needed per pie: 28 \u00f7 4.",
    "28 \u00f7 4 = 7."
  ],
  "solution": "7"
