  "query": "Every week of last month Paul tried out a new cake recipe.  The first week, he followed a cake recipe that called for 24 cups of sugar. Each week after that, he reduced the amount of sugar by half. How much sugar did he use for the cake on the fourth week?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul started with 24 cups of sugar in the first week.",
    "In the second week, he reduced the sugar by half. So, 24 cups divided by 2 is 12 cups.",
    "In the third week, he again reduced the sugar by half. So, 12 cups divided by 2 is 6 cups.",
    "In the fourth week, he once again reduced the sugar by half. So, 6 cups divided by 2 is 3 cups.",
    "I need to double-check my reduction by half at each step: \n\n- First week -> 24 cups\n- Second week -> 24 / 2 = 12 cups\n- Third week -> 12 / 2 = 6 cups\n- Fourth week -> 6 / 2 = 3 cups"
