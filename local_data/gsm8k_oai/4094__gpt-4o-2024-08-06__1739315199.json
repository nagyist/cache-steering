  "query": "Lidia has a collection of books. Her collection is four times bigger than the collection which her friend Susan has. In total Susan and Lidia, both have 3000 books. How many books does Susan have in her collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of books Susan has be represented as S.",
    "According to the problem, Lidia's collection is four times bigger than Susan's.",
    "That means Lidia has 4S books.",
    "Together, Susan and Lidia have 3000 books.",
    "So, we can write the equation: S + 4S = 3000.",
    "Combine like terms in the equation: 5S = 3000.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for S: S = 3000 / 5.",
    "Calculate the result: S = 600."
  ],
  "solution": "600"
