  "query": "Anna goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision where she gets 14 pieces of candy per house. Her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in a neighboring subdivision where he gets 11 pieces of candy per house. If the first subdivision has 60 houses and the second subdivision has 75 houses, how many more pieces of candy does Anna get?",
  "steps": [
    "Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house she visits.",
    "Billy gets 11 pieces of candy per house he visits.",
    "Anna is visiting 60 houses.",
    "Billy is visiting 75 houses.",
    "To find out how many pieces of candy Anna gets, I need to multiply the number of houses she visits by the number of pieces of candy she gets per house.",
    "Anna's candy: 14 candies/house * 60 houses = 840 candies.",
    "To find out how many pieces of candy Billy gets, I need to multiply the number of houses he visits by the number of pieces of candy he gets per house.",
    "Billy's candy: 11 candies/house * 75 houses = 825 candies.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more pieces of candy Anna gets compared to Billy.",
    "Subtract the number of candies Billy gets from the number of candies Anna gets: 840 candies - 825 candies.",
    "840 - 825 = 15 candies."
