  "query": "Theo can eat 13 cookies, 3 times a day, 20 days each month. How many cookies can he eat in 3 months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cookies Theo eats in one day.",
    "Theo eats 13 cookies each time, and he does this 3 times a day.",
    "So, in one day, he eats 13 cookies * 3 times = 39 cookies.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cookies Theo eats in one month.",
    "I know he eats 39 cookies in one day and he eats cookies 20 days each month.",
    "So, in one month, he eats 39 cookies/day * 20 days/month = 780 cookies.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many cookies he will eat in 3 months.",
    "Since he eats 780 cookies in one month, in 3 months he will eat 780 cookies/month * 3 months = 2340 cookies."
