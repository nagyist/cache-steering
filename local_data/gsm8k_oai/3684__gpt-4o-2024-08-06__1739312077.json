  "query": "Amelia has laundry to do. She has a load of whites that will take 72 minutes in the washing machine and 50 minutes in the dryer. She has a load of darks that will take 58 minutes in the washing machine and 65 minutes in the dryer. She has a load of colors that will take 45 minutes in the washer and 54 minutes in the dryer. If she does one load at a time, how long will it take her to wash and dry all three loads, in minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total time for the load of whites.",
    "The washing time for whites is 72 minutes.",
    "The drying time for whites is 50 minutes.",
    "The total time for the load of whites is 72 + 50 = 122 minutes.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total time for the load of darks.",
    "The washing time for darks is 58 minutes.",
    "The drying time for darks is 65 minutes.",
    "The total time for the load of darks is 58 + 65 = 123 minutes.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total time for the load of colors.",
    "The washing time for colors is 45 minutes.",
    "The drying time for colors is 54 minutes.",
    "The total time for the load of colors is 45 + 54 = 99 minutes.",
    "To find the total time for all three loads, I will add the total times for each load together.",
    "The total time for the whites is 122 minutes.",
    "The total time for the darks is 123 minutes.",
    "The total time for the colors is 99 minutes.",
    "Adding these together: 122 + 123 + 99 = 344 minutes."
