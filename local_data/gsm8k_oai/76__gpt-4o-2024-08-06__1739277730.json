  "query": "A garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers and twice as many peppers than the cucumbers. How many vegetables did the garden produce?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cucumbers were produced.",
    "The problem states that there were 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes.",
    "The number of potatoes is 237.",
    "To find the number of cucumbers, I subtract 60 from 237.",
    "237 - 60 equals 177, so there were 177 cucumbers.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many peppers were produced.",
    "The problem states there were twice as many peppers as cucumbers.",
    "There are 177 cucumbers.",
    "To find the number of peppers, I multiply 177 by 2.",
    "177 times 2 equals 354, so there were 354 peppers.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of vegetables produced.",
    "I have 237 potatoes, 177 cucumbers, and 354 peppers.",
    "To find the total, I add these amounts together: 237 + 177 + 354.",
    "237 plus 177 equals 414.",
    "414 plus 354 equals 768."

  "solution": "768"
