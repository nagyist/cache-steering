    "Hannah has three brothers.",
    "Each of her brothers is 8 years old.",
    "I need to find the sum of the ages of her brothers.",
    "Each brother is 8 years old, and there are three brothers, so I will multiply 8 by 3.",
    "8 multiplied by 3 equals 24.",
    "The sum of her brothers' ages is 24.",
    "Hannah's age is twice the sum of her brothers' ages.",
    "I need to calculate twice the sum, which is 2 times 24.",
    "2 multiplied by 24 equals 48."
