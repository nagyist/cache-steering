  "query": "Autumn was constantly misplacing her pencils.  At the start of the school year, she purchased a pack of 20 pencils.  In the first month of school, she misplaced 7 pencils, broke 3 pencils and had to throw them away, she found 4, and bought 2.  How many pencils did Autumn have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Autumn started with a pack of 20 pencils.",
    "During the first month of school, she misplaced 7 pencils.",
    "This means she had 20 - 7 = 13 pencils left after misplacing.",
    "She broke 3 pencils and had to throw them away.",
    "After throwing away the broken ones, she would have 13 - 3 = 10 pencils remaining.",
    "Autumn found 4 pencils.",
    "Adding the found pencils, she now has 10 + 4 = 14 pencils.",
    "She bought 2 more pencils.",
    "After buying, the total number of pencils increases to 14 + 2 = 16."
