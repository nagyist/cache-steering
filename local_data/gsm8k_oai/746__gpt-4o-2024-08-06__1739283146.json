  "query": "Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to analyze the ratio in which the money was shared. The ratio given is 2:1:3 for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth respectively.",
    "I see that Amy's portion of the ratio is 1 part and she received $50.",
    "This means that 1 part of the ratio corresponds to $50.",
    "Sandra's share of the ratio is 2 parts.",
    "To find out how much Sandra got, I need to calculate 2 parts based on Amy's part.",
    "Since 1 part is $50, I multiply $50 by 2 to calculate Sandra's amount.",
    "$50 times 2 equals $100.",
    "Therefore, Sandra received $100."

  "solution": "100"
