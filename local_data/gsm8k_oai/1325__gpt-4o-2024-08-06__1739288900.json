  "query": "Sally earned $1000 at work last month. This month, she received a 10% raise. How much money will she make in total for the two months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Sally earned in this month alone after receiving the raise.",
    "The original amount she earned was $1000.",
    "She receives a 10% raise on her $1000 salary.",
    "10% of $1000 is calculated as $1000 * 0.10 = $100.",
    "With her raise, Sally's new monthly earning becomes $1000 + $100 = $1100.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total earnings for both months.",
    "Last month, Sally earned $1000.",
    "This month, she earns $1100 after the raise.",
    "The total earnings for the two months is $1000 + $1100.",
    "Adding these amounts together: $1000 + $1100 = $2100."

  "solution": "2100"
