  "query": "Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter reads one book in 18 hours. Therefore, he reads 20 books in 20 x 18 hours.",
    "Calculating Peter's total reading time: 20 x 18 = 360 hours.",
    "Kristin reads at one third the speed of Peter, so each book takes her 3 times longer.",
    "Since Peter reads one book in 18 hours, Kristin reads one book in 18 x 3 hours.",
    "Calculating Kristin's time to read one book: 18 x 3 = 54 hours.",
    "Kristin needs to read 20 books. So, the total time for Kristin to read 20 books is 20 x 54 hours.",
    "Calculating Kristin's total reading time: 20 x 54 = 1080 hours.",
    "We need to calculate how long it will take Kristin to read half of her books, which is 10 books.",
    "The time for Kristin to read 10 books is 10 x 54 hours.",
    "Calculating Kristin's time to read 10 books: 10 x 54 = 540 hours.",
    "Rechecking calculations for any errors.",
    "All calculations appear correct. Kristin will take 540 hours to read half of her books."

  "solution": "540"
