  "query": "Kennedy grew tomatoes from three plants she had in her backyard.  The first tomato plant produced two dozen tomatoes.  The second plant produced 5 more than half as many tomatoes as the first plant.  And the third plant produced two more tomatoes than the second plant.  How many tomatoes did the three plants produce?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many tomatoes the first plant produced. The first plant produced two dozen tomatoes.",
    "Calculate the number of tomatoes from the first plant: 2 dozen means 2 x 12 = 24 tomatoes.",
    "Next, determine how many tomatoes the second plant produced. The second plant produced 5 more than half as many tomatoes as the first plant.",
    "Calculate half of the tomatoes produced by the first plant: 24 / 2 = 12.",
    "Now add 5 to the result for the second plant\u2019s production: 12 + 5 = 17 tomatoes.",
    "Determine how many tomatoes the third plant produced. The third plant produced 2 more tomatoes than the second plant.",
    "Add 2 to the second plant\u2019s production for the third plant\u2019s production: 17 + 2 = 19 tomatoes.",
    "Now, sum the tomatoes produced by all three plants: 24 (first plant) + 17 (second plant) + 19 (third plant).",
    "Calculate the total number of tomatoes: 24 + 17 = 41, then 41 + 19 = 60."
