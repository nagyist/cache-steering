  "query": "Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many toys Bill has, which is given as 60.",
    "Next, I need to find half of the number of toys Bill has.",
    "Half of 60 is 60 divided by 2, which equals 30.",
    "Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, so I add 9 to 30.",
    "30 plus 9 equals 39.",
    "Now I know Hash has 39 toys.",
    "To find the total number of toys the boys have, I add the number of toys Bill has to the number Hash has.",
    "Bill has 60 toys, and Hash has 39 toys.",
    "60 plus 39 equals 99."
