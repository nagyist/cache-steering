  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many erasers Anya has.",
    "I am given that Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea.",
    "Andrea has 4 erasers.",
    "Therefore, to find the number of erasers Anya has, I need to multiply the number of erasers Andrea has by 4.",
    "4 (erasers Andrea has) multiplied by 4 equals 16.",
    "Anya has 16 erasers.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more erasers Anya has than Andrea.",
    "I need to subtract the number of erasers Andrea has from the number of erasers Anya has to find out the difference.",
    "16 (erasers Anya has) minus 4 (erasers Andrea has) equals 12.",
    "Anya has 12 more erasers than Andrea."
