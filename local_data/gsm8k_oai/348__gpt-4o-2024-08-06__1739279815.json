  "query": "Brian can only hold his breath underwater for 10 seconds.  He wants to get better, so he starts practicing.  After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it.  After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week.  The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week.  How long can Brian hold his breath for now?",
  "steps": [
    "Brian can initially hold his breath for 10 seconds.",
    "After the first week, he doubles his time, so 10 seconds becomes 20 seconds.",
    "After the second week, he doubles his time again, so 20 seconds becomes 40 seconds.",
    "In the final week, he increases his 40 seconds by 50%. To find 50% of 40 seconds, I multiply 40 by 0.5.",
    "40 * 0.5 equals 20 seconds.",
    "Adding this 20 seconds to the 40 seconds from the previous week, Brian can now hold his breath for 60 seconds."
