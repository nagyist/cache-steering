    "Next, find out how much Martha spent. Martha spent half as much as Doris.",
    "Calculate half of what Doris spent: $6 / 2 = $3.",
    "Add the amounts Doris and Martha spent together: $6 + $3 = $9.",
    "Subtract the total amount spent from the original amount in the cookie jar: $21 - $9 = $12."
