  "query": "Mrs. Kaplan has 1/4 as many pizza slices as Bobby has. If Bobby has 2 pizzas and each pizza has 6 slices, how many slices does Mrs. Kaplan have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many slices Bobby has in total.",
    "Bobby has 2 pizzas, and each pizza has 6 slices.",
    "I multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 2 pizzas * 6 slices per pizza = 12 slices.",
    "Now I know that Bobby has 12 slices in total.",
    "Mrs. Kaplan has 1/4 as many slices as Bobby.",
    "To find out how many slices Mrs. Kaplan has, I take 1/4 of 12 slices.",
    "I calculate 1/4 of 12 by dividing 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3 slices.",
    "So, Mrs. Kaplan has 3 slices."
