  "query": "Julia collects old watches. She owns 20 silver watches, and three times as many bronze watches. She decided to buy gold watches to add to her collection, a number that represents 10% of all the watches she owns. How many watches does Julia own after this purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying how many bronze watches Julia owns. She has three times as many bronze watches as silver watches.",
    "Since Julia has 20 silver watches, the number of bronze watches will be 3 times 20.",
    "3 times 20 equals 60. So, Julia has 60 bronze watches.",
    "Now, determine the current total number of watches Julia owns before purchasing any gold watches.",
    "Add the number of silver watches (20) and bronze watches (60) together.",
    "20 plus 60 equals 80.",
    "Next, calculate the number of gold watches Julia decides to buy. She decided that the number of gold watches should be 10% of all the watches she currently owns.",
    "10% of 80 is calculated by multiplying 80 by 0.1.",
    "80 times 0.1 equals 8. So, Julia buys 8 gold watches.",
    "Now, calculate the new total number of watches by adding the number of gold watches to the current total.",
    "The previous total number of watches was 80, and she buys 8 gold watches.",
    "Add 80 and 8 together to find the new total number of watches.",
    "80 plus 8 equals 88."

  "solution": "88"
