  "query": "Kimberley, Ela, and Houston all are sent to collect firewood by their grammy. Kimberley collects ten pounds of firewood, and Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood. If the three of them managed to collect a total of 35 pounds of firewood, how many pounds were collected by Ela?",
  "steps": [
    "Kimberley collects 10 pounds.",
    "Houston collects 12 pounds.",
    "The total firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston is 10 + 12 = 22 pounds.",
    "The total firewood collected by all three is 35 pounds.",
    "To find out how much Ela collected, subtract the amount collected by Kimberley and Houston from the total collected.",
    "35 (total) - 22 (Kimberley and Houston) = 13 pounds."
