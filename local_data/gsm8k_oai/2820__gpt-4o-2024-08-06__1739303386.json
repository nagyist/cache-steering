  "query": "Ruth is counting the number of spots on her cow. The cow has 16 spots on its left side and three times that number plus 7 on its right side. How many spots does it have total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of spots on the cow's left side. I already know this number: 16 spots.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of spots on the right side. According to the problem, it's three times the number of spots on the left side plus 7.",
    "I start by calculating three times the number of spots on the left side: 3 \u00d7 16.",
    "3 times 16 is 48.",
    "Now I add 7 to this result to find the number of spots on the right side.",
    "48 + 7 equals 55.",
    "The cow has 55 spots on the right side.",
    "Now I need the total number of spots on the cow, which is the sum of the spots on both sides.",
    "I add the number of spots on the left side (16) to the number of spots on the right side (55).",
    "16 + 55 equals 71."
