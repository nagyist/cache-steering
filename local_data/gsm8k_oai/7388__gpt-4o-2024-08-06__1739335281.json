  "query": "Yella's computer usage last week was 91 hours. If she plans to use the computer 8 hours a day for this week, how much less \u200bis her computer usage for this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Yella plans to use the computer 8 hours a day for this week.",
    "To calculate her planned computer usage for this week, I multiply the number of days in a week by the number of hours she plans to use the computer each day.",
    "So, the calculation is: 8 hours/day * 7 days = 56 hours.",
    "Now, I need to compare her previous week's usage to this week's planned usage to find the difference.",
    "Her computer usage last week was 91 hours.",
    "To find out how much less her usage is this week, I subtract this week's planned usage from last week's usage.",
    "The calculation is: 91 hours (last week) - 56 hours (this week) = 35 hours."
