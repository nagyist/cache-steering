  "query": "John has 3 children. He and his wife are supposed to buy notebooks for their sons but they couldn't agree on how many to buy. So John bought 2 notebooks for each of his children and John's wife bought 5 notebooks for each of them. How many notebooks did they buy in total for their children?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sons John and his wife have. John has 3 children, so I will assume these are all sons, as no other information indicates otherwise.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of notebooks John bought. He bought 2 notebooks for each of his 3 children.",
    "I multiply the number of sons (3) by the number of notebooks John bought for each (2). This results in \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) notebooks.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of notebooks John's wife bought. She bought 5 notebooks for each of the 3 children.",
    "I multiply the number of sons (3) by the number of notebooks John's wife bought for each (5). This results in \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) notebooks.",
    "To find the total number of notebooks purchased by both John and his wife, I add the number of notebooks John bought (6) to the number of notebooks his wife bought (15).",
    "Adding these gives \\(6 + 15 = 21\\) total notebooks."
