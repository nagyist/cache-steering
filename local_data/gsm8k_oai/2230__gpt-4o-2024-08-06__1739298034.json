  "query": "Alfonso earns $6 each day walking his aunt\u2019s dog. He is saving to buy a mountain bike helmet for $340. Currently, he already has $40. If he walks his aunt's dog 5 days a week, in how many weeks should Alfonso work to buy his mountain bike?",
  "steps": [
    "To determine how many weeks Alfonso needs to work, we first need to calculate how much money he still needs to save.",
    "Alfonso needs $340 for the mountain bike helmet, and he currently has $40.",
    "The amount Alfonso still needs is $340 - $40.",
    "This calculation gives us $300.",
    "Next, we calculate how much money Alfonso can save in one week.",
    "He makes $6 each day walking the dog and works 5 days a week.",
    "In one week, Alfonso earns 5 days * $6 per day.",
    "This gives him $30 per week.",
    "Now we need to find out how many weeks he has to work to save the $300 he needs.",
    "We divide the total amount he needs, $300, by his weekly earnings, $30.",
    "$300 \u00f7 $30 equals 10 weeks.",
    "Therefore, Alfonso needs to work for 10 weeks to save enough to buy the mountain bike helmet."
