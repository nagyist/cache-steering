  "query": "Brady gets paid 70 cents for each recipe card he transcribes. He also gets a 10 dollar bonus each time he transcribes 100 cards. If he transcribes 200 cards how much will he earn including bonuses?",
  "steps": [
    "Brady gets paid 70 cents per recipe card.",
    "He transcribes 200 cards in total.",
    "To find out how much he earns from transcribing the cards, I need to multiply the number of cards by the payment per card.",
    "200 cards multiplied by 70 cents per card is 200 * 0.70 dollars.",
    "200 * 0.70 is equal to 140 dollars.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the bonus.",
    "Brady receives a 10 dollar bonus for every 100 cards.",
    "Since he transcribes 200 cards, he qualifies for 2 bonuses.",
    "2 bonuses of 10 dollars each equal 20 dollars.",
    "I need to add the earnings from the cards with the bonus.",
    "140 dollars (from transcription) + 20 dollars (bonus) equals 160 dollars."

  "solution": "160"
