    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the meal and drink.",
    "The cost of the meal is $10 and the drink costs $2.5.",
    "I add the cost of the meal and the drink: $10 + $2.5 = $12.5.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the 20% tip on the total cost.",
    "To find 20% of $12.5, I calculate $12.5 * 0.20.",
    "$12.5 * 0.20 equals $2.5.",
    "I add the tip to the total cost: $12.5 + $2.5 = $15.",
    "Kim pays with a $20 bill.",
    "I subtract the total bill from the amount she paid: $20 - $15.",
    "$20 - $15 equals $5."
