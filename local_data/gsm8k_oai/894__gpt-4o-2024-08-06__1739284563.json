  "query": "Nick has 35 quarters.  2/5 of the quarters are state quarters, and 50 percent of the state quarters are Pennsylvania.  How many Pennsylvania state quarters does Nick have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many of Nick's quarters are state quarters.",
    "Nick has 35 quarters in total.",
    "According to the problem, 2/5 of these quarters are state quarters.",
    "I will calculate how many quarters are state quarters by multiplying 35 by 2/5.",
    "35 multiplied by 2/5 is equal to 35 * (2/5).",
    "35 divided by 5 is equal to 7.",
    "7 multiplied by 2 is equal to 14.",
    "So, Nick has 14 state quarters.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many of these state quarters are Pennsylvania state quarters.",
    "50 percent of the state quarters are Pennsylvania state quarters.",
    "To find out how many of the 14 state quarters are Pennsylvania, I multiply 14 by 0.5 (which is the same as 50 percent).",
    "14 multiplied by 0.5 is equal to 7.",
    "Therefore, Nick has 7 Pennsylvania state quarters."
