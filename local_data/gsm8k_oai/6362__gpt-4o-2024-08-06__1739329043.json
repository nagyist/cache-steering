  "query": "Frank spent 1/5 of his money to buy groceries. He then spent 1/4 of the remaining money to buy a magazine. If he had $360 left in his wallet, how much money did he have at first?",
  "steps": [
    "Frank spent 1/5 of his money on groceries, which means he had 4/5 of his money left.",
    "Let's call the total amount of money Frank had at first \"x\".",
    "After spending on groceries, Frank had (4/5) * x left.",
    "He then spent 1/4 of the remaining money on a magazine.",
    "He was left with 3/4 of the money he had after buying groceries.",
    "So, after purchasing the magazine, he had (3/4) * (4/5) * x left.",
    "We know this remaining amount is $360.",
    "This means (3/4) * (4/5) * x = 360.",
    "Simplifying the expression, (3 * 4)/(4 * 5) * x = 360 reduces to (12/20) * x = 360.",
    "Simplifying further, (3/5) * x = 360.",
    "To solve for x, multiply both sides by 5/3.",
    "x = 360 * (5/3).",
    "360 divided by 3 is 120.",
    "120 multiplied by 5 is 600."

  "solution": "600"
