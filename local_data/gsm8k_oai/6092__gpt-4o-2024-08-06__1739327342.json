  "query": "Part of Stella's job is to restock the toilet paper in each of the 6 bathrooms at the bed and breakfast.  She stocks 1 roll a day, every day of the week.  She buys the toilet paper in bulk, and each pack contains 1 dozen rolls.  After 4 weeks, how many packs of toilet paper dozen Stella buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Stella restocks 1 roll per bathroom per day.",
    "There are 6 bathrooms, so she restocks 6 rolls per day.",
    "Each week has 7 days.",
    "Stella uses 6 rolls per day \u00d7 7 days per week = 42 rolls per week.",
    "4 weeks means she will restock for a total of 4 \u00d7 42 rolls = 168 rolls.",
    "Each pack contains 12 rolls (since one dozen equals 12).",
    "To find the number of packs needed, divide the total number of rolls by the number of rolls in one pack: 168 rolls \u00f7 12 rolls per pack.",
    "168 \u00f7 12 = 14."

  "solution": "14"
