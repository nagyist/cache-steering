  "query": "Harry is a professional dog-walker.  He is paid to go on long walks with dogs while their families are away from home.  On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs.  On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.  And on Thursday he walks 9 dogs.  He is paid $5 for each dog that he walks.  How many dollars does Harry earn in a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate how much Harry earns on Monday by walking 7 dogs.",
    "On Monday, Harry walks 7 dogs and earns $5 per dog. The earnings for Monday are 7 dogs * $5/dog = $35.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much Harry earns on Tuesday by walking 12 dogs.",
    "On Tuesday, Harry walks 12 dogs and earns $5 per dog. The earnings for Tuesday are 12 dogs * $5/dog = $60.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much Harry earns on Wednesday by walking 7 dogs.",
    "On Wednesday, Harry walks 7 dogs and earns $5 per dog. The earnings for Wednesday are 7 dogs * $5/dog = $35.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much Harry earns on Thursday by walking 9 dogs.",
    "On Thursday, Harry walks 9 dogs and earns $5 per dog. The earnings for Thursday are 9 dogs * $5/dog = $45.",
    "Finally, I will calculate how much Harry earns on Friday by walking 7 dogs.",
    "On Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs and earns $5 per dog. The earnings for Friday are 7 dogs * $5/dog = $35.",
    "Now I need to sum up Harry's earnings from each day to find the total weekly earnings.",
    "Total weekly earnings = $35 (Monday) + $60 (Tuesday) + $35 (Wednesday) + $45 (Thursday) + $35 (Friday).",
    "Let's add them together: $35 + $60 = $95, then $95 + $35 = $130, then $130 + $45 = $175, and finally $175 + $35 = $210."
