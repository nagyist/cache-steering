  "query": "Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much this time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim. If Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, how many days did it take Joey to learn swimming?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time Alexa spent on vacation. She spent a week and 2 days on vacation.",
    "A week is equal to 7 days. So, a week and 2 days means 7 + 2 = 9 days.",
    "Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks.",
    "Let's denote the time Ethan took to learn the tricks as E days. According to the problem, 3/4 of E equals 9 days.",
    "Mathematically, that can be expressed as (3/4) * E = 9.",
    "To find E, I need to solve for E in the equation (3/4) * E = 9.",
    "To isolate E, I will multiply both sides by 4/3: E = 9 * (4/3).",
    "Calculating the right side: E = 9 * 4/3 = 12.",
    "So, Ethan took 12 days to learn the 12 fencing tricks.",
    "Now, according to the problem, Joey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim.",
    "Joey's time is half of Ethan's time, so I will divide Ethan's 12 days by 2.",
    "12 days / 2 = 6 days."

  "solution": "6"
