  "query": "A crayon factory makes 4 colors of crayons. They put 2 of each color crayon in each box. The factory produces enough crayons to fill 5 boxes per hour. How many crayons does the factory produce in 4 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many crayons are in one box.",
    "There are 2 of each color in a box and 4 colors.",
    "So one box contains 2 crayons per color times 4 colors, which is 2 * 4.",
    "Therefore, each box contains 8 crayons.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many boxes are produced in 4 hours.",
    "The factory produces 5 boxes per hour.",
    "In 4 hours, they would produce 5 boxes/hour * 4 hours.",
    "5 boxes/hour * 4 hours = 20 boxes.",
    "Each box contains 8 crayons.",
    "So the total number of crayons produced is 20 boxes * 8 crayons/box.",
    "20 boxes * 8 crayons/box = 160 crayons.",
    "Thus, the factory produces 160 crayons in 4 hours."

  "solution": "160"
