  "query": "Sam bought a heavy safe with a combination lock. There were four rows with twenty gold bars per row arranged in the safe. If each gold bar is worth $20000, calculate the total worth of the gold bars in the safe.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of gold bars in the safe.",
    "Each row has twenty gold bars, and there are four rows.",
    "To find the total number of gold bars, I will multiply the number of rows by the number of gold bars per row: \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\).",
    "The safe contains 80 gold bars in total.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total worth of all the gold bars in the safe.",
    "Each gold bar is worth $20000.",
    "To find the total worth, I will multiply the number of gold bars by the worth of each bar: \\(80 \\times 20000\\).",
    "Calculate \\(80 \\times 20000\\).",
    "\\(80 \\times 20000 = 1600000\\).",
    "The total worth of the gold bars in the safe is $1,600,000."
