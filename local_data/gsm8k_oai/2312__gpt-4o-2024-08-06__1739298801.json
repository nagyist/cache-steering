She asks her mother, as well as her brother, to help her raise the total amount of money she needs to buy the gift.,If her mother gave her 3/5 times of what she had saved and her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her, calculate the price of the gift she wanted to buy if she still had $400 less.",
  "steps": [
    "Lisa initially saved $1200.",
    "Her mother gave her 3/5 times the amount of what Lisa had saved.",
    "Calculate how much her mother gave her: (3/5) * $1200 = $720.",
    "Her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her.",
    "Calculate how much her brother gave her: 2 * $720 = $1440.",
    "Add up all the amounts to find the total amount Lisa has.",
    "Total amount Lisa has = $1200 (initial) + $720 (from mother) + $1440 (from brother).",
    "Total amount Lisa has = $3360.",
    "She still had $400 less than the price of the gift.",
    "Add $400 to her total amount to find the price of the gift.",
    "Price of the gift = $3360 + $400 = $3760."
