  "query": "Mr. Dubois buys a new car for $13,380. He pays $5,400 and pays the rest by giving $420 a month. In how many months will the car be fully paid for?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount due that Mr. Dubois needs to pay through monthly installments.",
    "The total cost of the car is $13,380.",
    "Mr. Dubois initially pays $5,400.",
    "To find out how much more Mr. Dubois needs to pay, I must subtract the initial payment from the total cost.",
    "Subtracting the initial payment: $13,380 - $5,400 = $7,980.",
    "So, the remaining amount Mr. Dubois needs to pay is $7,980.",
    "He pays $420 each month toward this remaining balance.",
    "To find out how many months it will take to pay off $7,980 with monthly payments of $420, I will divide $7,980 by $420.",
    "Performing the division: $7,980 \u00f7 $420 = 19.",
    "Thus, it will take 19 months for Mr. Dubois to fully pay the remaining balance of the car."
