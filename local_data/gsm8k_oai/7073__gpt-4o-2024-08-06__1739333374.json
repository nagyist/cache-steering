  "query": "Leila spent 3/4 of her savings on make-up and the rest on a sweater. If the sweater cost her $20, what were her original savings?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote Leila's original savings as \\( S \\).",
    "She spent \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of her savings on make-up.",
    "The remaining savings went towards the sweater.",
    "Since the sweater cost $20, this means she spent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of her savings on the sweater.",
    "We can express this as: \\(\\frac{1}{4}S = 20\\).",
    "To find her original savings (\\( S \\)), we need to solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{4}S = 20\\).",
    "Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \\( S \\).",
    "\\( S = 20 \\times 4 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 20 \\times 4 \\) to find \\( S \\).",
    "\\( S = 80 \\)."
