  "query": "Jake agrees to work part of his debt off.  He owed someone $100 but paid them $40 before agreeing to work off the rest.   He worked for $15 an hour.  How many hours did he have to work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Jake still owes after paying $40.",
    "Jake originally owed $100 and paid $40, so I subtract $40 from $100.",
    "$100 - $40 equals $60. So, Jake still owes $60.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many hours Jake needs to work at $15 an hour to pay off the remaining $60.",
    "I will divide the remaining debt, which is $60, by the hourly wage, which is $15.",
    "$60 \u00f7 $15 equals 4."
