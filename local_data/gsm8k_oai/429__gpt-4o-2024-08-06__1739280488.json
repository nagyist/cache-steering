  "query": "In the school's library, there are 2300 different books. 80% of all the books are in English, but only 60% of these books were published in the country. How many English-language books have been published outside the country?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of the 2300 books are in English.",
    "Since 80% of the books are in English, I calculate 80% of 2300.",
    "80% of 2300 is calculated as (80/100) * 2300.",
    "This equals 0.8 * 2300, which is 1840.",
    "So, there are 1840 books in English.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these English books were published in the country.",
    "60% of the English books were published in the country.",
    "I calculate 60% of 1840.",
    "60% of 1840 is (60/100) * 1840.",
    "This equals 0.6 * 1840, which is 1104.",
    "So, 1104 English books were published in the country.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many English books were published outside the country.",
    "This is the total number of English books minus the number published in the country.",
    "1840 English books minus 1104 books published in-country equals 736.",
    "Therefore, 736 English-language books have been published outside the country."

  "solution": "736"
