  "query": "Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of people in Alice's class, which includes both students and instructors.",
    "There are 40 students and 10 instructors, for a total of 40 + 10 = 50 people in the class.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of the students are bringing their own life vests.",
    "20% of the students are bringing life vests. I calculate 20% of 40 students: 40 * 0.20 = 8 students are bringing life vests.",
    "Since 8 students are bringing their own life vests, I can subtract these from the total number of people who need to be provided with life vests by Alice.",
    "50 people total in the class minus 8 students bringing their own life vests leaves 50 - 8 = 42 people needing life vests.",
    "Alice currently has 20 life vests on hand.",
    "I need to calculate how many additional life vests are needed for 42 people. Thus, 42 - 20 = 22 more life vests are needed."

  "solution": "22"
