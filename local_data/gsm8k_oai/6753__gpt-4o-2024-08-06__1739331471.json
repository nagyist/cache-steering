  "query": "Amanda has to sell 80 tickets in 3 days so she can make enough money to go on vacation. On the first day, she sells 5 of her friends 4 tickets each. On the second day she sells 32 tickets. How many tickets does she need to sell on the third day to meet her goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Amanda needs to sell a total of 80 tickets.",
    "On the first day, she sells 5 friends 4 tickets each.",
    "5 friends times 4 tickets each equals 20 tickets sold on the first day.",
    "On the second day, she sells 32 additional tickets.",
    "So far, Amanda has sold 20 tickets on the first day and 32 tickets on the second day.",
    "Adding these together: 20 + 32 equals 52 tickets sold by the end of the second day.",
    "Amanda needs to sell 80 tickets in total. She has already sold 52 tickets.",
    "To find out how many more tickets she needs to sell, subtract the tickets she has already sold from the total number of tickets needed: 80 - 52.",
    "80 minus 52 equals 28 tickets."
