  "query": "Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Mac can run at a rate of 4 miles per hour. In minutes, how much faster will Mac run a 24 mile race?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how long it takes Apple to run a 24 mile race.",
    "Apple runs at a rate of 3 miles per hour. To find the time it takes Apple to run 24 miles, I divide the 24 miles by that rate.",
    "24 miles \u00f7 3 miles per hour = 8 hours",
    "Now I need to calculate how long it takes Mac to run the same 24 mile race.",
    "Mac runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour. I will divide the 24 miles by Mac's rate to find the time.",
    "24 miles \u00f7 4 miles per hour = 6 hours",
    "To find out how much faster Mac is, I need to calculate the difference in time it takes each of them to finish the race.",
    "Apple takes 8 hours and Mac takes 6 hours. The difference is 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours.",
    "The question asks for the answer in minutes, so I need to convert 2 hours to minutes.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours \u00d7 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes."

  "solution": "120"
