  "query": "John builds a box.  The box is 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick on each side.  How much is the internal volume in cubic feet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that the box is a rectangular prism with outer dimensions 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.",
    "I remember that each wall has a thickness of 1 inch. Therefore, to find the internal dimensions, I need to subtract twice the thickness of the walls from each external dimension (since there are walls on both sides).",
    "I calculate the internal length. The external length is 26 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick on both sides. So, the internal length is 26 - 2 * 1 = 24 inches.",
    "I calculate the internal width in the same way. The external width is 26 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick on both sides. So, the internal width is 26 - 2 * 1 = 24 inches.",
    "I calculate the internal height. The external height is 14 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick on both top and bottom. So, the internal height is 14 - 2 * 1 = 12 inches.",
    "Now, I have the internal dimensions: length = 24 inches, width = 24 inches, height = 12 inches.",
    "Next, I calculate the internal volume in cubic inches. Volume = length * width * height = 24 * 24 * 12.",
    "I perform the multiplication: 24 * 24 = 576.",
    "Then I multiply 576 by 12 to get the volume in cubic inches: 576 * 12 = 6912 cubic inches.",
    "Finally, I convert from cubic inches to cubic feet. I know there are 12 * 12 * 12 = 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot.",
    "I divide 6912 cubic inches by 1728 cubic inches per cubic foot: 6912 / 1728 = 4."
