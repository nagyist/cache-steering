  "query": "Mark is injured so decides to spend more time reading.  He used to read 2 hours a day but increased that by 150%.  Before he read 100 pages a day.  How many pages does he read a week now?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to understand how Mark's reading time has increased.",
    "Mark increased his reading time by 150%.",
    "Initially, Mark was reading for 2 hours a day.",
    "150% of 2 hours is 1.5 times 2 hours, which equals 3 hours.",
    "So, he increased his reading time by 3 hours.",
    "Mark's new reading time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours a day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pages he reads in this new duration of 5 hours.",
    "Initially, Mark read 100 pages in 2 hours.",
    "I need to find out how many pages he now reads in 1 hour.",
    "If he read 100 pages in 2 hours, then in 1 hour he read 100/2 = 50 pages.",
    "Therefore, in 5 hours, he would read 50 pages/hour * 5 hours = 250 pages.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pages he would read in a week.",
    "He reads 250 pages a day now.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "So in a week, he reads 250 pages/day * 7 days = 1750 pages."

  "solution": "1750"
