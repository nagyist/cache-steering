  "query": "Unique is making biscuits. She has a sheet of dough that is 12 inches by 12 inches. She makes square biscuits and each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches. How many biscuits can she make with this dough?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the dough.",
    "The dimensions of the dough are 12 inches by 12 inches.",
    "The area of the dough is 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches.",
    "Next, I need to find the area of one biscuit.",
    "Each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches.",
    "The area of one biscuit is 3 inches * 3 inches = 9 square inches.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many biscuits can fit into the entire area of the dough.",
    "To do this, I divide the total area of the dough by the area of one biscuit.",
    "144 square inches / 9 square inches per biscuit = 16 biscuits.",
    "I should also consider how the biscuits fit onto the sheet, but since both the sheet and the biscuits are perfectly square, they should fit exactly without cutting issues."

  "solution": "16"
