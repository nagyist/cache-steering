  "query": "Travis and his brother joined a trick-or-treat event. They collected 68 pieces of candy altogether. Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy after the event. How many pieces of candy were left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pieces of candy Travis and his brother ate in total.",
    "Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy.",
    "So, the total number of pieces of candy they ate is 4 pieces each multiplied by 2 people.",
    "This means they ate 4 * 2 = 8 pieces of candy in total.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the number of pieces of candy they ate from the total number of pieces they collected.",
    "They collected 68 pieces of candy altogether.",
    "Subtract the 8 pieces they ate from the 68 pieces they collected.",
    "68 - 8 = 60 pieces of candy."

  "solution": "60"
