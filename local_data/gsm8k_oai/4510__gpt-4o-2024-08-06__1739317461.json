  "query": "Mark is 18 years old. He has a little brother, John, who is 10 years younger. If John and Mark's parents are currently 5 times older than John, how old were they when Mark was born?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark is 18 years old.",
    "John is 10 years younger than Mark.",
    "Therefore, John is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.",
    "John and Mark's parents are currently 5 times older than John.",
    "5 times John's age means 5 * 8 = 40 years old.",
    "The parents are 40 years old now.",
    "We need to find how old the parents were when Mark was born.",
    "Mark is 18 years old now, so he was born 18 years ago.",
    "To find the age of the parents when Mark was born, we subtract 18 years from their current age.",
    "40 - 18 = 22 years old."

  "solution": "22"
