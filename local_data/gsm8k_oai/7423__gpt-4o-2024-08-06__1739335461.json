    "First, I need to understand the cost price and selling price of the rice.",
    "The total weight of the sack of rice is 50 kilograms.",
    "The total cost of the sack is $50.",
    "David's selling price is $1.20 per kilogram.",
    "I will calculate how much David earns by selling the entire 50 kilograms of rice.",
    "The selling price for 50 kilograms is 50 kg \u00d7 $1.20/kg = $60.",
    "Now, I need to calculate David's profit by subtracting the cost from the selling price.",
    "Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = $60 - $50 = $10."
