  "query": "Carla is making smoothies. If she uses 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, how many 150 ml servings can she make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total volume of the ingredients she is using.",
    "Carla uses 500 ml of watermelon puree.",
    "She also uses 100 ml of cream.",
    "I add these amounts together: 500 ml + 100 ml.",
    "The total volume of the ingredients is 600 ml.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 150 ml servings can be made from 600 ml.",
    "I divide the total volume by the serving size: 600 ml \u00f7 150 ml.",
    "600 divided by 150 is 4.",
    "Carla can make 4 servings of 150 ml each with the total volume available."
