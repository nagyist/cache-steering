  "query": "A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people are sharing the chocolate bars. The problem mentions Mike, Rita, and Anita.",
    "Since there are three people, the 12 bars are shared equally among them.",
    "To find out how many bars each person gets, I need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of people, which is 3.",
    "12 bars divided by 3 people equals 4 bars per person.",
    "Mike and Rita are two of the people sharing the bars. Since each gets 4 bars, I calculate the combined total for Mike and Rita.",
    "I add the 4 bars that Mike gets to the 4 bars that Rita gets.",
    "4 bars (Mike) + 4 bars (Rita) equals 8 bars for Mike and Rita combined."

  "solution": "8"
