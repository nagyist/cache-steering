  "query": "James decides to buy a living room set.  The coach cost $2500 and the sectional cost $3500 and everything else has a combined cost of $2000.  He gets a 10% discount on everything.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of everything before the discount. This includes the coach, sectional, and everything else.",
    "The coach costs $2500.",
    "The sectional costs $3500.",
    "Everything else costs $2000.",
    "Now, I will add all these costs together: $2500 (coach) + $3500 (sectional) + $2000 (everything else).",
    "Adding these amounts gives me: $2500 + $3500 + $2000 = $8000.",
    "The total cost before the discount is $8000.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the 10% discount on the total cost.",
    "To find 10% of $8000, I will multiply $8000 by 0.10.",
    "Calculating the discount: $8000 * 0.10 = $800.",
    "The discount amount is $800.",
    "To find out how much James paid, I need to subtract the discount from the total cost.",
    "Subtracting the discount from the total cost: $8000 - $800 = $7200.",
    "James paid $7200 after the discount."

  "solution": "7200"
