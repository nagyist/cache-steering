    "To find out the total number of dresses sewn in the first 7 days, I need to multiply 2 dresses per day by 7 days.",
    "2 dresses/day * 7 days = 14 dresses",

    "To find out the total number of dresses sewn in these 2 days, I multiply 3 dresses per day by 2 days.",
    "3 dresses/day * 2 days = 6 dresses",
