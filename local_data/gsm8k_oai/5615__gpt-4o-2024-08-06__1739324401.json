  "query": "Kevin repairs phones at his job. At the beginning of the day, Kevin has 15 phones that need to be repaired. By the afternoon, Kevin has successfully repaired 3 of the 15 phones and a client has dropped off 6 more phones that need fixing. If a coworker of Kevin's offers to help him and fix half of the damaged phones, how many phones will each person need to repair?",
  "steps": [
    "At the beginning of the day, Kevin has 15 phones to repair.",
    "Kevin repairs 3 phones by the afternoon, so 15 - 3 = 12 phones are left for repair.",
    "In the afternoon, 6 more phones are added to the list, so 12 + 6 = 18 phones now need repairing.",
    "A coworker offers to fix half of the damaged phones. Therefore, the total number of phones, 18, should be divided equally between Kevin and his coworker.",
    "18 divided by 2 equals 9. Therefore, each person will need to repair 9 phones."

  "solution": "9"
