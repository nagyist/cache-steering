  "query": "There are 350 trees in the park, 70% of which are pine trees. How many are not pine trees?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of the 350 trees are pine trees.",
    "To find this, I calculate 70% of 350.",
    "70% can be expressed as the fraction 70/100, which simplifies to 0.7.",
    "I multiply 350 by 0.7 to find the number of pine trees.",
    "350 multiplied by 0.7 equals 245.",
    "There are 245 pine trees in the park.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of trees that are not pine trees.",
    "To do this, I subtract the number of pine trees from the total number of trees.",
    "350 trees total minus 245 pine trees equals 105.",
    "Therefore, there are 105 trees that are not pine trees in the park."
