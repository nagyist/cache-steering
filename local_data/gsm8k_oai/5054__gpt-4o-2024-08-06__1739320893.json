  "query": "Jaymee is 2 years older than twice the age of Shara. If Shara is 10 years old, how old is Jaymee?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Shara's age, which is given as 10 years old.",
    "I need to find twice Shara's age. Since Shara is 10, twice her age is 10 multiplied by 2.",
    "10 multiplied by 2 equals 20.",
    "Now, I need to add 2 years to this result because Jaymee is 2 years older than twice Shara's age.",
    "20 plus 2 equals 22."
  ],
  "solution": "22"
