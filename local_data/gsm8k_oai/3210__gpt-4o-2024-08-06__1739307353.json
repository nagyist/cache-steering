  "query": "Anna has a certain number of phone chargers and five times more laptop chargers than phone chargers. If she has 24 chargers total, how many phone chargers does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of phone chargers be represented by \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Anna has five times more laptop chargers than phone chargers. Therefore, the number of laptop chargers is \\( 5x \\).",
    "The total number of chargers (phone and laptop) is given as 24.",
    "Set up an equation based on the total chargers: \\( x + 5x = 24 \\).",
    "Combine the terms on the left side of the equation: \\( 6x = 24 \\).",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 4 \\).",
    "Check the solution: Substituting back, if \\( x = 4 \\), then the number of phone chargers is 4 and the number of laptop chargers is \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\).",
    "Adding these gives the total number of chargers: \\( 4 + 20 = 24 \\), which matches the total given in the problem."
