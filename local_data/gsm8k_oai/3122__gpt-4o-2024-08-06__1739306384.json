  "query": "Matthew and his brother Shawn played swimming-pool-basketball. Each basket was worth 3 points. Matthew scored 9 points. Shawn scored 6 points. What is the total number of baskets made during this game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many baskets Matthew made. Since each basket is worth 3 points, and Matthew scored 9 points, I will divide 9 by 3.",
    "9 divided by 3 is 3. So, Matthew made 3 baskets.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many baskets Shawn made. Shawn scored 6 points, and each basket is worth 3 points. Therefore, I will divide 6 by 3.",
    "6 divided by 3 is 2. So, Shawn made 2 baskets.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of baskets made by adding the number of baskets made by Matthew and Shawn.",
    "Matthew made 3 baskets, and Shawn made 2 baskets. When I add them together, 3 plus 2 equals 5."
