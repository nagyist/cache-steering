  "query": "Collin learned that he could earn $0.25 per aluminum can that he brought into the recycling center.  He found 12 cans at home and three times as many at his grandparents' house.   His neighbor gave him 46.  His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.  His dad told him he could keep the money from the cans he brought home from the office if he promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings.  How much money would Collin have to put into savings?",
  "steps": [
    "Collin found 12 cans at home.",
    "He found three times as many at his grandparents' house.",
    "Calculate the cans from his grandparents' house: 3 times 12 is 36.",
    "His neighbor gave him 46 cans.",
    "His dad brought 250 cans from the office.",
    "Add all the cans together to find the total: 12 (home) + 36 (grandparents) + 46 (neighbor) + 250 (dad) = 344 cans.",
    "He earns $0.25 per can.",
    "Calculate the total money earned from 344 cans: 344 cans \u00d7 $0.25 per can = $86.00.",
    "Collin's dad said he should put half of his entire earnings into savings.",
    "Calculate half of $86.00: $86.00 \u00d7 0.5 = $43.00."
