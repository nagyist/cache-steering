  "query": "In one hour, Addison mountain's temperature will decrease to 3/4  of its temperature. If the current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees, what will the temperature decrease by?",
  "steps": [
    "The current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees.",
    "In the next hour, the temperature will decrease to 3/4 of its current temperature.",
    "Calculate 3/4 of the current temperature, which is 3/4 * 84.",
    "First, calculate 3 * 84, which is 252.",
    "Next, divide 252 by 4 to find 3/4 of 84.",
    "252 divided by 4 equals 63.",
    "The temperature in an hour will be 63 degrees.",
    "Calculate the temperature decrease by subtracting the future temperature from the current temperature.",
    "84 (current temperature) minus 63 (temperature in an hour) equals 21."
