  "query": "John buys a lightsaber toy.  It is twice as expensive as all his other Star Wars toys combined.  If his other Star Wars toys cost $1000, how much money has he spent in all after buying the lightsaber?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of the lightsaber toy.",
    "I know the lightsaber is twice as expensive as all of John's other Star Wars toys combined.",
    "The cost of the other Star Wars toys is $1000.",
    "Twice the cost of the other Star Wars toys is 2 * $1000, which equals $2000.",
    "Therefore, the lightsaber costs $2000.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total amount of money John has spent.",
    "The total spending is the cost of the lightsaber plus the cost of the other Star Wars toys.",
    "The total cost is $2000 (lightsaber) + $1000 (other toys).",
    "The total money spent by John is $3000."

  "solution": "3000"
