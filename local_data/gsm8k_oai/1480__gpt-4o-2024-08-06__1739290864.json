  "query": "Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many scoops of ice cream Oli has in his banana split.",
    "Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Victoria has compared to Oli.",
    "Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli.",
    "Twice as many scoops would mean multiplying the number of Oli's scoops by 2.",
    "Victoria's scoops = 4 scoops (Oli's) x 2 = 8 scoops.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more scoops Victoria has than Oli.",
    "This can be found by subtracting the number of Oli's scoops from the number of Victoria's scoops.",
    "Victoria's extra scoops = 8 scoops (Victoria's) - 4 scoops (Oli's) = 4 more scoops."
