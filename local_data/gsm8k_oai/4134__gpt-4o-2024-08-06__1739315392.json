  "query": "Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?",
  "steps": [
    "I recall that for a right-angle triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the Pythagorean theorem: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.",
    "In this triangle, the base \\(a\\) is 4 inches and the height \\(b\\) is 3 inches. I need to find the length of the hypotenuse \\(c\\).",
    "I will use the Pythagorean theorem by substituting the values: \\(4^2 + 3^2 = c^2\\).",
    "Calculating \\(4^2\\) gives me \\(16\\).",
    "Calculating \\(3^2\\) gives me \\(9\\).",
    "I add these two results: \\(16 + 9 = 25\\).",
    "Now, I take the square root of 25 to find \\(c\\).",
    "The square root of 25 is 5.",
    "So, the length of the hypotenuse \\(c\\) is 5 inches.",
    "Next, to find the perimeter of the triangle, I need to sum up all the sides: base, height, and hypotenuse.",
    "The base is 4 inches, the height is 3 inches, and the hypotenuse is 5 inches.",
    "Adding these sides gives me \\(4 + 3 + 5 = 12\\)."
