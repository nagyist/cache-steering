  "query": "Carrie is wrapping three birthday presents. One present needs two square feet of wrapping paper to cover. The second present needs three-quarters of that amount. The third present needs the same amount as both other presents put together. How many square feet of wrapping paper does Carrie need for all three presents?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the amount of wrapping paper required for each present. The first present requires 2 square feet of wrapping paper.",
    "For the second present, it needs three-quarters of the amount required for the first present.",
    "To calculate the amount for the second present, I multiply the wrapping paper requirement of the first present by three-quarters: 2 square feet * 3/4.",
    "2 square feet * 3/4 is equal to 1.5 square feet.",
    "The second present requires 1.5 square feet of wrapping paper.",
    "The third present needs the same amount of wrapping paper as both the other presents put together.",
    "To find the total amount required for the first and second presents, I add their amounts together: 2 square feet + 1.5 square feet.",
    "2 + 1.5 equals 3.5 square feet.",
    "The third present requires 3.5 square feet of wrapping paper.",
    "Now, I need to find the total wrapping paper required by adding the amounts for all three presents together.",
    "Add the wrapping paper required for the first present (2 square feet), the second present (1.5 square feet), and the third present (3.5 square feet).",
    "2 + 1.5 + 3.5 equals 7 square feet."

  "solution": "7"
