  "query": "There are 516 cars in a parking lot. One-third are blue, one-half are red, and the rest are black. How many black cars are on the lot?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many cars are blue and how many are red first.",
    "One-third of the cars are blue. So, I need to calculate 1/3 of 516.",
    "1/3 * 516 = 516 / 3.",
    "516 divided by 3 equals 172.",
    "So, there are 172 blue cars.",
    "Next, calculate how many cars are red.",
    "One-half of the cars are red. So, I calculate 1/2 of 516.",
    "1/2 * 516 = 516 / 2.",
    "516 divided by 2 equals 258.",
    "So, there are 258 red cars.",
    "Now I know there are 172 blue cars and 258 red cars.",
    "To find the number of black cars, subtract the number of blue and red cars from the total.",
    "516 total cars - 172 blue cars - 258 red cars equals the number of black cars.",
    "516 - 172 = 344.",
    "344 - 258 = 86.",
    "So, there are 86 black cars."
