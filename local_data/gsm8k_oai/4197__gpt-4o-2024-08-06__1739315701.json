  "query": "Chantal knits sweaters to sell. Each sweater takes 4 balls of yarn. Each ball of yarn costs $6. How much money will Chantal gain in all 28 sweaters if she sells each sweater for $35?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of yarn for 28 sweaters.",
    "Each sweater takes 4 balls of yarn, and Chantal is making 28 sweaters.",
    "28 sweaters times 4 balls of yarn per sweater equals 112 balls of yarn needed.",
    "Each ball of yarn costs $6.",
    "112 balls of yarn times $6 per ball equals $672 as the total cost of the yarn.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling the 28 sweaters.",
    "Each sweater sells for $35.",
    "28 sweaters times $35 per sweater equals $980 in total revenue.",
    "To find the total gain, I need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "$980 (total revenue) minus $672 (total cost) equals $308."

  "solution": "308"
