  "query": "Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining the rate at which eggs are laid with the original 10 hens over the 10 days.",
    "10 hens lay 80 eggs in 10 days.",
    "Calculate the egg-laying rate per hen per day.",
    "80 eggs / 10 hens / 10 days = 0.8 eggs per hen per day.",
    "Calculate the total number of hens after Martin buys 15 more hens.",
    "10 hens + 15 hens = 25 hens.",
    "Compute the total number of eggs laid by 25 hens in one day with the rate found earlier.",
    "25 hens * 0.8 eggs per hen per day = 20 eggs per day.",
    "Determine the total number of eggs laid in 15 days by the 25 hens.",
    "20 eggs per day * 15 days = 300 eggs."
