  "query": "John climbs up 9 flights of stairs.  Each flight is 10 feet.  If each step is 18 inches, how many steps does he climb up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total height John climbs in feet.",
    "John climbs 9 flights of stairs.",
    "Each flight is 10 feet high.",
    "I multiply 9 flights by 10 feet per flight to find the total height climbed in feet: 9 x 10 = 90 feet.",
    "Next, I need to convert the total height from feet to inches because each step is measured in inches.",
    "There are 12 inches in one foot.",
    "I multiply 90 feet by 12 inches per foot to convert the total height to inches: 90 x 12 = 1080 inches.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many steps John climbs.",
    "Each step is 18 inches high.",
    "I divide the total height in inches (1080 inches) by the height of each step (18 inches) to find the total number of steps: 1080 \u00f7 18.",
    "1080 \u00f7 18 = 60.",
    "John climbs a total of 60 steps."

  "solution": "60"
