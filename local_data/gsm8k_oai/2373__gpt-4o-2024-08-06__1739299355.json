  "query": "There are 60 passengers on a bus. Children make up 25% of the bus riders. How many adults are on the bus?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many children are on the bus.",
    "I know that children make up 25% of the bus riders.",
    "There are 60 passengers in total.",
    "To find out how many children there are, I need to calculate 25% of 60.",
    "25% as a fraction is 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4.",
    "To find 1/4 of 60, I divide 60 by 4.",
    "60 divided by 4 is 15.",
    "There are 15 children on the bus.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many adults are on the bus.",
    "To find the number of adults, I subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers.",
    "60 (total passengers) minus 15 (children) equals 45."
