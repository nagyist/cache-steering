  "query": "Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of crayons Madeline has in 5 boxes.",
    "Each box has 24 crayons. Therefore, Madeline has 5 boxes x 24 crayons/box = 120 crayons in total.",
    "Now, consider the first two boxes. These contain 2 x 24 = 48 crayons.",
    "In these two boxes, 5/8 of the crayons were not yet used.",
    "Calculate the number of unused crayons in the first two boxes: (5/8) x 48 = 30.",
    "Next, consider the second set of boxes, which are also 2 boxes with 2 x 24 = 48 crayons.",
    "In these two boxes, 2/3 of the crayons were used. Therefore, 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the crayons are unused.",
    "Calculate the number of unused crayons in the second pair of boxes: (1/3) x 48 = 16.",
    "Consider the last box, which contains 24 crayons. We know it was not entirely used, but information is provided on unused crayons in the question, so assume all are considered.",
    "Since no specific information suggests some were used, assume all 24 crayons in the last box remain unused.",
    "Add the numbers of unused crayons from each set: 30 (from first 2 boxes) + 16 (from second 2 boxes) + 24 (last box) = 70 total unused crayons."

  "solution": "70"
