  "query": "Mr. Sam shared a certain amount of money between his two sons, Ken and Tony. If Ken got $1750, and Tony got twice as much as Ken, how much was the money shared?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Tony received.",
    "The problem states that Tony got twice as much as Ken.",
    "Ken received $1750.",
    "Twice $1750 is calculated by multiplying $1750 by 2.",
    "$1750 multiplied by 2 equals $3500.",
    "Tony received $3500.",
    "To find the total amount shared by Mr. Sam, I need to add the amounts received by Ken and Tony together.",
    "Ken received $1750, and Tony received $3500.",
    "Adding $1750 and $3500 gives me the total amount of money shared.",
    "$1750 plus $3500 equals $5250."
