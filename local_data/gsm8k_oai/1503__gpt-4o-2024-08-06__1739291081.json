  "query": "Jerome has 20 classmates on his cell phone contact list.  He has half as many out of school friends as classmates on his contact list.  He also has his two parents and his sister on his contact list.  How many people are on Jerome's contact list?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerome has 20 classmates on his contact list.",
    "He has half as many out of school friends as classmates.",
    "Since he has 20 classmates, half of that is 20 / 2 = 10 out of school friends.",
    "Jerome also has his two parents on his contact list.",
    "Additionally, Jerome has his sister on his contact list.",
    "Now, I will add up all the contacts: 20 classmates + 10 out of school friends + 2 parents + 1 sister.",
    "20 + 10 + 2 + 1 equals 33."
