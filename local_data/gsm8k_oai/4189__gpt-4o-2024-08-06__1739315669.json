  "query": "In eight years, Mr. Bernard will be 3 times as old as Luke is now. If Luke is 20, what is 10 years less than their average age?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how old Luke is currently. According to the information, Luke is 20 years old.",
    "The next step is to find out how old Mr. Bernard will be in eight years. The problem states that in eight years, Mr. Bernard's age will be 3 times Luke's current age.",
    "Luke's current age is 20. Therefore, 3 times Luke's age is 3 x 20 = 60.",
    "In eight years, Mr. Bernard will be 60 years old.",
    "To find Mr. Bernard's current age, I need to subtract 8 years from the 60 years he will be in the future.",
    "Mr. Bernard's current age is 60 - 8 = 52.",
    "Now that I know Mr. Bernard is currently 52 years old and Luke is 20 years old, I can calculate their average age.",
    "The average age is calculated by adding their ages together and dividing by 2: (52 + 20) / 2 = 72 / 2 = 36.",
    "According to the problem, I need to find 10 years less than their average age.",
    "10 years less than their average age of 36 is 36 - 10 = 26."
