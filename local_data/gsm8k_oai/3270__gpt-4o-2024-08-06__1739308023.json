  "query": "Granger went to the grocery store. He saw that the Spam is $3 per can, the peanut butter is $5 per jar, and the bread is $2 per loaf. If he bought 12 cans of spam, 3 jars of peanut butter, and 4 loaves of bread, how much is the total amount he paid?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the Spam. Each can costs $3 and Granger bought 12 cans.",
    "The cost for the Spam is 12 cans times $3 per can.",
    "12 times 3 equals $36.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the peanut butter. Each jar costs $5 and Granger bought 3 jars.",
    "The cost for the peanut butter is 3 jars times $5 per jar.",
    "3 times 5 equals $15.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for the bread. Each loaf costs $2 and Granger bought 4 loaves.",
    "The cost for the bread is 4 loaves times $2 per loaf.",
    "4 times 2 equals $8.",
    "Now, I will add the total costs together to find the overall total.",
    "The total cost is $36 for the Spam plus $15 for the peanut butter plus $8 for the bread.",
    "Adding these amounts: 36 plus 15 equals 51, and 51 plus 8 equals 59."

  "solution": "59"
