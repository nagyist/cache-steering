  "query": "Justin needs to collect one flower for each classmate that is in his 2nd-grade class. It takes him on average 10 minutes to find a flower he likes. He has been gathering for 2 hours. Assuming he has lost 3 of the flowers he initially gathered, how many more minutes does he need to look if he has 30 classmates?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flowers Justin has already found. Since he has been gathering for 2 hours, which is 120 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to find each flower, he must have initially gathered some flowers.",
    "I'll divide the 120 minutes by the 10 minutes per flower to find out how many flowers he gathered initially. 120 / 10 = 12. So, Justin has initially found 12 flowers.",
    "I need to account for the 3 flowers he lost. So, I'll subtract the lost flowers from the total he initially gathered. 12 - 3 = 9. So, Justin currently has 9 flowers.",
    "His goal is to collect 30 flowers, one for each classmate. I know he currently has 9 flowers.",
    "I'll calculate how many more flowers Justin needs by subtracting the number he already has from the total he needs. 30 - 9 = 21. So, he needs 21 more flowers.",
    "Since it takes him 10 minutes to find each flower, I need to multiply the number of additional flowers needed by the time it takes to find each one. 21 flowers * 10 minutes per flower = 210 minutes."

  "solution": "210"
