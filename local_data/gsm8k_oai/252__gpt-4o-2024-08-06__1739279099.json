  "query": "Angie bought 3 lbs. of coffee at the store today. Each lb. of coffee will brew about 40 cups of coffee. Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day. How many days will this coffee last her?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of cups of coffee that can be brewed from the 3 lbs. of coffee Angie bought.",
    "I know that each pound (lb.) of coffee can brew approximately 40 cups.",
    "Since Angie has 3 lbs. of coffee, I multiply the number of lbs. by the number of cups per lb: 3 lbs. * 40 cups/lb.",
    "3 * 40 equals 120.",
    "Now I know that Angie can brew a total of 120 cups of coffee with the 3 lbs. she purchased.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many days the coffee will last given Angie's coffee consumption.",
    "Angie drinks 3 cups of coffee every day.",
    "To find out how many days 120 cups will last, I divide the total number of cups (120) by the number of cups she drinks daily (3 cups/day).",
    "120 divided by 3 equals 40.",
    "Therefore, the coffee will last Angie for 40 days."
