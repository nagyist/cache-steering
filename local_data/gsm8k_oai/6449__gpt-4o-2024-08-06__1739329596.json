  "query": "Carter plays soccer on the school team.  On average, he scores 4 goals per game.  Shelby scores half as many as Carter per game on average.  And Judah, on average, scores three less than twice as many goals per game as Shelby.  If these three teammates are the only ones that score goals for the school team, what is the average total number of goals scored by the team per game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many goals Shelby scores on average. Carter scores 4 goals per game.",
    "Shelby scores half as many goals as Carter. So, Shelby scores 4 / 2 = 2 goals per game on average.",
    "Next, calculate how many goals Judah scores on average. Judah scores three less than twice as many goals as Shelby.",
    "First find twice as many goals as Shelby scores: 2 * 2 = 4 goals.",
    "Then subtract three from this result for Judah's average: 4 - 3 = 1 goal per game.",
    "Now, to find the average total number of goals scored by the team per game, add up the average goals scored by Carter, Shelby, and Judah.",
    "Carter scores 4 goals, Shelby scores 2 goals, and Judah scores 1 goal. So the total average goals scored per game is 4 + 2 + 1.",
    "Calculate the sum: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 goals."
