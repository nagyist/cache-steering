  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the makeup palettes.",
    "Maddie bought 3 makeup palettes at $15 each.",
    "The total cost for the makeup palettes is 3 times $15.",
    "3 times $15 equals $45.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the lipsticks.",
    "Maddie bought 4 lipsticks at $2.50 each.",
    "The total cost for the lipsticks is 4 times $2.50.",
    "4 times $2.50 equals $10.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the hair color boxes.",
    "Maddie bought 3 boxes of hair color at $4 each.",
    "The total cost for the hair color is 3 times $4.",
    "3 times $4 equals $12.",

    "The total cost for lipsticks is $10.",
    "The total cost for hair color is $12.",
    "Add $45, $10, and $12 together.",
    "$45 plus $10 equals $55.",
    "$55 plus $12 equals $67."
