  "query": "In the Math club, there are two times as many males as females. If there are 6 female members, how many members are there in the Math club in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the total number of members in the Math club.",
    "I know there are 6 female members in the club.",
    "The problem states that there are two times as many males as females.",
    "Since there are 6 female members, the number of male members would be 2 times 6.",
    "Calculating the number of male members: 2 * 6 = 12.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of members by adding the number of female and male members together.",
    "Adding the number of female members (6) and male members (12) gives: 6 + 12.",
    "Calculating the total number of members: 6 + 12 = 18."
