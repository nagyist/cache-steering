  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of days Geli works out in the week.",
    "Geli works out 3 times a week.",
    "The next step is to calculate the number of push-ups she does each day.",
    "On the first day, she does 10 push-ups.",
    "Her trainer encourages her to add 5 more push-ups each day. So on the second day, she does 10 + 5 = 15 push-ups.",
    "On the third day, she adds 5 again, resulting in 15 + 5 = 20 push-ups.",
    "Now, I need to sum up the push-ups done over the 3 days.",
    "The total number of push-ups is 10 + 15 + 20.",
    "Calculating the sum: 10 + 15 = 25.",
    "Then, 25 + 20 = 45."
