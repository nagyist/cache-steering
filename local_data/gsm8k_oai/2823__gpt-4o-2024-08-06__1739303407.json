  "query": "Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday.",
    "Merry had 25 boxes of apples on Sunday.",
    "Each box contains 10 apples.",
    "On Saturday, Merry had 50 boxes with 10 apples each, so she had 50 * 10 = 500 apples.",
    "On Sunday, Merry had 25 boxes with 10 apples each, so she had 25 * 10 = 250 apples.",
    "In total, she had 500 apples on Saturday and 250 apples on Sunday.",
    "The total number of apples for both days combined is 500 + 250 = 750 apples.",
    "She sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday.",
    "To determine the number of apples left, subtract the number of apples sold from the total number of apples: 750 - 720 = 30 apples left.",
    "Each box contains 10 apples, so the number of boxes left is 30 apples / 10 apples per box = 3 boxes."
