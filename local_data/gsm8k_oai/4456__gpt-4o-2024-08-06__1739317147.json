  "query": "Each class uses 200 sheets of paper per day. The school uses a total of 9000 sheets of paper every week. If there are 5 days of school days, how many classes are there in the school?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sheets of paper the school uses in one day.",
    "Since the school uses a total of 9000 sheets of paper every week, and there are 5 school days in a week, I will divide 9000 by 5.",
    "9000 sheets per week \u00f7 5 days per week = 1800 sheets per day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many classes are there. I know each class uses 200 sheets of paper per day.",
    "I will divide the total number of sheets used per day by the number of sheets each class uses.",
    "1800 sheets per day \u00f7 200 sheets per class = 9 classes."
