  "query": "Jose is a collector of fine wines.  His private cellar currently holds 2400 bottles of imported wine and half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine.  If Jose holds a party and the guests drink one-third of all his wine, how many bottles will remain in his cellar?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of domestic wine bottles in Jose's cellar.",
    "The problem states that Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine.",
    "Jose has 2400 bottles of imported wine.",
    "Half of 2400 is 2400 / 2 = 1200.",
    "So, Jose has 1200 bottles of domestic wine.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of wine bottles Jose has in his cellar.",
    "The total number of wine bottles is the number of imported wine bottles plus the number of domestic wine bottles.",
    "The total is 2400 (imported) + 1200 (domestic) = 3600 bottles.",
    "Next, I will determine how many bottles are consumed at the party.",
    "The guests drink one-third of all his wine.",
    "To find out how much one-third of the total wine is, I calculate 3600 / 3.",
    "3600 / 3 = 1200 bottles are consumed.",
    "Finally, I subtract the number of consumed bottles from the total number of bottles to find out how many remain.",
    "The remaining bottles after the party are 3600 - 1200 = 2400 bottles."

  "solution": "2400"
