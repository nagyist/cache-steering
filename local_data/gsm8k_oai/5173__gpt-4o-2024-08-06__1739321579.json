  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many songs are on Bart's mixtape in total.",
    "The first side has 6 songs.",
    "The second side has 4 songs.",
    "To find the total number of songs, I add the songs from both sides: 6 + 4 = 10 songs.",
    "Each song is 4 minutes long.",
    "To find the total length of the mixtape, I need to multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song.",
    "10 songs multiplied by 4 minutes per song is 10 * 4 = 40 minutes."
