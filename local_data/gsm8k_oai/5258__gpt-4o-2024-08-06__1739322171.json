  "query": "Jim decides he wants to practice for a marathon coming up.  He starts off by running 5 miles every day for 30 days straight.  He then pushes himself to run 10 miles a day for the next 30 days.  Finally, as marathon day gets closer Jim runs 20 miles a day for 30 days straight.  How many miles does Jim run in total during the 90 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the distance Jim runs during the first 30 days.",
    "He runs 5 miles every day for 30 days.",
    "The total distance for the first 30 days is 5 miles/day * 30 days.",
    "This equals 150 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the distance Jim runs during the next 30 days.",
    "During this period, he runs 10 miles every day for 30 days.",
    "The total distance for these 30 days is 10 miles/day * 30 days.",
    "This equals 300 miles.",
    "Then, I need to calculate the distance Jim runs during the final 30 days.",
    "He runs 20 miles every day for these last 30 days.",
    "The total distance for the final 30 days is 20 miles/day * 30 days.",
    "This equals 600 miles.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the miles he ran over the 90 days.",
    "So, I add 150 miles + 300 miles + 600 miles.",
    "This gives me a total of 1050 miles."

  "solution": "1050"
