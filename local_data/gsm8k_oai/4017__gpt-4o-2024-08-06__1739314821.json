  "query": "Tom broke his leg and needed to go to the doctor.  The visit cost $300 and the cast cost $200.  If insurance covered 60% how much was Tom's out-of-pocket cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of Tom's medical expenses.",
    "The doctor's visit cost $300.",
    "The cast cost $200.",
    "Adding these together gives the total cost: $300 + $200.",
    "The total cost is $500.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how much the insurance covered.",
    "Insurance covers 60% of the total cost.",
    "To find out how much the insurance covered, I calculate 60% of $500.",
    "60% of $500 is calculated as (60/100) * $500.",
    "This results in $300.",
    "The insurance covered $300.",
    "Now, I need to determine Tom's out-of-pocket cost.",
    "The out-of-pocket cost is the total cost minus the amount covered by insurance.",
    "Subtract $300 (the amount covered by insurance) from the total cost of $500.",
    "This gives $500 - $300.",
    "The result is $200.",
    "Therefore, Tom's out-of-pocket cost is $200."

  "solution": "200"
