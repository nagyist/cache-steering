  "query": "Daisy and Rose were enjoying their backyard pool with their dogs.  If there are 24 legs/paws in the pool, how many dogs do Daisy and Rose have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the humans, Daisy and Rose.",
    "There are 2 people, and each person has 2 legs.",
    "So, the total number of human legs in the pool is 2 people \u00d7 2 legs/person = 4 legs.",
    "Now let's focus on the total number of legs/paws, which is 24.",
    "Subtract the number of human legs from the total number of legs/paws: 24 total legs/paws - 4 human legs = 20 legs/paws.",
    "The remaining legs/paws are from the dogs.",
    "Each dog has 4 paws.",
    "To find the number of dogs, divide the number of paws by the number of paws per dog: 20 paws \u00f7 4 paws/dog = 5 dogs."
