  "query": "Camden went swimming 16 times in March and Susannah went 24 times. If the number of times they went throughout the month was divided equally among 4 weeks, how many more times a week did Susannah swim than Camden?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of times Camden went swimming in a week.",
    "Camden went swimming 16 times in March.",
    "March typically has 4 weeks for the purpose of this question.",
    "To find how many times Camden swam per week, I divide his total number by 4 weeks.",
    "Camden's weekly swimming = 16 \u00f7 4 = 4 times per week.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of times Susannah went swimming in a week.",
    "Susannah went swimming 24 times in March.",
    "To find how many times Susannah swam per week, I divide her total number by 4 weeks.",
    "Susannah's weekly swimming = 24 \u00f7 4 = 6 times per week.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden.",
    "Susannah swims 6 times a week, and Camden swims 4 times a week.",
    "I subtract Camden's weekly swimming from Susannah's weekly swimming to find the difference.",
    "Difference = 6 - 4 = 2 times per week."

  "solution": "2"
