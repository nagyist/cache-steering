  "query": "John buys 30 ducks for $10 each.  They weigh 4 pounds and he sells them for $5 per pound.  How much profit did he make?",
  "steps": [
    "John buys 30 ducks.",
    "The cost of each duck is $10.",
    "I need to calculate the total cost for 30 ducks.",
    "The total cost is 30 ducks * $10 each = $300.",
    "Each duck weighs 4 pounds.",
    "Every pound is sold for $5.",
    "I need to calculate how much John earns per duck.",
    "Since each duck weighs 4 pounds and sells for $5 per pound, John earns 4 pounds * $5 per pound = $20 per duck.",
    "I need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the ducks.",
    "Total revenue is 30 ducks * $20 per duck = $600.",
    "John\u2019s profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.",
    "John\u2019s profit = $600 (revenue) - $300 (cost).",
    "Profit = $300."
