  "query": "During 5 hours, a spider can catch 9 flies. How many flies would this spider catch in 30 hours if he would keep his efficiency?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the rate at which the spider catches flies.",
    "The spider catches 9 flies in 5 hours.",
    "To find the rate, I divide the number of flies by the number of hours: 9 flies / 5 hours = 1.8 flies per hour.",
    "Now that I have the rate, I need to find out how many flies the spider could catch in 30 hours.",
    "To do this, I multiply the rate of catching flies by the total number of hours: 1.8 flies/hour * 30 hours.",
    "Calculate the product: 1.8 * 30 = 54."
  ],
  "solution": "54"
