  "steps": [
    "Harly's animal shelter starts with 80 dogs.",
    "She adopts out 40% of them.",
    "To find out how many dogs are adopted out, calculate 40% of 80.",
    "40% as a decimal is 0.40.",
    "Multiply 80 by 0.40 to find the number of adopted dogs: 80 * 0.40 = 32.",
    "So, 32 dogs are adopted out.",
    "Subtract the 32 adopted dogs from the original 80 to find out how many remain: 80 - 32 = 48.",
    "However, Harly has to take back 5 dogs.",
    "Add the 5 returned dogs to the 48 remaining at the shelter: 48 + 5 = 53."
