  "query": "Barkley gets 10 new dog bones at the beginning of the month.  After 5 months, he has 8 bones available and has buried the rest.  How many bones has he buried?",
  "steps": [
    "At the beginning of each month, Barkley gets 10 new dog bones.",
    "After 5 months, he would have received a total of 5 x 10 = 50 bones.",
    "Barkley currently has 8 bones available.",
    "To find out how many bones he has buried, I need to subtract the number of bones he currently has from the total number of bones he has received.",
    "So, I calculate 50 (total bones received) - 8 (bones available) = 42 bones."

  "solution": "42"
