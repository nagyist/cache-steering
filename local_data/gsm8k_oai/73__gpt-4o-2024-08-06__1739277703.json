  "query": "It is Roger\u2019s turn to provide a snack for the baseball team after the game and he has decided to bring trail mix. The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. Roger has 13 members on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches and 2 helpers. How many packs of trail mix does he need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of people who will receive a snack. There are 13 baseball team members.",
    "In addition to the team members, there are 3 coaches.",
    "There are also 2 helpers.",
    "I add the number of team members, coaches, and helpers: 13 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 2 (helpers).",
    "13 + 3 equals 16.",
    "16 + 2 equals 18.",
    "So, there are a total of 18 people who need a snack.",
    "Each pack of trail mix contains 6 individual pouches.",
    "To determine how many packs Roger needs, I need to divide the total number of people by the number of pouches per pack: 18 people divided by 6 pouches per pack.",
    "18 divided by 6 equals 3.",
    "Therefore, Roger needs 3 packs of trail mix to have enough for everyone."
