  "steps": [
    "The pad of paper starts with 120 pages.",
    "Sammy uses 25% of the pages for his science project.",
    "To find 25% of 120 pages, I multiply 120 by 0.25.",
    "120 multiplied by 0.25 equals 30 pages.",
    "Sammy uses 30 pages for his science project.",
    "He also uses another 10 pages for his math homework.",
    "In total, Sammy uses 30 pages (science) + 10 pages (math) = 40 pages.",
    "To find out how many pages remain, subtract the pages used from the total.",
    "120 pages - 40 pages used = 80 pages remaining."
