  "query": "Carla, Kyle, and Tasha caught 36 fish. If Kyle and Tasha caught the same number of fish and Carla caught 8, how many fish did Kyle catch?",
  "steps": [
    "Carla caught a total of 8 fish.",
    "Kyle and Tasha caught the same number of fish.",
    "Let's denote the number of fish Kyle caught as K. Since Kyle and Tasha caught the same number of fish, Tasha also caught K fish.",
    "Together, Kyle and Tasha caught K + K = 2K fish.",
    "The total number of fish caught by all three people is 36.",
    "So, Carla's fish plus Kyle and Tasha's fish add up to 36: 8 + 2K = 36.",
    "Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2K = 36 - 8.",
    "Perform the subtraction: 2K = 28.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find K: K = 28 / 2.",
    "Perform the division: K = 14."
