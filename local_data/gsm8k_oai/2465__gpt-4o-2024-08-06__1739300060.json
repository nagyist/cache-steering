  "query": "A bird is building a nest from twigs. The bird has put twelve twigs together already to make a circle. For each twig it placed into the circle, it wants to weave in six more twigs to fill out the nest. It knows a tree that has dropped a third of the twigs it needs. How many twigs will the bird still need to find to finish its nest?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of additional twigs needed for each twig in the circle.",
    "Since each circle twig needs six more twigs, and there are twelve twigs in the circle, I calculate the total additional twigs required by multiplying 12 by 6.",
    "12 twigs * 6 twigs = 72 twigs.",
    "So, the bird needs 72 more twigs to add to the existing circle to complete its nest.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many twigs the bird has already found from the tree.",
    "The bird has found a third of the twigs it needs. Therefore, I need to calculate a third of the 72 additional twigs.",
    "72 twigs / 3 = 24 twigs.",
    "The bird has 24 twigs available from the tree.",
    "Now, I calculate how many more twigs the bird still needs to collect by subtracting the 24 twigs it has from the total 72 twigs required.",
    "72 twigs - 24 twigs = 48 twigs."

  "solution": "48"
