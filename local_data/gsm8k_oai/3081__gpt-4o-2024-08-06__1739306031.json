  "query": "A pea patch is twice as big as a radish patch. If one sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet.  How much is a whole radish patch in square feet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the size of the entire pea patch.",
    "I know that one sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet.",
    "To find the whole pea patch, I need to multiply 5 square feet by 6 because it represents one sixth.",
    "5 square feet times 6 equals 30 square feet.",
    "Next, I have to determine the size of the radish patch.",
    "The problem states that the pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch.",
    "So, I need to divide the size of the pea patch by 2 to find the size of the radish patch.",
    "30 square feet divided by 2 equals 15 square feet."
