  "query": "After five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice. If Ron's age now is 43, how old is Maurice now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Ron's age in five years.",
    "Since Ron's current age is 43, in five years he will be 43 + 5 = 48 years old.",
    "According to the problem, Ron's age in five years will be four times Maurice's age at that time.",
    "Let Maurice's current age be M.",
    "In five years, Maurice's age will be M + 5.",
    "Ron\u2019s age in five years (48) should equal four times Maurice\u2019s age at that time (M + 5).",
    "Set up the equation: 48 = 4 * (M + 5).",
    "To solve for M, first divide both sides of the equation by 4: 48 / 4 = M + 5.",
    "This simplifies to 12 = M + 5.",
    "Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for M: 12 - 5 = M.",
    "This yields M = 7.",
    "Thus, Maurice is currently 7 years old."
