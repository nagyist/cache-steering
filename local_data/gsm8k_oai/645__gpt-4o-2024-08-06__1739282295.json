  "query": "In the city, there is a block of flats. This block has 12 floors. Half of the floors have 6 apartments and the other half have 5 apartments. One apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents. What is the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many floors have 6 apartments and how many have 5 apartments.",
    "The block has 12 floors. Half of them have 6 apartments, so 12 divided by 2 is 6. There are 6 floors with 6 apartments.",
    "Consequently, the other half of the 12 floors, another 6 floors, have 5 apartments each.",
    "Now I calculate the total number of apartments in the floors with 6 apartments each.",
    "There are 6 floors, each with 6 apartments, which is 6 multiplied by 6. This equals 36 apartments on these floors.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of apartments in the floors with 5 apartments each.",
    "There are 6 floors, each with 5 apartments, which is 6 multiplied by 5. This equals 30 apartments on these floors.",
    "Adding these two results together will give me the total number of apartments in the building.",
    "36 apartments plus 30 apartments equals 66 apartments in total.",
    "Now, since each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents, I need to calculate the total maximum number of residents.",
    "I multiply the total number of apartments, 66, by 4 residents per apartment.",
    "66 multiplied by 4 equals 264."

  "solution": "264"
