  "query": "Pam has some bags of apples. Each of her bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Gerald's bags have 40 apples each. If Pam has 1200 apples in total, how many bags of apples does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that each of Pam's bags has 3 times as many apples as one of Gerald's bags.",
    "Gerald's bags have 40 apples each, so each of Pam's bags has 3 * 40 = 120 apples.",
    "I need to determine how many bags Pam would have if she has a total of 1200 apples.",
    "I can divide the total number of apples Pam has by the number of apples per bag to find out how many bags she has.",
    "Divide 1200 apples by 120 apples per bag.",
    "1200 \u00f7 120 = 10."
