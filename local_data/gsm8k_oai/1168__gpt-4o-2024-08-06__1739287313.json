  "query": "Arwen and Elrond picked some flowers. Arwen was able to get 20 tulips and Elrond was able to get twice as many tulips as Arwen did. How many tulips were they able to get in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tulips Elrond picked.",
    "Elrond picked twice as many tulips as Arwen, who picked 20 tulips.",
    "Therefore, I calculate Elrond's tulips: 2 times 20 tulips.",
    "2 times 20 equals 40 tulips.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of tulips both Arwen and Elrond picked.",
    "Add Arwen's tulips (20) to Elrond's tulips (40).",
    "20 plus 40 equals 60."

  "solution": "60"
