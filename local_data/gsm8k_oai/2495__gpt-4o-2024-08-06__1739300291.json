  "query": "A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much water the camel drank.",
    "The camel drank seven times as much as the traveler.",
    "The traveler drank 32 ounces of water.",
    "Seven times 32 ounces is the amount the camel drank.",
    "7 \u00d7 32 = 224 ounces.",
    "Now, I add the amount of water the traveler and the camel drank together.",
    "The traveler drank 32 ounces, and the camel drank 224 ounces.",
    "32 + 224 = 256 ounces in total.",
    "Next, I need to convert the total ounces to gallons.",
    "There are 128 ounces in a gallon.",
    "I divide the total ounces by the number of ounces per gallon.",
    "256 \u00f7 128 = 2 gallons."
