  "query": "Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?",
  "steps": [
    "I first note that April has 30 days.",
    "Jimmy's father already receives 20 emails per day before subscribing.",
    "For the first half of April, Jimmy's father receives 20 emails per day.",
    "Halfway through April means 15 days. So, for the first 15 days, he receives 20 emails per day.",
    "To calculate the number of emails for the first 15 days, I multiply 20 emails by 15 days.",
    "20 emails/day * 15 days = 300 emails.",
    "After halfway through April, Jimmy's father subscribes to the news channel that adds 5 more emails per day.",
    "Now Jimmy's father receives a total of 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day.",
    "For the remaining 15 days of April, he receives 25 emails per day.",
    "To calculate the number of emails for the next 15 days, I multiply 25 emails by 15 days.",
    "25 emails/day * 15 days = 375 emails.",
    "To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, I add the number of emails from the first half to the second half.",
    "300 emails + 375 emails = 675 emails."
  ],
  "solution": "675"
