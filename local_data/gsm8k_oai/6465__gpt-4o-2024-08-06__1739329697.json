  "query": "Thomas is keeping track of the rainfall in May for his science project. On the first day, 26 cm of rain fell. On the second day, 34 cm fell. On the third day, 12 cm less than the second day fell. The average rainfall for the first three days of May is usually 140 cm across all three days, in a normal year. How much less is it raining this year than average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine the rainfall for each of the first three days.",
    "On the first day, 26 cm of rain fell.",
    "On the second day, 34 cm of rain fell.",
    "On the third day, I know that 12 cm less than the second day fell. So I calculate 34 cm - 12 cm = 22 cm.",
    "Now, I will sum up the rainfall for the first three days this year: 26 cm + 34 cm + 22 cm.",
    "26 cm + 34 cm = 60 cm.",
    "60 cm + 22 cm = 82 cm.",
    "Next, I need to know the average rainfall in a normal year, which is given as 140 cm for three days.",
    "The difference between the normal average rainfall and this year's rainfall is 140 cm - 82 cm.",
    "140 cm - 82 cm = 58 cm."

  "solution": "58"
