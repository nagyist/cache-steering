  "query": "Daniel has 5 jars of juice containing 2 liters each. He wants to serve a full glass of juice to each person at a party. He knows that each glass can hold up to 250 milliliters of juice. How many full glasses can he give?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of juice Daniel has.",
    "He has 5 jars, and each contains 2 liters of juice.",
    "So, I multiply the number of jars by the amount per jar: 5 jars \u00d7 2 liters per jar = 10 liters.",
    "Next, I need to convert liters to milliliters because the glasses are measured in milliliters.",
    "1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters.",
    "Therefore, 10 liters of juice is equal to 10 \u00d7 1000 = 10,000 milliliters.",
    "Each glass can hold up to 250 milliliters of juice.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of full glasses Daniel can serve by dividing the total milliliters of juice by the capacity of one glass.",
    "10,000 milliliters \u00f7 250 milliliters per glass = 40 glasses."

  "solution": "40"
