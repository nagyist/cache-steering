  "query": "Karen is paddling her canoe up a river against the current. On a still pond, Karen can paddle 10 miles per hour. The river flows in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour. If the river is 12 miles long, how many hours will it take Karen to paddle up it?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find Karen's effective paddling speed against the current.",
    "Karen's paddling speed on still water is 10 miles per hour.",
    "The speed of the river's current is 4 miles per hour in the opposite direction.",
    "To find the effective speed, I need to subtract the river's speed from Karen's speed.",
    "Effective speed = 10 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour.",
    "Effective speed = 6 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I know that the length of the river is 12 miles.",
    "Time is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.",
    "Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 6 miles per hour.",
    "Time = 2 hours."

  "solution": "2"
