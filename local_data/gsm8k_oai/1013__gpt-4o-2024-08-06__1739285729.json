  "query": "Justin bought some jerseys. He bought four long-sleeved ones that cost $15 each, and some striped ones that cost $10 each. How many striped jerseys did Justin buy if he spent a total of $80?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total cost of the four long-sleeved jerseys.",
    "Each long-sleeved jersey costs $15.",
    "Multiply 4 long-sleeved jerseys by $15 each.",
    "4 * 15 = 60",
    "Justin spent $60 on the long-sleeved jerseys.",
    "Justin's total expenditure was $80.",
    "Subtract the cost of the long-sleeved jerseys from the total expenditure to find out how much he spent on the striped jerseys.",
    "80 - 60 = 20",
    "Justin spent $20 on the striped jerseys.",
    "Each striped jersey costs $10.",
    "Divide the total amount spent on striped jerseys by the cost of one striped jersey to find out how many he bought.",
    "20 \u00f7 10 = 2"
