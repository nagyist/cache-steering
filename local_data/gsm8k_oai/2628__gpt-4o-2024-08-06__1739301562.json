  "query": "John decides to buy some birds.  He got 50 dollars from each of his 4 grandparents.  If each bird costs $20, how many wings did all the birds have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money John received from his grandparents.",
    "John received $50 from each of his 4 grandparents.",
    "I will multiply 50 by 4 to find the total amount of money: 50 * 4 = 200.",
    "John has $200 in total to spend on birds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many birds John can buy with $200.",
    "Each bird costs $20.",
    "I will divide the total amount John has by the cost of one bird: 200 / 20 = 10.",
    "John can buy 10 birds.",
    "Each bird has 2 wings.",
    "To find the total number of wings, I will multiply the number of birds by 2: 10 * 2 = 20."
