  "query": "Mark has two dozen eggs to split with his three siblings. How many eggs does each person get to eat if they all eat the same amount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of eggs Mark has.",
    "A dozen means 12, so two dozen eggs would be 12 eggs times 2.",
    "12 times 2 equals 24. So Mark has 24 eggs in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many people will be sharing the eggs.",
    "Mark plans to share the eggs with his three siblings. So, there are four people in total (Mark plus the three siblings).",
    "Next, I need to divide the total number of eggs (24) by the number of people sharing them (4).",
    "24 divided by 4 equals 6.",
    "Each person will get 6 eggs."
