  "query": "Marta works on her grandparent's farm to raise money for a new phone. So far, she has collected $240. For every hour she works, she receives $10. Her grandmother often gives her tips, and she has collected $50 in tips in total. How many hours has Marta worked on the farm so far?",
  "steps": [
    "The total amount of money Marta has collected so far is $240.",
    "She has collected $50 in tips.",
    "To find out how much money she earned from working (excluding tips), we subtract the tips from the total amount collected.",
    "$240 - $50 = $190.",
    "Marta earns $10 for every hour she works.",
    "To find out how many hours she has worked, we divide the amount she earned from working by her hourly rate.",
    "$190 \u00f7 $10 = 19 hours."
