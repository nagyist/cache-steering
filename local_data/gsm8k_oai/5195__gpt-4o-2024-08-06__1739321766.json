  "query": "Era had 5 burgers for her and her 4 friends. She sliced each burger into halves. The first and second friends got 1 and 2 slices, respectively. Then the third and fourth friends got 3 slices each. How many slices of burgers are left for Era?",
  "steps": [
    "Era starts with 5 burgers.",
    "Each burger is sliced into halves, so each burger makes 2 slices.",
    "This means 5 burgers result in 5 * 2 = 10 slices.",
    "Friend 1 gets 1 slice.",
    "Friend 2 gets 2 slices.",
    "Friend 3 gets 3 slices.",
    "Friend 4 also gets 3 slices.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of slices given to the friends: 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9 slices.",
    "Era started with 10 slices in total and has given away 9 slices to her friends.",
    "The number of slices left for Era is 10 - 9 = 1 slice."
