  "query": "Erika and her brother Rick want to buy a gift for their mother that costs $250. They have both saved money. Erika saved $155 and her brother saved only half of the cost of the gift. They also want to surprise their mother with a birthday cake that costs $25. How much money will they have left after buying their mother a gift and cake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the total amount of money Erika and Rick have saved.",
    "Erika has saved $155.",
    "Rick has saved half of the cost of the gift, which is $250 / 2 = $125.",
    "To find the total, I add both amounts: $155 + $125 = $280.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the gift and the cake.",
    "The gift costs $250 and the cake costs $25.",
    "The total cost is $250 + $25 = $275.",
    "Now, I subtract the total cost from the total savings: $280 - $275 = $5."

  "solution": "5"
