  "steps": [
    "Lovely cuts her birthday cake into 12 equal pieces.",
    "One-fourth of the cake was eaten by her visitors.",
    "To find out how many pieces were eaten, I need to calculate one-fourth of 12.",
    "One-fourth of 12 is 12 divided by 4, which equals 3.",
    "So, 3 pieces of cake were eaten by the visitors.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many slices were kept.",
    "This is the total number of pieces (12) minus the number eaten (3).",
    "12 minus 3 equals 9."

  "solution": "9"
