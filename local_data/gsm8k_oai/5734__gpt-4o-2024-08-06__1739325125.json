  "query": "Darry is a roofer and has to climb ladders multiple times a day. He climbs his full ladder, which has 11 steps, 10 times today. He also climbs his smaller ladder, which has 6 steps, 7 times today. He did not climb any steps otherwise. In total, how many times has Darry climbed a step today?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many total steps Darry climbs using the full ladder.",
    "The full ladder has 11 steps.",
    "Darry climbs the full ladder 10 times today.",
    "To find the total steps climbed with the full ladder, multiply the steps per climb by the number of climbs: 11 steps * 10 climbs.",
    "11 * 10 = 110. So, Darry climbs 110 steps using the full ladder.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of steps climbed using the smaller ladder.",
    "The smaller ladder has 6 steps.",
    "Darry climbs the smaller ladder 7 times today.",
    "To find the total steps climbed with the smaller ladder, multiply the steps per climb by the number of climbs: 6 steps * 7 climbs.",
    "6 * 7 = 42. So, Darry climbs 42 steps using the smaller ladder.",
    "Finally, to find the total number of steps Darry climbed today, I add the steps climbed with both ladders: 110 from the full ladder and 42 from the smaller ladder.",
    "110 + 42 = 152."

  "solution": "152"
