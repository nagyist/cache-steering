  "query": "A herring has 40 oz of fat, an eel 20 oz, and a pike 10 more oz of fat than an eel. If Ellianna cooked and served 40 fish of each type, calculate how many ounces of fat she served.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine the amount of fat in a single pike.",
    "An eel has 20 oz of fat, and a pike has 10 more oz than an eel.",
    "So, a pike has 20 oz + 10 oz = 30 oz of fat.",
    "Now, I know a herring has 40 oz of fat, an eel 20 oz, and a pike 30 oz.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total fat from the 40 herring.",
    "Each herring has 40 oz of fat, and there are 40 herrings.",
    "So, the total fat from herrings is 40 x 40 = 1600 oz.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total fat from the 40 eels.",
    "Each eel has 20 oz of fat, and there are 40 eels.",
    "So, the total fat from eels is 40 x 20 = 800 oz.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total fat from the 40 pikes.",
    "Each pike has 30 oz of fat, and there are 40 pikes.",
    "So, the total fat from pikes is 40 x 30 = 1200 oz.",
    "Finally, I'll add the total fat from all three types of fish.",
    "Total fat served = 1600 oz (herring) + 800 oz (eels) + 1200 oz (pikes).",
    "Total fat served = 3600 oz."

  "solution": "3600"
