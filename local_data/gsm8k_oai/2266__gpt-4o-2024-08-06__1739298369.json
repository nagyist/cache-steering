  "query": "Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the number of necklaces Haley has: 25.",
    "We know Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. So, Jason has 25 - 5 necklaces.",
    "Calculate the number of necklaces Jason has: 25 - 5 = 20.",
    "Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. So, calculate half of Jason's necklaces: 20 / 2.",
    "Calculate 20 / 2 = 10. So, Josh has 10 necklaces.",
    "Now, find out how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh: 25 - 10.",
    "Calculate 25 - 10 = 15."
