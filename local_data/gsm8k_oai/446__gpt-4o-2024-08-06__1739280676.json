  "query": "In a classroom, 10 children have 7 books each. Their teacher brings another 8 books to the classroom. How many books are in the classroom altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of books that the children have.",
    "There are 10 children, and each child has 7 books.",
    "To find the total, I multiply the number of children by the number of books each has: 10 * 7.",
    "10 times 7 equals 70. So, the children have 70 books in total.",
    "Next, I need to add the books that the teacher brought to the classroom.",
    "The teacher brings 8 additional books.",
    "To find the total number of books in the classroom, I add the 70 books from the children to the 8 books the teacher brought. So, 70 + 8.",
    "70 plus 8 equals 78."

  "solution": "78"
