  "query": "Salaria is growing oranges this summer. She bought two types of trees. She has 50% of tree A and 50% of tree B. Tree A gives her 10 oranges a month and 60% are good. Tree B gives her 15 oranges and 1/3 are good. If she gets 55 good oranges per month, how many total trees does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to figure out how many good oranges each type of tree produces.",
    "Tree A gives 10 oranges a month, and 60% of them are good.",
    "60% of 10 oranges is 0.6 * 10 = 6 good oranges from each Tree A.",
    "Tree B gives 15 oranges a month, and 1/3 of them are good.",
    "1/3 of 15 oranges is 5 good oranges from each Tree B.",
    "The total good oranges she gets per month is 55.",
    "Let x be the number of Tree A she has, so she also has x number of Tree B because she has 50% of these trees each.",
    "The total good oranges from Tree A is 6x, and from Tree B is 5x.",
    "So, the equation for the total good oranges is 6x + 5x = 55.",
    "Combining terms gives 11x = 55.",
    "Solving for x gives x = 55 / 11 = 5.",
    "There are 5 of Tree A and 5 of Tree B.",
    "The total number of trees is 5 + 5 = 10."

  "solution": "10"
