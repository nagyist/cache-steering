    "Alice is planting bushes around three sides of her yard.",
    "Each side of the yard is 16 feet long.",
    "Since each bush fills 4 feet, I need to determine how many bushes fit in one side first.",
    "I will divide the length of one side (16 feet) by the space one bush fills (4 feet).",
    "16 \u00f7 4 = 4, so 4 bushes fit along one side.",
    "Alice is planting bushes on three sides, so I need to multiply the number of bushes per side by the number of sides.",
    "4 bushes per side \u00d7 3 sides = 12 bushes."

  "solution": "12"
