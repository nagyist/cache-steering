  "steps": [
    "Luigi bought four pizzas for a total cost of $80.",
    "Each pizza was cut into 5 pieces.",
    "First, I need to find out the total number of pieces.",
    "There are 4 pizzas and each pizza has 5 pieces, so I multiply 4 pizzas by 5 pieces per pizza.",
    "4 pizzas * 5 pieces per pizza = 20 pieces total.",
    "Now I need to find out the cost per piece of pizza.",
    "To find the cost per piece, I divide the total cost by the total number of pieces.",
    "The total cost is $80, and there are 20 pieces.",
    "80 dollars / 20 pieces = 4 dollars per piece."
