  "query": "A state fair charges $5 for a ticket. Two-thirds of the people who buy a ticket will buy deep-fried fair food for $8, one quarter will go on a ride for $4, and one eighth will spend $15 on a souvenir. The fair made $2520 from tickets. How many dollars did they make in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many tickets were sold. Each ticket costs $5, and the total revenue from tickets is $2520.",
    "To find the number of tickets sold, I divide the total revenue by the cost per ticket.",
    "2520 divided by 5 equals 504. So, 504 tickets were sold.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many people bought deep-fried fair food. Two-thirds of the ticket buyers bought food.",
    "Two-thirds of 504 is calculated by multiplying 504 by 2/3.",
    "504 multiplied by 2 equals 1008, and then 1008 divided by 3 equals 336.",
    "So, 336 people bought deep-fried fair food.",
    "The total revenue from the deep-fried fair food is 336 people multiplied by $8.",
    "336 times 8 equals 2688.",
    "Next, I calculate how many people went on a ride. One quarter of the ticket buyers went on a ride.",
    "One quarter of 504 is calculated by multiplying 504 by 1/4.",
    "504 divided by 4 equals 126.",
    "So, 126 people went on a ride.",
    "The total revenue from the rides is 126 people multiplied by $4.",
    "126 times 4 equals 504.",
    "Next, I calculate how many people bought a souvenir. One eighth of the ticket buyers bought a souvenir.",
    "One eighth of 504 is calculated by multiplying 504 by 1/8.",
    "504 divided by 8 equals 63.",
    "So, 63 people bought a souvenir.",
    "The total revenue from the souvenirs is 63 people multiplied by $15.",
    "63 times 15 equals 945.",
    "Now, I add all the revenues together: tickets, deep-fried food, rides, and souvenirs.",
    "The total from tickets is $2520.",
    "The total from deep-fried fair food is $2688.",
    "The total from rides is $504.",
    "The total from souvenirs is $945.",
    "Adding these amounts together: $2520 + $2688 + $504 + $945.",
    "2520 plus 2688 equals 5208.",
    "5208 plus 504 equals 5712.",
    "5712 plus 945 equals 6657."

  "solution": "6657"
