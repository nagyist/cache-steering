  "query": "The difference in ages between Richard and Hurley is 20. If Hurley is 14 years old, what are their combined ages 40 years from now?",
  "steps": [
    "Richard and Hurley's age difference is given as 20 years.",
    "Hurley is currently 14 years old.",
    "To find Richard's current age, I need to add the age difference to Hurley's age: 14 + 20 = 34.",
    "Now, I know Richard is 34 years old and Hurley is 14 years old.",
    "40 years from now, I need to add 40 to each of their current ages to find their ages in the future.",
    "Hurley will be 14 + 40 = 54 years old in 40 years.",
    "Richard will be 34 + 40 = 74 years old in 40 years.",
    "Now, I'll find their combined ages 40 years from now by adding their future ages.",
    "54 (Hurley's future age) + 74 (Richard's future age) = 128."
