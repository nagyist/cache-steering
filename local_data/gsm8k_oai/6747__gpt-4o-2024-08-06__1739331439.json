  "query": "Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total miles driven each day for the commute.",
    "The commute is 21 miles one way, so round-trip it would be 21 * 2 = 42 miles.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of commuting miles per week.",
    "They commute 5 days a week, so the weekly mileage is 42 miles/day * 5 days/week = 210 miles/week.",
    "Now, find out the total miles driven in a month.",
    "There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly mileage is 210 miles/week * 4 weeks/month = 840 miles/month.",
    "Next, calculate the total amount of gas required for one month.",
    "Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, so for 840 miles, it would require 840 miles / 30 miles/gallon = 28 gallons.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost of gas for the month.",
    "The cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, so 28 gallons * $2.50/gallon = $70.",
    "Carson's five friends cover the gas expenses, so they need to divide the total gas cost.",
    "There are five friends, so each friend pays $70 / 5 = $14."

  "solution": "14"
