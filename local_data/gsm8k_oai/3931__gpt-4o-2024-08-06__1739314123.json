  "query": "Gina and Tom were playing football. On the first day, Gina scored two goals, which was three less than Tom. On the second day, Gina scored two goals less than Tom who scored six goals. How many goals did Gina and Tom score during these two days?",
  "steps": [
    "On the first day, Gina scored 2 goals.",
    "Tom scored 3 more goals than Gina on the first day.",
    "Therefore, Tom scored 2 + 3 = 5 goals on the first day.",
    "On the first day, their total goals are Gina's 2 plus Tom's 5, which is 2 + 5 = 7 goals.",
    "On the second day, Tom scored 6 goals.",
    "Gina scored 2 goals less than Tom on the second day.",
    "So, Gina scored 6 - 2 = 4 goals on the second day.",
    "On the second day, their total goals are Gina's 4 plus Tom's 6, which is 4 + 6 = 10 goals.",
    "Now, I will add the total goals from both days.",
    "On both days combined, Gina and Tom scored a total of 7 + 10 = 17 goals."
