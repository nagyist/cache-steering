  "query": "Ivan buys 48 apples to make 24 full-size pies. He ends up not using as many as he thought because he decides to make mini pies instead of full-size ones, which only use 1/2 an apple each. If Ivan bakes 24 mini pies, how many apples does he have leftover?",
  "steps": [
    "Ivan buys a total of 48 apples.",
    "He decides to bake 24 mini pies.",
    "Each mini pie uses 1/2 an apple.",
    "To find out how many apples Ivan uses for mini pies, calculate 24 mini pies multiplied by 1/2 apple per mini pie.",
    "24 mini pies * 1/2 apple per mini pie = 12 apples used.",
    "Ivan started with 48 apples and used 12 apples for the mini pies.",
    "To find out how many apples he has leftover, subtract the apples used from the total apples he started with.",
    "48 apples - 12 apples = 36 apples leftover."
