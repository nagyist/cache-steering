  "query": "John used to be able to squat 135 pounds.  After training, he increased that by 265 pounds.  He then gets a magical strength-increasing bracer that increases his strength by an additional 600%.  How much can he now lift?",
  "steps": [
    "John's initial squat capability was 135 pounds.",
    "He increased that capability by 265 pounds through training.",
    "To find his new capability without the magical bracer, add 135 pounds and 265 pounds together.",
    "135 + 265 equals 400 pounds. So, after training, John can squat 400 pounds.",
    "Now he gets a magical bracer that increases his strength by an additional 600%.",
    "A 600% increase means his new capability is 7 times his current strength (100% original + 600% increase).",
    "To find out the total weight he can now squat, multiply his current capability of 400 pounds by 7.",
    "400 multiplied by 7 is 2800."

  "solution": "2800"
