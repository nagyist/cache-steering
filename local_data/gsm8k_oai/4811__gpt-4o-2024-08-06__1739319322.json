  "query": "There are 100 people in a theater. If 19 of these people have blue eyes, half of them have brown eyes, a quarter have black eyes, and the rest have green eyes, how many of them have green eyes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know there are 100 people in total in the theater.",
    "I am told that 19 people have blue eyes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many people have brown eyes. I know that half of the people have brown eyes.",
    "Half of 100 is 50, so 50 people have brown eyes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many people have black eyes. I am told that a quarter of them have black eyes.",
    "A quarter of 100 is 25, so 25 people have black eyes.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many people have green eyes.",
    "I need to add the number of people with blue, brown, and black eyes and subtract it from the total number of people to find the number with green eyes.",
    "19 people have blue eyes, 50 people have brown eyes, and 25 people have black eyes.",
    "Adding these numbers: 19 + 50 + 25 = 94.",
    "Subtract the sum from the total number of people: 100 - 94 = 6."

  "solution": "6"
