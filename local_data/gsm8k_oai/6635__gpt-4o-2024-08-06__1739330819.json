  "query": "Sarah walked to school carrying a bag containing 25 apples. At school, she gave each teacher she saw an apple. She also gave a single apple to each of 5 of her closest friends. And while she walked home, she also ate one of the apples. If she had three apples left in the bag when she got home, how many apples had she given away to teachers?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by noting the total number of apples Sarah started with, which was 25.",
    "She gave 5 apples to her closest friends.",
    "She ate 1 apple herself on her way home.",
    "She was left with 3 apples when she got home.",
    "Calculate the total apples given away to friends and the one she ate: 5 (friends) + 1 (eaten) = 6 apples.",
    "Calculate the total apples not given to teachers: 3 (leftover apples) + 6 (apples given to friends and eaten) = 9 apples.",
    "Subtract the total not given to teachers from the initial total to find those given to teachers: 25 - 9 = 16 apples."

  "solution": "16"
