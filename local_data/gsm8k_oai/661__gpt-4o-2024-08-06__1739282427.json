  "query": "There are 30 different nuts in a bowl. If 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, how many nuts were left?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by understanding the total number of nuts. We have 30 different nuts in a bowl.",
    "We need to determine how many nuts were eaten.",
    "According to the problem, 5/6 of the nuts were eaten.",
    "Calculate 5/6 of 30 to find out how many nuts were eaten.",
    "Do the multiplication: 30 * (5/6) = 150/6.",
    "Simplify 150/6 to find the exact number of nuts eaten.",
    "150 divided by 6 equals 25.",
    "This means 25 nuts were eaten.",
    "To find the number of nuts left, subtract the number of nuts eaten from the total number of nuts.",
    "We have 30 nuts in total and 25 nuts were eaten, so we perform the subtraction: 30 - 25.",
    "30 - 25 equals 5.",
    "Thus, 5 nuts remain in the bowl."
