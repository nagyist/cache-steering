  "query": "At the aquarium, there are twice as many sharks as stingrays. If there are 28 stingrays, how many fish are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many sharks there are in the aquarium.",
    "I know that there are twice as many sharks as stingrays.",
    "There are 28 stingrays.",
    "Twice as many sharks would mean multiplying the number of stingrays by 2.",
    "28 stingrays times 2 equals 56 sharks.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of fish.",
    "I should add the number of sharks and the number of stingrays.",
    "56 sharks plus 28 stingrays equals 84 fish."
