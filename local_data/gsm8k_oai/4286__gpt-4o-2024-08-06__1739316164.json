  "steps": [
    "Initially, Lizzy's school choir has a total of 80 girls, consisting of both blonde and black-haired girls.",
    "The teacher adds 10 more girls to the choir, and these new girls are all blonde-haired.",
    "After adding the 10 new blonde-haired girls, the total number of girls in the choir becomes 80 + 10 = 90.",
    "Initially, there were 30 blonde-haired girls in the choir.",
    "After adding 10 more blonde-haired girls, the total number of blonde-haired girls becomes 30 + 10 = 40.",
    "To find the number of black-haired girls, we take the total number of girls in the choir after the addition, which is 90, and subtract the number of blonde-haired girls, which is 40.",
    "This calculation gives 90 - 40 = 50 black-haired girls in the choir."
