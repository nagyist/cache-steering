  "query": "An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?",
  "steps": [
    "The pirate has 3500 gold coins that need to be distributed equally among 5 chests.",
    "To find out how many gold coins go in each chest, I need to divide 3500 by 5.",
    "3500 divided by 5 equals 700. So, each chest will have 700 gold coins.",
    "The pirate also has a total of 500 silver coins to distribute equally among the 5 chests.",
    "To find out how many silver coins go in each chest, I need to divide 500 by 5.",
    "500 divided by 5 equals 100. So, each chest will have 100 silver coins.",
    "The pirate will put twice as many bronze coins as silver coins in total.",
    "Since he has 500 silver coins, the total number of bronze coins will be 2 times 500.",
    "2 times 500 equals 1000. Thus, there are 1000 bronze coins in total.",
    "To find out how many bronze coins go in each chest, I need to divide 1000 by 5.",
    "1000 divided by 5 equals 200. So, each chest will have 200 bronze coins.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of coins in each chest, which includes gold, silver, and bronze coins.",
    "Each chest has 700 gold coins, 100 silver coins, and 200 bronze coins.",
    "I will add these amounts together: 700 + 100 + 200.",
    "700 plus 100 equals 800.",
    "800 plus 200 equals 1000."
