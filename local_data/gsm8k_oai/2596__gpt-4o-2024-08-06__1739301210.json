  "query": "Henry scored 50 points on his Geography test, 70 on his Math test and 66 on his English test. If his History score is the average of these 3 scores, what was his total score across all 4 subjects?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the average of Henry's scores in Geography, Math, and English.",
    "To find the average of these scores, I will add them together and divide by the number of scores.",
    "Henry's scores are 50 in Geography, 70 in Math, and 66 in English.",
    "I will add these scores: 50 + 70 + 66 = 186.",
    "There are 3 subjects, so I need to divide the total by 3 to find the average.",
    "186 divided by 3 equals 62.",
    "Henry's History score, which is the average of the other three scores, is 62.",
    "Now I need to find the total score across all 4 subjects.",
    "I will add up the scores from Geography, Math, English, and History.",
    "The scores are 50 (Geography) + 70 (Math) + 66 (English) + 62 (History).",
    "I will add these scores: 50 + 70 + 66 + 62.",
    "50 + 70 = 120.",
    "120 + 66 = 186.",
    "186 + 62 = 248.",
    "The total score across all 4 subjects is 248."
