  "query": "The number of cards in a card game was 500. Two friends Ellis and Orion, playing together, divided the cards in the ratio of 11:9. How many more cards did Ellis get than Orion?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of cards is 500.",
    "Ellis and Orion divide the cards in the ratio of 11:9.",
    "The sum of the parts of the ratio is 11 + 9 = 20.",
    "Each part of the ratio therefore represents 500 / 20 = 25 cards.",
    "Ellis's share is 11 parts of the ratio, so Ellis gets 11 * 25 = 275 cards.",
    "Orion's share is 9 parts of the ratio, so Orion gets 9 * 25 = 225 cards.",
    "To find how many more cards Ellis received than Orion, subtract Orion's number of cards from Ellis's: 275 - 225.",
    "275 - 225 equals 50."
