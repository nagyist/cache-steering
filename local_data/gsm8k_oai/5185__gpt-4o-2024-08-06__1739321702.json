  "query": "Shelly and Sam love to go deep sea fishing for swordfish.  Each time they go deep sea fishing, Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish, and Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly.  If Sam and Shelly go fishing 5 times, how many swordfish do they catch in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many swordfish Shelly catches each time they go fishing.",
    "Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish each time.",
    "Five swordfish minus 2 equals 3 swordfish.",
    "Therefore, Shelly catches 3 swordfish each time.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many swordfish Sam catches each time.",
    "Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly.",
    "Shelly catches 3 swordfish, so Sam catches 3 minus 1.",
    "That means Sam catches 2 swordfish each time.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of swordfish Shelly catches in 5 trips.",
    "Shelly catches 3 swordfish per trip, so over 5 trips she catches 3 times 5.",
    "3 times 5 equals 15 swordfish.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of swordfish Sam catches in 5 trips.",
    "Sam catches 2 swordfish per trip, so over 5 trips he catches 2 times 5.",
    "2 times 5 equals 10 swordfish.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate the total number of swordfish caught by both Shelly and Sam.",
    "Shelly catches 15 swordfish, and Sam catches 10 swordfish.",
    "The total is 15 plus 10 swordfish.",
    "15 plus 10 equals 25 swordfish."
