  "query": "A man loves to go hiking.  He knows that he has to pack about .5 pounds of supplies for every mile he hikes.  He plans to go for a very long hike.  He knows that he can get 1 resupply during the hike that will be 25% as large as his first pack.  He can hike at a rate of 2.5 mph.  He is going to hike 8 hours a day for 5 days.  How much does he need to bring with his first pack?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how many miles he will hike each day. He hikes at a rate of 2.5 mph.",
    "He plans to hike for 8 hours each day.",
    "To find the daily hiking distance, multiply the hiking rate by the hours per day: 2.5 mph * 8 hours = 20 miles per day.",
    "Next, calculate the total distance he will hike over 5 days by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days: 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.",
    "The man needs to carry 0.5 pounds of supplies per mile initially. Therefore, for 100 miles, he needs 0.5 pounds/mile * 100 miles = 50 pounds of supplies.",
    "He knows that he will receive a resupply that will be 25% as large as the first pack. Thus, the resupply amount is 25% of the initial supplies, which is 0.25 * initial pack weight.",
    "Let's denote the initial pack weight as x. The resupply amount is 0.25x.",
    "He must have enough supplies to cover 100 miles total. We account for both his initial packing and the resupply: x (initial pack) + 0.25x (resupply) = 50 pounds.",
    "Combine terms: 1x + 0.25x = 1.25x = 50 pounds.",
    "Solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.25: x = 50 / 1.25",
    "Calculate: 50 / 1.25 = 40."

  "solution": "40"
