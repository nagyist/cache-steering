  "query": "As Dan is learning to screen-print t-shirts to sell at the craft fair, he makes t-shirts, over the first hour, at the rate of one every 12 minutes. Then, in the second hour, he makes one at the rate of every 6 minutes. How many t-shirts does he make over the course of those two hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many t-shirts Dan makes during the first hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "Dan makes a t-shirt every 12 minutes during the first hour.",
    "To find out how many t-shirts he makes in the first hour, I divide 60 minutes by 12 minutes per t-shirt.",
    "60 minutes / 12 minutes per t-shirt equals 5 t-shirts.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many t-shirts Dan makes during the second hour.",
    "For the second hour, Dan makes a t-shirt every 6 minutes.",
    "Again, there are 60 minutes in this hour.",
    "I divide 60 minutes by 6 minutes per t-shirt to find out how many t-shirts he makes.",
    "60 minutes / 6 minutes per t-shirt equals 10 t-shirts.",
    "Now, I add the t-shirts from the first hour and the second hour to find the total.",
    "5 t-shirts from the first hour plus 10 t-shirts from the second hour equals 15 t-shirts."

  "solution": "15"
