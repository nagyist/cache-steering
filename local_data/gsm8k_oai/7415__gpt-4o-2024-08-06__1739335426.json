  "query": "It took Dad 5 more than twice as long to vacuum upstairs then to vacuum downstairs. He vacuumed for a total of 38 minutes. How many minutes did he vacuum upstairs?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the time taken to vacuum downstairs be \\( x \\) minutes.",
    "The time taken to vacuum upstairs is 5 more than twice the downstairs time, so it can be represented as \\( 2x + 5 \\).",
    "The total time for both tasks is 38 minutes.",
    "Set up the equation: \\( x + (2x + 5) = 38 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( x + 2x + 5 = 38 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 3x + 5 = 38 \\).",
    "Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\): \\( 3x = 33 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 11 \\).",
    "Now, substitute \\( x = 11 \\) back into the expression for the upstairs time: \\( 2x + 5 = 2(11) + 5 = 22 + 5 \\).",
    "Calculate the upstairs time: \\( 22 + 5 = 27 \\)."
