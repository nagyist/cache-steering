  "query": "Josh went to the shopping center. He bought 9 films and 4 books. He also bought 6 CDs. Each film cost $5, each book cost $4 and each CD cost $3. How much did Josh spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out the total cost of the films, books, and CDs.",
    "First, I'll calculate the total cost of the films.",
    "Josh bought 9 films, and each film cost $5.",
    "Multiplying the number of films by the cost per film gives: 9 films * $5/film = $45.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the books.",
    "Josh bought 4 books, and each book cost $4.",
    "Multiplying the number of books by the cost per book gives: 4 books * $4/book = $16.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total cost of the CDs.",
    "Josh bought 6 CDs, and each CD cost $3.",
    "Multiplying the number of CDs by the cost per CD gives: 6 CDs * $3/CD = $18.",
    "Now I will find the total amount spent by adding the costs of films, books, and CDs together.",
    "The total amount spent is $45 (films) + $16 (books) + $18 (CDs).",
    "Adding these amounts gives: $45 + $16 + $18 = $79."
