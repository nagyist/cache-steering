  "query": "Briar is attending a one-week community empowerment event and has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. A cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. If the event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, calculate the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the distance that Briar travels in one day for both the ride to the event and the ride back home.",
    "The event is 200 miles away from Briar's home.",
    "So, the round trip distance per day is 200 miles to the event and 200 miles back home.",
    "The round trip distance per day is 200 + 200 = 400 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the cab rides for one whole day.",
    "The cost per mile is $2.5.",
    "Thus, the cost per day is 400 miles * $2.5 per mile.",
    "Calculate the daily cost: 400 * 2.5 = 1000 dollars per day.",
    "Now, determine the number of days Briar attends the event.",
    "The event is one week long.",
    "A week has 7 days.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost of all cab rides for the entire week.",
    "Total cost = daily cost * number of days of the event.",
    "Total cost = 1000 dollars per day * 7 days.",
    "Calculate the total cost: 1000 * 7 = 7000 dollars."

  "solution": "7000"
