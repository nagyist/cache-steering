  "query": "Frank picked 36 apples. Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank. If Susan gave out half of her apples, and Frank sold a third of his, how many in total do they have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Frank picked 36 apples.",
    "Susan picked 3 times as many apples as Frank.",
    "3 times 36 is 108, so Susan picked 108 apples.",
    "Susan gave out half of her apples.",
    "Half of 108 is 54, so Susan gave out 54 apples.",
    "Susan has 108 - 54 apples left.",
    "108 - 54 is 54, so Susan has 54 apples left.",
    "Frank sold a third of his apples.",
    "A third of 36 is 12, so Frank sold 12 apples.",
    "Frank has 36 - 12 apples left.",
    "36 - 12 is 24, so Frank has 24 apples left.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of apples they both have left.",
    "Susan has 54 apples left and Frank has 24 apples left.",
    "54 + 24 is 78."

  "solution": "78"
