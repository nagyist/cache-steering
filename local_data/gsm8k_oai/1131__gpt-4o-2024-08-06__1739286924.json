  "query": "Tire repair for each tire costs $7, plus another 50 cents for sales tax. If Juan needs all 4 tires repaired, how much is the final cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the cost of repairing one tire. The repair cost is $7.",
    "In addition to the repair cost, there is a sales tax of 50 cents per tire.",
    "So, the total cost for repairing one tire, including tax, would be $7 + $0.50, which equals $7.50.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for all 4 tires.",
    "Multiply the total cost for one tire ($7.50) by 4 to find the cost for all 4 tires.",
    "$7.50 * 4 = $30."
