  "query": "Abigail thinks she has some lost some money out of her purse. She had $11 in her purse at the start of the day, and she spent $2 in a store. If she now has $3 left, how much money has she lost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Abigail is expected to have after spending money at the store.",
    "Abigail started with $11 in her purse.",
    "She spent $2 in the store.",
    "So, the expected amount of money left after spending would be $11 - $2 = $9.",
    "Abigail currently has $3 left.",
    "To find out how much money she lost, I need to calculate the difference between the expected amount ($9) and the actual amount ($3).",
    "The difference is $9 - $3 = $6."
