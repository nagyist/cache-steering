  "query": "Zoe ate a snack of 12 strawberries and 6 ounces of yogurt. If strawberries have 4 calories each and yogurt has 17 calories per ounce, how many calories did Zoe eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the calories from the strawberries.",
    "Each strawberry has 4 calories, and Zoe ate 12 strawberries.",
    "I multiply 12 strawberries by 4 calories per strawberry: \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\).",
    "So, the strawberries add 48 calories in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the calories from the yogurt.",
    "The yogurt has 17 calories per ounce, and Zoe ate 6 ounces.",
    "I multiply 6 ounces by 17 calories per ounce: \\(6 \\times 17 = 102\\).",
    "So, the yogurt adds 102 calories in total.",
    "Now, I add the calories from the strawberries and the yogurt together.",
    "48 calories (strawberries) + 102 calories (yogurt) equals 150 calories."

  "solution": "150"
