  "query": "Nora is selling muffins to raise $120 for an upcoming school trip. She has packaged the muffins in cases. Each case has three packs of muffins. Each pack has four muffins. If she prices each muffin at two dollars, how many cases of muffins must she sell to raise enough money for the trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many muffins are in one case.",
    "Each case contains three packs.",
    "Each pack has four muffins.",
    "To find the total number of muffins in one case, I can multiply the number of packs by the number of muffins per pack.",
    "3 packs per case \u00d7 4 muffins per pack = 12 muffins per case.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money Nora will make from selling one case of muffins.",
    "Each muffin is priced at two dollars.",
    "Therefore, 12 muffins \u00d7 2 dollars per muffin = 24 dollars per case.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cases of muffins Nora needs to sell to raise $120.",
    "I will divide the total amount needed by the amount of money raised per case.",
    "120 dollars \u00f7 24 dollars per case = 5 cases.",
    "Nora needs to sell 5 cases of muffins to raise $120."
