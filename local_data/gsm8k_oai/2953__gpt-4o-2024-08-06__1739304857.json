  "query": "There is a pie-eating contest at school. Adam eats three more pies than Bill. Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill. If Sierra ate 12 pies, how many pies were eaten in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pies Bill ate.",
    "We know Sierra ate 12 pies, and Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill.",
    "To find out how many pies Bill ate, I divide the number of pies Sierra ate by 2.",
    "12 pies divided by 2 equals 6 pies.",
    "So, Bill ate 6 pies.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pies Adam ate.",
    "According to the problem, Adam eats three more pies than Bill.",
    "Bill ate 6 pies, so Adam eats 6 + 3 = 9 pies.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of pies eaten by Adam, Bill, and Sierra.",
    "Bill ate 6 pies, Adam ate 9 pies, and Sierra ate 12 pies.",
    "Adding them together gives 6 + 9 + 12.",
    "6 + 9 = 15.",
    "15 + 12 = 27."

  "solution": "27"
