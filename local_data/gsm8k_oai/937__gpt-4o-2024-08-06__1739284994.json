  "query": "Stella wanted to buy a new dress for the upcoming dance.  At the store she found out that the dress she wanted was $50.  The store was offering 30% off of everything in the store.  What was the final cost of the dress?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that the dress costs $50 initially.",
    "I also know that the store is offering a 30% discount.",
    "I need to calculate the amount of discount on the dress.",
    "To find the discount amount, I will multiply the price of the dress by the discount percentage in decimal form: $50 * 0.30.",
    "Calculating this, $50 multiplied by 0.30 equals $15.",
    "Now, I will subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost of the dress.",
    "The original price is $50, and the discount amount is $15.",
    "Subtracting these, $50 - $15 equals $35."
