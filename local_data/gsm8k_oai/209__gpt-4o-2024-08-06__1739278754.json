  "query": "Five coaster vans are used to transport students for their field trip. Each van carries 28 students, 60 of which are boys. How many are girls?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that there are five coaster vans, each carrying 28 students.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of students.",
    "To find the total number of students, I multiply the number of coaster vans by the number of students each van carries.",
    "So, the total number of students is 5 vans * 28 students/van = 140 students.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students are girls.",
    "The problem states that 60 of the students are boys.",
    "To find the number of girls, I subtract the number of boys from the total number of students.",
    "So, the number of girls is 140 - 60 = 80."
