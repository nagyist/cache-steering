  "steps": [
    "Martin eats 1/2 cup of berries every day.",
    "A package of berries contains 1 cup and costs $2.00.",
    "Martin needs 1/2 cup per day, so in 2 days, he will consume 1 full cup of berries.",
    "Each package, costing $2.00, will last him 2 days.",
    "To find out how many packages Martin needs in 30 days, divide the number of days by 2: 30 days \u00f7 2 days/package = 15 packages.",
    "Each package costs $2.00, and Martin needs 15 packages.",
    "Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packages by the cost per package: 15 packages \u00d7 $2.00/package = $30.00."
