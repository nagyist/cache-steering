  "query": "Niles is collecting his book club's annual fees. Each of the six members pays $150/year towards snacks, plus $30 each for six hardcover books and $12 each for six paperback books. How much money does Niles collect in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total amount each member pays for the annual fees.",
    "Each member pays $150 for snacks.",
    "Each hardcover book costs $30, and each member purchases six books. Therefore, each member spends 6 * $30 = $180 on hardcover books.",
    "Each paperback book costs $12, and each member purchases six books. Therefore, each member spends 6 * $12 = $72 on paperback books.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total amount each member pays by adding the costs for snacks, hardcover books, and paperback books.",
    "Total for each member = $150 (snacks) + $180 (hardcover books) + $72 (paperback books) = $402.",
    "There are six members in the book club, so I need to multiply the total amount for each member by the number of members.",
    "Total amount collected by Niles = 6 * $402.",
    "Calculating the total gives 6 * $402 = $2412."
