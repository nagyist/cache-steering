  "query": "Jamie owns 4 Persian cats and 2 Maine Coons. Gordon owns half as many Persians and one more Maine Coon than Jamie. Hawkeye owns one less Maine Coon than Gordon and no Persian cats. If they bring all of their cats together to play, how many cats are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Jamie owns 4 Persian cats.",
    "Jamie owns 2 Maine Coons.",
    "Gordon owns half as many Persians as Jamie. Jamie has 4 Persians, so half would be 2.",
    "Gordon owns 1 more Maine Coon than Jamie. Jamie has 2 Maine Coons, so Gordon has 2 + 1 = 3 Maine Coons.",
    "Hawkeye owns 1 less Maine Coon than Gordon. Gordon has 3 Maine Coons, so Hawkeye has 3 - 1 = 2 Maine Coons.",
    "Hawkeye does not own any Persian cats.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of cats for each type and owner.",
    "Jamie has 4 Persian cats + 2 Maine Coons = 6 cats in total.",
    "Gordon has 2 Persian cats + 3 Maine Coons = 5 cats in total.",
    "Hawkeye has 0 Persian cats + 2 Maine Coons = 2 cats in total.",
    "Now add the totals: 6 cats (Jamie) + 5 cats (Gordon) + 2 cats (Hawkeye).",
    "6 + 5 + 2 = 13."

  "solution": "13"
