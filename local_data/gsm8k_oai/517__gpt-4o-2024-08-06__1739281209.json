  "query": "Roger rode his bike for 2 miles this morning, and then 5 times that amount in the evening.  How many miles did Roger ride his bike for?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles Roger rode in the evening.",
    "The problem says he rode 5 times the amount he rode in the morning in the evening.",
    "In the morning, Roger rode 2 miles.",
    "So, in the evening, he rode 5 times 2 miles.",
    "5 times 2 is 10.",
    "So, Roger rode 10 miles in the evening.",
    "Now, I need to find the total distance he rode for the whole day.",
    "I add the miles from the morning and the evening rides.",
    "In the morning, he rode 2 miles, and in the evening, he rode 10 miles.",
    "2 miles plus 10 miles equals 12 miles."

  "solution": "12"
