  "query": "Three frogs are trying to hop across the road. The first frog takes 4 times as many hops as the second.  The second frog takes twice as many as the third.  If the three frogs took a total of 99 hops, how many hops did it take the second frog to cross the road?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of hops the third frog takes as \\( x \\).",
    "The second frog takes twice the number of hops as the third frog, so it takes \\( 2x \\) hops.",
    "The first frog takes four times the number of hops as the second frog, so it takes \\( 4 \\times 2x = 8x \\) hops.",
    "The total number of hops taken by all three frogs is 99.",
    "So we can write the equation: \\( x + 2x + 8x = 99 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( 11x = 99 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 11: \\( x = \\frac{99}{11} = 9 \\).",
    "Now that we have \\( x = 9 \\), which is the number of hops the third frog takes,",
    "The second frog takes \\( 2x = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\) hops."
