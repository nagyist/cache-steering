  "query": "Tony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Tony's speed when driving between the two towns.",
    "The distance between the two towns is 120 miles, and it takes Tony 3 hours to cover this distance.",
    "To find the speed, I divide the distance by the time: speed = distance / time.",
    "Calculating: speed = 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour.",
    "Now that I know Tony's speed is 40 miles per hour, I need to find out how long it takes for him to drive 200 miles at this speed.",
    "To find the time, I use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "Calculating: time = 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours."

  "solution": "5"
