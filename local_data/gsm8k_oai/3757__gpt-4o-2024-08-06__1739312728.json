  "query": "In 5 years, Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude.  If Heath is 16 years old today, how old is Jude today?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Heath's age in 5 years.",
    "Heath is 16 years old today.",
    "In 5 years, he will be 16 + 5 = 21 years old.",
    "Now, I need to consider the condition given: Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude in 5 years.",
    "If Heath is 21 years old in 5 years, then 21 = 3 * (Jude's age in 5 years).",
    "To find Jude's age in 5 years, I need to solve the equation 21 = 3 * (Jude's age in 5 years).",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find Jude's age in 5 years: Jude's age in 5 years = 21 / 3 = 7.",
    "Now I need to determine Jude's current age.",
    "Since Jude will be 7 in 5 years, I subtract 5 from 7 to find Jude's current age.",
    "Jude's current age is 7 - 5 = 2."
