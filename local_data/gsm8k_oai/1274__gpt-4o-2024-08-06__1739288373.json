  "query": "At Esme's school, there are 30 teachers and 45 staff members. On a Monday morning, The Best Pizza Inn brought pizza for the staff and teachers as a promotion offer. If 2/3 of the teachers and 4/5 of the staff members ate Pizza, how many non-pizza eaters are at Esme's school?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many teachers ate pizza. There are 30 teachers in total.",
    "According to the problem, 2/3 of the teachers ate pizza.",
    "To find the number of teachers who ate pizza, I calculate: 2/3 * 30 = 20 teachers.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many staff members ate pizza. There are 45 staff members in total.",
    "4/5 of the staff members ate pizza, according to the problem.",
    "To find the number of staff members who ate pizza, I calculate: 4/5 * 45 = 36 staff members.",
    "Now I have the number of teachers and staff members who ate pizza: 20 teachers and 36 staff members.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of people who ate pizza by adding these two numbers: 20 + 36 = 56 people.",
    "Next, I need to find out the total number of teachers and staff members combined at Esme's school.",
    "The total number of people is 30 teachers + 45 staff members = 75 people.",
    "To find the number of non-pizza eaters, I subtract the number of people who ate pizza from the total number of people: 75 - 56 = 19 people."
