  "query": "Every year, Tabitha adds a new color to her hair.  She started this tradition when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color.  In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in the hair.  Currently, how old is Tabitha?",
  "steps": [
    "I want to find out how many colors Tabitha currently has in her hair.",
    "I know that in three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.",
    "Since she adds one new color each year, right now she must have 8 - 3 = 5 colors in her hair.",
    "Tabitha started adding colors when she was 15 years old, and that was when she added her second color.",
    "So when Tabitha was 15, she already had 2 colors in her hair.",
    "She is adding one color each year, so I need to find out how many years have passed since she was 15.",
    "Currently, she has 5 colors, and she had 2 colors initially.",
    "So, 5 colors - 2 colors = 3 years since she started adding new colors.",
    "Tabitha was 15 years old when she began adding colors. I need to add those 3 years to her starting age.",
    "15 years + 3 years = 18 years."
