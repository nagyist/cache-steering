  "query": "At the salad bar, Grandma put three mushrooms on her salad.  She also added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, 4 times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes, and 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles.  If one third of the bacon bits were red, than how many red bacon bits did Grandma put on her salad?",
  "steps": [
    "Grandma put 3 mushrooms on her salad.",
    "She added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms. Therefore, she added 2 * 3 = 6 cherry tomatoes.",
    "She added 4 times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes. Therefore, she added 4 * 6 = 24 pickles.",
    "She added 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles. Therefore, she added 4 * 24 = 96 bacon bits.",
    "One third of the bacon bits were red. So, the number of red bacon bits is 96 / 3 = 32."
