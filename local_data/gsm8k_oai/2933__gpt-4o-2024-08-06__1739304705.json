  "query": "There are 235 books in a library. On Tuesday, 227 books are taken out. On Thursday, 56 books are brought back and 35 books are taken out again on Friday. How many books are there now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that the library initially has 235 books.",
    "On Tuesday, 227 books are taken out. So, I will subtract 227 from 235.",
    "235 - 227 equals 8 books left in the library after Tuesday.",
    "On Thursday, 56 books are brought back into the library.",
    "I will add 56 to the books remaining in the library after Tuesday.",
    "8 + 56 equals 64 books in the library after Thursday.",
    "On Friday, 35 books are taken out.",
    "I will subtract 35 from the books remaining in the library after Thursday.",
    "64 - 35 equals 29 books left in the library."
