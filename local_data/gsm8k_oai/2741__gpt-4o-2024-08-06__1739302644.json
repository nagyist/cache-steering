  "query": "Zoe wants to go on the field trip to Washington DC with her middle school this spring and the cost is $485. Her grandma gave her $250 toward her fees and she must earn the rest by selling candy bars. She makes $1.25 for every candy bar she sells. How many candy bars does Zoe need to sell to earn the money for the trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Zoe still needs for the trip after receiving her grandma's contribution.",
    "The total cost of the trip is $485.",
    "Her grandma gave her $250.",
    "I will subtract $250 from $485 to find the remaining amount Zoe needs.",
    "$485 - $250 equals $235.",
    "Zoe still needs $235.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many candy bars Zoe has to sell to earn $235.",
    "She earns $1.25 for each candy bar she sells.",
    "To find the number of candy bars, I will divide the remaining amount she needs by the amount she earns per candy bar.",
    "I will divide $235 by $1.25.",
    "$235 / $1.25 equals 188.",
    "Zoe needs to sell 188 candy bars to earn $235."

  "solution": "188"
