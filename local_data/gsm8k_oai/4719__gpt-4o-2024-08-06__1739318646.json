  "query": "Sid takes $48 with him on a shopping trip to the mall.  He spent some of his money on computer accessories and another $8 on snacks. After these purchases, he only has $4 more than half of his original money left. How much did he spend on computer accessories?",
  "steps": [
    "Sid starts with $48.",
    "He spends $8 on snacks.",
    "After buying snacks, Sid has $48 - $8 = $40.",
    "Let the amount he spent on computer accessories be x.",
    "After spending x on computer accessories, he has $40 - x left.",
    "According to the problem, $40 - x is $4 more than half of his original money.",
    "Half of his original money is $48 / 2 = $24.",
    "$4 more than half of his original money is $24 + $4 = $28.",
    "We have the equation: $40 - x = $28.",
    "Solving for x, we get x = $40 - $28.",
    "Thus, x = $12."
