  "query": "Jeff\u2019s swimming coach required him to swim 98 laps over the weekend. On Saturday, Jeff swam 27 laps. On Sunday morning, he swam 15 laps, took a break, then resumed practice in the afternoon. How many laps did Jeff have remaining when he took the break?",
  "steps": [
    "Jeff was required to swim a total of 98 laps over the weekend.",
    "On Saturday, Jeff swam 27 laps.",
    "Then, on Sunday morning, Jeff swam 15 laps.",
    "I need to calculate how many laps he swam in total before his Sunday afternoon practice.",
    "Adding the laps from Saturday and Sunday morning: 27 laps + 15 laps = 42 laps.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many laps Jeff had remaining out of the original 98 laps requirement.",
    "Subtract the laps swum (42) from the total required laps (98).",
    "98 laps - 42 laps = 56 laps remaining."
