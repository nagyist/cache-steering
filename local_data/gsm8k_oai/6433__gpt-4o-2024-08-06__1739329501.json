  "query": "There are 48 crayons in the box.  Kiley takes 1/4 of them away.  Joe takes away half of the remaining crayons, how many crayons are left?",
  "steps": [
    "There are initially 48 crayons in the box.",
    "Kiley takes 1/4 of the 48 crayons.",
    "Calculate 1/4 of 48 by dividing 48 by 4.",
    "48 divided by 4 is 12.",
    "So, Kiley takes 12 crayons away.",
    "Subtract the 12 crayons Kiley took from the initial 48 crayons.",
    "48 minus 12 equals 36.",
    "There are 36 crayons remaining after Kiley takes her share.",
    "Joe takes away half of the remaining crayons.",
    "Calculate half of the remaining 36 crayons by dividing 36 by 2.",
    "36 divided by 2 is 18.",
    "Joe takes 18 crayons away.",
    "Subtract the 18 crayons Joe took from the remaining 36 crayons.",
    "36 minus 18 equals 18.",
    "There are 18 crayons left after Joe takes his share."
