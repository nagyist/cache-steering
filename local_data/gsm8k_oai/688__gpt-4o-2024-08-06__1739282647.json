  "query": "Trent caught 180 tadpoles then let 75% of them go. How many did he keep?",
  "steps": [
    "Trent initially caught 180 tadpoles.",
    "He let go of 75% of them.",
    "To find out how many he let go, I need to calculate 75% of 180.",
    "75% can be expressed as the fraction \\(\\frac{75}{100}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).",
    "Now, I will multiply 180 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).",
    "180 multiplied by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is calculated as \\(180 \\times 0.75\\).",
    "\\(180 \\times 0.75 = 135\\).",
    "He let go of 135 tadpoles.",
    "To find out how many tadpoles Trent kept, I need to subtract the number he let go from the total he initially caught.",
    "Subtract 135 from 180: \\(180 - 135\\).",
    "180 minus 135 equals 45."
