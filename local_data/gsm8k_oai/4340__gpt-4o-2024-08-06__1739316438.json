  "query": "Claudia offers art classes to kids and charges $10.00 for her one-hour class.  If 20 kids attend Saturday\u2019s class and half that many attend Sunday\u2019s class, how much money does she make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many kids attend the Saturday class. I already know that 20 kids attend the Saturday class.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many kids attend the Sunday class. It is mentioned that half as many kids attend Sunday\u2019s class as Saturday\u2019s class. So, I will calculate half of 20.",
    "Half of 20 is 10. Therefore, 10 kids attend the Sunday class.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total number of kids attending classes on both days.",
    "There are 20 kids on Saturday and 10 kids on Sunday, so the total number of kids attending is 20 + 10.",
    "20 + 10 equals 30, so 30 kids attend classes over the weekend.",
    "Each kid pays $10.00 for the class, so I need to multiply the total number of kids by the cost per kid to find the total income.",
    "The calculation is 30 kids times $10.00 per kid.",
    "30 times $10.00 equals $300.00."

  "solution": "300"
