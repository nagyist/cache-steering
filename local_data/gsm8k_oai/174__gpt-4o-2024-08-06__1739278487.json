  "query": "Movie tickets cost $5 each on a Monday, twice as much on a Wednesday, and five times as much as Monday on a Saturday. If Glenn goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday, how much does he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of a movie ticket on Wednesday.",
    "Movie tickets cost $5 each on a Monday.",
    "On Wednesday, the cost is twice as much as Monday.",
    "So, the ticket price on Wednesday is 2 times $5, which is $10.",
    "Next, I need to figure out the cost of a movie ticket on Saturday.",
    "The ticket price on Saturday is five times as much as Monday.",
    "So, the ticket price on Saturday is 5 times $5, which is $25.",
    "Glenn goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday.",
    "The total amount Glenn spends is the cost of one ticket on Wednesday plus the cost of one ticket on Saturday.",
    "The total cost is $10 (Wednesday) + $25 (Saturday).",
    "Therefore, Glenn spends $35 in total."
