  "query": "If Layla scored 104 goals in four hockey games and Kristin scored 24 fewer goals in the same four games, calculate the average number of goals the two scored.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many goals Kristin scored in total.",
    "I know she scored 24 fewer goals than Layla. Layla scored 104 goals.",
    "So, Kristin scored \\( 104 - 24 \\) goals.",
    "Calculating, Kristin scored 80 goals in total.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of goals scored by both Layla and Kristin together.",
    "I add Layla's goals and Kristin's goals together: \\( 104 + 80 \\).",
    "Calculating, the total number of goals scored by both is 184.",
    "To find the average number of goals scored by Layla and Kristin, I take the total number of goals and divide by the number of players.",
    "There are 2 players, Layla and Kristin.",
    "Therefore, I divide 184 by 2 to find the average.",
    "Calculating, the average number of goals scored is \\( 184 \\div 2 \\).",
    "184 divided by 2 is 92."
