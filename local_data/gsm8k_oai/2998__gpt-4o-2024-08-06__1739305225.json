  "query": "As a freelancer, Katherine takes 20 hours to develop a website for her clients. Her junior, Naomi, takes 1/4 times more time to complete creating a similar website. If many clients required her to build their websites in a particular year, and she gave her junior 30 websites to develop, calculate the total number of hours Katherine's junior took to create the 30 websites.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much time Naomi, the junior, takes to develop one website.",
    "I know Katherine takes 20 hours to build a website.",
    "According to the problem, Naomi takes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) times more time than Katherine.",
    "To calculate Naomi's time, I need to find \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of 20 hours.",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of 20 hours is \\( 20 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 5 \\) hours.",
    "Naomi takes an additional 5 hours on top of Katherine's 20 hours.",
    "Thus, Naomi takes \\( 20 + 5 = 25 \\) hours to complete one website.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of hours Naomi took to create 30 websites.",
    "If Naomi takes 25 hours for one website, for 30 websites, it would be \\( 30 \\times 25 \\) hours.",
    "Calculating \\( 30 \\times 25 \\) gives me 750 hours."

  "solution": "750"
