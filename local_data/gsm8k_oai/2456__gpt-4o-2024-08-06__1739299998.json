  "query": "Balki is counting the number of raisins in boxes of cereal. He counted 437 total raisins in 5 boxes. In one box he counted 72 raisins. In a second box he counted 74 raisins. The other three boxes had the same number each. How many were in each of the other three boxes?",
  "steps": [
    "Balki counted a total of 437 raisins in 5 boxes.",
    "In the first box, there are 72 raisins.",
    "In the second box, there are 74 raisins.",
    "The sum of the raisins in the first two boxes is 72 + 74.",
    "72 + 74 equals 146.",
    "Subtract the raisins in the first two boxes from the total raisins to find the total in the other three boxes.",
    "437 - 146 equals 291.",
    "The other three boxes have a total of 291 raisins.",
    "Since all three boxes have the same number of raisins, divide 291 by 3 to find the number in each box.",
    "291 divided by 3 equals 97."
