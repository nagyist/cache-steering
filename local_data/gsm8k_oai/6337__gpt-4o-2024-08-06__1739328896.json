  "query": "There are 141 gold balloons and twice as many silver balloons. If the gold and silver balloons were added to 150 black balloons, how many balloons are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many silver balloons there are.",
    "I know from the problem that there are twice as many silver balloons as there are gold balloons.",
    "Since there are 141 gold balloons, the number of silver balloons is 2 times 141.",
    "2 times 141 is equal to 282.",
    "Now I have 141 gold balloons and 282 silver balloons.",
    "The problem asks for the total number of balloons when these are added to 150 black balloons.",
    "I need to add the numbers together: 141 (gold) + 282 (silver) + 150 (black).",
    "First, I add 141 and 282.",
    "141 + 282 is equal to 423.",
    "Next, I add 423 (sum of gold and silver) to 150 (black balloons).",
    "423 + 150 is 573.",
    "I have now calculated the total number of balloons."

  "solution": "573"
