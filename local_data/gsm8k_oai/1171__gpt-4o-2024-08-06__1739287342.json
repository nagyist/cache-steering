  "query": "Jack will have ten times more handball trophies than Michael has right now in three years. If Michael has 30 trophies right now, and the number of his trophies increases by 100 in three years, what's the total number of trophies they'll have altogether after three years?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many trophies Michael will have in three years.",
    "Michael has 30 trophies right now. In three years, his trophies increase by 100.",
    "So, in three years, Michael will have 30 + 100 = 130 trophies.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many trophies Jack will have in three years.",
    "The problem states that Jack will have ten times more trophies than Michael currently has in three years.",
    "Currently, Michael has 30 trophies. Ten times more than 30 is 10 x 30 = 300.",
    "Therefore, Jack will have 300 trophies in three years.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of trophies Jack and Michael will have together in three years.",
    "Michael will have 130 trophies, and Jack will have 300 trophies.",
    "Adding these together gives 130 + 300 = 430."

  "solution": "430"
