  "query": "In a survey about the student's favorite sports, 40% said they like basketball, 10% like chess, 28% like soccer, and the rest said they like badminton. If 250 students were interviewed, how many students identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many students chose each sport. This requires calculating the number of students for each percentage.",
    "Start with basketball: 40% of 250 students like basketball.",
    "Calculate 40% of 250. That is (40/100) * 250.",
    "40/100 simplifies to 0.4.",
    "Multiply 0.4 by 250 to find the number of students who like basketball.",
    "0.4 * 250 = 100.",
    "So, 100 students like basketball.",
    "Next, calculate the number of students who like chess.",
    "10% of students like chess, so calculate 10% of 250.",
    "10% can be expressed as (10/100) or 0.1.",
    "Multiply 0.1 by 250.",
    "0.1 * 250 = 25.",
    "So, 25 students like chess.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of students who identified either basketball or chess as their favorite sport.",
    "Add the number of students who like basketball (100) to the number of students who like chess (25).",
    "100 + 25 = 125.",
    "Therefore, 125 students identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport."

  "solution": "125"
