  "query": "Rachel is twice as old as Rona and Collete's age is half the age of Rona's. If Rona is 8 years old, what is the difference between the age of Collete and Rachel?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start with Rona's age. We are given that Rona is 8 years old.",
    "Rachel is twice as old as Rona. To find Rachel's age, I need to multiply Rona's age by 2.",
    "Rona is 8 years old, so Rachel is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.",
    "Collete's age is half of Rona's age. To find Collete's age, I need to divide Rona's age by 2.",
    "Rona is 8 years old, so Collete is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.",
    "I now have Rachel's age as 16 years and Collete's age as 4 years.",
    "The difference between Rachel's age and Collete's age is 16 - 4.",
    "Let's calculate the difference: 16 - 4 = 12."
