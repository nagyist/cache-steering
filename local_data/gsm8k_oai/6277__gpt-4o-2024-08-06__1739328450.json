  "query": "Adam, Andrew and Ahmed all raise goats.  Adam has 7 goats.  Andrew has 5 more than twice as many goats as Adam.  Ahmed has 6 fewer goats than Andrew.  How many goats does Ahmed have?",
  "steps": [
    "Adam has 7 goats.",
    "Andrew has 5 more than twice as many goats as Adam.",
    "First, I need to calculate twice as many goats as Adam has.",
    "Twice as many as Adam's 7 goats is 2 * 7 = 14 goats.",
    "Now, I will add 5 more to this number for Andrew.",
    "Andrew has 14 + 5 = 19 goats.",
    "Ahmed has 6 fewer goats than Andrew.",
    "So, I need to subtract 6 from the number of goats Andrew has.",
    "19 - 6 = 13 goats."
