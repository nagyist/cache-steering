  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many widgets John makes in one day.",
    "John makes 20 widgets an hour.",
    "He works 8 hours a day.",
    "To find out how many widgets he makes in one day, I will multiply the widgets per hour by the hours he works per day.",
    "20 widgets/hour * 8 hours/day = 160 widgets/day",
    "Next, I will determine how many days John works in a week.",
    "John works 5 days a week.",
    "Now, to find out how many widgets John makes in a week, I will multiply the number of widgets he makes in a day by the number of days he works in a week.",
    "160 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 800 widgets/week"
