  "query": "Honey earned $80 a day. Every day, she spent part of her pay and saved the rest. After 20 days of work, she spent $1360. How much did Honey save in 20 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Honey's total earnings over the 20 days.",
    "Honey earns $80 a day.",
    "Total earnings in 20 days = 20 days * $80/day = $1600.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Honey spent in total over these 20 days.",
    "It is given that Honey spent $1360.",
    "Now, to find out how much Honey saved, I need to subtract the total amount spent from her total earnings.",
    "Total savings = Total earnings - Total amount spent.",
    "Total savings = $1600 - $1360.",
    "Calculate the difference: $1600 - $1360 = $240."
