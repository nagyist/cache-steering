  "query": "On Tuesday, Max's mom gave him $8 dollars for a hot dog at the Grand Boulevard park. On Wednesday, his mom gave him 5 times as much money as she gave him on Tuesday. On Thursday, his mom gave him $9 more in money than she gave him on Wednesday. How much more money did his mom give him on Thursday than she gave him on Tuesday?",
  "steps": [
    "On Tuesday, Max's mom gave him $8.",
    "On Wednesday, Max received 5 times as much money as he did on Tuesday.",
    "5 times $8 is calculated as \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\).",
    "So, on Wednesday, Max got $40.",
    "On Thursday, he got $9 more than he did on Wednesday.",
    "Adding $9 to the $40 he got on Wednesday gives us \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).",
    "So, on Thursday, Max received $49.",
    "Now I need to find out how much more money his mom gave him on Thursday than she did on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday, Max got $8.",
    "On Thursday, he got $49.",
    "To find the difference, subtract the Tuesday amount from the Thursday amount: \\(49 - 8 = 41\\)."
