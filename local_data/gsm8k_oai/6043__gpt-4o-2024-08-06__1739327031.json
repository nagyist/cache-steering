  "query": "Carlos has some gold quarters. If he spends them in a store, they are worth the regular amount. If he melts them down, he can get $100 per ounce. Each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce. How many times more money would he get from melting them down instead of spending them in a store?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the value of the quarters if Carlos spends them in a store.",
    "A regular U.S. quarter is worth $0.25 when spent in a store.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the melt value of a quarter.",
    "Each quarter weighs 1/5 of an ounce.",
    "If melted, the gold is worth $100 per ounce.",
    "Since each quarter is 1/5 of an ounce, the melt value of one quarter is 1/5 of $100.",
    "Calculate 1/5 of $100.",
    "1/5 of $100 is $20.",
    "Now, compare the melt value with the spent value of the quarter.",
    "The melt value is $20, and the spent value is $0.25.",
    "To find how many times more money Carlos would get from melting down the quarters, divide the melt value by the spent value.",
    "Calculate 20 \u00f7 0.25.",
    "20 \u00f7 0.25 equals 80."

  "solution": "80"
