  "query": "It takes 3 ounces of wax to detail Kellan\u2019s car and 4 ounces to detail his SUV. He bought an 11-ounce bottle of vehicle wax, but spilled 2 ounces before using it. How many ounces does he have left after waxing his car and SUV?",
  "steps": [
    "Kellan originally bought an 11-ounce bottle of vehicle wax.",
    "He spilled 2 ounces of the wax.",
    "To find out how much wax he has left after the spill, subtract the spilled amount from the original amount: 11 - 2 = 9 ounces.",
    "It takes 3 ounces of wax to detail Kellan's car.",
    "Detailing his car will reduce the wax by 3 ounces, so subtract 3 from 9: 9 - 3 = 6 ounces.",
    "It takes 4 ounces of wax to detail Kellan's SUV.",
    "Detailing his SUV will reduce the wax by 4 ounces, so subtract 4 from 6: 6 - 4 = 2 ounces."
