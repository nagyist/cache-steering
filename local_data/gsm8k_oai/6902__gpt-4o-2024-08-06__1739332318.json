  "query": "Misty's favorite number is 3 times smaller than Glory's favorite number. If Glory's favorite number is 450, what's the sum of their favorite numbers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what it means for a number to be \"3 times smaller.\"",
    "\"3 times smaller\" implies dividing the number by 3. So, Misty's favorite number would be Glory's favorite number divided by 3.",
    "Glory's favorite number is given as 450.",
    "To find Misty's number, I divide 450 by 3.",
    "450 divided by 3 equals 150. So, Misty's favorite number is 150.",
    "Now, I need to find the sum of Misty's and Glory's favorite numbers.",
    "Misty's favorite number is 150, and Glory's favorite number is 450.",
    "The sum of their favorite numbers is 450 plus 150.",
    "450 plus 150 equals 600."
