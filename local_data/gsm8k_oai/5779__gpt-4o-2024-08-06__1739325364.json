  "query": "Betty has 3 red beads for every 2 blue beads that she has. How many blue beads does Betty have if she has 30 red beads?",
  "steps": [
    "Betty has a ratio of 3 red beads to 2 blue beads.",
    "For every 3 red beads, there are 2 blue beads.",
    "Betty has 30 red beads.",
    "I need to determine how many groups of 3 red beads are in 30 red beads.",
    "To find the number of groups, I divide 30 by 3.",
    "30 divided by 3 equals 10.",
    "So, there are 10 groups of 3 red beads.",
    "Each group of 3 red beads corresponds to 2 blue beads.",
    "Since there are 10 groups, I multiply 10 by 2 to find the number of blue beads.",
    "10 multiplied by 2 equals 20."
