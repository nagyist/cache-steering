  "query": "In 21 hours, a heating plant consumes 7 liters of fuel. How much does it consume in 90 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the fuel consumption rate in liters per hour.",
    "The plant consumes 7 liters in 21 hours.",
    "To find the rate, I divide 7 liters by 21 hours.",
    "7 liters / 21 hours = 1/3 liter per hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much fuel the plant consumes in 90 hours.",
    "To do this, I multiply the hourly consumption rate by 90 hours.",
    "(1/3 liter per hour) * 90 hours = 30 liters."
