  "query": "On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters. On each of 9 Tuesdays it rained 2.5 centimeters. How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total rainfall on Mondays.",
    "There are 7 Mondays and it rained 1.5 centimeters on each.",
    "To find the total rainfall on Mondays, I multiply 7 by 1.5.",
    "7 * 1.5 equals 10.5.",
    "So, the total rainfall on Mondays is 10.5 centimeters.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total rainfall on Tuesdays.",
    "There are 9 Tuesdays and it rained 2.5 centimeters on each.",
    "To find the total rainfall on Tuesdays, I multiply 9 by 2.5.",
    "9 * 2.5 equals 22.5.",
    "So, the total rainfall on Tuesdays is 22.5 centimeters.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more centimeters it rained on Tuesdays than on Mondays.",
    "I subtract the total rainfall on Mondays from the total rainfall on Tuesdays.",
    "22.5 - 10.5 equals 12.",
    "So, it rained 12 more centimeters on Tuesdays than on Mondays."
