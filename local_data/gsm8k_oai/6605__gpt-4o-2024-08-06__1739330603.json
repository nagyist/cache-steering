  "query": "In preparation for the upcoming Olympics, Rita's swimming coach requires her to swim a total of 1,500 hours. Rita has already completed 50 hours of backstroke, 9 hours of breaststroke, and 121 hours of butterfly, but she is unhappy with her inconsistency. She has therefore decided to dedicate 220 hours every month practicing freestyle and sidestroke. How many months does Rita have to fulfill her coach\u2019s requirements?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many hours Rita has already completed.",
    "Rita has completed 50 hours of backstroke.",
    "She has completed 9 hours of breaststroke.",
    "She has completed 121 hours of butterfly.",
    "To find the total hours she has already completed, add these hours together: 50 (backstroke) + 9 (breaststroke) + 121 (butterfly) = 180 hours.",
    "Rita's coach requires her to swim a total of 1,500 hours.",
    "Subtract the hours she has already completed from the total required: 1,500 - 180 = 1,320 hours remaining.",
    "Rita will now dedicate 220 hours every month to practicing freestyle and sidestroke.",
    "To determine how many months Rita needs, divide the remaining hours by the hours she dedicates per month: 1,320 \u00f7 220 = 6."

  "solution": "6"
