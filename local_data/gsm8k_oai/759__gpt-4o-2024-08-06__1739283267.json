  "query": "Tom wants to make the world's largest dough ball.  He needs 500 pounds of flour and he can buy 50-pound bags of flour for $20.  He also needs 10 pounds of salt and salt cost $.2 a pound.  He also spends $1000 promoting everything.  He then sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets.  How much money did he make?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom needs 500 pounds of flour.",
    "Each bag of flour is 50 pounds.",
    "To find out how many bags he needs, divide 500 by 50.",
    "500 \u00f7 50 = 10 bags of flour.",
    "Each bag costs $20.",
    "10 bags * $20 = $200 for flour.",
    "Tom also needs 10 pounds of salt.",
    "Salt costs $0.2 per pound.",
    "10 pounds * $0.2 = $2 for salt.",
    "Additionally, Tom spends $1000 on promoting everything.",
    "To find the total cost, add the costs for flour, salt, and promotion.",
    "$200 (flour) + $2 (salt) + $1000 (promotion) = $1202 total cost.",
    "Tom sells tickets for $20 each.",
    "He sells 500 tickets.",
    "500 tickets * $20 = $10000 total revenue from ticket sales.",
    "To find out how much money Tom made, subtract the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "$10000 (revenue) - $1202 (cost) = $8798."
