  "query": "Daniela goes shopping during a sale. She finds out that the store has 40 percent off on shoes and 20 percent off dresses. If Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes originally priced at $50 a pair and a dress originally priced at $100, how much money does she spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the discount on each pair of shoes. The original price of one pair of shoes is $50.",
    "The discount on the shoes is 40 percent. To find 40 percent of $50, I calculate \\(50 \\times 0.40 = 20\\).",
    "The discount amount on each pair of shoes is $20.",
    "To find the sale price of one pair of shoes, I subtract the discount from the original price: \\(50 - 20 = 30\\).",
    "The cost for one pair of shoes after the discount is $30.",
    "Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, so I multiply the discounted price of one pair by 2: \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\).",
    "The total cost for the two pairs of shoes is $60.",
    "Next, I calculate the discount on the dress. The original price of the dress is $100 and the discount is 20 percent.",
    "To find 20 percent of $100, I calculate \\(100 \\times 0.20 = 20\\).",
    "The discount amount on the dress is $20.",
    "To find the sale price of the dress, I subtract the discount from the original price: \\(100 - 20 = 80\\).",
    "The cost for the dress after the discount is $80.",
    "To find the total amount Daniela spends, I add the cost of the shoes and the dress: \\(60 + 80 = 140\\)."
