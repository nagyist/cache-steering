  "query": "Kimberly went hiking and took a 4-liter bottle full of water with her. The first time she drank from it, she consumed a quarter of the water in the bottle. Later on, she drank 2/3rd of the remaining water. How much water is left in the bottle (in liters)?",
  "steps": [
    "Kimberly started with a 4-liter bottle of water.",
    "The first time she drank from the bottle, she consumed a quarter of the water.",
    "A quarter of 4 liters is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = 1 \\) liter.",
    "After drinking 1 liter, the remaining water in the bottle is \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\) liters.",
    "Later, she drank 2/3rd of the remaining 3 liters.",
    "2/3rd of 3 liters is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 3 = 2 \\) liters.",
    "After drinking 2 liters, the remaining water in the bottle is \\( 3 - 2 = 1 \\) liter."
