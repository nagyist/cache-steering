  "query": "Delores has some money. She buys a computer for $400 and a printer for $40. If she has $10 left, how much money, in dollars, did Delores have at first?",
  "steps": [
    "Delores buys a computer for $400.",
    "She also buys a printer for $40.",
    "The total cost of the computer and printer together is $400 + $40.",
    "Calculating this gives a total expenditure of $440.",
    "After buying the computer and printer, Delores has $10 left.",
    "To find out how much money Delores had initially, we need to add her total expenditure to the amount she has left.",
    "Adding $440 (expenditure) to $10 (remaining money) gives us the original amount.",
    "So, Delores initially had $440 + $10.",
    "Calculating this, Delores initially had $450."
