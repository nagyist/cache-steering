  "query": "Jack is running a bake sale to help pay for his basketball team's uniforms. He's already sold 4 brownies for $3 each and 5 lemon squares for $2 each. If Jack's goal is to make $50 and he sells cookies for $4 each, how many cookies does he need to sell to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount Jack has already made from selling brownies.",
    "Since he sold 4 brownies at $3 each, I multiply 4 by 3.",
    "4 brownies \u00d7 $3 each = $12 from brownies.",
    "Next, I calculate the total amount Jack has made from selling lemon squares.",
    "He sold 5 lemon squares at $2 each, so I multiply 5 by 2.",
    "5 lemon squares \u00d7 $2 each = $10 from lemon squares.",
    "Now, I need to add the amounts earned from brownies and lemon squares together to find out the total earnings so far.",
    "$12 (from brownies) + $10 (from lemon squares) = $22 total earnings.",
    "Jack's goal is to make $50. I need to determine how much more he needs to earn to reach his goal.",
    "$50 goal - $22 earnings so far = $28 more needed.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many cookies Jack needs to sell to earn the remaining $28.",
    "Cookies are sold for $4 each, so I divide the remaining $28 by $4 per cookie.",
    "$28 \u00f7 $4 per cookie = 7 cookies."

  "solution": "7"
