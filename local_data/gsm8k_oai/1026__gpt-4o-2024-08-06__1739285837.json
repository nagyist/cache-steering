  "query": "Mr. Martinez is two feet taller than his daughter, Chiquita. If Chiquita is 5 feet tall, calculate their combined height.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Chiquita is 5 feet tall.",
    "Next, I need to determine Mr. Martinez's height. He is 2 feet taller than Chiquita.",
    "I calculate Mr. Martinez's height by adding 2 feet to Chiquita's height: 5 feet + 2 feet = 7 feet.",
    "Now, I have Mr. Martinez's height as 7 feet and Chiquita's height as 5 feet.",
    "To find their combined height, I add their individual heights together: 7 feet + 5 feet.",
    "The sum of their heights is 12 feet."
