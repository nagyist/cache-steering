  "query": "At the bake sale, Tamara makes $32 from the brownies. She made 2 pans of brownies which were all sold.  The brownies were cut into 8 big square pieces.  How much did each brownie cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of brownies. Tamara made 2 pans of brownies, with each pan cut into 8 pieces.",
    "To find the total number of brownies, I multiply the number of pans by the number of pieces per pan: 2 pans \u00d7 8 pieces per pan = 16 brownies.",
    "Tamara made $32 from selling all the brownies.",
    "To find out how much each brownie costs, I divide the total amount of money made by the total number of brownies: $32 \u00f7 16 brownies.",
    "Now, I perform the division: $32 \u00f7 16 = $2.",
    "So, each brownie costs $2."
