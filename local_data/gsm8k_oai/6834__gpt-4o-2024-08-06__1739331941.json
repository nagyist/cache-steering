  "query": "Sara sent letters to her friend in China every month. She sent 6 letters in January, 9 letters in February, and in March she sent triple the number of letters she sent in January. How many letters does Sara send?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the number of letters Sara sent each month.",
    "According to the problem, Sara sent 6 letters in January.",
    "In February, she sent 9 letters.",
    "In March, she sent triple the number of letters she sent in January.",
    "Since she sent 6 letters in January, triple that amount would be 6 times 3.",
    "Calculating 6 times 3 gives me 18.",
    "Sara sent 18 letters in March.",
    "Now, I need to sum the total number of letters sent over these three months.",
    "In January, she sent 6 letters, in February 9 letters, and in March 18 letters.",
    "Adding these together: 6 + 9 + 18.",
    "6 plus 9 equals 15.",
    "15 plus 18 gives me the final total.",
    "15 plus 18 equals 33."

  "solution": "33"
