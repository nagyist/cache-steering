  "query": "David swims the 100-meter freestyle in 48 seconds.  He swims the 100-meter backstroke 4 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter freestyle, he swims the 100-meter butterfly 3 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter backstroke, and he swims the 100-meter breaststroke 2 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter butterfly.  What is the combined length of time, in seconds, it would take for him to swim all four 100-meter events (the freestyle, the backstroke, the butterfly, and the breaststroke)?",
  "steps": [
    "David swims the 100-meter freestyle in 48 seconds.",
    "The 100-meter backstroke is 4 seconds slower than the freestyle.",
    "For the backstroke, David swims in 48 + 4 = 52 seconds.",
    "The 100-meter butterfly is 3 seconds slower than the backstroke.",
    "For the butterfly, David swims in 52 + 3 = 55 seconds.",
    "The 100-meter breaststroke is 2 seconds slower than the butterfly.",
    "For the breaststroke, David swims in 55 + 2 = 57 seconds.",
    "Now, I will add the times for all four events: freestyle (48 sec), backstroke (52 sec), butterfly (55 sec), and breaststroke (57 sec).",
    "The total time is 48 + 52 + 55 + 57 seconds.",
