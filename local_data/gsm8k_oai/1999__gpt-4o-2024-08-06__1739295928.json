  "query": "John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah\u2019s pool. If John\u2019s pool is 15 feet deep, how deep is Sarah\u2019s pool?",
  "steps": [
    "Let Sarah's pool depth be represented by the variable \\( s \\).",
    "According to the problem, John's pool depth can be expressed as \\( 2s + 5 \\).",
    "We know that John's pool is 15 feet deep.",
    "Thus, we can set up the equation: \\( 2s + 5 = 15 \\).",
    "To isolate \\( 2s \\), we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.",
    "So, \\( 2s = 15 - 5 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( 2s = 10 \\).",
    "Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( s \\).",
    "\\( s = \\frac{10}{2} \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( s = 5 \\)."
