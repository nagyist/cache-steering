  "query": "Cole wants to fence his backyard on three sides. His backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back. The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side of his fence, and the neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side. Fencing costs $3 per foot. How much does Cole have to pay for the fence?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total length of the fence that Cole needs to build.",
    "Cole wants to fence his backyard on three sides. The dimensions of the fenced area are 9 feet for each side and 18 feet for the back.",
    "I will calculate the total length of the fence by adding up the lengths of the three sides he wants to fence: 9 feet + 18 feet + 9 feet.",
    "The total length of the fence is 36 feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much Cole personally has to pay, considering the contributions from his neighbors.",
    "The neighbor behind him will pay for half of their shared side, which is the 18-foot side.",
    "Since half of 18 feet is 9 feet, the neighbor contributes to 9 feet of fencing.",
    "The neighbor on his left will pay for a third of their shared side, which is one of the 9-foot sides.",
    "Since a third of 9 feet is 3 feet, the other neighbor contributes to 3 feet of fencing.",
    "To find out how much fencing Cole personally has to pay for, I subtract the portions his neighbors will pay for from the total length: 36 feet - 9 feet (from the back neighbor) - 3 feet (from the side neighbor).",
    "Cole has to pay for 24 feet of fencing.",
    "Fencing costs $3 per foot, so I multiply the length Cole has to pay for by the cost per foot: 24 feet * $3/foot.",
    "24 feet * $3/foot = $72."
  ],
  "solution": "72"
