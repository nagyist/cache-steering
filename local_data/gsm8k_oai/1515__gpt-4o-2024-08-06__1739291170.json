  "query": "Billy weighs 9 pounds more than Brad. Brad weighs 5 pounds more than Carl. If Carl weighs 145 pounds, how much does Billy weigh, in pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Brad's weight.",
    "I know that Brad weighs 5 pounds more than Carl.",
    "Carl weighs 145 pounds.",
    "Therefore, Brad weighs 145 pounds + 5 pounds.",
    "145 + 5 = 150.",
    "So, Brad weighs 150 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out Billy's weight.",
    "Billy weighs 9 pounds more than Brad.",
    "I just calculated that Brad weighs 150 pounds.",
    "Therefore, Billy weighs 150 pounds + 9 pounds.",
    "150 + 9 = 159.",
    "So, Billy weighs 159 pounds."
