  "query": "In the cafeteria,  Athena wants to buy snacks for her friends. She bought 3 sandwiches at $3 each and 2 fruit drinks at $2.5 each. How much did she spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Athena bought 3 sandwiches. Each sandwich costs $3.",
    "To find the total cost of the sandwiches, I need to multiply the number of sandwiches by the cost per sandwich.",
    "3 sandwiches * $3 per sandwich = $9.",
    "Next, Athena bought 2 fruit drinks. Each drink costs $2.5.",
    "To find the total cost of the fruit drinks, I need to multiply the number of drinks by the cost per drink.",
    "2 drinks * $2.5 per drink = $5.",
    "Now, I have the total costs: $9 for the sandwiches and $5 for the fruit drinks.",
    "To find the total amount Athena spent, I need to add the costs of the sandwiches and the fruit drinks together.",
    "$9 + $5 = $14."
