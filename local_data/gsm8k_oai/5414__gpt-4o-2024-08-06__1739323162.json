  "query": "Peter has to walk 2.5 miles to get to the grocery store. If it takes him 20 minutes to walk one mile and he has walked 1 mile already, how many more minutes does he have to walk to reach it?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter needs to walk a total of 2.5 miles to reach the grocery store.",
    "He has already walked 1 mile.",
    "To find out how much more he needs to walk, I subtract the distance he has already walked from the total distance: 2.5 miles - 1 mile = 1.5 miles.",
    "Peter walks 1 mile in 20 minutes.",
    "He needs to walk 1.5 more miles to reach the grocery store.",
    "To calculate how long it takes him to walk 1.5 miles, I multiply the time it takes to walk one mile by the remaining distance: 20 minutes/mile * 1.5 miles.",
    "20 minutes/mile * 1.5 miles = 30 minutes.",
    "Therefore, Peter has to walk for 30 more minutes to reach the grocery store."

  "solution": "30"
