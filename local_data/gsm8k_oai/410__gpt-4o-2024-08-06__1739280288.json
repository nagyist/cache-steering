  "query": "Mark wants to set the record for most consecutive ropes jumped.  The record is 54,000.  He can jump 3 times a second.  How many hours would he need to jump rope?",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to determine how many jumps Mark can complete in one minute.",
    "Mark jumps 3 times a second.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "To find how many jumps he can complete in one minute, I multiply 3 jumps/second by 60 seconds.",
    "3 jumps/second * 60 seconds/minute = 180 jumps/minute.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many jumps he can complete in one hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To find his jumps per hour, I multiply 180 jumps/minute by 60 minutes.",
    "180 jumps/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 10,800 jumps/hour.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many hours it will take him to reach 54,000 jumps.",
    "I divide the total jumps needed, 54,000, by the number of jumps he can do in one hour, 10,800.",
    "54,000 jumps \u00f7 10,800 jumps/hour = 5 hours."
