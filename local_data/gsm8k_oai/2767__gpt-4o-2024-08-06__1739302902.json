  "query": "It takes Polly 20 minutes to cook breakfast every day. She spends 5 minutes cooking lunch. She spends 10 minutes cooking dinner 4 days this week. The rest of the days she spends 30 minutes cooking dinner. How many minutes does Polly spend cooking this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total minutes Polly spends cooking breakfast for the whole week.",
    "Since she cooks breakfast every day and it takes 20 minutes, I multiply 20 minutes by 7 days.",
    "20 minutes/day * 7 days = 140 minutes",
    "Next, I calculate the total minutes Polly spends cooking lunch for the whole week.",
    "She cooks lunch every day, and it takes 5 minutes. So, I multiply 5 minutes by 7 days.",
    "5 minutes/day * 7 days = 35 minutes",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total minutes she spends cooking dinner for 4 days.",
    "She spends 10 minutes cooking dinner on these 4 days, so I multiply 10 minutes by 4 days.",
    "10 minutes/day * 4 days = 40 minutes",
    "Next, I calculate the total minutes she spends cooking dinner on the remaining days.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, and she spends 10 minutes on dinner for 4 days, so there are 3 days left.",
    "On these 3 days, she spends 30 minutes cooking dinner. I multiply 30 minutes by 3 days.",
    "30 minutes/day * 3 days = 90 minutes",
    "Now, I add up all the cooking times to get the total number of minutes Polly spends cooking this week.",
    "140 minutes (breakfast) + 35 minutes (lunch) + 40 minutes (dinner on 4 days) + 90 minutes (dinner on 3 days).",
    "Total = 140 + 35 + 40 + 90",
    "Total = 305 minutes"

  "solution": "305"
