  "query": "Katy makes some brownies to eat throughout the week. She eats 5 on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday. After she has eaten the brownies on Tuesday, all of the brownies she made are gone. How many brownies did Katy make?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's determine how many brownies Katy ate on Tuesday.",
    "Katy eats twice as many brownies on Tuesday as she did on Monday.",
    "On Monday, she ate 5 brownies.",
    "Twice as many as 5 is calculated as 5 * 2 = 10 brownies.",
    "So, Katy ate 10 brownies on Tuesday.",
    "Now, we add the brownies eaten on Monday and Tuesday to find out the total number of brownies she made.",
    "On Monday, she ate 5 brownies, and on Tuesday, she ate 10 brownies.",
    "Add them together: 5 + 10 = 15 brownies.",
    "Therefore, Katy made a total of 15 brownies."
