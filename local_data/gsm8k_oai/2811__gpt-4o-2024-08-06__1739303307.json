  "query": "Brenda raises mice, and her adult mice recently had three litters of 8 each. She gave a sixth of the baby mice to her friend Robbie to keep as pets. She sold three times the number of babies she gave Robbie to a pet store. Half of the remaining mice were sold to snake owners as feeder mice. How many baby mice did Brenda have left?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by determining the total number of baby mice. There are three litters of 8 mice each.",
    "I multiply 3 litters by 8 mice per litter, which equals 24 mice.",
    "Brenda gave one sixth of the 24 baby mice to Robbie, so I need to calculate 1/6 of 24.",
    "1/6 of 24 is 4, because 24 divided by 6 equals 4.",
    "Brenda gave Robbie 4 mice, so I subtract 4 from the total 24 baby mice to find out how many are left.",
    "24 - 4 equals 20 mice after giving some to Robbie.",
    "Brenda sold 3 times the number of mice she gave to Robbie to a pet store.",
    "Three times 4 equals 12, so she sold 12 mice to the pet store.",
    "I subtract 12 from the remaining 20 mice to determine how many mice she has now.",
    "20 - 12 equals 8 mice remaining.",
    "Half of the remaining 8 mice were sold to snake owners.",
    "Half of 8 is 4. Therefore, Brenda sold 4 mice to snake owners.",
    "I subtract 4 from 8 to find out how many mice Brenda has left."

  "solution": "4"
