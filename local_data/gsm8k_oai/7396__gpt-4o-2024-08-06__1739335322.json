  "query": "A 750 ml bottle of spirits costs $30.00 and has 16 servings per bottle.  Most restaurants will charge $8.00 for one serving.  How much money does a restaurant make on a bottle of spirits?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much revenue a restaurant earns from selling one serving of the spirits.",
    "Each serving is sold for $8.00.",
    "Next, I have to calculate the total revenue from selling all 16 servings from one bottle.",
    "The revenue from selling one bottle is 16 servings multiplied by $8.00 per serving.",
    "16 servings x $8.00 per serving equals $128.00.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost to purchase one bottle of spirits for the restaurant.",
    "The cost of one 750 ml bottle of spirits is $30.00.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the cost of the bottle from the total revenue.",
    "$128.00 (total revenue) - $30.00 (cost of the bottle) equals $98.00.",
    "Therefore, the restaurant makes $98.00 on a bottle of spirits."
