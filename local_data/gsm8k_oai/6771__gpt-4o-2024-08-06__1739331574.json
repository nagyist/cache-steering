He decides to use his office.  He goes in there 5 times a day every day.  How many pull-ups does he do a week?",

    "Mike does 2 pull-ups each time he goes into his office.",
    "He goes into his office 5 times a day.",
    "To find out how many pull-ups he does in a day, I need to multiply the number of pull-ups each time by the number of times he goes into the office per day.",
    "2 pull-ups/time \u00d7 5 times/day = 10 pull-ups/day",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pull-ups he does in a week.",
