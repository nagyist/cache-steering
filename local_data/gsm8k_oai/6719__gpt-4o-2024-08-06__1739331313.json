  "query": "There are 45 children in a classroom. One-third of them are girls. How many boys are in the classroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many children are girls.",
    "The problem states that one-third of the children are girls.",
    "To find one-third of the total number of children, I calculate 1/3 of 45.",
    "Calculate: 45 divided by 3 equals 15.",
    "So, there are 15 girls in the classroom.",
    "To find the number of boys, subtract the number of girls from the total number of children.",
    "Subtract: 45 minus 15 equals 30.",
    "Thus, there are 30 boys in the classroom."
