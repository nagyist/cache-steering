  "query": "James decides to use tannerite to blow things up to reveal his baby's gender. The explosion ignites both his neighbors' houses and attracts a police officer, who arrests James on two count of arson, one count of manufacturing explosives, and one count of domestic terrorism. If the arson counts each carry a 6-year sentence, the explosives sentence is twice as long as the total arson sentence, and the domestic terrorism charge's sentence is 20 years, how long might James spend in jail?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total sentence for the arson charges.",
    "James is charged with two counts of arson, and each carries a 6-year sentence.",
    "Therefore, the total sentence for the arson charges is 2 counts \u00d7 6 years per count = 12 years.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the sentence for the manufacturing explosives charge.",
    "The sentence for this charge is twice as long as the total arson sentence, which we calculated as 12 years.",
    "Thus, the sentence for manufacturing explosives is 2 \u00d7 12 years = 24 years.",
    "Now, I'll consider the sentence for the domestic terrorism charge.",
    "This charge carries a sentence of 20 years.",
    "Finally, I need to add up all the sentences to find the total time James might spend in jail.",
    "The total sentence is the sum of the arson sentence, explosives sentence, and domestic terrorism sentence.",
    "Thus, it is 12 years (arson) + 24 years (explosives) + 20 years (domestic terrorism) = 56 years."

  "solution": "56"
