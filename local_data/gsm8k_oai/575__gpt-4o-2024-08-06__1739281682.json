  "query": "A package of candy has 3 servings with 120 calories each.  John eats half the package.  How many calories did he eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of calories in the entire package.",
    "There are 3 servings in the package, and each serving has 120 calories.",
    "To find the total calories, I should multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving.",
    "3 servings * 120 calories per serving = 360 calories.",
    "Now I know the entire package contains 360 calories.",
    "John eats half of the package.",
    "To find how many calories he ate, I need to divide the total calories by 2.",
    "360 calories \u00f7 2 = 180 calories.",
    "Therefore, John ate 180 calories."
  ],
  "solution": "180"
