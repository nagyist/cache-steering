  "query": "Isabella is twice as old as Antonio.  In 18 months, she will be 10 years old.  How many months old is Antonio?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Isabella is right now.",
    "In 18 months, Isabella will be 10 years old.",
    "To find her current age, I subtract 18 months from 10 years.",
    "10 years is equivalent to 120 months (because 10 x 12 = 120).",
    "Subtracting 18 months from 120 months gives me 102 months.",
    "So, Isabella is currently 102 months old.",
    "Isabella is twice as old as Antonio.",
    "To find Antonio's age, I divide Isabella's current age by 2.",
    "102 months divided by 2 equals 51 months.",
    "Therefore, Antonio is 51 months old."

  "solution": "51"
