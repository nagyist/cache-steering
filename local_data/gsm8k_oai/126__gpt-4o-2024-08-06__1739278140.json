    "First, I need to understand the relationship between John and Bob's number of roommates.",
    "The problem states that John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob.",
    "I see that Bob has 10 roommates.",
    "Now I need to find twice the number of Bob's roommates.",
    "Twice the number of Bob's roommates is 2 times 10.",
    "2 times 10 equals 20.",
    "Next, I need to add five to this result to find John's number of roommates.",
