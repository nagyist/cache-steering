  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many friends John has. John has 3 times as many friends as James.",
    "James has 75 friends, so John's number of friends is 3 times 75.",
    "I calculate 3 times 75 to find John's number of friends: 3 * 75 = 225.",
    "Now I know that John has 225 friends.",
    "Next, I need to find out the total number of friends when James and John combine their lists.",
    "They share 25 common friends, so these friends should not be counted twice when combining their lists.",
    "To find the combined total, I add James' friends and John's friends and then subtract the shared friends to avoid double-counting.",
    "The total number of combined friends is 75 (James' friends) + 225 (John's friends) - 25 (shared friends).",
    "First, I calculate the sum of James' and John's friends: 75 + 225 = 300.",
    "Next, I subtract the shared friends: 300 - 25 = 275."
