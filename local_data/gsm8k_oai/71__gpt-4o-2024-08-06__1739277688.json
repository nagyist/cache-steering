  "query": "At a flea market, Hillary sells handmade crafts for 12 dollars per craft. Today, Hillary sells 3 crafts and is given an extra 7 dollars from an appreciative customer. Later on, Hillary deposits 18 dollars from today's profits into her bank account. How many dollars is Hillary left with after making the deposit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount earned from selling crafts. Hillary sells each craft for 12 dollars, and she sold 3 crafts.",
    "To find out how much she earned from the crafts, I multiply 12 dollars by 3 crafts: \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\) dollars.",
    "An appreciative customer also gave Hillary an extra 7 dollars.",
    "I need to add this extra 7 dollars to the amount earned from the crafts: \\(36 + 7 = 43\\) dollars.",
    "So, the total earnings before any deposit are 43 dollars.",
    "Hillary deposits 18 dollars from today's profits into her bank account.",
    "To find out how much she is left with after the deposit, I subtract the deposited amount from the total earnings: \\(43 - 18 = 25\\) dollars."

  "solution": "25"
