  "query": "Peter bought 4 new notebooks for school. 2 of them are green, one is black and the other one is pink. The total cost was $45. If the black notebook cost $15, and the pink one cost $10, how much did the green notebooks cost each?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter bought 4 notebooks in total: 2 green, 1 black, and 1 pink.",
    "The black notebook costs $15.",
    "The pink notebook costs $10.",
    "I need to find out the total cost of the green notebooks.",
    "First, calculate the combined cost of the black and pink notebooks.",
    "The black notebook is $15 and the pink notebook is $10.",
    "Add the cost of the black and pink notebooks: $15 + $10 = $25.",
    "The total cost of all notebooks is $45.",
    "Subtract the cost of the black and pink notebooks from the total cost.",
    "$45 - $25 = $20 is the total cost of the green notebooks.",
    "Since there are 2 green notebooks, divide the total cost of green notebooks by 2 to find the cost of each.",
    "$20 \u00f7 2 = $10."
