  "query": "Erica is telling her grandson about the animals she saw during her recent safari in Kenya's Maasai Mara. On Saturday, she saw 3 lions and 2 elephants. She spotted 2 buffaloes and 5 leopards on Sunday, and 5 rhinos and 3 warthogs on Monday. What is the total number of animals that Erica saw?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of animals Erica saw each day.",
    "On Saturday, Erica saw 3 lions and 2 elephants. That's 3 + 2 = 5 animals.",
    "On Sunday, Erica saw 2 buffaloes and 5 leopards. That's 2 + 5 = 7 animals.",
    "On Monday, Erica saw 5 rhinos and 3 warthogs. That's 5 + 3 = 8 animals.",
    "Now, I will add the number of animals seen each day to find the total number.",
    "Saturday: 5 animals, Sunday: 7 animals, Monday: 8 animals. The total is 5 + 7 + 8.",
    "5 + 7 = 12; then, 12 + 8 = 20."

  "solution": "20"
