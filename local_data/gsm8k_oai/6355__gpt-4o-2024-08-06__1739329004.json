  "query": "Louis is making himself a velvet suit for a formal event. The velvet fabric he chose was $24 per yard. He bought a pattern for $15, and two spools of silver thread for $3 each. If he spent $141 for the pattern, thread, and fabric, how many yards of fabric did he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the pattern and the threads.",
    "The cost of the pattern is $15.",
    "The cost of each spool of thread is $3, and there are two spools: $3 * 2 = $6.",
    "So, the total cost for the pattern and the threads is $15 + $6 = $21.",
    "Now, I subtract this cost from the total amount Louis spent to find out how much he spent on fabric.",
    "The total amount spent is $141, so the amount spent on fabric is $141 - $21 = $120.",
    "The cost of fabric per yard is $24.",
    "To find out how many yards of fabric he bought, I divide the total cost of the fabric by the cost per yard: $120 / $24.",
    "$120 divided by $24 is 5."
