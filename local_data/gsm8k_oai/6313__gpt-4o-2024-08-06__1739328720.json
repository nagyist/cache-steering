  "query": "Trevor's older brother was twice his age 20 years ago. How old was Trevor a decade ago if his brother is now 32 years old?",
  "steps": [
    "Trevor's brother is currently 32 years old.",
    "20 years ago, Trevor's brother would have been 32 - 20 = 12 years old.",
    "According to the problem, 20 years ago, Trevor's brother was twice Trevor's age.",
    "If Trevor's brother was 12 years old at that time, then Trevor must have been 12 / 2 = 6 years old.",
    "If Trevor was 6 years old 20 years ago, we need to determine his age a decade ago.",
    "A decade ago would be 10 years ago.",
    "From 20 years ago to 10 years ago is a 10-year difference.",
    "So, if Trevor was 6 years old 20 years ago, then 10 years later (which is a decade ago), he would have been 6 + 10 = 16 years old."
