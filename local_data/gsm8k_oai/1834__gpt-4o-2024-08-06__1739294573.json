  "query": "During vacation, Jimmy visits different beaches on an island, so he changes his place of lodging from time to time. The first 3 days he stays in a hostel, where he is charged $15 per night. The fourth and fifth days he stays in a cabin where he shares expenses with 2 of his friends, and they are charged $45 total per night. How much did Jimmy spend on lodging?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of staying in the hostel for three nights.",
    "The cost per night in the hostel is $15.",
    "For 3 nights, the cost is 3 nights * $15/night.",
    "3 * $15 = $45 for the 3 nights in the hostel.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of staying in the cabin for two nights.",
    "The total cost per night for the cabin, shared among 3 people, is $45.",
    "Jimmy's share of the cost per night is $45/3.",
    "$45/3 = $15 per night for 1 person.",
    "For 2 nights in the cabin, Jimmy's cost is 2 nights * $15/night.",
    "2 * $15 = $30 for the 2 nights in the cabin.",
    "Now, I need to add the hostel costs and the cabin costs to find the total lodging cost.",
    "The total cost is $45 (hostel) + $30 (cabin).",
    "$45 + $30 = $75."
  ],
  "solution": "75"
