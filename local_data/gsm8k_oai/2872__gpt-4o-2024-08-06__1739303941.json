  "query": "Giorgio plans to make cookies for his class. There are 40 students and he plans to make 2 cookies per student. If 10% of his classmates want oatmeal raisin, then how many oatmeal raisin cookies will Giorgio make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cookies Giorgio plans to make in total.",
    "There are 40 students, and he plans to make 2 cookies per student.",
    "I multiply 40 students by 2 cookies per student to get the total number of cookies.",
    "40 students * 2 cookies/student = 80 cookies in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many students want oatmeal raisin cookies.",
    "10% of the class wants oatmeal raisin cookies.",
    "To find 10% of 40 students, I multiply 40 by 0.10.",
    "40 * 0.10 = 4.",
    "This means 4 students want oatmeal raisin cookies.",
    "Since Giorgio plans to make 2 cookies per student, and 4 students want oatmeal raisin cookies, I need to multiply 4 by 2.",
    "4 students * 2 cookies/student = 8 oatmeal raisin cookies."
