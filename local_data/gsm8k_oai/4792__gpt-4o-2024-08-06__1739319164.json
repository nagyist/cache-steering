    "Nancy creates 12 clay pots on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, she creates twice as many pots as on Monday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pots.",
    "Nancy's total for Monday and Tuesday together is 12 + 24 = 36 pots.",
    "By the end of the week, she has 50 clay pots in total.",
    "The pots created on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the pots from Monday and Tuesday from the total at the end of the week.",
    "To find out how many she made on Wednesday, I calculate 50 (total pots by the end of the week) - 36 (pots made by Monday and Tuesday) = 14 pots."
