  "query": "John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "John is performing in 3 plays.",
    "Each play consists of 5 Acts.",
    "In each act, he wears 2 wigs.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of wigs used in all 3 plays initially.",
    "For one play, the number of acts is 5, and he uses 2 wigs per act, so the total wigs for one play is 5 * 2 = 10 wigs.",
    "John is in 3 plays, so the total number of wigs for all plays is 3 * 10 = 30 wigs.",
    "Each wig costs $5, so the amount of money spent on wigs is 30 wigs * $5 per wig = $150.",
    "John drops one of the plays, meaning he no longer uses the wigs for that play.",
    "The number of wigs from one dropped play is 10, as calculated earlier.",
    "He sells the wigs for the dropped play for $4 each, so he sells 10 wigs * $4 per wig = $40.",
    "To find out how much money he actually spent, I will subtract the money he got from selling the 10 wigs from the total amount spent on wigs.",
    "I subtract the $40 from the total spent of $150, so $150 - $40 = $110."
