  "query": "Brayden and Gavin were playing touch football against Cole and Freddy. Touchdowns were worth 7 points. Brayden and Gavin scored 7 touchdowns. Cole and Freddy's team scored 9 touchdowns. How many more points did Cole and Freddy have than Brayden and Gavin?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many points Brayden and Gavin scored.",
    "Each touchdown is worth 7 points, and they scored 7 touchdowns.",
    "To find their total score, I multiply 7 touchdowns by 7 points per touchdown.",
    "7 x 7 = 49",
    "So, Brayden and Gavin scored 49 points.",
    "Next, I calculate Cole and Freddy's total score.",
    "They scored 9 touchdowns.",
    "I multiply 9 touchdowns by 7 points per touchdown.",
    "9 x 7 = 63",
    "So, Cole and Freddy scored 63 points.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in points between Cole and Freddy and Brayden and Gavin.",
    "I subtract Brayden and Gavin's score from Cole and Freddy's score.",
    "63 - 49 = 14"
