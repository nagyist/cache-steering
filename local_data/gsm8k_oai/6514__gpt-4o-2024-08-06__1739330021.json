  "query": "There are 500 students in a local high school.  40 percent are juniors.  70 percent of juniors are involved in sports.  How many juniors are involved in sports?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many students in the high school are juniors. There are 500 students in total.",
    "40 percent of these students are juniors. To find the number of juniors, I will calculate 40 percent of 500.",
    "40 percent is the same as 0.4 in decimal form. To find 40 percent of 500, I multiply 500 by 0.4.",
    "500 multiplied by 0.4 equals 200. Therefore, there are 200 juniors in the school.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these juniors are involved in sports.",
    "70 percent of the juniors are involved in sports. To find 70 percent of the 200 juniors, I calculate 70 percent of 200.",
    "70 percent is the same as 0.7 in decimal form. Therefore, I multiply 200 by 0.7 to find the number of juniors involved in sports.",
    "200 multiplied by 0.7 equals 140.",
    "So, there are 140 juniors involved in sports."
