  "query": "Leticia, Scarlett, and Percy decide to eat at a Greek restaurant for lunch. The prices for their dishes cost $10, $13, and $17, respectively. If the trio gives the waiter a 10% tip, how much gratuity should the waiter receive in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the dishes. Leticia's dish costs $10, Scarlett's dish costs $13, and Percy's dish costs $17.",
    "Now, I add up these amounts: $10 + $13 + $17.",
    "The sum of $10 and $13 is $23.",
    "Adding $17 to $23 results in a total cost of $40 for all the dishes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the 10% tip on the total cost of $40.",
    "To find 10% of $40, I multiply $40 by 0.10.",
    "$40 multiplied by 0.10 equals $4."
