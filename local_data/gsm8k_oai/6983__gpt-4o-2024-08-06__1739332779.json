  "query": "A Ferris wheel can accommodate 70 people in 20 minutes.  If the Ferris wheel is open from 1:00 pm until 7:00 pm, how many people will get to ride?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours the Ferris wheel is open for.",
    "The Ferris wheel operates from 1:00 pm to 7:00 pm. I need to calculate the total hours of operation.",
    "From 1:00 pm to 7:00 pm is 6 hours in total.",
    "I need to find out how many 20-minute intervals there are in one hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour. Dividing 60 minutes by 20 minutes per interval gives 3 intervals per hour.",
    "Now, I calculate how many 20-minute intervals there are in 6 hours.",
    "6 hours multiplied by 3 intervals per hour equals 18 intervals.",
    "Each 20-minute interval can accommodate 70 people.",
    "Multiply the number of intervals (18) by the number of people per interval (70).",
    "18 intervals multiplied by 70 people per interval equals 1260 people."

  "solution": "1260"
