  "query": "To make 3 km, Ben walked for 2 hours. Continuing at the same speed, how much time in minutes would it take him to travel 12 km?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Ben's walking speed in kilometers per hour.",
    "Ben walked 3 km in 2 hours.",
    "The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.",
    "3 km / 2 hours = 1.5 km/h.",
    "Next, I need to determine the time it would take Ben to walk 12 km at this speed.",
    "Time is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.",
    "12 km / 1.5 km/h = 8 hours.",
    "Now, I need to convert this time from hours to minutes.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes."
