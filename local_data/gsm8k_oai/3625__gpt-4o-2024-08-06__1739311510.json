  "query": "At Ken's local store, a pound of steak is going for $7. He decides to get two pounds. At the till, he pays using a $20 bill. How much money will he get back?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost for the steak.",
    "I know that a pound of steak costs $7.",
    "Ken is buying two pounds of steak.",
    "To find the total cost for two pounds, I multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds: 7 * 2.",
    "7 * 2 equals 14.",
    "The total cost for the steak Ken bought is $14.",
    "Ken is paying with a $20 bill.",
    "To find out how much money Ken will get back, I need to subtract the total cost of the steak from the amount Ken pays.",
    "So, I take 20 (the amount Ken paid) and subtract 14 (the total cost of the steak).",
    "20 - 14 equals 6."

  "solution": "6"
