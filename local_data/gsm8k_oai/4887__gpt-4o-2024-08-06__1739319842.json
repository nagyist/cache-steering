  "query": "Oliver had 135 stickers. He used 1/3 of his stickers, gave 2/5 of the remaining to his friend, and kept the remaining stickers. How many stickers did he keep?",
  "steps": [
    "Oliver started with 135 stickers.",
    "He used 1/3 of his stickers.",
    "1/3 of 135 is calculated by dividing 135 by 3.",
    "135 divided by 3 is 45.",
    "So, Oliver used 45 stickers.",
    "Subtract the used stickers from the total: 135 - 45.",
    "135 - 45 equals 90.",
    "After using stickers, Oliver has 90 stickers remaining.",
    "Oliver gave 2/5 of the remaining stickers to his friend.",
    "Calculate 2/5 of 90 by multiplying 90 by 2/5.",
    "(90 * 2) is 180.",
    "180 divided by 5 is 36.",
    "So, Oliver gave 36 stickers to his friend.",
    "Subtract the given stickers from the remaining: 90 - 36.",
    "90 - 36 equals 54.",
    "Therefore, Oliver kept 54 stickers."
