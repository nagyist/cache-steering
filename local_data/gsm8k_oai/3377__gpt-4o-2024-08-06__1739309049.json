    "Kyle goes to basketball practice for 2 hours every day.",
    "2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "He spends half of this time shooting. So, time spent shooting = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.",
    "The remaining 60 minutes are spent running and weightlifting.",
    "Let x be the time he spends weightlifting.",
    "He spends twice as much time running as weightlifting, so running time = 2x.",
    "The total time for running and weightlifting is 60 minutes, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = 60.",
    "Combine like terms: 3x = 60.",
    "Solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: x = 60 / 3.",
    "x = 20."
