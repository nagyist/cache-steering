    "Ollie caught 5 fish.",
    "Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus.",
    "If Ollie caught 5 fish, and that is 7 fewer than what Angus caught, then I add 7 to 5 to find how many fish Angus caught.",
    "Angus caught 5 + 7 = 12 fish.",
    "Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick did.",
    "To find out how many fish Patrick caught, I subtract 4 from the number of fish Angus caught.",
    "Patrick caught 12 - 4 = 8 fish."
