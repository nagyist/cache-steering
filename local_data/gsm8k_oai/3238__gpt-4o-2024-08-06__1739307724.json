  "query": "Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill.",
    "The distance up the hill is 900 feet.",
    "The speed going up the hill is 9 feet/second.",
    "Time is calculated using the formula: time = distance/speed.",
    "Time to run up the hill = 900 feet / 9 feet/second = 100 seconds.",
    "Next, determine the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill.",
    "The distance down the hill is also 900 feet.",
    "The speed going down the hill is 12 feet/second.",
    "Time to run down the hill = 900 feet / 12 feet/second.",
    "Time to run down the hill = 75 seconds.",
    "Now, add the time taken to run up and down the hill to find the total time.",
    "Total time = time up + time down = 100 seconds + 75 seconds.",
    "Total time = 175 seconds."

  "solution": "175"
