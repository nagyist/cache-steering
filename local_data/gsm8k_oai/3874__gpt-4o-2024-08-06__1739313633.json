  "query": "Sara makes cakes during the five weekdays to sell on weekends. She makes 4 cakes a day and sells her cakes for $8. In 4 weeks she managed to sell all the cakes. How much money did she collect during that time?",
  "steps": [
    "Sara makes 4 cakes per day.",
    "There are 5 weekdays in a week.",
    "To calculate the number of cakes made each week, I multiply the number of cakes she makes per day by the number of days she works: 4 cakes/day * 5 days/week.",
    "4 cakes/day * 5 days/week = 20 cakes/week.",
    "Sara continues this process for 4 weeks.",
    "To find out how many cakes she made in total over 4 weeks, I multiply the number of cakes she makes per week by the number of weeks: 20 cakes/week * 4 weeks.",
    "20 cakes/week * 4 weeks = 80 cakes.",
    "Sara sells each cake for $8.",
    "To find out how much money Sara collected from selling all the cakes, I multiply the number of cakes by the price per cake: 80 cakes * $8/cake.",
    "80 cakes * $8/cake = $640."

  "solution": "640"
