  "query": "Jack went to a supermarket with $100 and bought 4 bottles of water. Then his mother called him and asked him to buy twice as many bottles as he already bought. Each bottle cost $2. Finally, he also bought half a pound of cheese and 1 pound of cheese costs $10. How much money does Jack have remaining?",
  "steps": [
    "Jack initially has $100.",
    "He buys 4 bottles of water.",
    "Each bottle costs $2.",
    "The cost for 4 bottles is 4 bottles * $2/bottle = $8.",
    "He spends $8 on the initial 4 bottles of water.",
    "Subtracted from his initial $100, he now has $100 - $8 = $92.",
    "His mother asks him to buy twice as many bottles as he already bought.",
    "He already bought 4 bottles, so twice as many is 4 bottles * 2 = 8 additional bottles.",
    "Each of these additional bottles also costs $2.",
    "The cost for the additional 8 bottles is 8 bottles * $2/bottle = $16.",
    "Subtracted from his remaining $92, he now has $92 - $16 = $76.",
    "He buys half a pound of cheese.",
    "1 pound of cheese costs $10.",
    "Half a pound of cheese costs $10 * 0.5 = $5.",
    "Subtracted from his remaining $76, he now has $76 - $5 = $71."
