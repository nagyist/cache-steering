  "query": "Tom has a job mowing lawns around his neighborhood. Each month he spends $17 on gas and mows 3 lawns, charging $12 per lawn mowed.  Last month he also made extra money pulling weeds for $10.  How much profit did Tom earn last month?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom mows 3 lawns each month.",
    "He charges $12 per lawn.",
    "To find the income from mowing lawns, multiply the number of lawns (3) by the charge per lawn ($12).",
    "\\[ 3 \\text{ lawns} \\times \\$12/\\text{lawn} = \\$36 \\]",
    "Add the extra money made from pulling weeds, which is $10.",
    "\\[ \\$36 (\\text{mowing}) + \\$10 (\\text{weeds}) = \\$46 \\]",
    "Tom spends $17 on gas.",
    "To find the profit, subtract the gas cost from the total income.",
    "\\[ \\$46 (\\text{total income}) - \\$17 (\\text{gas cost}) = \\$29 \\]"
