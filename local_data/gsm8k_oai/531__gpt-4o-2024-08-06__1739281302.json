  "query": "3 lions and 2 rhinos escape from the zoo.  If it takes 2 hours to recover each animal how long did the zoo spend recovering animals?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many lions escaped. There are 3 lions.",
    "Next, determine how many rhinos escaped. There are 2 rhinos.",
    "Add the number of lions and rhinos to find the total number of escaped animals. 3 lions + 2 rhinos = 5 animals.",
    "Each animal takes 2 hours to recover.",
    "Multiply the total number of animals by the time it takes to recover each one: 5 animals \u00d7 2 hours/animal = 10 hours."

  "solution": "10"
