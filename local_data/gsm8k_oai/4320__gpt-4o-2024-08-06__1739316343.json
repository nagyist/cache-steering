  "query": "John paints a giant mural that is 6m by 3m. The paint costs $4 per square meter. The artist can paint 1.5 square meters per hour and charges $10 per hour. How much does the mural cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of the mural.",
    "The mural is 6 meters by 3 meters.",
    "Area is calculated by multiplying the length and the width: 6m * 3m.",
    "The area of the mural is 18 square meters.",
    "Next, calculate the cost of the paint. The paint costs $4 per square meter.",
    "Multiply the area (18 square meters) by the cost per square meter ($4): 18 * 4.",
    "The paint costs $72.",
    "Now, calculate the time it takes for John to paint the mural.",
    "John can paint 1.5 square meters per hour.",
    "Divide the total area (18 square meters) by the painting rate (1.5 square meters per hour): 18 / 1.5.",
    "It takes John 12 hours to paint the mural.",
    "Next, calculate the labor cost. John charges $10 per hour.",
    "Multiply the number of hours (12) by the hourly rate ($10): 12 * 10.",
    "The labor costs $120.",
    "Finally, add the paint cost and the labor cost to find the total cost of the mural.",
    "Paint cost is $72 and labor cost is $120.",
    "Add these together: $72 + $120.",
    "The total cost of the mural is $192."

  "solution": "192"
