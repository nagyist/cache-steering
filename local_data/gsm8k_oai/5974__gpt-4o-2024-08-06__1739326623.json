  "query": "In a court-mandated traffic class, there are a certain number of drunk drivers and 3 less than 7 times that many speeders. If there are 45 students total, how many drunk drivers are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of drunk drivers as \\( x \\).",
    "The number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers.",
    "This can be expressed as \\( 7x - 3 \\).",
    "The total number of students in the class, consisting of drunk drivers and speeders, is 45.",
    "We can set up the equation: \\( x + (7x - 3) = 45 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( x + 7x - 3 = 45 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 8x - 3 = 45 \\).",
    "Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\): \\( 8x = 48 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 6 \\).",
    "Thus, the number of drunk drivers is 6."
