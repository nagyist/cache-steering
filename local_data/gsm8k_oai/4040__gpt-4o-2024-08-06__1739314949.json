  "query": "In Everlee's family, there are two adults and four children. In a cookie jar, there are a total of 120 cookies. If the adults eat 1/3 of the cookies and then gives the rest to the children to divide equally, how many cookies does each child get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cookies the adults eat.",
    "The adults eat 1/3 of the total cookies in the jar.",
    "Since there are 120 cookies, I need to calculate 1/3 of 120.",
    "120 divided by 3 is 40.",
    "The adults eat 40 cookies.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many cookies are left after the adults have eaten.",
    "The total number of cookies left is 120 minus 40.",
    "120 - 40 equals 80 cookies.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many cookies each child gets.",
    "The cookies left are distributed equally among the four children.",
    "To find out how many cookies each child gets, I divide 80 by 4.",
    "80 divided by 4 is 20.",
    "Each child gets 20 cookies."

  "solution": "20"
