  "query": "Milena is 7 years old, and her grandmother is 9 times older than her. Milena's grandfather is two years older than her grandmother. What is the age difference between Milena and her grandfather?",
  "steps": [
    "Milena is 7 years old.",
    "Her grandmother is 9 times older than Milena.",
    "To find the grandmother's age, I multiply Milena's age by 9.",
    "7 multiplied by 9 is 63, so the grandmother is 63 years old.",
    "Milena's grandfather is 2 years older than her grandmother.",
    "To find the grandfather's age, I add 2 to the grandmother's age.",
    "63 plus 2 is 65, so the grandfather is 65 years old.",
    "Now I need to find the age difference between Milena and her grandfather.",
    "To find the age difference, I subtract Milena's age from the grandfather's age.",
    "65 minus 7 is 58."
