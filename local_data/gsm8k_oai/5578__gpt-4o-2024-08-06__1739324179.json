  "query": "Willy is starting a new TV series on Netflix. The TV series has 3 seasons that are each 20 episodes long. If Willy watches 2 episodes a day, how many days will it take for Willy to finish the entire series?",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to determine the total number of episodes in the series.",
    "There are 3 seasons, and each season has 20 episodes.",
    "The total number of episodes is 3 seasons multiplied by 20 episodes per season.",
    "3 x 20 equals 60.",
    "So, there are 60 episodes in the entire series.",
    "Willy watches 2 episodes a day.",
    "I need to find out how many days it takes to watch 60 episodes at a rate of 2 episodes per day.",
    "I will divide the total number of episodes, 60, by the number of episodes Willy watches per day, which is 2.",
    "60 divided by 2 equals 30.",
    "It will take Willy 30 days to watch all 60 episodes."
