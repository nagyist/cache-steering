  "query": "Bobby has 16 toy cars, and the number of cars he has increases by 50% every year. How many toy cars will Bobby have in three years?",
  "steps": [
    "Bobby starts with 16 toy cars.",
    "In the first year, the number of toy cars increases by 50%.",
    "To calculate the increase, I need to find 50% of 16.",
    "50% of 16 is 16 * 0.5 = 8.",
    "In the first year, Bobby will have 16 + 8 = 24 toy cars.",
    "In the second year, again the number of toy cars increases by 50%.",
    "50% of 24 is 24 * 0.5 = 12.",
    "So, in the second year, Bobby will have 24 + 12 = 36 toy cars.",
    "In the third year, the increase is again 50%.",
    "50% of 36 is 36 * 0.5 = 18.",
    "Therefore, in the third year, Bobby will have 36 + 18 = 54 toy cars."
