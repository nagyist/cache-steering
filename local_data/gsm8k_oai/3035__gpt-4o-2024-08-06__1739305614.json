  "query": "Linda makes $10.00 an hour babysitting.  There is a $25.00 application fee for each college application she submits.  If she is applying to 6 colleges, how many hours will she need to babysit to cover the application fees?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the application fees for 6 colleges.",
    "The application fee for each college is $25.00.",
    "I multiply $25.00 by 6 to find the total cost for 6 applications.",

    "Now, I know that the total cost for all college applications is $150.00.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many hours of babysitting Linda needs to do to earn $150.00.",
    "Linda earns $10.00 an hour babysitting.",
    "I will divide the total cost of $150.00 by her hourly wage of $10.00.",
    "$150.00 \u00f7 $10.00 = 15 hours"
