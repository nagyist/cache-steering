  "query": "Brendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day, he bought a lawnmower and it helped him to cut more yards by Fifty percent per day. How many yards will Brendan be able to cut after a week?",
  "steps": [
    "Brendan originally cuts 8 yards of grass per day.",
    "The new lawnmower helps him to cut 50% more yards per day.",
    "50% more of 8 yards is calculated as follows: 50% of 8 equals (50/100) * 8.",
    "Calculating 50/100 * 8 gives 4 yards.",
    "With the lawnmower, Brendan can now cut an additional 4 yards per day.",
    "Therefore, Brendan is now able to cut 8 + 4 = 12 yards of grass per day.",
    "We need to calculate how many yards Brendan can cut in a week, or over 7 days.",
    "Multiply the daily yardage of 12 by 7 days: 12 * 7.",
    "Calculating 12 * 7 gives 84 yards."
