  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the meal for both Billy and Jenny.",
    "Billy orders a $20 steak and a $5 drink.",
    "Jenny also orders a $20 steak and a $5 drink.",
    "Each of their meals costs: $20 + $5 = $25.",
    "The total cost for both of them is: $25 + $25 = $50.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total tip based on this cost.",
    "The suggested tip percentage is 20% of the total bill.",
    "20% of $50 is 0.2 * $50 = $10.",
    "Billy wants to cover 80% of this tip.",
    "80% of $10 is 0.8 * $10 = $8."
