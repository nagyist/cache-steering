  "query": "Together Felipe and Emilio needed a combined time of 7.5 years to build their homes. Felipe finished in half the time of Emilio. How many months did it take Felipe to build his house?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the time Felipe took to build his house as \\( F \\) years.",
    "We know from the problem statement that Emilio took twice as long as Felipe to build his house. So, Emilio took \\( 2F \\) years.",
    "The combined time they took to build their homes is given as 7.5 years.",
    "So we can set up the equation: \\( F + 2F = 7.5 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, we get \\( 3F = 7.5 \\).",
    "To find \\( F \\), we divide both sides by 3: \\( F = 7.5 / 3 \\).",
    "Calculating \\( 7.5 / 3 \\), we find that \\( F = 2.5 \\) years.",
    "The question asks for the time it took Felipe to build his house in months.",
    "Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to convert 2.5 years into months.",
    "We do this by multiplying 2.5 years by 12 months/year: \\( 2.5 \\times 12 = 30 \\)."

  "solution": "30"
