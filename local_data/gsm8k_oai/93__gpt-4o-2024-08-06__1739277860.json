  "query": "John orders food for a massive restaurant.  He orders 1000 pounds of beef for $8 per pound.  He also orders twice that much chicken at $3 per pound.  How much did everything cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of the beef.",
    "John orders 1000 pounds of beef at $8 per pound.",
    "I multiply 1000 by 8 to find the total cost of the beef.",
    "1000 * 8 equals 8000.",
    "Next, I calculate the amount of chicken ordered.",
    "John orders twice the amount of chicken as he does beef.",
    "He ordered 1000 pounds of beef, so he orders 2 * 1000 pounds of chicken, which is 2000 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the chicken.",
    "The chicken is $3 per pound.",
    "I multiply 2000 pounds by $3 to find the total cost of the chicken.",
    "2000 * 3 equals 6000.",
    "Now, I add the cost of the beef and chicken to find the total cost.",
    "8000 (beef cost) + 6000 (chicken cost) equals 14000."
  ],
  "solution": "14000"
