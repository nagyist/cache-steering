  "query": "Heisenberg owns a pharmacy. He earned a total of $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin and $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin every week. If each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5 and each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2, how many capsules of amoxicillin does he sell every 2 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "Heisenberg earns $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin.",
    "Each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5.",
    "To find the number of 100 mg amoxicillin capsules sold, divide the total earnings by the cost per capsule.",
    "80 \u00f7 5 = 16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin are sold per week.",
    "Heisenberg earns $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin.",
    "Each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2.",
    "To find the number of 500 mg amoxicillin capsules sold, divide the total earnings by the cost per capsule.",
    "60 \u00f7 2 = 30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin are sold per week.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of capsules sold per week by adding the 100 mg and 500 mg capsules sold.",
    "16 (100 mg) + 30 (500 mg) = 46 capsules sold per week.",
    "To find out how many capsules are sold every 2 weeks, multiply the weekly total by 2.",
    "46 \u00d7 2 = 92 capsules."
