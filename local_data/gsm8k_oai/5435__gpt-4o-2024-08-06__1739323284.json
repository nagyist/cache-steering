  "query": "Matt's protein powder is 80% protein.  He weighs 80 kg and wants to eat 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day.  How much protein powder does he need to eat per week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Matt's daily protein requirement in grams.",
    "Matt weighs 80 kg and wants to consume 2 grams of protein per kilogram.",
    "80 kg multiplied by 2 grams of protein per kg equals 160 grams of protein needed daily.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much protein powder Matt needs to consume to meet this daily protein requirement.",
    "Matt's protein powder is 80% protein, so each gram of protein powder contains 0.8 grams of protein.",
    "To find out how many grams of protein powder Matt needs to get 160 grams of protein, I divide 160 grams by 0.8.",
    "160 divided by 0.8 equals 200 grams of protein powder needed per day.",
    "Matt wants to know how much protein powder he needs per week, not per day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so I multiply the daily protein powder requirement by 7.",
    "200 grams per day multiplied by 7 days equals 1400 grams of protein powder per week."
