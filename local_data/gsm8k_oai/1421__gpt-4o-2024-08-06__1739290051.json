  "query": "Xavier needs 84 paper plates for a housewarming party. He already has 21 green plates and 28 red plates. How many more plates should Xavier buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Xavier needs a total of 84 paper plates for the party.",
    "He currently has 21 green plates.",
    "He also has 28 red plates.",
    "First, I will calculate the total number of plates Xavier already has by adding the green and red plates.",
    "21 green plates + 28 red plates = 49 plates.",
    "Now I will subtract the number of plates Xavier already has from the total he needs.",
    "84 total plates needed - 49 plates he already has = 35 plates."
