  "query": "Jennifer is building tanks to hold her goldfish. She built 3 tanks that will hold 15 fish each, heated, and filled them. She plans to build the rest of the tanks equipped with heaters, and they will hold 10 fish each. If she needs to build enough tanks to house a total of 75 fish, how many more will she need to build?",
  "steps": [
    "Jennifer initially built 3 tanks.",
    "Each of these tanks holds 15 fish.",
    "To find the total number of fish that can be housed in the 3 initial tanks, multiply 3 tanks by 15 fish per tank.",
    "3 tanks * 15 fish per tank = 45 fish.",
    "Jennifer already has enough space for 45 fish.",
    "She needs to house a total of 75 fish.",
    "Subtract the number of fish she can already house (45 fish) from the total number needed (75 fish).",
    "75 fish - 45 fish = 30 fish.",
    "The remaining tanks will each hold 10 fish.",
    "To find how many additional tanks she needs, divide the number of fish that still need housing (30 fish) by the capacity of each new tank (10 fish per tank).",
    "30 fish / 10 fish per tank = 3 tanks."
