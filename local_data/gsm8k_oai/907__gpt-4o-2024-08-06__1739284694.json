  "query": "A store received 20 pallets of paper products to stock. Half the pallets were paper towels, a quarter were tissues, and a fifth were paper plates. The rest were paper cups. How many pallets of paper cups did the store receive?",
  "steps": [
    "The store received a total of 20 pallets of paper products.",
    "Half of 20 pallets are paper towels. To find half, I divide 20 by 2.",
    "20 divided by 2 equals 10. So there are 10 pallets of paper towels.",
    "A quarter of the pallets are tissues. To find a quarter, I divide 20 by 4.",
    "20 divided by 4 equals 5. So there are 5 pallets of tissues.",
    "A fifth of the pallets are paper plates. To find a fifth, I divide 20 by 5.",
    "20 divided by 5 equals 4. So there are 4 pallets of paper plates.",
    "To find how many pallets are paper cups, I need to subtract the number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total.",
    "Number of non-paper cup pallets: 10 (paper towels) + 5 (tissues) + 4 (paper plates) equals 19.",
    "Subtract 19 from the total, which is 20.",
    "20 minus 19 equals 1."
