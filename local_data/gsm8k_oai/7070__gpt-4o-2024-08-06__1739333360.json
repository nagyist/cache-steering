  "query": "Two pieces of bread are needed for one regular sandwich. 3 pieces of bread are needed for a double meat sandwich. How many pieces of bread are needed for 14 regular sandwiches and 12 double meat sandwiches?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to first determine how many pieces of bread are required for the regular sandwiches.",
    "Each regular sandwich requires 2 pieces of bread.",
    "There are 14 regular sandwiches to make.",
    "So, I will calculate the total pieces of bread needed for the regular sandwiches: 14 sandwiches * 2 pieces of bread per sandwich.",
    "14 * 2 equals 28.",
    "I need 28 pieces of bread for the regular sandwiches.",
    "Next, I will determine how many pieces of bread are required for the double meat sandwiches.",
    "Each double meat sandwich requires 3 pieces of bread.",
    "There are 12 double meat sandwiches to make.",
    "So, I will calculate the total pieces of bread needed for the double meat sandwiches: 12 sandwiches * 3 pieces of bread per sandwich.",
    "12 * 3 equals 36.",
    "I need 36 pieces of bread for the double meat sandwiches.",
    "Now, I need to add the pieces of bread for both types of sandwiches to find the total.",
    "28 pieces (regular sandwiches) + 36 pieces (double meat sandwiches) equals 64 pieces of bread."

  "solution": "64"
