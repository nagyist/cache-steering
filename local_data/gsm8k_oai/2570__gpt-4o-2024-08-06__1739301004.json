  "query": "Kenneth spent 10% of this earnings this week on a new joystick. If he is left with $405, how much were his earnings?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the total earnings of Kenneth be denoted by E.",
    "Kenneth spent 10% of his earnings on a joystick, which means he spent 0.1 * E on the joystick.",
    "After spending on the joystick, Kenneth is left with $405.",
    "This means the remaining 90% of his earnings is equal to $405.",
    "Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.9 * E = 405.",
    "To find the total earnings, E, we need to solve the equation: E = 405 / 0.9.",
    "Divide 405 by 0.9.",
    "405 divided by 0.9 is equal to 450."

  "solution": "450"
