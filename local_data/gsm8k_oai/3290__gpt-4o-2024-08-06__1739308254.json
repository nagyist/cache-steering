  "query": "Working together, four pugs can clean their house in 45 minutes. In how many minutes will 15 pugs working together be able to clean their house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much work one pug can do. If four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes, then I need to calculate how much work this is in terms of pug-minutes.",
    "The work done by four pugs in 45 minutes is the same as 4 pugs * 45 minutes = 180 pug-minutes.",
    "This means that cleaning the house requires 180 pug-minutes of work.",
    "Now, to find out how much time 15 pugs working together will take, I need to divide the total work required (in pug-minutes) by the number of pugs.",
    "If 15 pugs are working together, I divide 180 pug-minutes by 15 pugs.",
    "180 pug-minutes / 15 pugs = 12 minutes.",
    "So, 15 pugs working together will be able to clean their house in 12 minutes."
