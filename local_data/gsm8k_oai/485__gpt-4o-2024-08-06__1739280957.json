  "query": "During the holidays, Lance works as a merchandiser. He works 35 hours a week, spread equally over 5 workdays. If Lance earns $9 an hour, how much does he make on each workday?",
  "steps": [
    "Lance works 35 hours a week.",
    "These hours are spread equally over 5 workdays.",
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Lance works per day.",
    "To find the number of hours worked per day, I divide the total number of hours per week by the number of workdays: 35 hours per week / 5 workdays = 7 hours per day.",
    "Now, I know Lance works 7 hours each day.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much he earns per hour.",
    "Lance earns $9 an hour.",
    "To find out how much Lance earns each workday, I multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day: $9 per hour * 7 hours per day = $63."
