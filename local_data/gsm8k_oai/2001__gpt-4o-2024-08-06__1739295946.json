  "query": "Jenna is on a road trip. She drives for 2 hours at 60mph. She takes a bathroom break, and then she continues driving for 3 hours at 50 mph. She can drive for 30 miles on one gallon of gas. If one gallon of gas costs $2, how much money does she spend on gas for her trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total distance Jenna travels during the trip.",
    "For the first part of the trip, Jenna drives for 2 hours at 60 mph.",
    "To find the distance she drives in the first part, multiply the speed by the time: distance = speed \u00d7 time = 60 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 120 miles.",
    "Next, for the second part of the trip, Jenna drives for 3 hours at 50 mph.",
    "To find the distance for the second part, multiply the speed by the time: distance = speed \u00d7 time = 50 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles.",
    "Add the distances from both parts of the trip to find the total distance: 120 miles + 150 miles = 270 miles.",
    "Now, calculate how many gallons of gas are needed for 270 miles.",
    "Jenna can drive 30 miles on one gallon of gas. To find the total gallons needed, divide the total distance by the miles per gallon: total gallons = 270 miles / 30 miles per gallon = 9 gallons.",
    "Next, calculate the total cost of the gas. One gallon of gas costs $2.",
    "Multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: total cost = 9 gallons \u00d7 $2 = $18."
