  "query": "Yves and his siblings ordered pizza and asked to have it cut into 16 slices.  During dinner time, they only ate one-fourth of it. The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining pizza. Then his two siblings ate 2 slices each. How many slices of pizza were left?",
  "steps": [
    "The whole pizza is divided into 16 slices.",
    "During dinner, they ate one-fourth of the pizza.",
    "One-fourth of 16 slices is 16 / 4 = 4 slices.",
    "There were 16 - 4 = 12 slices left after dinner.",
    "The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining 12 slices.",
    "One-fourth of 12 slices is 12 / 4 = 3 slices.",
    "After Yves ate, there were 12 - 3 = 9 slices left.",
    "Each of his two siblings ate 2 slices.",
    "His siblings ate 2 + 2 = 4 slices in total.",
    "After his siblings ate, there were 9 - 4 = 5 slices left."
