  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the lemonade.",
    "She bought 2 cups of lemonade at $2 each.",
    "The cost for the lemonade is 2 cups * $2 = $4.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the sandwiches.",
    "She bought 2 sandwiches at $2.50 each.",
    "The cost for the sandwiches is 2 sandwiches * $2.50 = $5.",
    "Now, I add the cost of the lemonade and the cost of the sandwiches together to find the total cost.",
    "The total cost is $4 for lemonade + $5 for sandwiches = $9.",
    "Roxanne has a $20 bill.",
    "I subtract the total cost from the $20 bill to find the change she must receive.",
    "$20 - $9 = $11."
