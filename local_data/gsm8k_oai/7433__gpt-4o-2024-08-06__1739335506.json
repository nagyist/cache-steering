  "query": "Woody wants to buy a games console that costs $282. Woody already has $42 and receives an allowance of $24 every week. How many weeks will it take him to save the money he needs for the game console?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much money Woody needs in total to buy the games console. The console costs $282.",
    "Now, I check how much money Woody already has. Woody has $42.",
    "I calculate the remaining amount Woody needs to save. I subtract the amount Woody already has from the total cost: $282 - $42 = $240.",
    "Woody receives an allowance of $24 every week. I need to figure out how many weeks of allowance are needed to save $240.",
    "To find out how many weeks it will take, I divide the remaining amount by the weekly allowance: $240 \u00f7 $24 = 10.",
    "I calculate the division again to ensure accuracy: $240 \u00f7 $24 indeed results in 10.",
    "Since the result is a whole number, Woody will need exactly 10 weeks to save the needed amount."

  "solution": "10"
