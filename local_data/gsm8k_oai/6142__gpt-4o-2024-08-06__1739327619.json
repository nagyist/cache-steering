  "query": "Krystiana owns an apartment building. The rooms on the first floor cost $15 per month and the rooms on the 2nd floor cost $20 per month. The rooms on the third floor cost twice as much as the rooms on the first floor, but only two rooms are occupied. If each floor has 3 rooms, how much does Krystiana earn every month?",
  "steps": [
    "Krystiana owns an apartment building with 3 floors, each having 3 rooms.",
    "First, I will calculate the monthly earnings from the first floor.",
    "The cost of each room on the first floor is $15 per month.",
    "There are 3 rooms on the first floor.",
    "The earnings from the first floor are 3 rooms * $15/room = $45 per month.",
    "Next, I will calculate the monthly earnings from the second floor.",
    "The cost of each room on the second floor is $20 per month.",
    "There are 3 rooms on the second floor.",
    "The earnings from the second floor are 3 rooms * $20/room = $60 per month.",
    "Now, I will calculate the monthly earnings from the third floor.",
    "The rooms on the third floor cost twice as much as the rooms on the first floor.",
    "The cost of each room on the third floor is 2 * $15 = $30 per month.",
    "Only 2 rooms are occupied on the third floor.",
    "The earnings from the third floor are 2 rooms * $30/room = $60 per month.",
    "Now I will add the earnings from all floors to find the total monthly earnings.",
    "The total earnings are $45 (first floor) + $60 (second floor) + $60 (third floor) = $165 per month."
