  "query": "Jasmine and her older sister Alexa went to the store to buy shoes. Alexa's shoes are twice as big as Jasmine's shoes. If Jasmine's shoe size is 7, what's the combined shoe size for both of them?",
  "steps": [
    "Jasmine's shoe size is given as 7.",
    "Alexa's shoe size is twice Jasmine's shoe size.",
    "To find Alexa's shoe size, I need to multiply Jasmine's shoe size by 2.",
    "So, Alexa's shoe size = 2 * 7.",
    "Calculating, Alexa's shoe size = 14.",
    "Next, I need the combined shoe size of both Jasmine and Alexa.",
    "To find the combined shoe size, I add Jasmine's shoe size to Alexa's shoe size.",
    "Combined shoe size = Jasmine's shoe size + Alexa's shoe size.",
    "Combined shoe size = 7 + 14.",
    "Calculating, the combined shoe size = 21."
