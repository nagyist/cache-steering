  "query": "Carlton wears an assortment of sweater vests and button-up shirts. He has twice as many sweater vests as button-up shirts and considers each unique combination of vest and shirt to be an outfit. He owns three button-up shirts. How many outfits does Carlton have?",
  "steps": [
    "Carlton owns three button-up shirts.",
    "He has twice as many sweater vests as button-up shirts.",
    "Since twice as many means two times three, Carlton has 2 * 3 sweater vests.",
    "Carlton has 6 sweater vests.",
    "For each shirt, he can wear any of the 6 sweater vests to form an outfit.",
    "Each shirt can be combined with 6 different sweater vests.",
    "So, the total number of combinations (outfits) is 3 shirts * 6 sweater vests.",
    "Calculate 3 * 6 to find the total number of outfits.",
    "3 * 6 equals 18."

  "solution": "18"
