  "steps": [
    "John starts at an elevation of 400 feet.",
    "He travels downward at a rate of 10 feet per minute.",
    "He travels for 5 minutes.",
    "I need to calculate the total distance he travels downward.",
    "Distance traveled downward = rate of descent x time traveled.",
    "Distance traveled downward = 10 feet/minute * 5 minutes = 50 feet.",
    "I need to subtract the distance he traveled downward from his starting elevation.",
    "New elevation = starting elevation - distance traveled downward.",
    "New elevation = 400 feet - 50 feet = 350 feet."

  "solution": "350"
