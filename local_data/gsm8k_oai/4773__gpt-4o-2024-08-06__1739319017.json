  "steps": [
    "I know the hospital originally had 11 doctors.",
    "I also know the hospital originally had 18 nurses.",
    "I need to subtract 5 doctors who quit from the original 11 doctors.",
    "11 doctors - 5 doctors = 6 doctors left.",
    "Now I need to subtract 2 nurses who quit from the original 18 nurses.",
    "18 nurses - 2 nurses = 16 nurses left.",
    "Now, I will add the number of doctors and nurses who are left.",
    "6 doctors + 16 nurses = 22 people left."
