  "query": "Cowboy Mickey and cowgirl Minnie train horses for a living.  On average, Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as does Minnie,  while Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week.  How many horses does Mickey Mount per week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many horses Minnie mounts per day. It is given that Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Minnie mounts 7 (days in a week) + 3 = 10 horses per day.",
    "Now calculate how many horses Mickey mounts per day. It is given that Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as Minnie.",
    "Twice as many horses as Minnie per day is 2 * 10 = 20.",
    "Subtract 6 from 20 to find how many horses Mickey mounts per day: 20 - 6 = 14.",
    "Mickey mounts 14 horses per day.",
    "To find out how many horses Mickey mounts per week, multiply the number of horses he mounts per day by 7 (the number of days in a week).",
    "14 (horses per day) * 7 (days per week) = 98 horses per week."

  "solution": "98"
