  "query": "Every day Tom drinks 5 12-oz cans of soda plus 64 ounces of water. How many ounces of fluid does he drink a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many ounces of soda Tom drinks in a day.",
    "Tom drinks 5 cans of soda each day.",
    "Each can of soda is 12 ounces.",
    "So, the total ounces of soda per day is 5 cans * 12 ounces/can = 60 ounces.",
    "Now, I need to add the daily water intake.",
    "Tom also drinks 64 ounces of water every day.",
    "Now, I'll sum the ounces of soda and water to find the daily total fluid intake.",
    "Daily fluid intake = 60 ounces of soda + 64 ounces of water = 124 ounces.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the fluid intake for a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Weekly fluid intake = 124 ounces/day * 7 days = 868 ounces."

  "solution": "868"
