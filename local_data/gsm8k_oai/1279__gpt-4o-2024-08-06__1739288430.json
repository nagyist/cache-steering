  "query": "Bill is buying healthcare on an exchange. The normal monthly price of the plan he wants is $500. The government will pay for part of this cost depending on Bill's income: 90% if he makes less than $10,000, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000. Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much will Bill spend for health insurance in a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Bill's monthly income.",
    "Bill earns $25 per hour.",
    "Bill works 30 hours per week.",
    "Bill earns $25 * 30 hours = $750 per week.",
    "There are 4 weeks in a month, so Bill's monthly income is 750 * 4 = $3,000.",
    "Next, I need to determine Bill's annual income.",
    "Bill's monthly income is $3,000.",
    "Therefore, his annual income is $3,000 * 12 = $36,000.",
    "Now, I need to determine the percentage of the healthcare plan cost covered by the government, based on Bill's income.",
    "Bill's annual income is $36,000.",
    "Since $10,001 < $36,000 < $40,000, the government will cover 50% of the healthcare plan cost.",
    "The normal monthly price of the plan is $500.",
    "The government will pay 50% of $500, which is 0.5 * 500 = $250.",
    "Therefore, Bill will pay the remaining 50%, which is also $250 per month.",
    "To find out how much Bill spends on health insurance in a year, I can multiply his monthly expenditure by 12.",
    "Bill spends $250 per month on health insurance.",
    "His annual healthcare cost will be 250 * 12 = $3,000."
