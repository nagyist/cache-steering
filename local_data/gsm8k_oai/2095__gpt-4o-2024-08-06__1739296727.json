  "query": "There are 60 pieces of chips in Lara's bag. One-sixth of the chips are blue. There are 34 red chips and the rest are green. How many green chips are in Lara's bag?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that there are a total of 60 pieces of chips in Lara's bag.",
    "One-sixth of the chips are blue, so I need to calculate one-sixth of 60.",
    "To find one-sixth of 60, I divide 60 by 6.",
    "60 divided by 6 equals 10.",
    "Therefore, there are 10 blue chips in the bag.",
    "According to the question, there are 34 red chips in the bag.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many chips are neither blue nor red, which would be the green chips.",
    "To do this, I subtract the number of blue and red chips from the total number of chips.",
    "The total number of blue and red chips is 10 (blue) plus 34 (red).",
    "10 plus 34 equals 44.",
    "I subtract 44 from 60 to find the number of green chips.",
    "60 minus 44 equals 16."
