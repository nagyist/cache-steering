  "query": "Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin is. Xavier will 30 years old in six years. What is the total of their ages now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Xavier's current age.",
    "I know that Xavier will be 30 years old in six years.",
    "By subtracting 6 years from 30, I can find Xavier's current age: 30 - 6 = 24.",
    "Now, I know that Xavier is currently 24 years old.",
    "Xavier is stated to be twice as old as Yasmin.",
    "If Xavier is 24, then to find Yasmin's age, I divide 24 by 2.",
    "24 divided by 2 is 12, so Yasmin is currently 12 years old.",
    "To find the total of their ages, I add Xavier's age and Yasmin's age together.",
    "24 + 12 equals 36."

  "solution": "36"
