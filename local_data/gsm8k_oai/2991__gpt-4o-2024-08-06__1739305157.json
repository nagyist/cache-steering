  "query": "A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate how many oranges Del picked over the 2 days. Del picked 23 oranges each day.",
    "Multiply the number of oranges Del picked per day by the number of days: 23 oranges/day * 2 days = 46 oranges.",
    "Del picked 46 oranges in total. Now, I need to find out how many oranges Juan picked.",
    "I know that together they picked 107 oranges. I will subtract the number Del picked from the total: 107 oranges - 46 oranges = 61 oranges.",
    "Juan picked the remaining oranges, which is the result from the subtraction."
  ],
  "solution": "61"
