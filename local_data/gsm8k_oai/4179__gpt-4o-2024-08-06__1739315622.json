  "query": "Sarah's external drive showed 2.4 gigabytes free and 12.6 gigabytes used. She decided to delete a folder of size 4.6 gigabytes and store new files of 2 gigabytes. If she will transfer all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes, how many free gigabytes will the new external drive have?",
  "steps": [
    "Sarah's current external drive shows 2.4 gigabytes free.",
    "The used space on Sarah's drive currently is 12.6 gigabytes.",
    "Sarah deletes a folder of size 4.6 gigabytes.",
    "After deleting the folder, the used space will be 12.6 gigabytes - 4.6 gigabytes = 8 gigabytes.",
    "Now, Sarah will store new files of 2 gigabytes.",
    "After adding the new files, the used space will be 8 gigabytes + 2 gigabytes = 10 gigabytes.",
    "Sarah will transfer all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes.",
    "The new drive is 20 gigabytes in total size, and the used space is 10 gigabytes.",
    "The free space on the new external drive will be 20 gigabytes - 10 gigabytes = 10 gigabytes."
