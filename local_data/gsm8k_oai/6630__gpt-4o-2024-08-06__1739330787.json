  "steps": [
    "Lyn donates $240 each year in total to the private organization.",
    "First, calculate the amount that goes to the community pantry project. It is 1/3 of the total donation.",
    "1/3 of $240 is calculated as $240 * (1/3).",
    "$240 * (1/3) = $80.",
    "So, $80 goes to the community pantry project.",
    "Now, calculate the amount that goes to the local crisis fund, which is 1/2 of the total donation.",
    "1/2 of $240 is calculated as $240 * (1/2).",
    "$240 * (1/2) = $120.",
    "So, $120 goes to the local crisis fund.",
    "Now, sum up the amounts given to the community pantry project and the local crisis fund.",
    "$80 (community pantry project) + $120 (local crisis fund) = $200.",
    "Now, subtract this sum from the total donation to find the remaining amount for the livelihood project funds and contingency fund.",
    "$240 - $200 = $40 remaining.",
    "1/4 of this remaining amount goes to the livelihood project funds.",
    "1/4 of $40 is calculated as $40 * (1/4).",
    "$40 * (1/4) = $10.",
    "So, $10 goes to the livelihood project funds.",
    "Now, calculate the amount that goes to the contingency fund by subtracting the amount for the livelihood project funds from the remaining amount.",
    "$40 (remaining) - $10 (livelihood project funds) = $30.",
    "Thus, $30 goes to the contingency fund."
