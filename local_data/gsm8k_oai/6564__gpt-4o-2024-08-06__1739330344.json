  "query": "Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?",
  "steps": [
    "Aimee conducted a poll with an equal number of men and women, so the women make up 50% of the total people polled.",
    "We know that 35% of women in the poll are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes.",
    "This implies that 65% of the women are opposed to this idea, as 100% - 35% = 65%.",
    "Aimee found that 39 women opposed the idea of shortening the school day by 30 minutes.",
    "Since 65% of the women are opposed, this 65% corresponds to the 39 women.",
    "Let's find the total number of women. We can set up the equation: 0.65 * W = 39, where W is the total number of women.",
    "Solve for W by dividing 39 by 0.65: W = 39 / 0.65.",
    "Calculating this gives W = 60.",
    "Therefore, there are 60 women in the poll. Since the poll consists of equal numbers of men and women, there are also 60 men.",
    "Thus, the total number of people Aimee polled is 60 women + 60 men."
