  "query": "Tamia is making dinner. She is using 5 bell peppers to make her meal. She likes to have a variety of sizes so some will melt and some will be thick enough to eat whole. First she cuts each bell pepper into 20 large slices. Then she takes half those slices and cuts them into 3 smaller pieces each. How many slices and pieces of bell pepper total is Tamia going to add to her meal?",
  "steps": [
    "Tamia starts with 5 bell peppers.",
    "Each bell pepper is cut into 20 large slices.",
    "So, 5 bell peppers x 20 slices each = 100 large slices initially.",
    "She cuts half of these 100 large slices into 3 smaller pieces each.",
    "Half of 100 large slices is 50 large slices.",
    "Each of these 50 large slices is cut into 3 smaller pieces.",
    "So, 50 large slices x 3 smaller pieces each = 150 smaller pieces.",
    "She keeps 50 large slices as they are and cuts the other 50 large slices into 150 smaller pieces.",
    "Therefore, she has 50 large slices + 150 smaller pieces.",
    "Adding these together, 50 + 150 = 200."

  "solution": "200"
