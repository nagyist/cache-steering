  "query": "A chocolate bar weighs 125 g. A shopkeeper has just received a 2 kilogram box of chocolate. How many bars does this represent?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that the question is asking for the number of chocolate bars in the box.",
    "I'm given the total weight of the box which is 2 kilograms.",
    "I should convert this weight into grams because the weight of each chocolate bar is given in grams.",
    "I know that 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams.",
    "So, 2 kilograms equals 2 * 1000 grams.",
    "This means the box weighs 2000 grams.",
    "Each chocolate bar weighs 125 grams.",
    "To find out how many chocolate bars are in the box, I need to divide the total weight of the box by the weight of one chocolate bar.",
    "I perform the division: 2000 grams / 125 grams.",
    "2000 divided by 125 equals 16."
