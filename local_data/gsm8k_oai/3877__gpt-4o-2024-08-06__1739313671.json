  "query": "Marissa has 4.5 feet of ribbon that she wants to use to tie some boxes. If 1 foot of ribbon is left after Marissa uses 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box, find out how many boxes she tied?",
  "steps": [
    "Marissa initially has 4.5 feet of ribbon.",
    "She wants to use her ribbon to tie boxes and will use 0.7 feet of ribbon per box.",
    "In the end, she wants to have 1 foot of ribbon left over.",
    "First, determine how much ribbon Marissa is actually willing to use.",
    "Subtract the 1 foot of ribbon she wants to have left from the total amount of ribbon.",
    "4.5 feet (total ribbon) - 1 foot (remaining ribbon) = 3.5 feet.",
    "So, Marissa can use 3.5 feet of ribbon to tie the boxes.",
    "Next, calculate how many boxes can be tied using 0.7 feet per box with 3.5 feet of ribbon available.",
    "Divide the usable ribbon by the amount needed per box.",
    "3.5 feet \u00f7 0.7 feet/box = 5 boxes."
