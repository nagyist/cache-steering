  "query": "There are 14 caterpillars on the tree. 4 more eggs hatch, and baby caterpillars climb out to munch on the leaves.  8 fat caterpillars leave the tree to cocoon themselves to be butterflies.  How many caterpillars are left on the tree?",
  "steps": [
    "I start with 14 caterpillars that are already on the tree.",
    "Next, 4 more eggs hatch, adding 4 new baby caterpillars to the tree.",
    "I add the 4 new caterpillars to the 14 that are already there: 14 + 4 = 18 caterpillars.",
    "Then, I account for the 8 caterpillars leaving the tree to cocoon themselves.",
    "I subtract the 8 caterpillars that leave from the 18 on the tree: 18 - 8 = 10 caterpillars.",
    "So, after taking everything into account, there are 10 caterpillars left on the tree."
