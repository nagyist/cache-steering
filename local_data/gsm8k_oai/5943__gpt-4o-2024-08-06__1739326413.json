  "query": "Carly had 42 lollipops to share with her friends. Half of the lollipops were cherry, and the rest were equal amounts of watermelon, sour apple, and grape. How many lollipops were grape?",
  "steps": [
    "Carly starts with 42 lollipops in total.",
    "Half of these lollipops are cherry.",
    "To find out how many are cherry, I need to calculate 42 divided by 2.",
    "42 divided by 2 is 21.",
    "So, there are 21 cherry lollipops.",
    "The remaining lollipops are watermelon, sour apple, and grape.",
    "These remaining lollipops equal 42 total lollipops minus the 21 cherry lollipops.",
    "42 - 21 equals 21.",
    "So, there are 21 lollipops that are either watermelon, sour apple, or grape.",
    "These 21 lollipops are divided equally among the three flavors.",
    "To find out how many each flavor got, I divide 21 by 3.",
    "21 divided by 3 equals 7.",
    "So, there are 7 grape lollipops."
