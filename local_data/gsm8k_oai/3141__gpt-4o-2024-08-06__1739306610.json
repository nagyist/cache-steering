  "steps": [
    "John eats 3 meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",
    "Breakfast contains 500 calories.",
    "Lunch contains 25% more calories than breakfast.",
    "To find out how many calories lunch contains, calculate 25% of the breakfast calories: 500 * 0.25 = 125 calories.",
    "Add the additional calories to the breakfast calories to get the lunch calories: 500 + 125 = 625 calories.",
    "Dinner is twice as many calories as lunch.",
    "Calculate the calories in dinner: 625 * 2 = 1250 calories.",
    "He has 3 shakes that are each 300 calories.",
    "Calculate the total calories from the shakes: 3 * 300 = 900 calories.",
    "Now sum the calories from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the shakes.",
    "Breakfast: 500 calories, Lunch: 625 calories, Dinner: 1250 calories, Shakes: 900 calories.",
    "Total calories: 500 + 625 + 1250 + 900 = 3275 calories."
