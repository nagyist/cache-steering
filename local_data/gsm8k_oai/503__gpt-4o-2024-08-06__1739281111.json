  "query": "Yasna has two books. One book is 180 pages long, and the other book is 100 pages long. If Yasna wants to finish both of the books in two weeks, how many pages will Yasna need to read every day, if she reads an equal number of pages each day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of pages Yasna needs to read. She has two books, one with 180 pages and the other with 100 pages.",
    "I will add the number of pages in both books: 180 + 100.",
    "The total number of pages Yasna needs to read is 280 pages.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many days there are in two weeks since Yasna wants to finish both books in this time period.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are 7 * 2 days.",
    "This gives me 14 days in total for reading.",
    "Yasna needs to read 280 pages over 14 days, so I will divide the total number of pages by the total number of days.",
    "280 pages \u00f7 14 days equals 20 pages per day."

  "solution": "20"
