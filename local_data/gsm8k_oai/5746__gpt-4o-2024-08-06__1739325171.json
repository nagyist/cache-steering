  "query": "12 archeology students and 4 teachers went on a field trip to a dinosaur museum. Student tickets cost $1 each, and adult tickets cost $3 each. How much did the museum tickets cost in all?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the total cost, I first need to determine how many student tickets were purchased.",
    "There are 12 archeology students. Therefore, 12 student tickets were purchased.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of each type of ticket. Student tickets are $1 each.",
    "To find the total cost of student tickets, I multiply the number of student tickets by the cost per ticket: 12 tickets * $1 = $12.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of teacher tickets purchased. There are 4 teachers, so 4 teacher tickets were purchased.",
    "Adult tickets (for teachers) cost $3 each.",
    "To find the total cost of teacher tickets, I multiply the number of teacher tickets by the cost per ticket: 4 tickets * $3 = $12.",
    "Now, I add the total cost of student tickets and the total cost of teacher tickets to find the overall cost.",
    "The total cost is $12 (student tickets) + $12 (teacher tickets) = $24."

  "solution": "24"
