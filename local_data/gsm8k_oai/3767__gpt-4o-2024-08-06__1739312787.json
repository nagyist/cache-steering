  "query": "In a basketball game, Jon scored 3 points. Jack scored 5 points more than Jon, and Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together. How many points did they score altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Jon scored 3 points.",
    "Jack scored 5 points more than Jon.",
    "Jon's points are 3, so Jack scored 3 + 5 = 8 points.",
    "Next, we consider Tom's points.",
    "Jon and Jack together scored 3 + 8 = 11 points.",
    "Tom scored 4 points less than the total of Jon and Jack.",
    "So, Tom scored 11 - 4 = 7 points.",
    "Now, we calculate the total points scored by Jon, Jack, and Tom.",
    "Jon scored 3 points, Jack scored 8 points, and Tom scored 7 points.",
    "Altogether, they scored 3 + 8 + 7 points.",
    "The total score is 3 + 8 + 7 = 18 points."
