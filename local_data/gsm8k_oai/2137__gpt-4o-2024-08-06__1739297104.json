  "query": "In his garden, Grandpa had counted 36 small tomatoes before going on vacation. When he came back from vacation, he counted 100 times more tomatoes. How many tomatoes grew in his absence?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many tomatoes were counted by Grandpa after he returned from vacation.",
    "He counted 100 times more tomatoes than initially.",
    "Initially, there were 36 small tomatoes.",
    "So, the number of tomatoes after vacation would be 100 times 36.",
    "I will calculate 100 times 36.",
    "100 times 36 equals 3600.",
    "Grandpa counted 3600 tomatoes in total after his vacation.",
    "To find out how many tomatoes grew in his absence, I need to subtract the initial count from the count after vacation.",
    "So, I will subtract 36 from 3600.",
    "3600 minus 36 equals 3564."

  "solution": "3564"
