  "query": "There are 920 deer in a park. 10% of the deer have 8 antlers, and a quarter of that number also have albino fur. How many albino 8-antlered deer are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many deer have 8 antlers.",
    "10% of the 920 deer have 8 antlers.",
    "10% of 920 is calculated by multiplying 920 by 0.10.",
    "920 * 0.10 = 92 deer with 8 antlers.",
    "Next, I need to find how many of these 92 deer also have albino fur.",
    "A quarter of the deer with 8 antlers also have albino fur.",
    "A quarter can be calculated by multiplying by 0.25.",
    "92 * 0.25 = 23 albino 8-antlered deer."
