  "query": "A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?",
  "steps": [
    "The average pig yields 20 pounds of bacon.",
    "This month's pig is half the size of the average pig.",
    "Half of 20 pounds is 20 / 2 = 10 pounds.",
    "The farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6.",
    "To find out how much money he makes, multiply the pounds of bacon by the price per pound: 10 pounds * $6 = $60."

  "solution": "60"
