  "query": "Simon collected treasures on the beach during his summer vacation. He collected a bucket of pearly seashells, a jar full of smooth sea glass, and a bag of ten sand dollars. If the jar holds three times as many pieces of glass as the bag does sand dollars, and the bucket holds five times as many seashells as the jar holds pieces of glass, how many treasures did Simon find on the beach?",
  "steps": [
    "Simon collected ten sand dollars, as stated in the problem.",
    "The jar holds three times as many pieces of sea glass as the number of sand dollars. Since there are 10 sand dollars, the number of pieces of sea glass is 3 times 10.",
    "Calculating the number of pieces of sea glass: 3 * 10 = 30.",
    "The bucket holds five times as many seashells as there are pieces of sea glass. Since there are 30 pieces of sea glass, the number of seashells is 5 times 30.",
    "Calculating the number of seashells: 5 * 30 = 150.",
    "To find the total number of treasures, I need to add up all the items: sand dollars, sea glass, and seashells.",
    "Adding them up: 10 sand dollars + 30 sea glass + 150 seashells.",
    "10 + 30 + 150 = 190."

  "solution": "190"
