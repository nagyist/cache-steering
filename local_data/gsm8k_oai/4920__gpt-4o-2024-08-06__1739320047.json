  "query": "Erin is sorting through the library books to decide which ones to replace. She finds 8 less than 6 times as many obsolete books as damaged books. If she removes 69 books total, how many books were damaged?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of damaged books be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, the number of obsolete books is 8 less than 6 times the number of damaged books.",
    "This can be expressed as the equation for obsolete books: \\( 6x - 8 \\).",
    "The total number of books removed is the sum of damaged and obsolete books: \\( x + (6x - 8) \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( x + 6x - 8 = 69 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 7x - 8 = 69 \\).",
    "Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\): \\( 7x = 77 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 11 \\).",
    "We have found that the number of damaged books is 11."
