  "query": "In a house of 15, 3/5 of the people eat pizza. If Aviana brought pizza with 50 pieces, and each person eating pizza took 4 pieces, calculate the number of pizza pieces that remained.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people are in the house.",
    "The problem states there are 15 people in the house.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these people are eating pizza.",
    "The problem states that 3/5 of the people eat pizza.",
    "To find out how many people eat pizza, I should calculate 3/5 of 15.",
    "\\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 15 = 9\\)",
    "Therefore, 9 people eat pizza.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pieces of pizza they took in total.",
    "The problem states each person eating pizza took 4 pieces.",
    "Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces consumed is 9 people \\(\\times\\) 4 pieces each.",
    "9 \\(\\times\\) 4 = 36",
    "So, they consumed 36 pieces of pizza.",
    "Aviana brought pizza with 50 pieces initially.",
    "The remaining pieces of pizza can be found by subtracting the pieces eaten from the pieces brought: 50 - 36.",
    "50 - 36 = 14"
  ],
  "solution": "14"
