  "query": "There are 30 pieces of popcorn in a serving. Jared can eat 90 pieces of popcorn and his three other friends can each eat 60 pieces of popcorn. How many servings of popcorn should Jared order for all of them?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many pieces of popcorn Jared and his three friends can eat in total.",
    "Jared can eat 90 pieces of popcorn.",
    "Each of his three friends can eat 60 pieces.",
    "So, the total pieces of popcorn his friends can eat is 3 times 60, which is 180.",
    "Now, I add Jared's 90 pieces to the 180 pieces from his friends.",
    "This means they can eat a total of 90 + 180 = 270 pieces of popcorn.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many servings of popcorn that is.",
    "There are 30 pieces of popcorn in a serving.",
    "To find the number of servings needed, I divide the total number of pieces (270) by the number of pieces in one serving (30).",
    "270 divided by 30 is 9."

  "solution": "9"
