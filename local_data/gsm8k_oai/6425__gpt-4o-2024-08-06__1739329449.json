  "query": "Bart fills out surveys to earn money. He receives $0.2 for every question he answers in the survey. Each survey has 10 questions. On Monday he finished 3 surveys, and on Tuesday 4 surveys. How much money did he earn during these two days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many questions are in each survey.",
    "Each survey has 10 questions.",
    "Now, I calculate how many questions Bart answered on Monday.",
    "On Monday, he finished 3 surveys. Since each survey has 10 questions, he answered 3 x 10 = 30 questions on Monday.",
    "Next, I determine how many questions Bart answered on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday, he finished 4 surveys, which means he answered 4 x 10 = 40 questions on Tuesday.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of questions Bart answered over both days.",
    "He answered 30 questions on Monday and 40 questions on Tuesday, which totals 30 + 40 = 70 questions.",
    "I need to determine how much Bart earns per question.",
    "Bart earns $0.2 for each question he answers.",
    "I can calculate the total money Bart earned by multiplying the total number of questions by the earning per question.",
    "Bart earns 70 x $0.2 = $14."
