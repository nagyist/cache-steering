  "query": "There are 15 students in the art club. By the end of each quarter, each student makes two artworks. If there are four quarters in a school year, how many artworks can the art club collect in two school years?",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by identifying the number of artworks each student makes in one quarter.",
    "Each student makes two artworks per quarter.",
    "I calculate the number of artworks made by one student in one school year.",
    "Since there are four quarters in a school year, each student makes 2 artworks/quarter \u00d7 4 quarters = 8 artworks in one school year.",
    "Next, I find out how many artworks 15 students make in one school year.",
    "The 15 students collectively make 15 students \u00d7 8 artworks/student = 120 artworks in one school year.",
    "Now I calculate how many artworks the art club collects in two school years.",
    "In two school years, the art club collects 120 artworks/school year \u00d7 2 school years = 240 artworks."
