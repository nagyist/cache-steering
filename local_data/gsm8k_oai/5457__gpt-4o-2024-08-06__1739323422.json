  "query": "14 less than two times the number of koi fish in the pond is 64. How many koi fish will you find in the pond?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of koi fish in the pond be represented by the variable \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, two times the number of koi fish is \\( 2x \\).",
    "The problem states that 14 less than this amount is equal to 64.",
    "This can be expressed as the equation \\( 2x - 14 = 64 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( x \\), I first add 14 to both sides of the equation.",
    "This results in \\( 2x = 78 \\).",
    "Next, I divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \\( x \\).",
    "This gives me \\( x = 39 \\).",
    "Therefore, the number of koi fish in the pond is 39."
