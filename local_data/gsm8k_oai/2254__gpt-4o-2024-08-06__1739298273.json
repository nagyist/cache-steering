  "query": "Aubrey has a deck of cards with 52 cards in it. She then adds two additional cards to the deck. If she splits the deck evenly among herself and two other players, how many cards does each player have?",
  "steps": [
    "Aubrey starts with a deck of 52 cards.",
    "She then adds 2 additional cards to the deck.",
    "The total number of cards now is 52 + 2 = 54.",
    "Aubrey wants to split the deck evenly among herself and two other players, which means the cards will be divided into 3 equal parts.",
    "To find out how many cards each player will get, I need to divide the total number of cards by the number of players: 54 \u00f7 3.",
    "54 divided by 3 is 18.",
    "Therefore, each player gets 18 cards."
