  "query": "At a birthday party, there are 20 red balloons and 15 green balloons. Before the party started, 3 red and 2 green balloons burst. How many balloons are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many red balloons are left.",
    "Originally, there are 20 red balloons.",
    "3 red balloons burst.",
    "To find the remaining red balloons, I subtract the burst ones from the original number: 20 - 3.",
    "20 - 3 = 17. So, there are 17 red balloons left.",
    "Now, let's find out how many green balloons are left.",
    "Originally, there are 15 green balloons.",
    "2 green balloons burst.",
    "To find the remaining green balloons, I subtract the burst ones from the original number: 15 - 2.",
    "15 - 2 = 13. So, there are 13 green balloons left.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of balloons left.",
    "There are 17 red balloons and 13 green balloons left.",
    "To find the total number of balloons remaining, I add the remaining red and green balloons: 17 + 13.",
    "17 + 13 = 30."
