  "query": "John used to go to the gym multiple times a weak but because of lockdowns he hasn't been able to go.  He used to lift 700 for squat, 400 for bench, and 800 for deadlift.  For squat he lost 30% of his lift.  He didn't lose any weight on bench because he was able to train that at home and he lost 200 pounds on deadlift.  What is his new total?",
  "steps": [
    "John's original squat lift was 700 pounds.",
    "John lost 30% of his squat lift.",
    "30% of 700 is calculated as 0.30 * 700 = 210 pounds.",
    "John's new squat weight is 700 - 210 = 490 pounds.",
    "John's bench press did not change, so it remains at 400 pounds.",
    "John's original deadlift was 800 pounds.",
    "John lost 200 pounds on his deadlift.",
    "John's new deadlift weight is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.",
    "Now, add the new squat, bench press, and deadlift weights to find John's new total.",
    "The calculation is 490 + 400 + 600 = 1490 pounds."
