  "query": "Sam, Sid, and Steve brought popsicle sticks for their group activity in their Art class. Sam has thrice as many as Sid, and Sid has twice as many as Steve. If Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, how many popsicle sticks can they use for their Art class activity?",
  "steps": [
    "The question gives me that Steve has 12 popsicle sticks.",
    "Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve.",
    "Since Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, let's calculate how many Sid has: Sid has 2 times 12 popsicle sticks.",
    "2 times 12 equals 24, so Sid has 24 popsicle sticks.",
    "Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid.",
    "Since Sid has 24 popsicle sticks, let's calculate how many Sam has: Sam has 3 times 24 popsicle sticks.",
    "3 times 24 equals 72, so Sam has 72 popsicle sticks.",
    "Now, I will add up all the popsicle sticks for their group activity.",
    "Steve has 12, Sid has 24, and Sam has 72 popsicle sticks.",
    "Adding those together: 12 + 24 + 72 equals 108."

  "solution": "108"
