  "query": "In a math test, Mark scored twice as much as the least score. If the highest score is 98 and the range of the scores is 75, what was Mark's score?",
  "steps": [
    "The range of the scores is given as 75. The range is the difference between the highest score and the lowest score.",
    "Since the highest score is 98, we can calculate the lowest score by subtracting the range from the highest score.",
    "Lowest score = Highest score - Range = 98 - 75.",
    "98 - 75 = 23. Thus, the lowest score is 23.",
    "According to the problem, Mark scored twice as much as the lowest score.",
    "Mark's score = 2 \u00d7 Lowest score = 2 \u00d7 23.",
    "2 \u00d7 23 = 46. Therefore, Mark's score is 46."
