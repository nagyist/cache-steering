  "steps": [
    "Ed has 2 dogs.",
    "Ed has 3 cats.",
    "To find out how many fish, first we calculate the combined number of cats and dogs.",
    "The number of cats and dogs combined is 2 (dogs) + 3 (cats) = 5.",
    "Ed has twice as many fish as the combined number of dogs and cats.",
    "To find the number of fish, multiply the combined number of dogs and cats by 2.",
    "This is 5 (combined cats and dogs) * 2 = 10 fish.",
    "Now, add everything together to check the total number of pets Ed has.",
    "Ed's total number of pets is 2 (dogs) + 3 (cats) + 10 (fish).",
    "The total is 2 + 3 + 10 = 15."
