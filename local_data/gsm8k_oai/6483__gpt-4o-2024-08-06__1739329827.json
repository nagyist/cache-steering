  "query": "Carrie is trying to sneak some mashed turnips into her kids' mashed potatoes. She knows they didn't notice when she mixed 2 cups of turnips with 5 cups of potatoes. If she has 20 cups of potatoes, how many cups of turnips can she add?",
  "steps": [
    "Carrie originally mixed 2 cups of turnips with 5 cups of potatoes.",
    "The ratio of turnips to potatoes is 2:5.",
    "Carrie wants to maintain the same ratio with 20 cups of potatoes.",
    "To scale up the ratio, I need to find how many units of 5 are in 20.",
    "20 divided by 5 is 4.",
    "This means we have 4 times the original amount of potatoes.",
    "If the potatoes are scaled by a factor of 4, the turnips must also be scaled by the same factor to maintain the ratio.",
    "Originally, there were 2 cups of turnips.",
    "Scaling the 2 cups of turnips by a factor of 4, we get 2 * 4 = 8 cups of turnips."
