  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students raised $30 each.",
    "There are 30 students in total.",
    "10 students raised $20 each, so I subtract 10 from 30.",
    "30 - 10 = 20 students raised $30 each.",
    "Now, I calculate the total amount of money raised by the 10 students who raised $20 each.",
    "10 students * $20 = $200",
    "Next, I calculate the total amount of money raised by the 20 students who raised $30 each.",
    "20 students * $30 = $600",
    "Finally, I add the money raised by both groups of students to find the total amount raised.",
    "$200 + $600 = $800"
