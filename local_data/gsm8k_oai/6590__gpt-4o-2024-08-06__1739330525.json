  "query": "Davida worked 35 hours on each of Weeks 1 and 2. She worked 48 hours each of Weeks 3 and 4. How many more hours did Davida work on Weeks 3 and 4 than on Weeks 1 and 2?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many hours Davida worked in Weeks 1 and 2.",
    "She worked 35 hours each week for the first two weeks.",
    "So, I calculate 35 hours/week * 2 weeks = 70 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many hours she worked in Weeks 3 and 4.",
    "She worked 48 hours each week for the last two weeks.",
    "So, I calculate 48 hours/week * 2 weeks = 96 hours.",
    "Now I need to find the difference between the hours worked in Weeks 3 and 4 and Weeks 1 and 2.",
    "I calculate the difference: 96 hours - 70 hours = 26 hours."
