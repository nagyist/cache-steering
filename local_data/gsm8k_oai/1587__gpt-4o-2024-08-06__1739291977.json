  "query": "In a class of 300 students, the number of smoking teens is 40% of the class. In a year, 70% of the smoking students are hospitalized from smoking-related complications. Calculate the total number of smoking students from the class who have not been hospitalized from smoking-related complications.",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of students in the class is 300.",
    "The number of smoking students is 40% of the class.",
    "To find the number of smoking students, calculate 40% of 300.",
    "40% of 300 is calculated as (40/100) * 300.",
    "This is equal to 0.4 * 300.",
    "0.4 * 300 equals 120.",
    "So, there are 120 smoking students.",
    "Next, we need to find out how many of these smoking students are hospitalized.",
    "70% of the smoking students are hospitalized.",
    "To find the number of hospitalized smoking students, calculate 70% of 120.",
    "70% of 120 is calculated as (70/100) * 120.",
    "This is equal to 0.7 * 120.",
    "0.7 * 120 equals 84.",
    "So, 84 smoking students are hospitalized.",
    "Finally, calculate the number of smoking students who have not been hospitalized.",
    "Subtract the number of hospitalized students (84) from the total number of smoking students (120).",
    "120 - 84 equals 36."
