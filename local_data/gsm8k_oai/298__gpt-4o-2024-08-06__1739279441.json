  "query": "There were sweets on the table. Jack came and took half of all the candies and 4 more candies. Then Paul came and took the remaining 7 sweets. How many sweets were on the table at first?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul took the remaining 7 sweets, so there were 7 sweets left on the table after Jack took his share.",
    "Let's denote the total number of sweets on the table initially as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Jack took half of the sweets plus 4 more.",
    "If Jack took half of all the candies and 4 more, then the number of sweets he took can be represented as \\(\\frac{x}{2} + 4\\).",
    "After Jack took his share, there were 7 sweets left on the table, which Paul took.",
    "So, the equation representing this is: \\(\\frac{x}{2} + 4 + 7 = x\\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( \\frac{x}{2} + 11 = x \\).",
    "Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x - \\frac{x}{2} = 11 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 11 \\).",
    "Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 22 \\).",
    "I've concluded that the initial number of sweets on the table was 22."
