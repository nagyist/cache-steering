    "Sunny starts with 8 cakes.",
    "She gives away 2 cakes.",
    "I need to subtract the 2 cakes she gives away from the 8 cakes she started with.",
    "8 cakes - 2 cakes = 6 cakes.",
    "Sunny now has 6 cakes remaining.",
    "Sunny wants to put 6 candles on each of the remaining 6 cakes.",
    "To find the total number of candles, I need to multiply the number of cakes by the number of candles per cake.",
    "6 cakes * 6 candles per cake = 36 candles."
