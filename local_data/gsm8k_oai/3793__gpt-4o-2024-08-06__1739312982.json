  "query": "Max is planning a vacation for 8 people. The Airbnb rental costs $3200. They also plan on renting a car that will cost $800. If they plan on splitting the costs equally, how much will each person\u2019s share be?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the vacation by adding the Airbnb rental cost and the car rental cost.",
    "The Airbnb rental costs $3200 and the car rental costs $800.",
    "I add these two amounts: $3200 + $800 = $4000.",
    "The total cost for the vacation is $4000.",
    "Now, I need to divide the total cost by the number of people to find out each person's share.",
    "There are 8 people going on the vacation.",
    "I divide $4000 by 8 to find each person\u2019s share: $4000 \u00f7 8 = $500."
