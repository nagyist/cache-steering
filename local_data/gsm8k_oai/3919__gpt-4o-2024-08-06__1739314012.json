  "query": "Leila eats cake almost every week. Last week, she ate 6 cakes on Monday, 9 cakes on Friday, and on Saturday, she ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday. How many cakes does Leila eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cakes Leila ate on Saturday.",
    "She ate triple the number of cakes she ate on Monday.",
    "On Monday, she ate 6 cakes.",
    "Triple of 6 is 6 * 3.",
    "Calculating 6 * 3 gives 18 cakes.",
    "Now, I will add the number of cakes she ate on each day to find the total.",
    "On Monday, she ate 6 cakes.",
    "On Friday, she ate 9 cakes.",
    "On Saturday, she ate 18 cakes.",
    "Adding these together: 6 + 9 + 18.",
    "Calculating 6 + 9 gives 15.",
    "Now, adding 18 to 15 gives 33."
