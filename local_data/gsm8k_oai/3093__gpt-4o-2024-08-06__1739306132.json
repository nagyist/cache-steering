  "query": "Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden. She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom. However, the flower shop only sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack. Each pack is $5. How much will Madeline spend on seeds to plant 20 flowers?",
  "steps": [
    "Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden.",
    "She assumes that about half of the seeds will die before they bloom.",
    "This means she should plant twice as many seeds as the number of flowers she wants.",
    "Twice the number of flowers she wants is 20 * 2 = 40 seeds.",
    "The flower shop sells seeds in packs of 25.",
    "Madeline needs at least 40 seeds.",
    "Let's determine how many 25-seed packs are needed for at least 40 seeds.",
    "One pack contains 25 seeds.",
    "Two packs contain 25 * 2 = 50 seeds.",
    "Two packs (50 seeds total) are enough because they provide more than 40 seeds.",
    "Each pack costs $5.",
    "Two packs will cost 2 * $5 = $10."
