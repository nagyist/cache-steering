  "query": "A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "The chocolate box initially contains 200 bars.",
    "Thomas and his 4 friends together make 5 people.",
    "They take 1/4 of the 200 bars. So I need to calculate 1/4 of 200.",
    "1/4 of 200 is calculated as 200 divided by 4, which equals 50.",
    "So, Thomas and his friends take a total of 50 bars from the box.",
    "Initially, there are 200 bars in the box, and they take 50 bars, leaving 150 bars in the box.",
    "The 50 bars need to be divided equally among Thomas and his 4 friends.",
    "There are 5 people (Thomas and his 4 friends).",
    "Each person gets 50 divided by 5, which equals 10 bars.",
    "One of Thomas's friends returns 5 of his bars to the box.",
    "Each friend initially took 10 bars, so one friend returning 5 bars means they now have 5 bars.",
    "Returning 5 bars increases the number of bars in the box from 150 to 155.",
    "Piper takes 5 fewer bars than the total initially taken by Thomas and his friends (50 bars).",
    "5 fewer than 50 is 50 - 5, which equals 45.",
    "Piper takes 45 bars from the box.",
    "After Piper takes 45 bars, we need to subtract these from the remaining 155 bars.",
    "155 - 45 equals 110 bars."

  "solution": "110"
