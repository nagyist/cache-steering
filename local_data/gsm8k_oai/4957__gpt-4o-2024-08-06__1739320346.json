  "query": "Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, Jan's skipping speed is 70 skips per minute.",
    "After training, she doubles her speed.",
    "Doubling 70 skips per minute means her new speed is 70 * 2.",
    "Calculating this gives 140 skips per minute.",
    "To find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes, I multiply her new speed by the number of minutes.",
    "This means calculating 140 skips/minute * 5 minutes.",
    "Multiplying gives 700 skips."

  "solution": "700"
