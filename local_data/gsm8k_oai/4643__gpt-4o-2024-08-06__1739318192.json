    "First, I need to determine the amount I need to pay back.",
    "I borrowed $100 initially from my friend.",
    "We agreed on a 10% increase when repaying the amount.",
    "To find the increase in the amount, I calculate 10% of $100.",
    "10% of $100 is calculated as (10/100) * $100 = $10.",
    "Now, I add this $10 increase to the original borrowed amount of $100.",
    "The total amount to repay is $100 + $10 = $110."
