  "query": "Peter has a plan to take his family on a vacation to Germany. He needs $5,000 to cover all the spending for the travel, and he has $2,900 in savings right now. If he can save up $700 each month, how many months does he need to wait to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter needs a total of $5,000 for the vacation.",
    "He currently has $2,900 in savings.",
    "I need to calculate how much more money Peter needs to save.",
    "Subtract Peter's current savings from the total amount needed: $5,000 - $2,900 = $2,100.",
    "Peter needs an additional $2,100 to reach his goal.",
    "He can save $700 each month.",
    "To find out how many months he needs to save, I should divide the additional amount needed by the savings per month.",
    "Divide $2,100 by $700: $2,100 / $700 = 3 months."
