  "query": "The snack machine at Richmond High School sells candy bars for $2 each and chips for $.50 each. How much money, in dollars, will 5 students need in total if each of them gets 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost for one student who buys 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips.",
    "A candy bar costs $2 each.",
    "Two bags of chips cost $0.50 each, so their total cost is $0.50 * 2 = $1.",
    "Now I will add the cost of 1 candy bar and the cost of 2 bags of chips.",
    "Total cost for one student = $2 (candy bar) + $1 (chips) = $3.",
    "Next, I need to find out the total amount for 5 students.",
    "If one student spends $3, then 5 students will spend 5 * $3.",
    "5 * $3 gives me $15."
