  "query": "Andre catches 8 ladybugs on Monday and 5 ladybugs on Tuesday. If each ladybug has 6 dots, how many dots are there in total for all the ladybugs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many ladybugs Andre caught in total across both days.",
    "He caught 8 ladybugs on Monday and 5 ladybugs on Tuesday.",
    "I add the number of ladybugs from Monday and Tuesday: 8 + 5 = 13 ladybugs in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many dots are on all of these ladybugs combined.",
    "Each ladybug has 6 dots.",
    "To find the total number of dots, I multiply the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots each has: 13 ladybugs * 6 dots/ladybug.",
    "Now I perform the multiplication: 13 * 6 = 78 dots."
  ],
  "solution": "78"
