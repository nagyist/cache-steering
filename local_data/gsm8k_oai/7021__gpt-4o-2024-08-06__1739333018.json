  "query": "There is a road stretching 3 miles from the base camp to the chain challenge. Every 20 minutes, a car comes down the road from the base camp towards the chain challenge. How many hours have passed once 30 cars have come down the road?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how often cars are coming down the road.",
    "The problem states that a car comes every 20 minutes.",
    "I need to calculate the total time it takes for 30 cars to come down the road.",
    "If one car comes every 20 minutes, then 30 cars will come every 30 x 20 minutes.",
    "I will multiply 30 cars by 20 minutes to find the total time in minutes.",
    "30 x 20 = 600 minutes is the total time taken for 30 cars.",
    "Now I need to convert 600 minutes into hours since the question asks for time in hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "I divide 600 minutes by 60 to convert into hours.",
    "600 \u00f7 60 = 10 hours."

  "solution": "10"
