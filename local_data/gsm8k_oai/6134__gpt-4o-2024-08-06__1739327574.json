  "query": "There were 200 students on a field playing football. Suddenly a military plane flew by, and 3/4 of the students looked up. How many eyes saw the airplane?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students looked up when the plane flew by.",
    "I know that 3/4 of the students looked up.",
    "There are 200 students in total.",
    "I calculate 3/4 of 200 by multiplying 200 by 3/4.",
    "First, divide 200 by 4 to find 1/4 of the students: 200 \u00f7 4 = 50.",
    "Next, multiply 50 by 3 to get 3/4 of the students: 50 \u00d7 3 = 150.",
    "So, 150 students looked up at the airplane.",
    "Since each student has 2 eyes, I need to find out how many eyes saw the airplane.",
    "I multiply the number of students who looked up by 2: 150 \u00d7 2 = 300."

  "solution": "300"
