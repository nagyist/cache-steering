  "query": "There are 480 zombies in the shopping mall. If the number of zombies doubled every day, how many days ago were there less than 50 zombies in the mall?",
  "steps": [
    "Currently, there are 480 zombies in the mall.",
    "I need to find out how many days ago the number of zombies was less than 50.",
    "The number of zombies doubles every day. So, working backwards, I need to halve the current number of zombies each day.",
    "Let's halve 480 to find the number of zombies from one day ago: 480 / 2 = 240.",
    "If I halve again to find the number two days ago: 240 / 2 = 120.",
    "Halving once more to find three days ago: 120 / 2 = 60.",
    "Halving again to find the number of zombies four days ago: 60 / 2 = 30.",
    "Now, there are 30 zombies four days ago, which is less than 50.",
    "Thus, four days ago, the number of zombies was less than 50 for the first time."
