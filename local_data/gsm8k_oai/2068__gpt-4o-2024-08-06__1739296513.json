  "query": "Janessa has a plan to give her brother Dexter his first collection of baseball cards. She currently has 4 cards in addition to the 13 that her father gave her.  She ordered a collection of 36 cards from eBay. After inspecting the cards she found 4 cards are in bad shape and decides to throw them away. Janessa ended up giving Dexter 29 cards. How many cards did Janessa keep for herself?",
  "steps": [
    "Janessa initially has 4 cards on her own.",
    "Her father gave her 13 cards.",
    "The cards she currently has after receiving her father's gift is 4 + 13 = 17 cards.",
    "She ordered an additional 36 cards from eBay.",
    "Adding the eBay cards, the total number of cards becomes 17 + 36 = 53 cards.",
    "Janessa finds out that 4 of these cards are in bad shape and throws them away.",
    "The total number of cards after discarding the bad ones is 53 - 4 = 49 cards.",
    "Janessa gives 29 cards to Dexter.",
    "To find out how many cards she kept for herself, subtract the number of cards given to Dexter from the total she has: 49 - 29 = 20 cards."
