  "query": "An NGO contracted a construction company to build 2000 houses within one year. In the first half of the year, they built the first 3/5 units of the contracted number. Due to unavoidable circumstances, the company could only build an additional 300 units by October. How many units remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of houses the company contracted to build is 2000.",
    "In the first half of the year, they built 3/5 of the contracted number of houses.",
    "To find out how many houses they built in the first half, I need to calculate 3/5 of 2000.",
    "3/5 of 2000 is equal to \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 2000 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 2000 \\), which is 1200 houses.",
    "The company built 1200 houses in the first half of the year.",
    "After the first half of the year, an additional 300 units were built by October.",
    "Add the 300 units built by October to the 1200 units already built in the first half.",
    "The total number of houses built by October is \\( 1200 + 300 = 1500 \\).",
    "To find the remaining number of units, subtract the units built by October from the contracted number.",
    "Calculate \\( 2000 - 1500 \\), which equals 500."
