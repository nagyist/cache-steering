  "query": "The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90.  Marco scored 10% less than the average test score and Margaret received 5 more points than Marco.  What score did Margaret receive on her test?",
  "steps": [
    "The average score on the test was 90.",
    "Marco scored 10% less than the average score.",
    "10% of 90 is calculated as 90 * 0.10 = 9.",
    "Thus, Marco's score is 90 - 9 = 81.",
    "Margaret received 5 more points than Marco.",
    "Therefore, Margaret's score is 81 + 5 = 86."
