  "query": "In a field of 500 clovers, 20% have four leaves and one quarter of these are purple clovers. Assuming these proportions are exactly correct, how many clovers in the field are both purple and four-leaved?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many clovers have four leaves in the field of 500 clovers.",
    "20% of the clovers have four leaves. To find this number, I calculate 20% of 500.",
    "To find 20% of 500, I multiply 500 by 0.20.",
    "500 multiplied by 0.20 equals 100.",
    "So, there are 100 clovers with four leaves.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these four-leaved clovers are purple.",
    "One quarter of the four-leaved clovers are purple, so I calculate one quarter of 100.",
    "To find one quarter of 100, I divide 100 by 4.",
    "100 divided by 4 equals 25.",
    "Therefore, there are 25 clovers that are both purple and have four leaves."

  "solution": "25"
