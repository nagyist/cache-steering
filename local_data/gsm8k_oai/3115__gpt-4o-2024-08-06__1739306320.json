  "query": "Susie has 572 beans in the jar. One-fourth of them are red and one-third of the remaining beans are white. Then half of the remaining are green beans. How many green beans are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate how many beans are red.",
    "Since one-fourth of the beans are red, I need to divide 572 by 4.",
    "572 \u00f7 4 = 143",
    "So there are 143 red beans.",
    "Next, I'll find out how many beans are remaining after removing the red beans.",
    "I'll subtract the number of red beans from the total number of beans.",
    "572 - 143 = 429",
    "There are 429 beans remaining after removing the red beans.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many beans are white.",
    "Since one-third of the remaining beans are white, I need to divide 429 by 3.",
    "429 \u00f7 3 = 143",
    "So there are 143 white beans.",
    "Next, I'll find out how many beans are remaining after removing the white beans.",
    "I'll subtract the number of white beans from the remaining beans.",
    "429 - 143 = 286",
    "There are 286 beans remaining after removing the white beans.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many beans are green.",
    "Since half of the remaining beans are green, I will divide 286 by 2.",
    "286 \u00f7 2 = 143",
    "So there are 143 green beans."
