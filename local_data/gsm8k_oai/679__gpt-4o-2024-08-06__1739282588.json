  "query": "Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many notepads Bart bought.",
    "Each notepad costs $1.25.",
    "Bart spends a total of $10 on notepads.",
    "I will divide the total amount Bart spent by the cost per notepad to find out how many notepads he bought: $10 / $1.25 per notepad.",
    "10 divided by 1.25 equals 8.",
    "So, Bart bought 8 notepads.",
    "Each notepad has 60 pages.",
    "To find out the total number of pages Bart bought, I need to multiply the number of notepads by the number of pages per notepad: 8 notepads * 60 pages per notepad.",
    "8 multiplied by 60 equals 480.",
    "Therefore, Bart bought a total of 480 pages."
