  "query": "Katerina purchases 3 pots and 4 pans at the home goods store. Each pot costs $20. The total cost of Katerina's items is $100. If each pan is the same price, what is the cost of 2 pans?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the pots.",
    "There are 3 pots, and each pot costs $20.",
    "So, the total cost for the pots is 3 pots * $20/pot = $60.",
    "Next, I will find out the total cost of the pans.",
    "Katerina's total cost for all items is $100.",
    "The cost of the pans is the total cost minus the cost of the pots.",
    "Total cost of the pans = $100 - $60 = $40.",
    "Katerina bought 4 pans, and together they cost $40.",
    "To find the cost of one pan, I will divide the total cost of the pans by the number of pans.",
    "Cost per pan = $40 / 4 = $10.",
    "Finally, to find the cost of 2 pans, I multiply the cost per pan by 2.",
    "Cost of 2 pans = 2 * $10 = $20."

  "solution": "20"
