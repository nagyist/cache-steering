  "query": "James buys a weight vest for $250.  He then buys 200 pounds of weight plates for $1.2 per pound.  A 200-pound weight vest would cost $700 but there is a $100 discount.  How much does he save with his vest?",
  "steps": [
    "The first item James buys is a weight vest for $250.",
    "Next, he buys 200 pounds of weight plates at a rate of $1.2 per pound.",
    "I will calculate the total cost of the weight plates. 200 pounds times $1.2 per pound equals $240.",
    "The total cost James incurred is the sum of the weight vest and the weight plates: $250 + $240.",
    "Adding these values together gives $490.",
    "A 200-pound weight vest would normally cost $700.",
    "However, there is a $100 discount on the 200-pound weight vest.",
    "With the discount, the 200-pound weight vest would cost $700 - $100.",
    "This results in a discounted price of $600.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much James saves by assembling his own weight vest compared to buying the discounted 200-pound weight vest.",
    "The cost of the assembled weight vest is $490, and the cost of the discounted weight vest is $600.",
    "The savings are calculated by subtracting the cost of the assembled vest from the cost of the discounted vest: $600 - $490.",
    "The calculation gives a savings of $110."
