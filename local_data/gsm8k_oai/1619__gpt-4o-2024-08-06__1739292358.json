  "query": "Ragnar is a woodchopper. He can get 3 blocks of wood for every tree he cuts. If Ragnar chops 2 trees every day, how many blocks of woods does he get after 5 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many blocks of wood Ragnar gets from chopping one tree.",
    "Ragnar gets 3 blocks of wood for every tree he cuts.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many trees Ragnar chops each day.",
    "Ragnar chops 2 trees every day.",
    "To find out how many blocks of wood Ragnar collects each day, I multiply the number of trees he chops per day by the number of blocks of wood per tree.",
    "2 trees per day * 3 blocks of wood per tree = 6 blocks of wood per day.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many blocks of wood Ragnar collects after 5 days.",
    "I multiply the number of blocks of wood Ragnar collects per day by the number of days.",
    "6 blocks of wood per day * 5 days = 30 blocks of wood."
