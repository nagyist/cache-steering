  "query": "Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Calculate the age of Justin currently.",
  "steps": [
    "We start by figuring out how old Angelina is currently.",
    "In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old.",
    "To find Angelina's current age, we subtract 5 from 40.",
    "40 - 5 = 35. So, Angelina is currently 35 years old.",
    "Now, we know that Angelina is 4 years older than Justin currently.",
    "Let Justin's current age be J. Thus, we have the equation 35 = J + 4.",
    "To find J, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation.",
    "35 - 4 = J.",
    "This simplifies to J = 31."
