  "query": "Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary counted 60 animals.",
    "Mary double-counted 7 sheep.",
    "This means the actual count of sheep is 7 too high.",
    "So, we subtract 7 from her total count: 60 - 7 = 53.",
    "Mary forgot to count 3 pigs.",
    "So, the actual count needs to include these 3 pigs.",
    "We add the 3 pigs to the corrected total: 53 + 3 = 56."

  "solution": "56"
