  "steps": [
    "Neeley sliced the loaf of bread into 12 pieces.",
    "His family ate a third of the bread slices for breakfast.",
    "To find out how many slices they ate for breakfast, I need to calculate a third of 12.",
    "A third of 12 slices is 12 divided by 3, which equals 4 slices.",
    "This means 4 slices were eaten for breakfast.",
    "Neeley then used 2 slices to make a sandwich for lunch.",
    "So far, 4 + 2 = 6 slices have been used.",
    "To find out how many slices remain, I subtract the number of slices used from the total number of slices.",
    "12 slices were originally there, and 6 slices have been used.",
    "12 - 6 = 6 slices remaining."
