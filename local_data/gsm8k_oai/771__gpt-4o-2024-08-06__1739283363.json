  "query": "Jimmy decides to make sandwiches for a picnic.  He makes 8 sandwiches in total, using two slices of bread each.  How many packs of bread does he need to buy to make these sandwiches, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices of bread in it?",
  "steps": [
    "Jimmy wants to make 8 sandwiches.",
    "Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread.",
    "To calculate the total number of slices needed, I multiply the number of sandwiches by the number of slices per sandwich.",
    "8 sandwiches x 2 slices per sandwich = 16 slices of bread needed.",
    "Each pack contains 4 slices of bread.",
    "To find out how many packs he needs, I divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pack.",
    "16 slices needed \u00f7 4 slices per pack = 4 packs.",
    "Since there are no slices left over, 4 packs will be just enough."
