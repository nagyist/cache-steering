  "query": "Bruno wants to buy two and one-half dozens of pens. How many pens will he have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that \"dozen\" means 12.",
    "Bruno wants to buy two and one-half dozens.",
    "I need to calculate how many pens are in two dozens.",
    "Two dozens is 2 multiplied by 12.",
    "2 multiplied by 12 equals 24.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of pens in one-half dozen.",
    "One-half dozen is 0.5 multiplied by 12.",
    "0.5 multiplied by 12 equals 6.",
    "To find the total number of pens, I need to add the pens in two dozens and one-half dozen.",
    "So, I add 24 (from two dozens) and 6 (from one-half dozen).",
    "24 plus 6 equals 30."

  "solution": "30"
