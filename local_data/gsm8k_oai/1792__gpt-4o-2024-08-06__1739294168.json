  "query": "Marta is arranging floral centerpieces for a reception party.  Each arrangement needs to have 8 roses,12 daisies, 3 snapdragons and twice as many lilies.  The reception will have 10 tables.  How many flowers will she need in total to fill this order?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many lilies are needed in each arrangement.",
    "Each arrangement requires twice as many lilies as they do snapdragons.",
    "There are 3 snapdragons in each arrangement.",
    "Two times 3 snapdragons means there are 6 lilies in each arrangement.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of flowers per arrangement.",
    "Each arrangement includes 8 roses, 12 daisies, 3 snapdragons, and 6 lilies.",
    "Adding these together gives 8 + 12 + 3 + 6 flowers per arrangement.",
    "This amounts to 29 flowers in each arrangement.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of arrangements needed.",
    "There are 10 tables, and each table needs one arrangement.",
    "Therefore, 10 arrangements are needed in total.",
    "To find the total number of flowers needed for all arrangements, multiply the number of arrangements by the number of flowers in each arrangement.",
    "This calculation is 10 arrangements times 29 flowers per arrangement.",
    "That is 290 flowers in total."
