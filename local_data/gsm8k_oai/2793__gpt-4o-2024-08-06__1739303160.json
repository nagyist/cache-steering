  "query": "Lara is baking cookies using four baking trays. She places five rows of cookies on a baking tray where there are six cookies in one row. How many cookies is she baking?",
  "steps": [
    "Lara is using four baking trays to bake cookies.",
    "On each baking tray, there are five rows of cookies.",
    "Each row on the baking tray has six cookies.",
    "To find the number of cookies on one tray, I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of cookies per row: 5 rows * 6 cookies/row.",
    "5 * 6 equals 30, so there are 30 cookies on one baking tray.",
    "Since Lara is using four baking trays, I need to multiply the number of cookies on one tray (30 cookies) by the number of trays: 4 trays.",
    "30 cookies/tray * 4 trays equals 120 cookies."

  "solution": "120"
