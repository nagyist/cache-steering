  "query": "Steven, Stephanie, and Sonya went ice skating. Steven only fell down 3 times, but Stephanie had 13 more falls than Steven. If Sonya fell down 2 times less than half the number of times Stephanie fell, how many times did Sonya fall?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many times Stephanie fell.",
    "I know that Steven fell 3 times.",
    "Stephanie fell 13 more times than Steven.",
    "So, Stephanie fell 3 + 13 times.",
    "3 + 13 equals 16.",
    "Stephanie fell 16 times.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many times Sonya fell.",
    "Sonya fell 2 times less than half the number of times Stephanie fell.",
    "Half the number of times Stephanie fell is 16 / 2.",
    "16 divided by 2 equals 8.",
    "Now, I subtract 2 from 8 to find out how many times Sonya fell.",
    "8 - 2 equals 6."

  "solution": "6"
