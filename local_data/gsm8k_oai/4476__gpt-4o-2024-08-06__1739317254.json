  "query": "In spring, a family planted trees to capture the sun. They planted 3 times as many peaches as apricots. If 58 apricot trees were planted, how many trees were planted in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of peach trees planted.",
    "I know that the family planted 3 times as many peaches as apricots.",
    "There are 58 apricot trees planted.",
    "The number of peach trees is 3 times the number of apricot trees.",
    "To find the number of peach trees, I multiply the number of apricot trees by 3: 58 * 3.",
    "58 times 3 equals 174.",
    "So, the family planted 174 peach trees.",
    "Now, I must determine the total number of trees planted.",
    "The total number of trees is the sum of apricot and peach trees.",
    "So I add the number of apricot and peach trees: 58 + 174.",
    "58 plus 174 equals 232."

  "solution": "232"
