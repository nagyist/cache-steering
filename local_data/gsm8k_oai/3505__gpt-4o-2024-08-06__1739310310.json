  "query": "During a unit on probability, a teacher surveys her class asking her students two questions.  The first question was whether they prefer dogs or cats, and the second question was whether they movies or video games.  Of the 30 students in her class, 50% chose dogs and video games as their two answers, while 10% chose dogs and movies as their two answers.  In total, how many students in this teacher's class prefer dogs over cats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students in the class, which is given as 30.",
    "I know that 50% of students chose dogs and video games. To find out how many students this is, I calculate 50% of 30.",
    "50% of 30 is calculated as 0.50 * 30 = 15 students.",
    "Next, I see that 10% of students chose dogs and movies. To find out how many students this is, I calculate 10% of 30.",
    "10% of 30 is calculated as 0.10 * 30 = 3 students.",
    "Now, I will add the number of students who prefer dogs and video games (15) to the number of students who prefer dogs and movies (3) to get the total number of students who prefer dogs.",
    "15 students (dogs and video games) + 3 students (dogs and movies) = 18 students prefer dogs."

  "solution": "18"
