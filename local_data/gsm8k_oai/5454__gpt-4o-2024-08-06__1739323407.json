  "steps": [
    "Maria starts with 40 stamps in her collection.",
    "She wants to have 20% more stamps.",
    "To find out how many more stamps that is, I need to calculate 20% of 40.",
    "20% as a decimal is 0.20.",
    "I will multiply 40 by 0.20 to find 20% of her current collection.",
    "40 multiplied by 0.20 is 8.",
    "Maria wants to have 8 more stamps than she currently has.",
    "To find the total number of stamps she wants, I add the additional stamps to her current collection.",
    "40 plus 8 equals 48."
