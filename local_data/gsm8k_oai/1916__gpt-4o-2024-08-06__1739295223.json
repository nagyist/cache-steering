  "query": "The Donaldsons pay $15 per hour for babysitting. The Merck family pays $18 per hour and the Hille family pays $20 per hour for babysitting. Layla babysat for the Donaldsons for 7 hours, the Merck family for 6 hours and the Hille family for 3 hours. How many dollars did Layla earn babysitting?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate Layla's earnings from babysitting for the Donaldsons.",
    "Layla babysat for the Donaldsons for 7 hours and her rate is $15 per hour.",
    "To find the total earnings from the Donaldsons, I multiply 7 hours by $15 per hour.",
    "7 hours * $15/hour = $105.",
    "Next, I calculate Layla's earnings from babysitting for the Merck family.",
    "Layla babysat for the Merck family for 6 hours and her rate is $18 per hour.",
    "To find the total earnings from the Merck family, I multiply 6 hours by $18 per hour.",
    "6 hours * $18/hour = $108.",
    "Now, I calculate Layla's earnings from babysitting for the Hille family.",
    "Layla babysat for the Hille family for 3 hours and her rate is $20 per hour.",
    "To find the total earnings from the Hille family, I multiply 3 hours by $20 per hour.",
    "3 hours * $20/hour = $60.",
    "Finally, I add up Layla's earnings from all three families to find the total amount she earned.",
    "$105 (Donaldsons) + $108 (Merck) + $60 (Hille) = $273."
