  "query": "Jeff was driving to the capital city to attend a conference. At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How many miles did he travel?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the distance Jeff traveled while driving at 80 miles/hour.",
    "He drove at this speed for 6 hours.",
    "Distance = Speed x Time = 80 miles/hour x 6 hours = 480 miles.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the distance Jeff traveled while driving at 60 miles/hour.",
    "He drove at this speed for 4 hours.",
    "Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 4 hours = 240 miles.",
    "Then, I'll calculate the distance Jeff traveled while driving at 40 miles/hour.",
    "He drove at this speed for 2 hours.",
    "Distance = Speed x Time = 40 miles/hour x 2 hours = 80 miles.",
    "To find the total distance Jeff traveled, I need to add all the distances together.",
    "Total Distance = 480 miles + 240 miles + 80 miles.",
    "Total Distance = 800 miles."

  "solution": "800"
