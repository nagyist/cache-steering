  "query": "Thomas has 25 drawings to display. 14 of the drawings were made using colored pencils. 7 of the drawings were made using blending markers. The rest of the drawings were made with charcoal. How many are charcoal drawings?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by noting the total number of drawings Thomas has, which is 25.",
    "Next, we need to account for the drawings made with colored pencils and blending markers. There are 14 drawings made with colored pencils.",
    "Additionally, there are 7 drawings made with blending markers.",
    "To find how many drawings were made with charcoal, we need to subtract the number of colored pencil drawings and blending marker drawings from the total number of drawings.",
    "Add the drawings made with colored pencils and blending markers together: 14 + 7 = 21.",
    "Subtract the sum of colored pencil and blending marker drawings from the total number of drawings: 25 - 21 = 4."
