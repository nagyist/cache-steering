  "query": "When Jayson is 10 his dad is four times his age and his mom is 2 years younger than his dad.  How old was Jayson's mom when he was born?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by determining Jayson's dad's age when Jayson is 10.",
    "Jayson's dad is four times Jayson's age when Jayson is 10.",
    "Four times 10 is 40, so Jayson's dad is 40 years old when Jayson is 10.",
    "Now, let's determine Jayson's mom's age when Jayson is 10.",
    "Jayson's mom is 2 years younger than his dad.",
    "Jayson's dad is 40, so Jayson's mom is 40 - 2 = 38 years old when Jayson is 10.",
    "Next, we need to find out how old Jayson's mom was when Jayson was born.",
    "When Jayson was born, he was 0 years old.",
    "Since Jayson is now 10 years old, 10 years have passed since his birth.",
    "If Jayson's mom is 38 now when Jayson is 10, she must have been 10 years younger when he was born.",
    "Subtract 10 from 38 to find her age when Jayson was born: 38 - 10 = 28."

  "solution": "28"
