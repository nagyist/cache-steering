  "query": "Frank invites his friends over to play video games. He bakes a pan of brownies before he arrives. He cuts 6 even columns and 3 even rows into the pan of brownies. If there are 6 people, including Frank, in total, how many brownies can they each eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Frank cuts the brownies into 6 columns and 3 rows.",
    "To find the total number of brownies, I multiply the number of columns by the number of rows: 6 columns * 3 rows = 18 brownies.",
    "There are 6 people, including Frank, who will share the brownies.",
    "To find out how many brownies each person can eat, I divide the total number of brownies by the number of people: 18 brownies \u00f7 6 people = 3 brownies per person."
