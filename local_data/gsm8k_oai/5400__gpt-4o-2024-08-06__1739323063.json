  "query": "Seth and Max were selling candy bars for a school fundraiser. Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold. If Max sold 24 candy bars, how many did Seth sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many candy bars Max sold. It's given that Max sold 24 candy bars.",
    "Next, I need to write an expression for the number of candy bars Seth sold.",
    "The problem states that Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 3 times the number Max sold.",
    "I will calculate 3 times the number of candy bars Max sold. So, 3 times 24 is \\(3 \\times 24 = 72\\).",
    "Now, according to the problem, Seth sold 6 more than this number. So, I add 6 to 72.",
    "By adding 6 to 72, I get \\(72 + 6 = 78\\).",
    "I have calculated that Seth sold 78 candy bars."
  ],
  "solution": "78"
