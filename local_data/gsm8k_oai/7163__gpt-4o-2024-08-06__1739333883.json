  "query": "Malcolm is trying to find the fastest walk to school and is currently comparing two routes. In the first route, he walks for 6 minutes uphill, walks for twice this amount of time along a path, then finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages. In the second route, he walks along a flat path for 14 minutes, then finishes the walk in twice this amount of time. In minutes, how much longer was the second route compared with the first?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total time for the first route.",
    "Malcolm walks for 6 minutes uphill.",
    "Then, he walks twice this amount of time along a path, which is 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes.",
    "The total time for these two stages is 6 minutes + 12 minutes = 18 minutes.",
    "For the last stage of the first route, Malcolm takes a third of the total time of the first two stages, so that's 18 minutes / 3 = 6 minutes.",
    "Adding this to the previous total gives the total time for the first route as 18 minutes + 6 minutes = 24 minutes.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time for the second route.",
    "Malcolm walks along a flat path for 14 minutes.",
    "Then, he finishes the walk in twice this amount of time, so that's 14 minutes * 2 = 28 minutes.",
    "The total time for the second route is 14 minutes + 28 minutes = 42 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find how much longer the second route is compared to the first route.",
    "The second route is 42 minutes, and the first route is 24 minutes.",
    "Subtracting the first route time from the second gives 42 minutes - 24 minutes = 18 minutes."
