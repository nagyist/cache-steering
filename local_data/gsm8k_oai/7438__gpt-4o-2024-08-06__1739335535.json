  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Logan currently spends in total each year.",
    "Logan spends $20,000 on rent every year.",
    "He spends $5,000 on groceries every year.",
    "He spends $8,000 on gas every year.",
    "To find the total annual expenses, I add up all these amounts: $20,000 + $5,000 + $8,000.",
    "$20,000 + $5,000 = $25,000.",
    "$25,000 + $8,000 = $33,000.",

    "Next, I need to calculate how much money Logan has left after these expenses with his current income.",
    "Logan's current income is $65,000 per year.",
    "Subtract the total expenses from Logan's income: $65,000 - $33,000.",
