  "steps": [
    "Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.",
    "First, I need to find out how many 5-minute intervals are in 2 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "So, 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I divide 120 minutes by 5 minutes per interval.",
    "120 \u00f7 5 = 24 intervals of 5 minutes in 120 minutes.",
    "Bob shucks 10 oysters in each 5-minute interval.",
    "I multiply the number of intervals by the number of oysters he shucks per interval.",
    "24 x 10 = 240."
