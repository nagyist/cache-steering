  "query": "Bob was creating a math test for an online platform.  He created 13 questions in the first hour.  Bob then doubled his rate for the second hour, and doubled his second hour rate for the third hour.  How many questions did Bob create in the three hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many questions Bob created in the first hour. According to the problem, he created 13 questions in the first hour.",
    "Next, I need to determine Bob's rate for the second hour. The problem states that he doubled his rate for the second hour.",
    "Since he created 13 questions in the first hour, doubling this rate means he created 2 times 13 questions in the second hour.",
    "Calculating the number of questions for the second hour: 2 times 13 equals 26 questions.",
    "Now, I need to determine Bob's rate for the third hour. The problem states that Bob doubled his second-hour rate for the third hour.",
    "Doubling the second hour's rate of 26 questions means he created 2 times 26 questions in the third hour.",
    "Calculating the number of questions for the third hour: 2 times 26 equals 52 questions.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of questions Bob created in the three hours. I need to add together the questions he created in each hour.",
    "Adding the questions: 13 (first hour) plus 26 (second hour) plus 52 (third hour).",
    "13 plus 26 equals 39.",
    "39 plus 52 equals 91."

  "solution": "91"
