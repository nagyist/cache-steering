  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many treats John will need for the entire month.",
    "John gives his dog 2 treats per day.",
    "The month is 30 days long.",
    "I multiply 2 treats/day by 30 days to find the total number of treats.",
    "2 treats/day \u00d7 30 days = 60 treats.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of 60 treats.",
    "Each treat costs $0.1.",
    "I multiply 60 treats by $0.1/treat to find the total cost.",
    "60 \u00d7 $0.1 = $6."
