  "query": "For the family reunion, Peter is buying 16 pounds of bone-in chicken and half that amount in hamburgers.  He's going to buy 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers.  He's also going to buy several sides that will weigh half the amount of hot dogs.  How many pounds of food will he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the amount of bone-in chicken Peter is buying. It is given as 16 pounds.",
    "Next, determine the amount of hamburgers Peter is buying. He is buying half the amount of bone-in chicken in hamburgers. Half of 16 pounds is 8 pounds.",
    "Now, find out how many pounds of hot dogs Peter will buy. He will buy 2 more pounds of hot dogs than hamburgers. Since he is buying 8 pounds of hamburgers, he will buy 8 + 2 = 10 pounds of hot dogs.",
    "Next, calculate the amount of sides Peter is going to buy. The sides will weigh half the amount of hot dogs. Half of 10 pounds is 5 pounds.",
    "Add up all the food Peter plans to buy: bone-in chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, and sides.",
    "The total weight of bone-in chicken is 16 pounds.",
    "The total weight of hamburgers is 8 pounds.",
    "The total weight of hot dogs is 10 pounds.",
    "The total weight of sides is 5 pounds.",
    "Add together: 16 pounds of chicken + 8 pounds of hamburgers + 10 pounds of hot dogs + 5 pounds of sides.",
    "16 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 39 pounds of food."
