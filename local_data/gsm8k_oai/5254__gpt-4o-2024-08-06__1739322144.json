  "query": "Shawn collected 40 plain pebbles. He painted 9 pebbles red and 13 pebbles blue. He then divided the remaining pebbles equally into 3 groups, and painted them purple, yellow, and green. What is the difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles?",
  "steps": [
    "Shawn collected a total of 40 pebbles.",
    "He painted 9 pebbles red and 13 pebbles blue.",
    "First, I need to calculate the number of pebbles that were painted red and blue in total.",
    "9 (red pebbles) + 13 (blue pebbles) = 22 pebbles",
    "Shawn painted 22 pebbles either red or blue.",
    "Now I need to find out how many pebbles were left after painting some red and blue.",
    "40 (total pebbles) - 22 (red and blue pebbles) = 18 pebbles left",
    "These 18 remaining pebbles were divided equally into 3 groups.",
    "18 divided by 3 groups = 6 pebbles per group",
    "Each group of 6 pebbles was painted a different color: purple, yellow, and green.",
    "The question asks for the difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles.",
    "There are 13 blue pebbles.",
    "There are 6 yellow pebbles.",
    "Now, I calculate the difference between the number of blue and yellow pebbles.",
    "13 (blue pebbles) - 6 (yellow pebbles) = 7"
