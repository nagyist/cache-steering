  "query": "A company is lining a 900-foot path with a fence. Every 6 feet, a fence pole is placed. The entire path is lined with a fence except for a 42-foot bridge. How many fence poles will be placed along the whole path on both sides?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the length of the path that will actually have poles placed. Subtract the length of the bridge from the total path length.",
    "The path is 900 feet long, and the bridge is 42 feet. So, 900 - 42 = 858 feet of path will have poles.",
    "Fence poles are placed every 6 feet along the remainder of the path.",
    "To find out how many poles are needed, divide the usable length of the path by the spacing distance: 858 feet / 6 feet per pole.",
    "858 / 6 = 143 poles",
    "The question asks for the number of poles placed on both sides of the path. Each side of the path has 143 poles.",
    "Since there are two sides to the path, calculate the total number of poles: 143 poles/side * 2 sides."

  "solution": "286"
