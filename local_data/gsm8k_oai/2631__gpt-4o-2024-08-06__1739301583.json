  "query": "Jenson and Kingsley have a tailoring business. Jenson makes 3 shirts, and Kingsley makes 5 pairs of pants per day. If each shirt uses 2 yards of fabric and a pair of pants uses 5 yards of fabric, how many yards of fabric do they need every 3 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how much fabric Jenson uses for shirts per day.",
    "Jenson makes 3 shirts per day, and each shirt uses 2 yards of fabric.",
    "So, Jenson uses \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) yards of fabric per day.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how much fabric Kingsley uses for pants per day.",
    "Kingsley makes 5 pairs of pants per day, and each pair of pants uses 5 yards of fabric.",
    "So, Kingsley uses \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) yards of fabric per day.",
    "Now, I'll find out the total fabric used by both Jenson and Kingsley in one day.",
    "The total fabric used per day is the sum of the fabric used by Jenson and Kingsley, which is \\(6 + 25 = 31\\) yards per day.",
    "I'll calculate how much fabric they need for 3 days.",
    "In 3 days, they will use \\(31 \\times 3 = 93\\) yards of fabric."
