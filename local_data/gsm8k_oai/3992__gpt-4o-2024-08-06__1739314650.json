  "query": "Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster than the two other harbors combined. If the other two harbors have 80 pounds of lobster each, how many pounds of lobster are the three harbors holding?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the amount of lobster in the two other harbors. Each has 80 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total pounds of lobster in the two other harbors: 80 pounds + 80 pounds = 160 pounds.",
    "According to the problem, Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster as the two other harbors combined.",
    "To find how many pounds of lobster Hooper Bay has, multiply the total from the two other harbors by 2: 160 pounds * 2 = 320 pounds.",
    "Finally, add the lobster amounts for all three harbors together. Hooper Bay has 320 pounds and the two other harbors together have 160 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total lobster for all three harbors: 320 pounds + 160 pounds = 480 pounds."
