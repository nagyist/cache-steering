  "query": "There are 50 children at the party. Three-fifths of them are boys. How many of the children are girls?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. There are 50 children in total.",
    "Three-fifths of the children are boys.",
    "To find the number of boys, I need to calculate three-fifths of 50.",
    "Three-fifths as a fraction is 3/5.",
    "I multiply 50 by 3/5 to find the number of boys.",
    "50 multiplied by 3 equals 150.",
    "150 divided by 5 equals 30.",
    "So, there are 30 boys at the party.",
    "Now I need to find the number of girls.",
    "If there are 50 children in total and 30 of them are boys, I subtract 30 from 50.",
    "50 minus 30 equals 20.",
    "Therefore, there are 20 girls at the party."
