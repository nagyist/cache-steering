  "query": "Gargamel needed new tires for his truck. He went to the auto shop and bought 4 tires on sale for $75 each. The salesman told him that he saved a total of $36. If Gargamel saved the same amount on each tire, what was the original price of each tire?",
  "steps": [
    "Gargamel bought 4 tires on sale for $75 each.",
    "The total cost for the 4 tires at the sale price is 4 tires * $75/tire = $300.",
    "He was told that he saved a total of $36 on the 4 tires.",
    "To find out how much he saved per tire, I need to divide the total savings by the number of tires.",
    "The savings per tire is $36 total savings / 4 tires = $9 savings per tire.",
    "To find the original price of each tire before the savings, I need to add the savings per tire to the sale price per tire.",
    "The original price of each tire is the sale price $75 + $9 savings = $84."

  "solution": "84"
