  "query": "In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total there are 12 fruits in the bowl. How many oranges are in the bowl?",
  "steps": [
    "I know there are 2 bananas in the bowl.",
    "There are twice as many apples as bananas, so there are 2 * 2 = 4 apples.",
    "I sum the number of bananas and apples: 2 + 4 = 6 fruits so far.",
    "The total number of fruits is 12.",
    "To find the number of oranges, I subtract the number of bananas and apples from the total: 12 - 6 = 6 oranges."
