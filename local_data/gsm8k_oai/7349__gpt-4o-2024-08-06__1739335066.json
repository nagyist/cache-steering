  "query": "Kara mixes cups of sugar and water in the ratio of 1:2 to make one liter of lemonade. Calculate the total number of cups of sugar used if she used 84 cups to make lemonade.",
  "steps": [
    "Kara is mixing sugar and water in the ratio of 1:2.",
    "This means for every 1 cup of sugar, she uses 2 cups of water.",
    "The total mixture involves 1 cup of sugar + 2 cups of water = 3 cups of mixture.",
    "I know she used 84 cups of mixture in total.",
    "To find out how many parts are sugar, I need to determine what part of the mixture the sugar is in the ratio.",
    "The sugar part of the mixture is 1 out of every 3 parts.",
    "If the total mixture used is 84 cups, I need to find 1/3 of this amount to determine the cups of sugar.",
    "I will calculate 1/3 of 84 cups.",
    "84 divided by 3 equals 28.",
    "Therefore, Kara used 28 cups of sugar."
