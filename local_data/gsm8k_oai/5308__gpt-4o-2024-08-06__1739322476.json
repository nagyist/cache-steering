  "query": "Trace has five shopping bags that weigh the same amount as Gordon\u2019s two shopping bags. One of Gordon\u2019s shopping bags weighs three pounds and the other weighs seven. Trace\u2019s shopping bags all weigh the same amount. How many pounds does one of Trace\u2019s bags weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the number of pounds one of Trace's shopping bags weighs.",
    "Gordon has two shopping bags: one weighs 3 pounds, the other weighs 7 pounds.",
    "Gordon's total weight for his two shopping bags is 3 + 7 = 10 pounds.",
    "Trace's five shopping bags weigh the same total amount as Gordon's two shopping bags.",
    "So, the total weight of Trace's five bags is 10 pounds.",
    "Each of Trace's shopping bags weighs the same amount.",
    "To find the weight of one of Trace's bags, I divide the total weight of all five bags by the number of bags.",
    "I calculate: 10 pounds \u00f7 5 bags = 2 pounds per bag."
