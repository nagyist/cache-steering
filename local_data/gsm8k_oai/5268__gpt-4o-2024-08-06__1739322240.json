  "query": "Pat's Pool Supply has three times as many swimming pools as Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store. If Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store has 200 pools, how many pools do they have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know Pat's Ark & Athletic Wear store has 200 pools.",
    "Pat's Pool Supply has three times as many pools as the Ark & Athletic Wear store.",
    "To find out how many pools Pat's Pool Supply has, I need to multiply the number of pools at the Ark & Athletic Wear store by 3.",
    "Performing the calculation: 200 pools * 3 = 600 pools.",
    "Now I know Pat's Pool Supply has 600 pools.",
    "To find the total number of pools, I need to add the number of pools at both places together.",
    "So, I add the 200 pools at the Ark & Athletic Wear store to the 600 pools at the Pool Supply: 200 + 600 = 800 pools."
