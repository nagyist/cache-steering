  "query": "Nunzio eats three pieces of pizza every day for lunch.  If a piece of pizza represents one-eighth of the entire pie, then how many pizzas does Nunzio eat in 72 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Nunzio eats 3 pieces of pizza each day.",
    "Each piece is 1/8 of a pizza.",
    "To find out how much pizza Nunzio eats daily, I multiply the number of pieces he eats by the size of each piece (in terms of the whole pie).",
    "So, daily pizza consumption in terms of whole pizzas is 3 pieces * (1/8 of a pizza per piece) = 3/8 of a pizza.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much pizza Nunzio eats in 72 days.",
    "I multiply the daily pizza consumption by the number of days: (3/8 pizza per day) * 72 days.",
    "(3/8) * 72 = 216/8",
    "Now, I need to divide 216 by 8 to find the number of whole pizzas.",
    "216 \u00f7 8 = 27"
  ],
  "solution": "27"
