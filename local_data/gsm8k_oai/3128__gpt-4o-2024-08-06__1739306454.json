  "query": "It's field trip month, and the students took six vans and four minibusses. There were 10 students on each van and 24 students on each minibus. How many students went on the field trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students traveled in the vans.",
    "I know each van holds 10 students and there are 6 vans.",
    "I multiply 10 students/van by 6 vans to find the total number of students in the vans.",
    "10 x 6 = 60 students in vans.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students traveled in the minibusses.",
    "I know each minibus holds 24 students and there are 4 minibusses.",
    "I multiply 24 students/minibus by 4 minibusses to find the total number of students in the minibusses.",
    "24 x 4 = 96 students in minibusses.",
    "Finally, I need to add the number of students from the vans and the minibusses to find the total number of students on the field trip.",
    "60 students from vans + 96 students from minibusses = 156 students total."
