  "query": "Antonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family.  His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.  Antonio has 8 family members, including himself.  If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?",
  "steps": [
    "The recipe requires 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.",
    "Antonio uses a total of 4 pounds of hamburger.",
    "To find out how many meatballs he can make, I need to divide the total pounds of hamburger by the amount needed per meatball.",
    "I calculate the number of meatballs as 4 pounds divided by 1/8 pound per meatball.",
    "Performing the division: 4 \u00f7 (1/8) = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 meatballs.",
    "Antonio has 8 family members in total.",
    "Each family member eats an equal number of meatballs, so I divide the total number of meatballs by the number of people.",
    "Divide 32 meatballs by 8 family members: 32 \u00f7 8 = 4 meatballs per person.",
    "Since Antonio is one member of the family, he will eat 4 meatballs."
