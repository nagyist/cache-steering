  "query": "A baker bakes 5 loaves of bread an hour in one oven. He has 4 ovens. From Monday to Friday, he bakes for 5 hours, but on Saturday and Sunday, he only bakes for 2 hours. How many loaves of bread does the baker bake in 3 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many loaves of bread the baker bakes in one oven in one hour. It is given as 5 loaves per hour.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many loaves he can bake in all his ovens in one hour. Since he has 4 ovens, that would be 5 loaves per hour per oven multiplied by 4 ovens.",
    "5 loaves per hour per oven times 4 ovens equals 20 loaves per hour in total.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many loaves he bakes on weekdays (Monday to Friday), where he bakes for 5 hours each day.",
    "He bakes 20 loaves per hour, so in 5 hours on a weekday, he bakes 20 times 5 loaves.",
    "20 times 5 equals 100 loaves per weekday.",
    "Since there are 5 weekdays, he bakes 100 loaves per day times 5 days, which equals 500 loaves in one week from Monday to Friday.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many loaves he bakes on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), where he bakes for 2 hours each day.",
    "He bakes 20 loaves per hour, so in 2 hours on a weekend day, he bakes 20 times 2 loaves.",
    "20 times 2 equals 40 loaves per day on each weekend day.",
    "Since there are 2 weekend days, he bakes 40 loaves per day times 2 days, which equals 80 loaves in one week from Saturday to Sunday.",
    "Now I need to add the loaves baked on weekdays and weekends to get the total loaves baked in one week.",
    "500 loaves from weekdays plus 80 loaves from the weekend equals 580 loaves in one week.",
    "Finally, I multiply the weekly total by 3 to find out how many loaves he bakes in 3 weeks.",
    "580 loaves per week multiplied by 3 weeks equals 1740 loaves."
