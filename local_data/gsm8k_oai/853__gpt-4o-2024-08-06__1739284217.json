  "query": "Eugene built a model house out of toothpicks and a deck of playing cards.  For every card, he used 75 toothpicks.  The deck of playing cards had 52 cards, and Eugene used all but 16 of the cards to build his house.  If a box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, how many boxes of toothpicks did Eugene use to create his model house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cards Eugene used for his model house.",
    "Eugene used all but 16 of the 52 cards.",
    "So, he used 52 - 16 = 36 cards.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of toothpicks used for the 36 cards.",
    "Eugene used 75 toothpicks per card.",
    "Therefore, the total number of toothpicks used is 36 cards * 75 toothpicks/card = 2700 toothpicks.",
    "I need to find out how many boxes of toothpicks were used. Each box contains 450 toothpicks.",
    "To determine the number of boxes required, I divide the total toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box.",
    "2700 toothpicks \u00f7 450 toothpicks/box = 6 boxes."

  "solution": "6"
