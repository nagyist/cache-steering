  "query": "There are 84 people waiting in line to ride a roller coaster at an amusement park.\u00a0 The roller coaster has 7 cars, and each car seats 2 people.\u00a0 How many times will the ride operator have to run the roller coaster to give everyone in line a turn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to determine the total capacity of the roller coaster for each ride. The roller coaster has 7 cars.",
    "Each car seats 2 people. So, I need to calculate the total number of people that can ride at one time.",
    "To find the total capacity, I multiply the number of cars by the number of people each car can hold: 7 cars * 2 people per car.",
    "7 * 2 equals 14, so the roller coaster can hold 14 people at a time.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times the roller coaster needs to run to accommodate all 84 people in line.",
    "I will divide the total number of people waiting, 84, by the capacity of the roller coaster, 14, to find out how many full rides are needed.",
    "84 divided by 14 equals 6 rides, but I should check if there is any remainder.",
    "I calculated that 14 * 6 equals 84, with no remainder, meaning all people can be accommodated in exactly 6 rides."

  "solution": "6"
