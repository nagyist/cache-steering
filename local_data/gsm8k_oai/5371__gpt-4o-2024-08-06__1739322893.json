  "query": "Martha has 20 apples. She decided to split them among her friends. Jane got 5 apples from her, and James got 2 more than Jane. How many more apples would Martha need to give away to be left with only 4 of them?",
  "steps": [
    "Martha starts with 20 apples.",
    "She gives 5 apples to Jane.",
    "Now, Martha has 20 - 5 = 15 apples left.",
    "James receives 2 more apples than Jane.",
    "Jane got 5 apples, so James gets 5 + 2 = 7 apples.",
    "Martha now has 15 - 7 = 8 apples left after giving apples to both Jane and James.",
    "Martha wants to be left with only 4 apples.",
    "Currently, she has 8 apples. To have 4 apples left, she needs to give away 8 - 4 = 4 more apples."
