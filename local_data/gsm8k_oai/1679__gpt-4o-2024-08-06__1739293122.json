  "query": "A park is 1000 feet long and 2000 feet wide. If there is 1 tree per 20 square feet, how many trees are there in the park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the area of the park in square feet.",
    "The length of the park is 1000 feet and the width is 2000 feet.",
    "To find the area, I multiply the length by the width: 1000 feet * 2000 feet.",
    "1000 * 2000 equals 2,000,000 square feet.",
    "There is 1 tree per 20 square feet.",
    "To find the total number of trees, I need to divide the total area by the area per tree: 2,000,000 square feet / 20 square feet per tree.",
    "2,000,000 divided by 20 equals 100,000."
  ],
  "solution": "100,000"
