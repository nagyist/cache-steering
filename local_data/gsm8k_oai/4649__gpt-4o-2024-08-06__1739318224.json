  "query": "A machine fills 150 cans of paint every 8 minutes. How many minutes does it take this machine to fill 675 cans?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the rate at which the machine fills cans in terms of cans per minute.",
    "The machine fills 150 cans in 8 minutes.",
    "To find the rate, I will divide the number of cans by the number of minutes: 150 cans / 8 minutes.",
    "Performing the division, 150 / 8 = 18.75.",
    "So, the machine fills 18.75 cans per minute.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many minutes it will take to fill 675 cans.",
    "I will divide the total number of cans needed (675) by the rate of cans per minute (18.75).",
    "Performing the division, 675 / 18.75 = 36."
  ],
  "solution": "36"
