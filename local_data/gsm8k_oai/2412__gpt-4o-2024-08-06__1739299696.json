  "query": "Mike is 16 years old. His sister Barbara is half as old as he is. How old is Barbara going to be when Mike is 24 years old?",
  "steps": [
    "Mike is currently 16 years old.",
    "Barbara is half as old as Mike is.",
    "To calculate Barbara's current age, I take half of Mike's age: 16 divided by 2 equals 8.",
    "So, Barbara is currently 8 years old.",
    "I need to find out how old Barbara will be when Mike turns 24.",
    "First, I calculate how many years it will be until Mike is 24 years old. Mike is currently 16, so 24 minus 16 equals 8 years from now.",
    "Barbara will also age by 8 years during this period.",
    "Barbara is currently 8 years old, so I add 8 years to her current age: 8 plus 8 equals 16."

  "solution": "16"
