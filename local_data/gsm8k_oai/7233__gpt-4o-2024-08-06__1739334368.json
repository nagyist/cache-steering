  "query": "Martha has 19 butterflies in her collection. She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies. The rest of her butterflies are black. If Martha has 6 blue butterflies, how many black butterflies does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "Martha has 19 butterflies in total.",
    "She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies.",
    "It is given that she has 6 blue butterflies.",
    "Since blue butterflies are twice as many as yellow butterflies, the number of yellow butterflies is half of the number of blue butterflies.",
    "Therefore, the number of yellow butterflies is 6 / 2 = 3.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many black butterflies she has.",
    "The total number of blue and yellow butterflies is 6 (blue) + 3 (yellow) = 9.",
    "Martha's total number of butterflies is 19, consisting of blue, yellow, and black butterflies.",
    "The number of black butterflies is the total number of butterflies minus the number of blue and yellow butterflies.",
    "Therefore, the number of black butterflies is 19 - 9 = 10."
