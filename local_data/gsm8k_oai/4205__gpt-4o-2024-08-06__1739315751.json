  "query": "While at the lake, Cohen saw 300 fish-eater birds that had migrated into the area recently walking by the lake, eating the fish they had caught. The number of birds at the lake doubled on the second day and reduced by 200 on the third day. How many fish-eater birds did Cohen see in the three days?",
  "steps": [
    "Cohen initially saw 300 fish-eater birds on the first day.",
    "On the second day, the number of birds doubled. So, 300 birds doubled is 300 * 2.",
    "After calculation, 300 * 2 equals 600 birds on the second day.",
    "On the third day, the number of birds reduced by 200. So, 600 - 200 gives the number of birds on the third day.",
    "600 - 200 equals 400 birds on the third day.",
    "To find the total number of birds Cohen saw over the three days, I need to add the numbers from each day: 300 + 600 + 400.",
    "300 + 600 equals 900.",
    "900 + 400 equals 1300."

  "solution": "1300"
