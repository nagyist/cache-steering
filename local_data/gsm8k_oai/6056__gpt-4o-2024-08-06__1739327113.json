  "query": "Paul, Amoura, and Ingrid were to go to a friend's party planned to start at 8:00 a.m. Paul arrived at 8:25. Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul, and Ingrid was three times later than Amoura. How late, in minutes, was Ingrid to the party?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul arrived at the party 25 minutes after it started since the party began at 8:00 a.m. and Paul got there at 8:25 a.m.",
    "Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul. So she was 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes late to the party.",
    "Ingrid was three times later than Amoura. Since Amoura was 55 minutes late, Ingrid was 3 times 55 minutes late.",
    "To calculate 3 times 55 minutes, I multiply 3 by 55: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165."
