    "First, I need to find out how many soccer balls are without holes.",
    "Matthias has 40 soccer balls in total.",
    "Out of these, 30 soccer balls have a hole in them.",
    "To find the number of soccer balls without holes, I subtract the soccer balls with holes from the total number of soccer balls.",
    "40 - 30 = 10 soccer balls are without holes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many basketballs are without holes.",
    "Matthias has 15 basketballs in total.",
    "Out of these, 7 basketballs have a hole in them.",
    "To find the number of basketballs without holes, I subtract the basketballs with holes from the total number of basketballs.",
    "15 - 7 = 8 basketballs are without holes.",
    "Now, I add the soccer balls and basketballs without holes to find the total number of balls without holes.",
    "10 soccer balls without holes + 8 basketballs without holes = 18 balls without holes."
