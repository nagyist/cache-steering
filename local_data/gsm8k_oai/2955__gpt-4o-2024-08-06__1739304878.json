  "query": "Mo is buying valentine's day cards for the class. There are 30 students and he wants to give a Valentine to 60% of them. They cost $2 each. If he has $40, what percentage of his money will he spend on Valentine?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students Mo wants to give Valentine's Day cards to.",
    "There are 30 students in the class.",
    "Mo wants to give a Valentine to 60% of the students.",
    "To find out how many students that is, I calculate 60% of 30.",
    "60% of 30 is calculated as \\( \\frac{60}{100} \\times 30 = 18 \\).",
    "Mo wants to give a Valentine to 18 students.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money Mo will spend on the Valentine's Day cards.",
    "Each card costs $2.",
    "If Mo gives a card to 18 students, then he needs to buy 18 cards.",
    "The total cost for 18 cards is \\( 18 \\times 2 = 36 \\) dollars.",
    "Mo has $40.",
    "To find what percentage of his money he will spend, I need to calculate \\( \\frac{36}{40} \\times 100 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{36}{40} \\times 100 = 90 \\).",
    "Mo will spend 90% of his money on the Valentine's Day cards."
