  "query": "Robbie weighs 100 pounds. Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie, but she has since lost 235 pounds by working out. How many more pounds does Patty weigh than Robbie now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that I need to initially find out how much Patty weighed before her weight loss.",
    "Patty was 4.5 times as heavy as Robbie. Robbie's weight is 100 pounds.",
    "To find Patty's initial weight, I multiply Robbie's weight by 4.5.",
    "100 pounds * 4.5 = 450 pounds. So Patty initially weighed 450 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much Patty weighs after losing 235 pounds.",
    "I subtract the weight Patty lost (235 pounds) from her initial weight (450 pounds).",
    "450 pounds - 235 pounds = 215 pounds. So Patty now weighs 215 pounds.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many more pounds Patty weighs than Robbie now.",
    "Patty now weighs 215 pounds and Robbie weighs 100 pounds.",
    "I subtract Robbie's weight from Patty's current weight to find the difference.",
    "215 pounds - 100 pounds = 115 pounds."

  "solution": "115"
