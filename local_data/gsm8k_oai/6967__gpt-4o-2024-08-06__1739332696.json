  "query": "Anika has 4 more than twice the number of pencils as Reeta. If Reeta has 20 pencils, how many pencils do the two have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of pencils Reeta has. Given, Reeta has 20 pencils.",
    "Next, I need to express how many pencils Anika has. The problem states that Anika has 4 more than twice the number of pencils Reeta has.",
    "To find twice the number of pencils Reeta has, I multiply 20 (Reeta's pencils) by 2.",
    "2 times 20 equals 40. So, twice the number of pencils Reeta has is 40.",
    "Anika has 4 more than this amount. So I add 4 to 40.",
    "40 plus 4 equals 44. Therefore, Anika has 44 pencils.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pencils both Anika and Reeta have together.",
    "I add the number of pencils Anika has, which is 44, to the number of pencils Reeta has, which is 20.",
    "44 plus 20 equals 64."

  "solution": "64"
