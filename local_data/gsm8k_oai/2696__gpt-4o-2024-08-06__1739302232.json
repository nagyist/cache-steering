  "query": "Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?",
  "steps": [
    "Candice read 18 books. This is 3 times the number of books that Amanda read.",
    "To find the number of books Amanda read, I need to divide the number of books Candice read by 3.",
    "18 divided by 3 equals 6. So Amanda read 6 books.",
    "Kara read half the number of books Amanda read.",
    "To find out how many books Kara read, I need to divide the number of books Amanda read by 2.",
    "6 divided by 2 equals 3. So Kara read 3 books.",
    "Patricia read 7 times the number of books Kara read.",
    "To find out how many books Patricia read, I need to multiply the number of books Kara read by 7.",
    "3 multiplied by 7 equals 21."
