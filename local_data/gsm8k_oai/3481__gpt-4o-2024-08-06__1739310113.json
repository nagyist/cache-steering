  "query": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?",
  "steps": [
    "Miriam currently has 30 marbles. Let's denote the number of marbles Miriam started with as \\( x \\).",
    "Miriam gave 60 marbles to her brother. So far, the number of marbles given is 60.",
    "Miriam gave twice that amount, 60, to her sister. So, she gave her sister \\( 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\) marbles.",
    "Next, I'll add the marbles given to her brother and her sister: \\( 60 + 120 = 180 \\) marbles given to both.",
    "She gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, which is 30 marbles. So, to Savanna, she gave \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\) marbles.",
    "Adding all the marbles given away: \\( 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 \\) marbles total.",
    "Miriam currently has 30 marbles left.",
    "Since she has given away a total of 270 marbles and has 30 left, the total number of marbles she originally had is the sum of these: \\( 270 + 30 = 300 \\)."

  "solution": "300"
