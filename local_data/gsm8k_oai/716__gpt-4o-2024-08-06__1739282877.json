  "query": "Lance has 70 cents, Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar, Guy has two quarters and a dime, and Bill has six dimes. How many cents do they have combined?",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by determining how much money each person has in cents.",
    "Lance has 70 cents.",
    "Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. One dollar is 100 cents, so three-fourths of a dollar is 0.75 times 100, which equals 75 cents.",
    "Guy has two quarters and a dime. One quarter is 25 cents, so two quarters are 2 times 25, which equals 50 cents. A dime is 10 cents, so 50 cents plus 10 cents equals 60 cents.",
    "Bill has six dimes. Each dime is 10 cents, so six dimes are 6 times 10, which is 60 cents.",
    "Next, I sum up all the cents each person has to find the combined total amount in cents.",
    "Lance's 70 cents, Margaret's 75 cents, Guy's 60 cents, and Bill's 60 cents added together equals 70 + 75 + 60 + 60.",
    "I calculate 70 + 75 first, which is 145.",
    "Then, I add 60 to 145, resulting in 205.",
    "Lastly, I add the remaining 60 to 205.",
    "205 + 60 equals 265."

  "solution": "265"
