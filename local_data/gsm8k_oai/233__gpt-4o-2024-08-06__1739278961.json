  "query": "Bryan starts exercising at home during quarantine. To start, he decides to do 3 sets of 15 push-ups each. Near the end of the third set, he gets tired and does 5 fewer push-ups. How many push-ups did he do in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Bryan plans to do 3 sets of push-ups.",
    "Each set is supposed to have 15 push-ups.",
    "I will calculate the total number of push-ups he would do if he completed all the sets as planned.",
    "3 sets \u00d7 15 push-ups per set = 45 push-ups.",
    "However, Bryan did 5 fewer push-ups in the third set.",
    "5 fewer push-ups in the third set means he did 15 - 5 = 10 push-ups in the third set.",
    "To find the total, I add up all the push-ups he did across the sets.",
    "He completed 15 push-ups in the first set.",
    "He completed 15 push-ups in the second set.",
    "He completed 10 push-ups in the third set.",
    "Adding up, the total is: 15 + 15 + 10.",
    "15 + 15 = 30.",
    "30 + 10 = 40."
