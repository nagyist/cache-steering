  "query": "A wood stove burns 4 bundles of wood in the morning, then some more in the afternoon. If there were 10 bundles of wood at the start of the day and 3 bundles of wood at the end of the day, how many bundles of wood were burned in the afternoon?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total amount of wood available at the start of the day: 10 bundles.",
    "Next, calculate how many bundles remain at the end of the day: 3 bundles.",
    "Determine how many bundles were burned throughout the whole day by subtracting the remaining bundles from the initial bundles: 10 - 3.",
    "That means 7 bundles were burned throughout the whole day.",
    "It is given that 4 bundles of wood were burned in the morning.",
    "To find out how many bundles were burned in the afternoon, subtract the bundles burned in the morning from the total bundles burned throughout the day: 7 - 4.",
    "This calculation shows that 3 bundles were burned in the afternoon."

  "solution": "3"
