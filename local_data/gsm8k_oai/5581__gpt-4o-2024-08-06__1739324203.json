  "query": "There are 40 students in the 6th  grade.  25% of them wear glasses and 40% of them wear contact lenses.  How many students do not wear any vision assistance wear?",
  "steps": [
    "I know there are 40 students in total in the 6th grade.",
    "I also know that 25% of these students wear glasses.",
    "To find out how many students wear glasses, I multiply 40 students by 25% (or 0.25).",
    "40 * 0.25 equals 10 students who wear glasses.",
    "Next, I know that 40% of the students wear contact lenses.",
    "To find out how many students wear contact lenses, I multiply 40 students by 40% (or 0.4).",
    "40 * 0.4 equals 16 students who wear contact lenses.",
    "Some students might wear both glasses and contact lenses, which means I need to consider intersection effects.",
    "I need to find the number of students who wear either glasses or contacts or both.",
    "Since some details are not given, like how many students wear both, I can try another approach.",
    "I will list out all who wear any form of vision assistance and subtract from total.",
    "The students who only wear glasses or contact lenses can be found using an assumption that intersection is 0.",
    "If no one wears both, 10 students wear glasses, and 16 students wear contact lenses.",
    "10 + 16 is 26 students using vision correction.",
    "I subtract students wearing vision correction from the total number of students: 40 - 26.",
    "40 \u2212 26 equals 14 students who do not wear any vision assistance wear."
