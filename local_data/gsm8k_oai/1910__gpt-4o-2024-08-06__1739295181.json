  "query": "Johnson owns a hectare cornfield that can yield 80 corn every two months, while his neighbor owns a two-hectare cornfield and each hectare can yield twice the amount as Johnson. How much corn can they harvest altogether after six months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the yield for Johnson's cornfield. Johnson has a one-hectare cornfield.",
    "Johnson's cornfield yields 80 corn every two months.",
    "I need to find out how much corn Johnson's field yields in six months.",
    "Since there are three sets of two-month periods in six months (6 months / 2 months = 3 periods), Johnson's yield will be 80 corn x 3 periods.",
    "Calculating Johnson's total yield in six months: 80 x 3 = 240 corn.",
    "Next, I need to determine the yield for the neighbor's cornfield. The neighbor has a two-hectare cornfield.",
    "Each hectare of the neighbor's cornfield can yield twice the amount as Johnson's one-hectare field.",
    "Since Johnson's field yields 80 corn every two months, each hectare of the neighbor's field yields 80 x 2 = 160 corn every two months.",
    "The neighbor has two hectares, so I need to calculate the yield for both hectares in two months.",
    "The total two-month yield for the neighbor is 160 corn per hectare x 2 hectares = 320 corn.",
    "Now, I need the neighbor's corn yield over six months, which includes three two-month periods.",
    "Calculating the neighbor's total yield in six months: 320 x 3 = 960 corn.",
    "Finally, to find out how much corn both Johnson and his neighbor can harvest together, I add Johnson's and the neighbor's yields.",
    "Total corn harvested by both: 240 corn (Johnson) + 960 corn (Neighbor) = 1200 corn."
