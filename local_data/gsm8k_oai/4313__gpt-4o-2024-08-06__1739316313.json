  "query": "Bob enters cycling competitions every single week and hopes to win the 100 dollar grand prize each time. For the first 2 weeks, he managed first place and got 100 dollars each week. He is saving up for a puppy that costs 1000 dollars. What is the minimum number of additional weeks Bob must win first place?",
  "steps": [
    "Bob has already won first place in the first 2 weeks.",
    "For each of these weeks, he received 100 dollars.",
    "So, for the first 2 weeks, he earned 2 * 100 dollars = 200 dollars in total.",
    "Bob is trying to save 1000 dollars to buy a puppy.",
    "Currently, he has 200 dollars.",
    "He needs an additional 1000 dollars - 200 dollars = 800 dollars.",
    "Each week he wins, he gets an additional 100 dollars.",
    "To find out the minimum number of additional weeks he needs to win, I'll divide the additional amount needed by the prize per win: 800 dollars / 100 dollars per week = 8 weeks."
