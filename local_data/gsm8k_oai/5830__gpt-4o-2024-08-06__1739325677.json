  "query": "Hansel has a created album on Spotify that contains 25 songs and each song is 3 minutes long. If she adds 10 more songs to the album with the same duration, how many minutes will it take her to finish all the songs in the album?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of songs Hansel has in the album initially.",
    "Hansel starts with 25 songs.",
    "Hansel adds 10 more songs.",
    "To find the new total number of songs, I add 25 and 10.",
    "So, 25 + 10 = 35 songs.",
    "Next, I need to find the duration of each song since songs are 3 minutes long.",
    "To find the total time required for all songs, I need to multiply the number of songs by the duration of each song.",
    "Therefore, I calculate 35 songs \u00d7 3 minutes per song.",
    "35 \u00d7 3 = 105 minutes."

  "solution": "105"
