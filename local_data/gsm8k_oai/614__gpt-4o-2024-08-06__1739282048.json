  "query": "Maisie and Donna dropped off flyers for a neighborhood clean-up day at houses around their neighborhood. Maisie walked down the shorter left street and dropped off 33 flyers. Donna took the long right street on her bicycle and dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie. How many flyers did Donna drop off?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flyers Maisie dropped off. According to the question, Maisie dropped off 33 flyers.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many flyers Donna dropped off. The question states that Donna dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie.",
    "To find twice as many flyers as Maisie dropped off, I need to multiply the number of flyers Maisie dropped off by 2. That's 33 times 2.",
    "33 times 2 equals 66.",
    "Donna dropped off five more than this amount, so I need to add 5 to 66.",
    "66 plus 5 equals 71."
  ],
  "solution": "71"
