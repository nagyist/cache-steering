  "query": "Carter grew 9 plants with 3 seed packets. How many more seed packets does Carter need to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard?",
  "steps": [
    "Carter started with 3 seed packets.",
    "From these 3 seed packets, he grew 9 plants.",
    "To find out how many plants Carter can grow with each seed packet, I divide the total number of plants by the total number of seed packets.",
    "So, 9 plants \u00f7 3 seed packets = 3 plants per seed packet.",
    "Carter wants to have a total of 12 plants.",
    "He currently has 9 plants, so I need to determine how many more plants he needs.",
    "12 plants - 9 plants = 3 more plants needed.",
    "Since each seed packet grows 3 plants, I need to figure out how many seed packets are needed for 3 additional plants.",
    "3 more plants \u00f7 3 plants per seed packet = 1 more seed packet."
