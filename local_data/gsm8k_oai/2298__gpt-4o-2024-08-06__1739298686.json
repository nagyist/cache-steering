  "steps": [
    "Eunice has 10 eggplant seeds in total.",
    "She has 4 pots to plant the seeds in.",
    "Each pot can contain 3 seeds.",
    "If she plants 3 seeds in each of the 4 pots, that would be 3 seeds x 4 pots = 12 seeds required.",
    "However, she only has 10 seeds available.",
    "If she plants 3 seeds in the first 3 pots, that would be 3 pots x 3 seeds = 9 seeds used.",
    "This leaves her with 10 - 9 = 1 seed left for the fourth pot."
