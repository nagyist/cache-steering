  "query": "Kaylee needs to sell 33 boxes of biscuits. So far, she has sold 12 boxes of lemon biscuits to her aunt, 5 boxes of chocolate biscuits to her mother, and 4 boxes of oatmeal biscuits to a neighbor. How many more boxes of biscuits does Kaylee need to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many boxes Kaylee has sold in total so far.",
    "Kaylee sold 12 boxes of lemon biscuits.",
    "Kaylee also sold 5 boxes of chocolate biscuits.",
    "Additionally, Kaylee sold 4 boxes of oatmeal biscuits.",
    "To find the total number of boxes sold, I will add these amounts together: 12 + 5 + 4.",
    "12 + 5 = 17.",
    "17 + 4 = 21.",
    "Kaylee has sold a total of 21 boxes so far.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many more boxes Kaylee needs to sell to reach her goal of 33 boxes.",
    "To find this, I will subtract the number of boxes already sold from the target number: 33 - 21.",
    "33 - 21 = 12.",
    "Therefore, Kaylee needs to sell 12 more boxes of biscuits."
