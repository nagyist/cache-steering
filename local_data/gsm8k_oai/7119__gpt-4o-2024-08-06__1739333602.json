  "query": "Jerry was asked by her mom to do grocery shopping. He needs to buy 2 liters of mustard oil that costs $13 per liter, 3 pounds of gluten-free penne pasta that costs $4 per pound, and 1  pound of pasta sauce that costs $5. If Jerry can keep the rest of the $50 after grocery shopping, how much money will he have?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total cost of the mustard oil first.",
    "Mustard oil costs $13 per liter and Jerry needs 2 liters.",
    "2 liters of mustard oil will cost 2 * $13 = $26.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the gluten-free penne pasta.",
    "The cost of gluten-free penne pasta is $4 per pound, and Jerry needs 3 pounds.",
    "3 pounds of pasta will cost 3 * $4 = $12.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the pasta sauce.",
    "The pasta sauce costs $5 for 1 pound, and Jerry needs 1 pound.",
    "1 pound of pasta sauce will cost $5.",
    "Now, I need to sum up all these costs to find the total grocery bill.",
    "The total cost is $26 (mustard oil) + $12 (penne pasta) + $5 (pasta sauce).",
    "Summing these gives $26 + $12 + $5 = $43.",
    "Jerry has $50 to begin with.",
    "Subtract the total grocery cost from his initial amount to see how much money he will have left.",
    "$50 - $43 = $7."

  "solution": "7"
