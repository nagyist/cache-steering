  "query": "40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age. If Sierra is currently 30 years old, how old will Diaz be 20 years from now?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by expressing the information we have in an equation.",
    "The problem states: 40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age.",
    "Let's use variables: Let D be Diaz's age and S be Sierra's age.",
    "According to the problem, S is 30, because Sierra is currently 30 years old.",
    "The equation for the problem statement is: 10D - 40 = 10S + 20.",
    "Substitute the known value of S (S = 30) into the equation.",
    "This gives us: 10D - 40 = 10(30) + 20.",
    "Calculate 10 times 30, which is 300.",
    "Substitute to get: 10D - 40 = 300 + 20.",
    "Simplify the right side: 300 + 20 is 320.",
    "This simplifies the equation to: 10D - 40 = 320.",
    "To isolate 10D, add 40 to both sides: 10D = 320 + 40.",
    "This leads to 10D = 360.",
    "Now, divide both sides by 10 to solve for D: D = 360 / 10.",
    "So, D = 36, which means Diaz's current age is 36 years.",
    "The question asks for Diaz's age 20 years from now.",
    "So I add 20 years to Diaz's current age: 36 + 20.",
    "Calculating this gives us 56."
