  "query": "Matt spends 80 minutes washing the outside of his car and 1/4 that amount of time cleaning the inside. How long does he spend cleaning his car total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Matt spends 80 minutes washing the outside of his car.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time spent cleaning the inside of the car.",
    "The problem states he spends 1/4 of the time spent on the outside cleaning the inside.",
    "1/4 of 80 minutes is 80 / 4.",
    "80 divided by 4 is 20.",
    "He spends 20 minutes cleaning the inside of the car.",
    "To find the total time spent cleaning the car, I need to add the time spent on the outside and the time spent on the inside.",
    "80 minutes (outside) + 20 minutes (inside) = 100 minutes."
