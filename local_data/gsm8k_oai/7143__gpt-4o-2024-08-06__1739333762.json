  "query": "Angus has $20 worth of tokens less than Elsa has. If Elsa has 60 tokens and each token is worth $4, how many tokens does Angus have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Elsa's tokens are worth.",
    "Elsa has 60 tokens, and each token is worth $4.",
    "To find the total value of Elsa's tokens, I multiply the number of tokens by the value per token: 60 tokens * $4 = $240.",
    "Angus has $20 worth of tokens less than Elsa.",
    "So, to find the total value of Angus's tokens, I subtract $20 from Elsa's total: $240 - $20 = $220.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many tokens Angus has.",
    "Each of Angus's tokens is also worth $4.",
    "To find the number of tokens Angus has, I divide the total value of his tokens by the value per token: $220 / $4 = 55."
