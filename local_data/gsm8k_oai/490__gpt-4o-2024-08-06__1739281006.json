  "query": "The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?",
  "steps": [
    "The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.",
    "We know the perimeter is 160 cm.",
    "Two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm.",
    "Let the length of the third side be x cm.",
    "The sum of all sides is the perimeter, so we have the equation: 40 + 50 + x = 160.",
    "First, add the lengths of the two known sides: 40 + 50 = 90.",
    "Now, replace the sum of the two sides in the equation: 90 + x = 160.",
    "To find x, subtract 90 from both sides of the equation: x = 160 - 90.",
    "Calculate 160 - 90 to find the value of x.",
    "160 - 90 equals 70.",
    "Therefore, the length of the third side is 70 cm."
