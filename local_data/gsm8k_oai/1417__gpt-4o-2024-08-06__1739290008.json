  "steps": [
    "I am given that the sum of Mario and Maria's ages is 7.",
    "I am also told that Mario is 1 year older than Maria.",
    "To find their ages, I can set up equations. Let Maria's age be x.",
    "Then Mario's age would be x + 1, since he is 1 year older than Maria.",
    "The sum of their ages is 7. So, I can set up the equation: x + (x + 1) = 7.",
    "Simplifying the equation, I have 2x + 1 = 7.",
    "Subtract 1 from both sides to get: 2x = 6.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find x: x = 3.",
    "This means Maria is 3 years old.",
    "Since Mario is 1 year older than Maria, Mario is 3 + 1 = 4 years old."
