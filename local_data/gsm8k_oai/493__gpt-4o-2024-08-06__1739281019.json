  "query": "Hally and her friends organized a high school reunion. To cover the cost of a late-night party that they planned for at the reunion, each attendee had to pay $100. After the party, Hally and her friends realized that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. If there were 50 people at the party, how much money was used to pay for the party expenses?",
  "steps": [
    "The amount each attendee had to pay was $100.",
    "There were 50 people at the party.",
    "To find the total contributions, I need to multiply the number of people by the amount each paid.",
    "The total contributions would be 50 people * $100 per person = $5000.",
    "After the party, the expenses were $500 less than the total contributions.",
    "So, the expenses were $5000 - $500.",
    "Calculate this: $5000 - $500 = $4500."

  "solution": "4500"
