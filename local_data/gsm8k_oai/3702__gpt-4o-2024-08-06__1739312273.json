  "query": "Janet is considering two options to retile her bathroom. The turquoise tiles cost $13/tile and the purple tiles cost $11/tile. If Janet needs to tile two walls that measure 5 feet by 8 feet and 7 feet by 8 feet, and each square foot of wall takes 4 tiles, how much will Janet save by buying the purple tiles instead of the turquoise ones?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total square footage of both walls.",
    "The first wall is 5 feet by 8 feet, which equals 40 square feet.",
    "The second wall is 7 feet by 8 feet, which equals 56 square feet.",
    "Now, I add the area of both walls: 40 square feet + 56 square feet = 96 square feet.",
    "Each square foot requires 4 tiles, so I multiply 96 square feet by 4 tiles per square foot.",
    "96 square feet * 4 tiles per square foot = 384 tiles needed.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost of using turquoise tiles. Each turquoise tile costs $13.",
    "384 tiles * $13 per tile = $4,992 for turquoise tiles.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost of using purple tiles. Each purple tile costs $11.",
    "384 tiles * $11 per tile = $4,224 for purple tiles.",
    "To find the savings, subtract the cost of the purple tiles from the cost of the turquoise tiles.",
    "$4,992 - $4,224 = $768 savings."
  ],
  "solution": "768"
