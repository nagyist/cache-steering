  "query": "James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine which pages are crumpled.",
    "Pages are crumpled on every seventh page.",
    "The sequence of crumpled pages is 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42.",
    "Next, I need to determine which pages are blurred.",
    "Pages are blurred on every third page.",
    "The sequence of blurred pages is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42.",
    "Now, I need to find out which pages are both crumpled and blurred.",
    "A page is both crumpled and blurred if it is a common multiple of 3 and 7, which is the least common multiple (LCM).",
    "The LCM of 3 and 7 is 21.",
    "The sequence of pages that are both crumpled and blurred is 21 and 42.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of crumpled pages.",
    "There are 6 crumpled pages: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of blurred pages.",
    "There are 14 blurred pages: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42.",
    "Next, I determine the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred.",
    "Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, I add the crumpled and blurred pages and subtract those that are double-counted.",
    "6 (crumpled) + 14 (blurred) - 2 (both) = 18 pages.",
    "Finally, I need to subtract the number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred from the total number of pages.",
    "42 (total pages) - 18 (crumpled or blurred pages) = 24 pages."
