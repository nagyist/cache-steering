  "query": "On a normal day, Julia can run a mile in 10 minutes. However, today she decided to wear her new shoes to run. They were uncomfortable and slowed her mile down to 13 minutes. How much longer would it take Julia to run 5 miles in her new shoes than if she wore her old ones?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes Julia to run 5 miles on a normal day with her old shoes.",
    "She runs 1 mile in 10 minutes with her old shoes.",
    "So, in her old shoes, running 5 miles would take her 5 times 10 minutes.",
    "5 times 10 is 50. Therefore, it takes her 50 minutes to run 5 miles in her old shoes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how long it takes Julia to run 5 miles with her uncomfortable new shoes.",
    "With the new shoes, she runs 1 mile in 13 minutes.",
    "So, in her new shoes, running 5 miles would take her 5 times 13 minutes.",
    "5 times 13 is 65. Therefore, it takes her 65 minutes to run 5 miles in her new shoes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much longer it takes her with the new shoes compared to the old shoes for 5 miles.",
    "I subtract the time it takes with the old shoes from the time it takes with the new shoes: 65 minutes minus 50 minutes.",
    "65 minus 50 is 15."

  "solution": "15"
