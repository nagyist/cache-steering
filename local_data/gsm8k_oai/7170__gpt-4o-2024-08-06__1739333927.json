  "query": "Monica read 16 books last year. This year, she read twice the number of books she read last year. Next year, she wants to read 5 more than twice the number of books she read this year. How many books will Monica read next year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many books Monica read this year.",
    "I know that this year, Monica read twice the number of books she read last year.",
    "Last year, she read 16 books.",
    "Twice the number of books from last year is 16 * 2.",
    "16 * 2 = 32 books.",
    "So, this year Monica read 32 books.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many books Monica wants to read next year.",
    "Next year, she wants to read 5 more than twice the number of books she read this year.",
    "Twice the number of books she read this year is 32 * 2.",
    "32 * 2 = 64 books.",
    "She wants to read 5 more than that, so I need to add 5 to 64.",
    "64 + 5 = 69 books."

  "solution": "69"
