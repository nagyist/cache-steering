  "query": "Tom and Tim both brought 4, six-sided dice to school. How many total sides are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom brought 4 dice to school.",
    "Each die has 6 sides.",
    "To find out how many sides Tom's dice have in total, I need to multiply the number of dice by the number of sides per die.",
    "4 dice * 6 sides = 24 sides.",
    "Tom's dice have a total of 24 sides.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of sides for Tim's dice.",
    "Tim also brought 4 dice to school.",
    "Each of Tim's dice also has 6 sides.",
    "Multiplying the number of dice by the number of sides gives me 4 dice * 6 sides = 24 sides.",
    "Tim's dice have a total of 24 sides as well.",
    "To find the total number of sides from both Tom's and Tim's dice, I add the sides from both sets of dice.",
    "24 sides (Tom) + 24 sides (Tim) = 48 sides."

  "solution": "48"
