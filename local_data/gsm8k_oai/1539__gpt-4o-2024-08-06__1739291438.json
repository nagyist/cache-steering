  "query": "Chris is trying to sell his car for $5200 and has gotten two price offers. One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris\u2019s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of the car maintenance inspection.",
    "The maintenance inspection costs a tenth of Chris\u2019s asking price of $5200.",
    "A tenth of $5200 is calculated as $5200 / 10.",
    "$5200 divided by 10 equals $520.",
    "Now, let's calculate how much Chris would earn from the first buyer.",
    "The first buyer offers to pay the full price of $5200, but Chris has to pay $520 for the inspection.",
    "From this offer, Chris earns $5200 - $520.",
    "$5200 minus $520 equals $4680.",
    "Now, I will calculate the costs Chris has to pay in the second offer.",
    "The second buyer requires Chris to replace the headlights for $80.",
    "The second buyer also requires Chris to replace the tires for three times the cost of the headlights.",
    "Three times the $80 for the headlights is 3 * $80.",
    "3 times $80 equals $240.",
    "The total cost for the second offer is the sum of the costs for the headlights and the tires.",
    "The total cost is $80 + $240.",
    "$80 plus $240 equals $320.",
    "Now, let's calculate how much Chris would earn from the second buyer.",
    "The second buyer offers to pay the full price of $5200, but Chris has to pay $320 for the replacements.",
    "From this offer, Chris earns $5200 - $320.",
    "$5200 minus $320 equals $4880.",
    "Finally, I need to find the difference between the amounts Chris would earn from the two offers.",
    "The difference is $4880 - $4680.",
    "$4880 minus $4680 equals $200."
