  "query": "In five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe. If Rehana is currently 25 years old, and Jacob, Rehana's brother, is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age, how old is Jacob now?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Rehana's current age is 25 years.",
    "I need to find Rehana's age in five years.",
    "In five years, Rehana will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old.",
    "The problem states that in five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe.",
    "If Rehana will be 30 years old in five years, and that will be three times Phoebe's age at that time, then Phoebe's age in five years will be 30 / 3 = 10 years.",
    "I need to find Phoebe's current age.",
    "Since five years from now Phoebe will be 10 years old, Phoebe's current age must be 10 - 5 = 5 years.",
    "I know that Jacob is currently 3/5 of Phoebe's current age.",
    "Phoebe's current age is 5 years, so Jacob's current age is (3/5) * 5 = 3 years."
