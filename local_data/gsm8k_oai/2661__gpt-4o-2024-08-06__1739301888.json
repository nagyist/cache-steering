  "query": "The price of a monster box of cereal is reduced by $24 after an oversupply in the market. If the initial price was $104, and Romina bought 20 of such boxes, calculate the total price she paid.",
  "steps": [
    "The initial price of one monster box of cereal was $104.",
    "The price reduction per box due to oversupply is $24.",
    "To find the reduced price of one box, subtract the reduction from the initial price: $104 - $24.",
    "$104 - $24 = $80. So, the reduced price per box is $80.",
    "Romina bought 20 boxes.",
    "To find the total price she paid, multiply the reduced price per box by the number of boxes: $80 * 20.",
    "$80 * 20 = $1600. So, the total price Romina paid is $1600."

  "solution": "1600"
