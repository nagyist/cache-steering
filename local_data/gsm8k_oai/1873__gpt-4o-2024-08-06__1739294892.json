    "Jeremy's current age is given as 40 years.",
    "Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy.",
    "Sebastian's current age is 40 + 4 = 44 years.",
    "We need to determine Sophia's current age, but we know the total age of all three in three years.",
    "In three years, Jeremy will be 40 + 3 = 43 years old.",
    "In three years, Sebastian will be 44 + 3 = 47 years old.",
    "The sum of their ages in three years will be 43 + 47 + Sophia's age in three years.",
    "The sum of their ages in three years is given as 150.",
    "Set up the equation: 43 + 47 + (Sophia's age in 3 years) = 150.",
    "Calculate the sum of Jeremy's and Sebastian's age in three years: 43 + 47 = 90.",
    "Now solve for Sophia's age in three years: 90 + (Sophia's age in 3 years) = 150.",
    "Subtract 90 from both sides to find Sophia's age in three years: Sophia's age in 3 years = 150 - 90.",
    "Sophia's age in three years = 60."
