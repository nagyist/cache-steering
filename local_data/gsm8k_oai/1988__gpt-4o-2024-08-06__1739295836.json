  "query": "Jackson and Brandon both invest $500 in the stock market. Jackson's investment quadruples in value, while Brandon's is reduced to 20% of the initial value. How much more money does Jackson have than Brandon now?",
  "steps": [
    "Jackson started with an investment of $500.",
    "Jackson's investment quadrupled in value.",
    "To find the new value of Jackson's investment, multiply the initial amount by 4.",
    "$500 multiplied by 4 equals $2000.",
    "Brandon also started with an investment of $500.",
    "Brandon's investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value.",
    "To find 20% of the initial investment, multiply $500 by 0.2.",
    "$500 multiplied by 0.2 equals $100.",
    "Now, compare the final values of Jackson's and Brandon's investments.",
    "Jackson's investment is worth $2000.",
    "Brandon's investment is worth $100.",
    "To find how much more money Jackson has than Brandon, subtract Brandon's amount from Jackson's amount.",
    "$2000 minus $100 equals $1900."
