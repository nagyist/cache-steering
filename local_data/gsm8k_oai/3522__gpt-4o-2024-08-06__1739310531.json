  "query": "Victory and Sam have saved money for their holiday spending. Victory saves $100 less than Sam. If Sam saves $1000, how much is the total money saved for holiday spending?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Victory saves.",
    "I know from the problem that Victory saves $100 less than Sam.",
    "Sam saves $1000.",
    "Therefore, Victory saves $1000 - $100.",
    "$1000 - $100 equals $900.",
    "So, Victory saves $900.",
    "Next, I need to find the total money saved for holiday spending by combining what both Victory and Sam have saved.",
    "Sam saves $1000 and Victory saves $900.",
    "To find the total, I need to add Sam\u2019s savings to Victory\u2019s savings.",
    "$1000 + $900 equals $1900."

  "solution": "1900"
