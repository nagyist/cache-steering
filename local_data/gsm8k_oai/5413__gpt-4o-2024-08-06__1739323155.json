  "query": "Ben wants to pick 56 sugar snap peas. At his current rate of picking, all will be picked in seven minutes. How long, in minutes, would it take Ben to pick 72 sugar snap peas?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that Ben can pick 56 sugar snap peas in 7 minutes.",
    "I need to find out how many peas Ben picks per minute.",
    "To do this, I'll divide the total number of peas (56) by the total time in minutes (7).",
    "56 peas / 7 minutes = 8 peas per minute.",
    "Now that I know Ben's picking rate is 8 peas per minute, I need to determine how long it will take him to pick 72 peas.",
    "I'll divide the total number of peas (72) by Ben's picking rate (8 peas per minute).",
    "72 peas / 8 peas per minute = 9 minutes.",
    "Therefore, it will take Ben 9 minutes to pick 72 sugar snap peas."
