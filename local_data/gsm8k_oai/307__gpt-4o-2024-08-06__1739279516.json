  "query": "There are 110 calories in a serving of cheese.  Rick buys the large blocks that have 16 servings per block.  If Rick has already eaten 5 servings of cheese, how many calories are remaining in the block?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of calories in the whole block of cheese.",
    "There are 110 calories per serving.",
    "The block contains 16 servings.",
    "To find the total calories in the block, I multiply 110 calories by 16 servings.",
    "110 calories/serving * 16 servings = 1760 calories.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many calories Rick has eaten from the block.",
    "Rick has eaten 5 servings.",
    "To find the calories Rick has eaten, I multiply 110 calories by 5 servings.",
    "110 calories/serving * 5 servings = 550 calories.",
    "Now, to find the remaining calories in the block, I subtract the calories Rick has eaten from the total calories of the block.",
    "1760 calories - 550 calories = 1210 calories."

  "solution": "1210"
