  "query": "The local aquarium has 4 dolphins that each require 3 hours of training daily. The aquarium has 2 trainers and they want to split the hours they spend training the dolphins equally. How many hours will each trainer spend training the dolphins?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of hours required for training the dolphins.",
    "There are 4 dolphins, and each requires 3 hours of training daily.",
    "I multiply the number of dolphins (4) by the hours each requires (3).",
    "4 dolphins * 3 hours each = 12 hours of training required in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how these 12 hours are split between the 2 trainers equally.",
    "I divide the total hours (12) by the number of trainers (2).",
    "12 hours / 2 trainers = 6 hours."
