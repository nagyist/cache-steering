  "query": "Patricia and Geoffrey went fishing to feed their group of campers. They caught an eight-pound trout, six two-pound bass, and two twelve-pound salmon. If each person will eat two pounds of fish, how many campers can they feed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total weight of the fish caught by Patricia and Geoffrey.",
    "They caught an eight-pound trout.",
    "They also caught six two-pound bass.",
    "The weight of the bass is 6 bass * 2 pounds/bass = 12 pounds.",
    "Additionally, they caught two twelve-pound salmon.",
    "The total weight of the salmon is 2 salmon * 12 pounds/salmon = 24 pounds.",
    "Now, I calculate the total weight of all the fish combined.",
    "Total weight = weight of trout + weight of bass + weight of salmon.",
    "Total weight = 8 pounds (trout) + 12 pounds (bass) + 24 pounds (salmon).",
    "Total weight = 8 + 12 + 24 = 44 pounds.",
    "Each camper will eat two pounds of fish.",
    "I need to determine how many campers can be fed with the 44 pounds of fish.",
    "The number of campers that can be fed is the total weight of fish divided by the weight each camper eats.",
    "Number of campers = Total weight / Weight per camper.",
    "Number of campers = 44 pounds / 2 pounds per camper.",
    "Number of campers = 22."
