  "query": "Dylan filled his glass with ice cubes before he poured his soda into it. He counted and there were 8 ice cubes in his glass. Later when he prepares a pitcher of lemonade he puts two times as many ice cubes in the pitcher. Then it is time to refill the ice cube trays which have 12 spaces each for ice cubes. How many trays does Dylan need to fill if he used exactly all the ice they had in them?",
  "steps": [
    "Dylan initially used 8 ice cubes for his glass.",
    "For the pitcher of lemonade, he used two times as many ice cubes as the glass.",
    "Two times 8 ice cubes is 16 ice cubes for the pitcher.",
    "Adding the 8 ice cubes for the glass and the 16 ice cubes for the pitcher gives a total of 24 ice cubes used.",
    "Each tray has 12 spaces for ice cubes.",
    "To find the number of trays that equals 24 ice cubes, I divide 24 ice cubes by 12 spaces per tray.",
    "24 divided by 12 is 2."

  "solution": "2"
