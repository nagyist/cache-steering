  "query": "Michelle loves sugar. She bought 14 chocolate bars, each of which had 10 grams of sugar. She also bought a giant lollipop, which had an additional 37 grams of sugar, plus 190 calories. How many grams of sugar were in all of the candy she bought?",
  "steps": [
    "Michelle bought 14 chocolate bars.",
    "Each chocolate bar contains 10 grams of sugar.",
    "To find the total sugar from the chocolate bars, I need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by the grams of sugar per bar.",
    "14 chocolate bars \u00d7 10 grams of sugar per bar = 140 grams of sugar.",
    "Michelle also bought a lollipop with 37 grams of sugar.",
    "Now I need to add the sugar from the lollipop to the sugar from the chocolate bars.",
    "140 grams of sugar (from chocolate bars) + 37 grams of sugar (from the lollipop) = 177 grams of sugar."
