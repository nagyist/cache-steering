  "steps": [
    "Jane has 10 chickens.",
    "Each chicken lays 6 eggs per week.",
    "I need to find out how many eggs are laid by 10 chickens in one week.",
    "10 chickens * 6 eggs per chicken = 60 eggs per week.",
    "Now I need to find out how many eggs are laid in 2 weeks.",
    "60 eggs per week * 2 weeks = 120 eggs.",
    "Eggs are sold for $2 per dozen. I need to find out how many dozens are in 120 eggs.",
    "120 eggs \u00f7 12 eggs per dozen = 10 dozen.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total money earned from selling 10 dozen eggs.",
    "10 dozen * $2 per dozen = $20."
