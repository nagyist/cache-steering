  "query": "The Tampa Bay Bucs have 13 football players and 16 cheerleaders. If 10 football players and 4 cheerleaders quit, how many football players and cheerleaders are left?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by considering the number of football players initially, which is 13.",
    "Then I note that 10 football players have quit.",
    "To find out how many football players are left, I subtract the number who quit from the initial number: 13 - 10.",
    "The calculation 13 - 10 equals 3. So, there are 3 football players left.",
    "Next, I consider the number of cheerleaders initially, which is 16.",
    "I note that 4 cheerleaders have quit.",
    "To find out how many cheerleaders are left, I subtract the number who quit from the initial number: 16 - 4.",
    "The calculation 16 - 4 equals 12. So, there are 12 cheerleaders left.",
    "To find the total number of people left, I add the number of remaining football players to the number of remaining cheerleaders: 3 + 12.",
    "The calculation 3 + 12 equals 15. This is the total number of football players and cheerleaders left."
