  "query": "It takes 15 mink skins to make a coat. Andy buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, but half the total minks are set free by activists. How many coats can he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of minks Andy initially has, including the babies.",
    "Andy buys 30 minks. Each mink has 6 babies, so there are 30 x 6 = 180 babies.",
    "Adding the adult minks, Andy initially has 30 adults + 180 babies = 210 minks.",
    "Next, I need to account for the minks set free by the activists. Half of the total minks are set free.",
    "Half of 210 is 210 / 2 = 105 minks set free.",
    "Subtracting the minks set free from the initial total, Andy now has 210 - 105 = 105 minks left.",
    "I need to calculate how many mink skins are required to make one coat. It takes 15 mink skins to make one coat.",
    "With 105 minks available, I'll calculate how many coats can be made. I need to divide the number of minks by the number required per coat: 105 minks / 15 mink skins per coat.",
    "105 \u00f7 15 = 7 coats."

  "solution": "7"
