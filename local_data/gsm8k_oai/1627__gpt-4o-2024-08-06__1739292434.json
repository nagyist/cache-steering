  "query": "Grace is filling her pool in the backyard with a hose that sprays 50 gallons/hour. She waited for 3 hours but the pool wasn't full, so she decides to add another hose that sprays 70 gallons/hour, and after 2 more hours the pool is full. How much water can Grace\u2019s pool contain?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much water the first hose added in 3 hours.",
    "The rate of the first hose is 50 gallons per hour.",
    "In 3 hours, the first hose would have added 50 gallons/hour * 3 hours = 150 gallons.",
    "Next, I consider the scenario when both hoses are used.",
    "The first hose continues to spray water at 50 gallons/hour.",
    "The second hose sprays water at 70 gallons/hour.",
    "Combined, the two hoses spray 50 gallons/hour + 70 gallons/hour = 120 gallons/hour.",
    "The combined rate of both hoses is 120 gallons/hour for 2 hours.",
    "In 2 hours, both hoses together would have added 120 gallons/hour * 2 hours = 240 gallons.",
    "Now, I add the water from the first phase to the water from the second phase.",
    "In total, Grace's pool takes 150 gallons + 240 gallons = 390 gallons."

  "solution": "390"
