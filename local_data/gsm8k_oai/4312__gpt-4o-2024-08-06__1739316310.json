  "query": "Sean needs to replace 2 light bulbs in his bedroom, 1 in both the bathroom and the kitchen and 4 in the basement.  He also needs to replace 1/2 of that amount in the garage.  The bulbs come 2 per pack.  How many packs will he need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of light bulbs Sean needs without considering the garage yet.",
    "Sean needs 2 light bulbs for the bedroom, 1 for the bathroom, 1 for the kitchen, and 4 for the basement.",
    "Calculating the sum of these: 2 (bedroom) + 1 (bathroom) + 1 (kitchen) + 4 (basement) = 8 light bulbs.",
    "Next, I need to calculate 1/2 of this amount for the garage.",
    "Half of 8 is 8 / 2 = 4 bulbs needed for the garage.",
    "Now, add the 4 bulbs needed for the garage to the initial 8 bulbs.",
    "8 + 4 = 12 total bulbs needed in all.",
    "The bulbs come 2 per pack, so I need to divide the total number of bulbs by 2 to find the number of packs needed.",
    "12 bulbs divided by 2 bulbs per pack equals 6 packs."

  "solution": "6"
