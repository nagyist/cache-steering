    "There are 9 years remaining after the first year.",
    "He will teach 50 students each year for those 9 years.",
    "Multiply 50 students by 9 years to find the total students taught in those years: 50 * 9 = 450.",
    "Add the 40 students from the first year to the 450 students from the remaining 9 years: 40 + 450 = 490."
