  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many seconds there are in 10 minutes.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "Therefore, in 10 minutes there are 10 x 60 seconds.",
    "10 x 60 = 600, so there are 600 seconds in 10 minutes.",
    "Matt skips ropes 3 times per second.",
    "To find the total number of skips, I need to multiply the number of seconds by the number of skips per second.",
    "600 seconds x 3 skips per second = 1800 skips."
