  "query": "There are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls. Each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party. If there are 40 boys at the party and each boy paid $50 to attend the party, calculate the total amount of money collected at the party.",
  "steps": [
    "I first need to determine the number of girls at the party. The problem says that there are four times as many boys as girls.",
    "If there are 40 boys, then the number of girls would be 40 divided by 4.",
    "Calculating this gives me 40 / 4 = 10 girls.",
    "Each boy paid $50, and there are 40 boys. I need to calculate the total amount paid by the boys.",
    "The total amount paid by the boys is 40 boys * $50 = $2000.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much each girl paid. The problem states that each boy paid twice the amount that each girl paid.",
    "So, if each boy paid $50, each girl must have paid $50 / 2 = $25.",
    "Now I calculate the total amount paid by the girls. There are 10 girls, each paying $25.",
    "The total amount paid by the girls is 10 girls * $25 = $250.",
    "Finally, I add the total amounts paid by the boys and the girls to find the total amount of money collected at the party.",
    "The grand total collected at the party is $2000 from the boys + $250 from the girls = $2250."

  "solution": "2250"
