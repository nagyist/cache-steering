  "query": "Vins rides his bike 6 miles to school. He rides home a different route that is 7 miles long. This week, Vins rode to school and back 5 times. How many miles did Vins ride his bike this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles Vins rides in one round trip of going to school and back.",
    "The distance to school is 6 miles.",
    "The distance of the different route home is 7 miles.",
    "The total distance for one round trip is 6 miles to school plus 7 miles home.",
    "6 miles + 7 miles = 13 miles per round trip.",
    "Now I need to find out how many round trips Vins completed in a week.",
    "According to the problem, Vins rode to school and back 5 times this week.",
    "Therefore, he completed 5 round trips.",
    "To find the total miles Vins rode in a week, I multiply the miles per round trip by the number of round trips.",
    "13 miles/trip * 5 trips = 65 miles."
