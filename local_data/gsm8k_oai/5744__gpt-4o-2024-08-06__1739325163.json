  "query": "Olivia and Nigel are traveling in Asia. \u00a0Olivia has $112 and Nigel has $139. If together they buy six one day passes to a tourist attraction for $28 per ticket, how much money do they have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine the total amount of money that Olivia and Nigel have together. Olivia has $112, and Nigel has $139.",
    "I add $112 and $139 to get the total amount of money they have.",
    "$112 + $139 = $251.",
    "Next, I need to find the total cost of six one day passes. Each pass costs $28.",
    "I multiply 6 by $28 to get the total cost of the passes.",
    "6 * $28 = $168.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money Olivia and Nigel have left after purchasing the passes. I subtract the total cost of the passes from their original total amount of money.",
    "$251 - $168 = $83.",
    "I have calculated the remaining amount of money they have after the purchase."

  "solution": "83"
