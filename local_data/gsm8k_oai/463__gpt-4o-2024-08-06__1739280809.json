  "query": "It takes 30 minutes to make pizza dough and another 30 minutes in the oven for the pizza to cook. If one batch of pizza dough can make 3 pizzas but the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, how many hours would it take for Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many batches of dough Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas.",
    "Since one batch makes 3 pizzas, Camilla needs 12 / 3 = 4 batches of dough.",
    "Next, I calculate how long it takes to prepare the dough for 4 batches.",
    "Each batch of dough takes 30 minutes, so 4 batches take 4 x 30 = 120 minutes to prepare.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total cooking time needed in the oven for 12 pizzas.",
    "The oven can fit 2 pizzas at a time and each batch consists of 3 pizzas. This means she needs 6 rounds since 12 / 2 = 6 to cook all 12 pizzas in the oven.",
    "Each round takes 30 minutes, so 6 rounds take 6 x 30 = 180 minutes.",
    "To find the total time needed to finish making 12 pizzas, I add the time to prepare the dough and the total cooking time.",
    "The total preparation time for the dough is 120 minutes and the total oven time is 180 minutes.",
    "Adding these up gives 120 + 180 = 300 minutes.",
    "To convert the total time from minutes to hours, I divide by 60.",
    "300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours."
