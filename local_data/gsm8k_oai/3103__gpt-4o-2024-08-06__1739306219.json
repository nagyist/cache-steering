  "query": "Taegan goes to a carnival where she wins tickets from each of the 5 carnival games and also finds 5 tickets on the floor. Each ticket is worth $3. In total, she has tickets that total a value of $30. If Taegan won an equal number of tickets from each of the games, how many tickets did she win from each game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of tickets Taegan has.",
    "I know that the value of each ticket is $3.",
    "The total value of all the tickets Taegan has is $30.",
    "To find the total number of tickets, I divide the total value by the value of each ticket: $30 \u00f7 $3.",
    "Calculating this gives me 10 tickets in total.",
    "I also know that Taegan found 5 tickets on the floor.",
    "These 5 tickets were not won in the games, so I subtract them from the total number of tickets.",
    "10 total tickets - 5 tickets found on the floor = 5 tickets won from the games.",
    "Taegan won tickets from 5 carnival games.",
    "Each game contributed an equal number of tickets to the 5 tickets won.",
    "To find out how many tickets were won per game, I divide the 5 tickets by the 5 games.",
    "5 tickets \u00f7 5 games = 1 ticket per game."
