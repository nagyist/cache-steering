  "query": "The average number of fruits per basket in five baskets is 25. If basket A contains 15 apples, B has 30 mangoes, C has 20 peaches, D has 25 pears and E has some bananas, how many bananas are in basket E?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that the average number of fruits per basket in five baskets is 25.",
    "To find the total number of fruits across all five baskets, we multiply the average number of fruits per basket (25) by the number of baskets (5).",
    "25 (average) x 5 (baskets) = 125 total fruits.",
    "Now, we need to determine how many fruits are already accounted for in baskets A, B, C, and D.",
    "Basket A has 15 apples. + Basket B has 30 mangoes. + Basket C has 20 peaches. + Basket D has 25 pears.",
    "15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90 fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D combined.",
    "To find out how many bananas are in basket E, we subtract the number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D from the total number of fruits across all baskets.",
    "125 total fruits - 90 fruits in A, B, C, and D = 35 bananas in basket E."
