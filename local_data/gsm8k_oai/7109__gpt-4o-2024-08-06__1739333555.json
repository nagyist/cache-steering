  "query": "Michelle had some leftover cans of silly string from her birthday party. She split them among Roger and 3 of his friends. Then Roger decided to give 2 of his cans to his brothers so that he now has 4 for himself. How many cans of silly string did Michelle have to start with?",
  "steps": [
    "Roger now has 4 cans after giving away 2, so initially he had 4 + 2 = 6 cans.",
    "Roger and his 3 friends together have 6 + 3 (friends each getting 6 cans) = 6 + 3*6 = 6 + 18 = 24 cans.",
    "So Michelle originally had 24 cans of silly string to split among Roger and his 3 friends."
  ],
  "solution": "24"
