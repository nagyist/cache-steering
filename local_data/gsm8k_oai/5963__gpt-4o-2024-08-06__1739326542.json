    "First, I will calculate the total cost of the sofa and the armchairs.",
    "The cost of the sofa is $1,250.",
    "The cost of the two armchairs is $425 each.",
    "So, the cost of the two armchairs is 2 \u00d7 $425 = $850.",
    "Now, I will add the cost of the sofa to the cost of the armchairs to find the total cost of these items.",
    "The total cost of the sofa and the armchairs is $1,250 + $850 = $2,100.",
    "The total amount of the invoice is $2,430, which includes the sofa, armchairs, and the coffee table.",
    "To find the price of the coffee table, I will subtract the total cost of the sofa and armchairs from the total invoice amount.",
