    "He already has $100.00 left over from last year to contribute towards this goal.",
    "To find out how much more he needs to save, I subtract the $100.00 he already has from his total goal of $1,000.00.",
    "$1,000.00 - $100.00 = $900.00",
    "Alfred now needs to save $900.00 more to reach his goal.",
    "He wants to save this amount over 12 months.",
    "To find out how much he needs to save each month, I divide the remaining amount he needs to save, $900.00, by 12 months.",
    "$900.00 \u00f7 12 = $75.00"
