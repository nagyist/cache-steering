  "query": "If I read 4 novels with 200 pages each in a month, how many pages of novels will I read in a year?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by understanding that I read 4 novels per month.",
    "Each novel has 200 pages.",
    "To find out how many pages I read in a month, I multiply the number of novels by the number of pages per novel.",
    "4 novels * 200 pages per novel = 800 pages in a month.",
    "To find out how many pages I read in a year, I need to multiply the pages read in a month by the number of months in a year.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "800 pages per month * 12 months = 9600 pages."
