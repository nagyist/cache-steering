  "query": "Sue works in a factory and every 30 minutes, a machine she oversees produces 30 cans of soda. How many cans of soda can one machine produce in 8 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many 30-minute intervals are there in 8 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.",
    "Next, I'll divide the total minutes by the length of each interval: 480 minutes / 30 minutes per interval.",
    "480 / 30 = 16. So, there are 16 intervals of 30 minutes in 8 hours.",
    "Each 30-minute interval results in 30 cans of soda being produced.",
    "Therefore, I'll calculate the total number of cans produced in 16 intervals by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of cans per interval: 16 * 30.",
    "16 * 30 = 480."
  ],
  "solution": "480"
