  "query": "Mary does her grocery shopping on Saturday. She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary started with a credit of $100.",
    "She spent the full credit limit, which means she used up the entire $100.",
    "She paid $15 on Tuesday.",
    "Subtracting the $15 payment from the $100 credit, Mary owes $85 still ($100 - $15 = $85).",
    "She paid $23 on Thursday.",
    "Subtracting the $23 payment from the remaining $85, Mary owes $62 ($85 - $23 = $62).",
    "To be able to shop again, Mary needs to pay off the entire remaining balance."

  "solution": "62"
