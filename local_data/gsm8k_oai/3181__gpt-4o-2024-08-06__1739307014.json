  "query": "Mary's sheep can run 12 feet per second, and her sheepdog can run 20 feet per second. A sheep standing 160 feet away from the sheep dog bolts, and the dog runs after it. How many seconds does it take the dog to catch the sheep?",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to determine the difference in speed between the sheepdog and the sheep. The sheepdog runs at 20 feet per second.",
    "The sheep runs at 12 feet per second.",
    "The difference in their speeds is 20 feet per second - 12 feet per second = 8 feet per second.",
    "This means that the sheepdog gains 8 feet on the sheep every second.",
    "Next, I determine the initial distance between the sheepdog and the sheep, which is given as 160 feet.",
    "To find out how many seconds it takes for the dog to catch the sheep, I divide the distance by the rate at which the dog gains on the sheep.",
    "This is calculated as 160 feet / 8 feet per second = 20 seconds."

  "solution": "20"
