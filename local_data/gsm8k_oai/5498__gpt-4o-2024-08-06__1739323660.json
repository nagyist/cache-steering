  "query": "Sasha added 48 cards into a box. Her sister, Karen, then took out 1/6 of the cards Sasha added. If there are now 83 cards in the box, how many cards were originally in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "Sasha added 48 cards to the box.",
    "Karen then took out 1/6 of the 48 cards.",
    "First, calculate 1/6 of 48.",
    "1/6 of 48 is 48/6.",
    "48 divided by 6 is 8.",
    "Karen took out 8 cards from the box.",
    "To find out how many cards are left after Karen took some out, subtract the number of cards Karen took out from the number Sasha added.",
    "48 - 8 equals 40.",
    "There are 40 cards remaining from the ones Sasha added.",
    "We know there are now 83 cards total in the box.",
    "To find the original number of cards, subtract the remaining cards from Sasha's addition from the current total number of cards.",
    "83 - 40 equals 43."
