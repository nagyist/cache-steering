    "Hannah's sister has 8 dolls.",
    "Hannah has 5 times as many dolls as her sister.",
    "To find out how many dolls Hannah has, I need to multiply the number of her sister's dolls by 5.",
    "8 (sister's dolls) times 5 equals 40.",

    "To find out how many dolls they have altogether, I need to add the number of dolls Hannah has to the number of dolls her sister has.",
    "40 (Hannah's dolls) plus 8 (sister's dolls) equals 48."
