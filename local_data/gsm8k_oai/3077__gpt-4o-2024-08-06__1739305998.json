  "query": "Tracy has a charity book collection store from which she receives book donations from members of her town. Any person who wants to borrow a book is free to do so as long as they return the book after they've finished reading. She has already received 300 book donations. If ten people come and donate five books each in a week, and a total of 140 books are borrowed by other people to read, calculate the total number of books she has remaining in the store?",
  "steps": [
    "Tracy initially has 300 donated books in her store.",
    "Ten people come and donate five books each.",
    "The total number of books donated by these ten people is 10 * 5 = 50 books.",
    "Add these 50 donated books to the 300 initial books: 300 + 50 = 350 books.",
    "A total of 140 books are borrowed by other people.",
    "Subtract the 140 borrowed books from the 350 books Tracy now has: 350 - 140 = 210 books."

  "solution": "210"
