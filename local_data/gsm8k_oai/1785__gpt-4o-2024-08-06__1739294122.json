  "query": "Angeli had 90 assorted candies. One-third of the candies were lollipops and the rest were candy canes. She then shared the lollipops equally among the boys such that each boy received 3. She then shared the candy canes equally among the girls such that each received 2. How many boys and girls were given altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many lollipops Angeli had.",
    "She had 90 candies in total, and one-third of these were lollipops.",
    "To find one-third of 90, I calculate \\( 90 \\div 3 \\).",
    "90 divided by 3 is 30. So, she had 30 lollipops.",
    "Next, I will determine how many boys received lollipops.",
    "Each boy received 3 lollipops.",
    "To find the number of boys, I divide the total number of lollipops by the number each boy received.",
    "30 lollipops divided by 3 per boy is \\( 30 \\div 3 \\).",
    "30 divided by 3 is 10. So, there were 10 boys.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many candy canes Angeli had.",
    "The rest of the candies were candy canes.",
    "The total number of candy canes is \\( 90 - 30 \\) which is 60.",
    "Now, I find out how many girls received candy canes.",
    "Each girl received 2 candy canes.",
    "To find the number of girls, I divide the total number of candy canes by the number each girl received.",
    "60 candy canes divided by 2 per girl is \\( 60 \\div 2 \\).",
    "60 divided by 2 is 30. So, there were 30 girls.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of boys and girls.",
    "We already found that there were 10 boys and 30 girls.",
    "Adding the boys and girls together gives me the total number of children who received candies.",
    "10 boys plus 30 girls is 40."
