  "query": "Colleen is making a batch of 48 cookies. She's going to add 108 chocolate chips and one-third as many M&Ms to the whole batch. What are the average number of chocolate pieces in each cookie?",
  "steps": [
    "Colleen has 108 chocolate chips to start with.",
    "She is also adding M&Ms, specifically one-third the number of chocolate chips.",
    "To find the number of M&Ms, calculate 108 divided by 3.",
    "108 divided by 3 equals 36.",
    "Now, add the number of chocolate chips and M&Ms together.",
    "108 (chocolate chips) plus 36 (M&Ms) equals 144.",
    "These 144 chocolate pieces will be distributed among the 48 cookies.",
    "To find the average number of chocolate pieces per cookie, divide the total number of chocolate pieces by the number of cookies.",
    "144 divided by 48 equals 3."
