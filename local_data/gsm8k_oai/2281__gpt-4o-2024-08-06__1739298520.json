Each of the girls wanted a serving and a half of pancakes.  Willow\u2019s son wanted 3 servings of pancakes.  How many single pancakes will Willow make for the girls and her son?",
  "steps": [
    "Willow's daughter has 3 friends, so there are a total of 4 girls at the slumber party.",
    "Each girl wants 1.5 servings of pancakes.",
    "Willow's pancake recipe makes 4 pancakes per serving.",
    "One and a half servings equal 1.5 times 4 pancakes.",
    "Calculating 1.5 servings: 1.5 * 4 = 6 pancakes per girl.",
    "There are 4 girls, and each wants 6 pancakes.",
    "Multiplying the number of girls by the pancakes each wants: 4 * 6 = 24 pancakes for all the girls.",
    "Willow's son wants 3 servings of pancakes.",
    "Calculating pancakes for Willow's son: 3 servings * 4 pancakes per serving = 12 pancakes.",
    "Adding the pancakes for the girls and Willow's son: 24 (girls) + 12 (son) = 36 pancakes."
