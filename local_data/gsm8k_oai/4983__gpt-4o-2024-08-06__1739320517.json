  "query": "Violet is planning a hike through the desert with her dog. Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour hiked and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour. If Violet can carry 4.8 L of water, how many hours can she and her dog spend hiking?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine Violet's total water needs per hour. Violet requires 800 ml of water per hour.",
    "Next, calculate the dog's total water needs per hour. The dog requires 400 ml of water per hour.",
    "Now, we add Violet's and her dog's water needs together to determine the total amount of water required per hour for both of them. So, 800 ml + 400 ml = 1200 ml per hour.",
    "Violet can carry 4.8 L of water. I need to convert this to milliliters because the water consumption rate is in ml. 1 L = 1000 ml, so 4.8 L = 4800 ml.",
    "To find how many hours Violet and her dog can hike, we divide the total amount of water she can carry by the total amount of water they need per hour. That is, 4800 ml / 1200 ml per hour.",
    "Now, calculate the result of the division: 4800 ml \u00f7 1200 ml/hour equals 4 hours."
