  "query": "Mary has 300 sheep and Bob has double the number of sheep as Mary plus another 35. How many sheep must Mary buy to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of sheep Bob has.",
    "Mary has 300 sheep. Bob has double the number of sheep as Mary, plus another 35.",
    "Double the number of Mary's sheep is 300 * 2 = 600.",
    "Adding 35 to 600 gives Bob's total: 600 + 35 = 635 sheep.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many sheep Mary should have to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob.",
    "Bob has 635 sheep. 69 fewer than Bob's amount is 635 - 69.",
    "Subtracting 69 from 635 gives: 635 - 69 = 566.",
    "Mary currently has 300 sheep, and she needs 566 sheep.",
    "To find out how many sheep Mary must buy, I need to calculate the difference: 566 - 300.",
    "566 - 300 = 266."

  "solution": "266"
