  "query": "A rectangle has a length of 3 inches and a width of 6 inches. A square has a width of 5 inches. What is the difference in area between the two shapes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the rectangle.",
    "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.",
    "The length of the rectangle is 3 inches and the width is 6 inches.",
    "The area of the rectangle is 3 inches * 6 inches = 18 square inches.",
    "Next, I need to find the area of the square.",
    "The area of a square is calculated by squaring its side length.",
    "The side length of the square is 5 inches.",
    "The area of the square is 5 inches * 5 inches = 25 square inches.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in area between the square and the rectangle.",
    "The area of the square is 25 square inches and the area of the rectangle is 18 square inches.",
    "The difference in area is 25 square inches - 18 square inches.",
    "The difference in area is 7 square inches."
