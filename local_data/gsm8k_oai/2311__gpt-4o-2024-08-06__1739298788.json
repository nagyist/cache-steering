  "query": "Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Melody has three dogs.",
    "Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of food per meal.",
    "Each dog eats twice per day, so each dog consumes 1/2 pound x 2 meals = 1 pound of food per day.",
    "There are three dogs, so they consume 3 dogs x 1 pound = 3 pounds of food per day together.",
    "A week has 7 days.",
    "So in a week, they would consume 3 pounds/day x 7 days = 21 pounds of food.",
    "Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food initially.",
    "After a week, 30 pounds - 21 pounds consumed = 9 pounds of dog food are left."

  "solution": "9"
