  "steps": [
    "Rose bought a total of one dozen flowers.",
    "One dozen is equal to 12 flowers.",
    "Two of the flowers are daisies.",
    "First, I'll subtract the 2 daisies from the total of 12 flowers to see how many flowers are left.",
    "12 - 2 = 10 flowers are left.",
    "Three-fifths of these remaining flowers are tulips.",
    "To find how many flowers are tulips, I'll calculate three-fifths of 10.",
    "Three-fifths of 10 is calculated as (3/5) * 10.",
    "(3/5) * 10 = 6.",
    "There are 6 tulips.",
    "To find the number of sunflowers, I'll subtract the number of tulips from the remaining flowers.",
    "10 - 6 = 4.",
