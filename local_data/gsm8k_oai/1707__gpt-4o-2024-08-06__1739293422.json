  "query": "Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari. There are 160 toys altogether. How many toys are there in Kamari's box?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's call the number of toys Kamari has \"K\".",
    "If Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari, then Anais has \"K + 30\" toys.",
    "Together, Anais and Kamari have 160 toys.",
    "Therefore, we can set up the equation: K + (K + 30) = 160.",
    "This simplifies to: 2K + 30 = 160.",
    "I will subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the terms with K: 2K = 160 - 30.",
    "This simplifies to: 2K = 130.",
    "I will divide both sides by 2 to solve for K: K = 130 / 2.",
    "This simplifies to: K = 65."
