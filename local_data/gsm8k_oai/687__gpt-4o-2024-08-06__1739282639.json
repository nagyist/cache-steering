  "query": "Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party, but she needs more candles. She currently has a total of 30 candles. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. How many additional candles does Stephanie need to complete the cupcakes?",
  "steps": [
    "Stephanie has 24 cupcakes to decorate.",
    "She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each.",
    "Half of 24 cupcakes is 12 cupcakes.",
    "She will use 1 candle for each of these 12 cupcakes, so she needs 12 candles for them.",
    "The other half of the cupcakes, which is also 12 cupcakes, will be decorated with 2 candles each.",
    "She needs 2 candles for each of these 12 cupcakes.",
    "For 12 cupcakes with 2 candles each, she needs \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) candles.",
    "In total, Stephanie needs \\(12 + 24 = 36\\) candles to decorate all the cupcakes.",
    "Stephanie currently has 30 candles.",
    "To find out how many more candles she needs, we subtract the candles she has from the total candles needed.",
    "\\(36 - 30 = 6\\) candles."
