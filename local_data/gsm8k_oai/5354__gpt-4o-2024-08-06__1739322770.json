  "query": "It was time for Kelly to harvest her carrots that she had planted in three different beds.  In the first bed she pulled out 55 carrots.  In the second bed she pulled out 101 carrots and in the third bed she pulled out 78 carrots.  She found that 6 carrots weighed one pound.  How many pounds of carrots did Kelly harvest?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of carrots harvested from all three beds.",
    "Kelly harvested 55 carrots from the first bed.",
    "Kelly harvested 101 carrots from the second bed.",
    "Kelly harvested 78 carrots from the third bed.",
    "I add the number of carrots from each bed together: 55 + 101 + 78.",
    "55 + 101 equals 156.",
    "156 + 78 equals 234.",
    "Kelly harvested a total of 234 carrots.",
    "Next, I use the information that 6 carrots weigh one pound to find out how many pounds Kelly harvested.",
    "I divide the total number of carrots by the number of carrots per pound: 234 \u00f7 6.",
    "234 divided by 6 equals 39.",
    "Kelly harvested 39 pounds of carrots."
