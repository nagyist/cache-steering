    "Angie's total income for the month is $80.",
    "At the end of the month, Angie has $18 left.",
    "Angie contributes $42 for necessities each month.",
    "To find out how much she spent on taxes, let's first calculate her total spending: she ended with $18, so she spent $80 - $18 = $62.",
    "We know $42 of her spending was on necessities, so her tax payment must be the remaining amount: $62 - $42 = $20."
