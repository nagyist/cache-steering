  "query": "A farmer living in the countryside has a certain number of children. One day, they followed him to the farm, each one with a bag to collect harvested apples. At the end of the day, each bag was filled with 15 apples each. On their way back home, 2 of the children have eaten 4 apples each and another child sold 7 of his apples. If they had a total of 60 apples left by the time they got home, how many children does the farmer have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by writing down what we know: Each child collected 15 apples in their bag.",
    "Two children ate 4 apples each, so they ate a total of \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) apples.",
    "One child sold 7 apples.",
    "So, the total number of apples eaten and sold is \\(8 + 7 = 15\\).",
    "The total number of apples the children brought back home is 60.",
    "Let \\( x \\) be the number of children. Each child initially collected 15 apples, so the total number of apples collected initially is \\( 15x \\).",
    "The total apples that remained with the children after eating and selling some is given by: \\( 15x - 15 = 60 \\).",
    "Solve the equation for \\( x \\): \\( 15x - 15 = 60 \\).",
    "Add 15 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\): \\( 15x = 75 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 15: \\( x = \\frac{75}{15} \\).",
    "Simplify the division: \\( x = 5 \\)."
