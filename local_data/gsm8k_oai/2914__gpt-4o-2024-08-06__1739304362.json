  "query": "Leah bought 3 boxes of birdseed. When she went to put them away, she discovered that she already had 5 boxes in the pantry. Her parrot eats 100 grams of seeds each week and her cockatiel eats 50 grams of seeds in a week. If each box of birdseed contains 225 grams, for how many weeks can she feed her birds without going back to the store?",
  "steps": [
    "Leah originally had 5 boxes of birdseed in the pantry.",
    "She bought 3 additional boxes.",
    "The total number of boxes she has now is 5 + 3 = 8 boxes.",
    "Each box contains 225 grams of birdseed.",
    "The total grams of seeds available is 8 boxes * 225 grams/box = 1800 grams.",
    "The parrot eats 100 grams of seeds each week.",
    "The cockatiel eats 50 grams of seeds each week.",
    "The total consumption of seeds by the birds per week is 100 grams + 50 grams = 150 grams.",
    "To find out how many weeks Leah can feed her birds, divide the total grams of seeds by the total weekly consumption: 1800 grams / 150 grams/week.",
    "1800 / 150 equals 12 weeks."
