  "steps": [
    "Let's consider the problem step by step.",
    "Lassie eats half of her bones on Saturday.",
    "Let's denote the number of bones Lassie originally had as \\( x \\).",
    "After eating half her bones, she has \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) bones left.",
    "On Sunday, she received 10 more bones.",
    "The total bones she then has is \\( \\frac{x}{2} + 10 \\).",
    "It is stated that Lassie ends with 35 bones.",
    "The equation to represent this is \\( \\frac{x}{2} + 10 = 35 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I'll first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation.",
    "This gives \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 25 \\).",
    "Next, I'll multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\).",
    "Thus, \\( x = 50 \\).",
    "I now know that the initial number of bones Lassie had was 50."

  "solution": "50"
