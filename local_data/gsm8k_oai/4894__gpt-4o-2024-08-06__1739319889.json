  "query": "There are 19 students in the 3rd grade and twice that number in the 4th grade. There are 10 boys and 19 girls in the 2nd grade. How many students are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of students in the 3rd grade. I'm given that there are 19 students in the 3rd grade.",
    "Next, I need to figure out the number of students in the 4th grade. The problem states there are twice as many students in the 4th grade as in the 3rd grade.",
    "So, I multiply the 19 students in the 3rd grade by 2 to find the number of students in the 4th grade: 19 * 2 = 38.",
    "Now, I have the number of students in the 2nd grade, which is the sum of the boys and girls: 10 boys + 19 girls = 29 students.",
    "To find the total number of students, I add the number of students from each grade: 19 (3rd grade) + 38 (4th grade) + 29 (2nd grade).",
    "Calculating the total: 19 + 38 = 57.",
    "Then, 57 + 29 gives me the total number of students.",
    "57 + 29 equals 86."
  ],
  "solution": "86"
