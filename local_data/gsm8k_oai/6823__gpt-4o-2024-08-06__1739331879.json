  "query": "Mr. Smith had 32 markers in his classroom. He buys new boxes of markers that have 9 markers in each box. Now, he has 86 markers. How many new boxes did Mr. Smith buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Start with the total number of markers Mr. Smith originally had, which is 32.",
    "We need to find out the total number of markers that Mr. Smith has after buying new boxes of markers, which is 86.",
    "Let's determine the number of new markers by subtracting the original number of markers from the total markers he has now: 86 - 32 = 54.",
    "Each box contains 9 markers. We need to find out how many boxes were bought to get 54 new markers.",
    "Let's divide the total number of new markers by the number of markers per box: 54 \u00f7 9.",
    "Calculate the division: 54 \u00f7 9 = 6.",
    "Mr. Smith bought 6 new boxes of markers."
