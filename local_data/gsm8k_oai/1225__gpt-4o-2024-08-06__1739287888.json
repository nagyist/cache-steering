  "query": "Donovan Mitchell is currently averaging 26 points per game. His team has played 15 games this season. He has a goal of averaging 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season. How many points does he need to average per game to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total points Donovan Mitchell has scored so far this season.",
    "He is averaging 26 points per game over 15 games.",
    "To find the total points scored so far, I multiply 26 points per game by 15 games.",
    "26 * 15 = 390 points. Donovan Mitchell has scored 390 points in 15 games.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of points he wants to score by the end of the 20-game season.",
    "He wants to average 30 points per game for 20 games.",
    "To find the desired total points, I multiply 30 points per game by 20 games.",
    "30 * 20 = 600 points. Donovan Mitchell wants to score a total of 600 points by the end of the season.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of points he needs to score in the remaining games to reach his goal.",
    "He has already scored 390 points, and he wants to score a total of 600 points.",
    "600 - 390 = 210 points. He needs to score 210 more points.",
    "There are 5 games left in the season (since 20 total games - 15 games already played = 5 games).",
    "Now, I need to determine how many points he needs to average per game in these remaining 5 games to score 210 points.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total points needed (210) by the number of remaining games (5).",
    "210 / 5 = 42 points per game."
