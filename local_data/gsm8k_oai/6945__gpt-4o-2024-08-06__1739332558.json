  "query": "Josh buys 3 packs of string cheese.  Each piece of string cheese cost 10 cents.  Each pack has 20 string cheeses in them.  How many dollars did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, figure out the total number of string cheeses Josh buys by multiplying the number of packs by the number of string cheeses in each pack.",
    "He bought 3 packs, and each pack contains 20 string cheeses.",
    "3 packs * 20 string cheeses per pack = 60 string cheeses.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of string cheeses by the cost per piece.",
    "Each piece of string cheese costs 10 cents, so 60 string cheeses * 10 cents each = 600 cents.",
    "Convert the total cost from cents to dollars by dividing by 100, since 1 dollar = 100 cents.",
    "600 cents / 100 = 6 dollars."
