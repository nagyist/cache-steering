  "query": "Tim gets a manicure and tips the beautician 30%.  If the manicure cost $30 how much did he pay in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the tip amount that Tim gave.",
    "The manicure cost is $30, and the tip is 30% of this cost.",
    "To find 30% of $30, I multiply 30 by 0.30.",
    "30 * 0.30 = 9",
    "The tip amount is $9.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total amount Tim paid by adding the tip to the original cost.",
    "The original cost is $30 and the tip is $9.",
    "30 + 9 = 39",
    "Therefore, the total amount Tim paid is $39."
