  "query": "Carson is going to spend 4 hours at a carnival. The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes, the wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes, and the wait for the giant slide is 15 minutes. If Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times and the tilt-a-whirl once, how many times can he ride the giant slide? (Wait times include the time actually spent on the ride.)",
  "steps": [
    "Carson has 4 hours to spend at the carnival.",
    "4 hours is equivalent to 240 minutes.",
    "Carson rides the roller coaster 4 times.",
    "The wait for the roller coaster is 30 minutes each time.",
    "Total time spent on the roller coaster is 4 times 30 minutes.",
    "Calculating: 4 x 30 minutes = 120 minutes.",
    "Next, Carson rides the tilt-a-whirl once.",
    "The wait for the tilt-a-whirl is 60 minutes.",
    "Adding the time for the roller coaster and the tilt-a-whirl: 120 minutes + 60 minutes.",
    "Calculating: 120 + 60 = 180 minutes.",
    "Carson has spent 180 minutes on the roller coaster and tilt-a-whirl.",
    "Subtract the spent time from total available time: 240 minutes - 180 minutes.",
    "Calculating: 240 - 180 = 60 minutes left.",
    "The wait for the giant slide is 15 minutes each time.",
    "To find out how many times he can ride the giant slide, divide the remaining time by the giant slide's wait time: 60 minutes / 15 minutes per ride.",
    "Calculating: 60 / 15 = 4 times."
