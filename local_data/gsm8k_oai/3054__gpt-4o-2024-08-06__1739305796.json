  "query": "John has 10 members of his family on his father's side.  His mother's side is 30% larger.  How many people are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many family members John has on his mother's side.",
    "John has 10 family members on his father's side.",
    "His mother's side is 30% larger than his father's side.",
    "To find out how much larger in number that is, I calculate 30% of 10.",
    "30% of 10 is 0.3 * 10, which equals 3.",
    "Now, I add this number to the number of family members on his father's side to find the total on his mother's side.",
    "The number of family members on his mother's side is 10 + 3, which equals 13.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of family members by adding both sides together.",
    "The total is 10 (father's side) + 13 (mother's side)."
