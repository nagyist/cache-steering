  "query": "At the park, Dimitri saw families riding bicycles and tricycles. Bicycles have two wheels and tricycles have three wheels.  6 adults were riding bicycles and 15 children were riding tricycles.   How many wheels did Dimitri see at the park?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by noting how many wheels a bicycle has. A bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "Calculate the total number of wheels from the bicycles. There are 6 adults riding bicycles. Multiply 6 bicycles by 2 wheels per bicycle.",
    "6 bicycles * 2 wheels/bicycle = 12 bicycle wheels.",
    "Next, note how many wheels a tricycle has. A tricycle has 3 wheels.",
    "Calculate the total number of wheels from the tricycles. There are 15 children riding tricycles. Multiply 15 tricycles by 3 wheels per tricycle.",
    "15 tricycles * 3 wheels/tricycle = 45 tricycle wheels.",
    "Add the total wheels from bicycles and tricycles together to find how many wheels are at the park.",
    "12 bicycle wheels + 45 tricycle wheels = 57 wheels in total."

  "solution": "57"
