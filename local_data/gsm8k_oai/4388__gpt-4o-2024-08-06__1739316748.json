  "query": "A classroom of 15 students turned in essays on Friday morning. The first 5 students each turned in essays with 2 pages. The next 5 students each turned in essays with 3 pages. The last 5 students each turned in essays with 1 page. What is the average page count per essay for the 15 students?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the count of pages contributed by the first group of students. There are 5 students in this group, and each turned in an essay with 2 pages.",
    "Calculate the total pages for the first 5 students: 5 students * 2 pages/student = 10 pages.",
    "Next, identify the count of pages contributed by the second group of students. There are 5 students in this group, and each turned in an essay with 3 pages.",
    "Calculate the total pages for the second 5 students: 5 students * 3 pages/student = 15 pages.",
    "Now, identify the count of pages contributed by the third group of students. There are 5 students in this group, and each turned in an essay with 1 page.",
    "Calculate the total pages for the third 5 students: 5 students * 1 page/student = 5 pages.",
    "Add the total pages from each group to find the overall total pages. 10 pages + 15 pages + 5 pages = 30 pages.",
    "There are 15 students who turned in essays.",
    "To find the average page count per essay, divide the total number of pages by the total number of essays. That means 30 pages / 15 students.",
    "Calculate the average: 30 pages / 15 students = 2 pages per student."
