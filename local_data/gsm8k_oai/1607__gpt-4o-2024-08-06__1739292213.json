  "query": "Jean has three times as much money as Jane. They have a combined total of $76. How much money does Jean have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let me denote the amount of money Jane has as J dollars.",
    "According to the problem, Jean has three times as much money as Jane. Therefore, Jean has 3J dollars.",
    "Together, they have a combined total of $76. Therefore, J + 3J = 76.",
    "Combining like terms, I get 4J = 76.",
    "To find the value of J, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 4.",
    "When I do the division, I get J = 76 / 4.",
    "Calculating this gives me J = 19.",
    "Now I know that Jane has $19. Since Jean has three times that amount, I calculate 3 times 19.",
    "3 times 19 equals 57.",
    "Therefore, Jean has $57."
