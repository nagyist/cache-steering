  "query": "A chihuahua, pitbull, and great dane weigh a combined weight of 439 pounds. The pitbull weighs 3 times as much as the chihuahua.  The great dane weighs 10 more pounds than triple the pitbull.  How much does the great dane weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the weight of the chihuahua as \\( C \\).",
    "According to the problem, the pitbull weighs 3 times as much as the chihuahua. Therefore, the pitbull's weight can be represented as \\( 3C \\).",
    "The great dane weighs 10 more pounds than triple the weight of the pitbull. So, the weight of the great dane is \\( 3 \\times 3C + 10 = 9C + 10 \\).",
    "The combined weight of the chihuahua, pitbull, and great dane is 439 pounds. We can express this as an equation: \\( C + 3C + 9C + 10 = 439 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, we have \\( 13C + 10 = 439 \\).",
    "To find \\( C \\), we need to solve for it: \\( 13C + 10 = 439 \\).",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\( C \\): \\( 13C = 429 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 13 to find the value of \\( C \\): \\( C = \\frac{429}{13} = 33 \\).",
    "Now that we know the weight of the chihuahua is 33 pounds, we can determine the weight of the pitbull: \\( 3C = 3 \\times 33 = 99 \\) pounds.",
    "Finally, we can find the weight of the great dane: \\( 9C + 10 = 9 \\times 33 + 10 = 297 + 10 = 307 \\) pounds."
