  "query": "A van is delivering  180 bottles of drinks to a neighborhood, and each bottle contains either cider or beer or a mixture of two. Out of the  180 bottles, 40 contain only cider, 80 contain only beer, and the rest are a mixture of the two drinks. If the delivery man gives half the number of each bottle of drink to the first house, how many bottles does the first house get?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of bottles is given as 180.",
    "The number of bottles containing only cider is 40.",
    "The number of bottles containing only beer is 80.",
    "To find the number of bottles containing a mixture of both drinks, I need to subtract the number of cider-only and beer-only bottles from the total.",
    "Total cider and beer-only bottles = 40 (cider) + 80 (beer) = 120 bottles.",
    "The number of mixed bottles = Total bottles - cider-only bottles - beer-only bottles = 180 - 120 = 60.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many bottles each type the first house will get after the delivery man gives half of them.",
    "The first house gets half of the cider-only bottles: 40 / 2 = 20 bottles.",
    "The first house gets half of the beer-only bottles: 80 / 2 = 40 bottles.",
    "The first house gets half of the mixed bottles: 60 / 2 = 30 bottles.",
    "Now I will add up the numbers of each type of bottle the first house gets: 20 (cider-only) + 40 (beer-only) + 30 (mixed) = 90 bottles."
