  "query": "A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting that the machine has 16 red gumballs.",
    "The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. Since there are 16 red gumballs, the number of blue gumballs is 16 / 2.",
    "16 / 2 is 8, so there are 8 blue gumballs.",
    "For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. Therefore, there are 8 * 4 green gumballs.",
    "8 * 4 equals 32, so there are 32 green gumballs.",
    "To find the total number of gumballs, I add the number of red, blue, and green gumballs: 16 + 8 + 32.",
    "16 + 8 equals 24.",
    "24 + 32 equals 56."

  "solution": "56"
