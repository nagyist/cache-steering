  "query": "Samir climbed 318 stairs yesterday. Veronica climbed 18 more than half that amount. How many stairs did Veronica and Samir climb together yesterday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stairs Samir climbed, which is given as 318 stairs.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many stairs Veronica climbed. The problem states that she climbed 18 more than half the amount Samir climbed.",
    "To find half the number of stairs Samir climbed, I divide 318 by 2: 318 / 2 = 159.",
    "Veronica climbed 18 more than this half. Therefore, I add 18 to 159: 159 + 18 = 177.",
    "Now I know Veronica climbed 177 stairs.",
    "The next step is to find the total number of stairs climbed by both Samir and Veronica together.",
    "I add the number of stairs Samir climbed to the number Veronica climbed: 318 + 177.",
    "Perform the addition: 318 + 177 = 495.",
    "So, the total number of stairs climbed by Samir and Veronica together is 495."

  "solution": "495"
