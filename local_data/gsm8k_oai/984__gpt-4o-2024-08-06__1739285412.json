  "query": "Legoland has 5 kangaroos for each koala. If Legoland has 180 kangaroos, how many koalas and kangaroos are there altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "There are 5 kangaroos for each koala.",
    "We know there are 180 kangaroos in total.",
    "Let the number of koalas be \\( K \\).",
    "Since there are 5 kangaroos per koala, the number of kangaroos is 5 times the number of koalas.",
    "Therefore, 5 times the number of koalas \\( (5K) \\) should equal 180.",
    "We set up the equation: \\( 5K = 180 \\).",
    "To find \\( K \\), divide both sides of the equation by 5: \\( K = \\frac{180}{5} \\).",
    "Calculating that, \\( K = 36 \\).",
    "There are 36 koalas in Legoland.",
    "Add the number of kangaroos and koalas to get the total: 180 + 36.",
    "Calculate that, 180 + 36 = 216."

  "solution": "216"
