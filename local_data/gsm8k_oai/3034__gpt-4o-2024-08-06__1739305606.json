  "query": "In the school election, Eliot got twice as many votes as Shaun, and Shaun got 5 times as many votes as Randy. If Randy got 16 votes, how many did Eliot get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many votes Shaun received.",
    "I know from the problem that Shaun got 5 times as many votes as Randy.",
    "Randy got 16 votes.",
    "So, I calculate Shaun's votes by multiplying Randy's votes by 5: 16 * 5.",
    "16 * 5 equals 80.",
    "Shaun received 80 votes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many votes Eliot received.",
    "Eliot got twice as many votes as Shaun, according to the problem.",
    "Therefore, I need to multiply Shaun's votes by 2: 80 * 2.",
    "80 * 2 equals 160.",
    "Eliot received 160 votes."

  "solution": "160"
