  "query": "Simon and Peter have a big stamp collection. Simon collects red stamps and Peter collects white stamps. Simon has 30 red stamps and Peter has 80 white stamps. If the red stamps are then sold for 50 cents each and the white stamps are sold for 20 cents each, what is the difference in the amount of money they make in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much money Simon makes by selling his red stamps.",
    "Simon has 30 red stamps and sells them for 50 cents each.",
    "To find out how much money Simon makes, multiply the number of stamps he has by the price he sells each for: 30 stamps * $0.50 per stamp = $15.",
    "Next, calculate how much money Peter makes by selling his white stamps.",
    "Peter has 80 white stamps and sells them for 20 cents each.",
    "To find out how much money Peter makes, multiply the number of stamps he has by the price he sells each for: 80 stamps * $0.20 per stamp = $16.",
    "Now, determine the difference in the amount of money they each make from selling their stamps.",
    "Simon makes $15 and Peter makes $16.",
    "Calculate the difference: $16 (Peter's earnings) - $15 (Simon's earnings) = $1."
