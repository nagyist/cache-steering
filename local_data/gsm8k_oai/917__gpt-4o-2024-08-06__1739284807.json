  "query": "Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how high Matt climbs in 7 minutes.",
    "Matt climbs at a rate of 6 feet per minute.",
    "In 7 minutes, Matt will have climbed \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\) feet.",
    "Next, I need to determine how high Jason climbs in 7 minutes.",
    "Jason climbs at a rate of 12 feet per minute.",
    "In 7 minutes, Jason will have climbed \\(7 \\times 12 = 84\\) feet.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in height between Jason and Matt after 7 minutes.",
    "Jason's height is 84 feet and Matt's height is 42 feet.",
    "The difference in height is \\(84 - 42 = 42\\) feet."

  "solution": "42"
