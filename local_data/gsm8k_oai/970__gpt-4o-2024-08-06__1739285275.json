  "query": "Johann and two friends are to deliver 180 pieces of certified mail. His friends each deliver 41 pieces of mail. How many pieces of mail does Johann need to deliver?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many pieces of mail Johann's two friends delivered together.",
    "Each friend delivered 41 pieces of mail.",
    "Therefore, the total mail delivered by both friends is 41 pieces each multiplied by 2.",
    "Calculate 41 * 2 to find the total mail delivered by Johann's friends.",
