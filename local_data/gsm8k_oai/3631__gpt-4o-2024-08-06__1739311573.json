  "query": "Codger is a three-footed sloth.  He has a challenging time buying shoes because the stores only sell the shoes in pairs. If he already owns the 3-piece set of shoes he is wearing, how many pairs of shoes does he need to buy to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes?",
  "steps": [
    "Codger currently has one complete 3-piece set of shoes, which means he has 3 shoes.",
    "He needs 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes in total. Each set contains 3 shoes, so 5 sets require 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 shoes.",
    "Codger already has 3 shoes from his current complete set.",
    "To find out how many more shoes he needs, I subtract the number of shoes he already has from the total number of shoes required: 15 - 3 = 12 shoes.",
    "Shoes are sold in pairs, which means each pair contains 2 shoes.",
    "To calculate the number of pairs Codger needs, I divide the total number of additional shoes he needs by 2: 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 pairs of shoes."
