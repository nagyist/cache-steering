  "query": "Karen hangs 6 ferns around her house. Each fern has 7 fronds, and each frond has 30 leaves. How many leaves do all the ferns have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fronds there are in total. Each fern has 7 fronds.",
    "Karen has 6 ferns.",
    "To find the total number of fronds, I multiply the number of ferns by the number of fronds per fern: 6 * 7.",
    "6 multiplied by 7 equals 42. So, there are 42 fronds in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of leaves. Each frond has 30 leaves.",
    "To find the total number of leaves, I multiply the total number of fronds by the number of leaves per frond: 42 * 30.",
    "42 multiplied by 30 is calculated as follows: 42 * 3 = 126, then add a zero for multiplication by 10, giving 1260."

  "solution": "1260"
