  "query": "Larry started off having 150 channels from his cable company.  They took 20 channels away and replaced those with 12 channels.  He called the company and asked if he could reduce his package by 10 more channels but add the sports package which is 8 channels.  He realizes that he didn't add the supreme sports package.  He calls back and that package adds 7 more channels.  How many channels does Larry have?",
  "steps": [
    "Larry initially has 150 channels.",
    "The cable company takes 20 channels away from Larry.",
    "150 - 20 equals 130 channels after the removal.",
    "The company replaces those 20 channels with 12 new channels.",
    "130 + 12 equals 142 channels after the replacement.",
    "Larry decides to reduce his package by 10 more channels.",
    "142 - 10 equals 132 channels after the reduction.",
    "Larry adds the sports package which consists of 8 channels.",
    "132 + 8 equals 140 channels after adding the sports package.",
    "Larry realizes he needs the supreme sports package, adding 7 more channels.",
    "140 + 7 equals 147 channels after adding the supreme sports package."
