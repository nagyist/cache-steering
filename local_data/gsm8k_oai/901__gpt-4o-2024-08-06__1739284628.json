  "steps": [
    "Sandi initially had $600.",
    "She spent half of her money at the farmer's market.",
    "Calculate half of $600, which is $600 / 2 = $300.",
    "Sandi spent $300 at the farmer's market.",
    "Gillian spent $150 more than three times the amount Sandi spent.",
    "Calculate three times the amount Sandi spent, which is 3 * $300 = $900.",
    "Then, add $150 to $900, which gives $900 + $150 = $1050."
