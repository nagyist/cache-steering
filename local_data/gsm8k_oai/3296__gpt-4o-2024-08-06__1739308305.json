  "query": "Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work every day. Ten times the time he takes to travel to work and back is the same as the cost of buying a pack of snacks (in dollars). How much will Ryan pay, in dollars, to buy 50 packs of snacks?",
  "steps": [
    "Kyle bikes for 2 hours to work, which means he takes 2 hours to get there.",
    "Since he bikes to work and back, the total time Kyle spends biking each day is 2 hours (to work) + 2 hours (back) = 4 hours.",
    "It's given that ten times this total travel time is equal to the cost of a pack of snacks.",
    "Ten times the total travel time is 10 * 4 hours = 40 hours.",
    "Therefore, the cost of one pack of snacks is $40.",
    "Ryan wants to buy 50 packs of snacks.",
    "The total cost for 50 packs is 50 * $40 per pack = $2000."
