A while later, an animal rescue contacted them, and the zoo took in three endangered rhinos. Then one of their lionesses gave birth to cubs, and they opened a meerkat exhibit with twice as many meerkats as they had gained lion cubs. The zoo then had 90 animals in all. How many lion cubs were born at the zoo?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, the zoo houses a total of 68 wild animals.",
    "The zoo sends a gorilla family of six to a different zoo. This decreases the animal count from 68 to 68 - 6 = 62 animals.",
    "They adopt one hippopotamus from another zoo. This increases the count to 62 + 1 = 63 animals.",
    "The zoo takes in three endangered rhinos from an animal rescue. This increases the count to 63 + 3 = 66 animals.",
    "We know the total number of animals finally is 90. The number of new animals added after the rhinos must account for this difference.",
    "The difference between the final count and the count after the rhinos is 90 - 66 = 24 animals.",
    "The lionesses gave birth to some cubs, but we don't yet know how many.",
    "A meerkat exhibit opened with twice as many meerkats as there were lion cubs added. So, let's assume the number of lion cubs born is \"x\".",
    "Then there would be 2x meerkats. Adding the lion cubs and meerkats to the total after the rhinos, we have 66 + x + 2x = 66 + 3x.",
    "We know 66 + 3x equals the final total, which is 90.",
    "Set up the equation: 66 + 3x = 90.",
    "To find x, subtract 66 from both sides: 3x = 90 - 66.",
    "3x = 24",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 24 / 3.",
    "x = 8"
