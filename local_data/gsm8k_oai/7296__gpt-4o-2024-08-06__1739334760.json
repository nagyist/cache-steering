  "query": "Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?",
  "steps": [
    "Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate.",
    "Each class is worth 3 credits.",
    "To find out how many classes she needs in total, divide the total credits by the credits per class: 120 credits \u00f7 3 credits/class.",
    "120 \u00f7 3 = 40 classes. So, Maddy needs to take 40 classes in total.",
    "Maddy is in college for 8 semesters.",
    "To find out how many classes she needs to take per semester, divide the total number of classes by the number of semesters: 40 classes \u00f7 8 semesters.",
    "40 \u00f7 8 = 5 classes. Maddy needs to take 5 classes per semester."
