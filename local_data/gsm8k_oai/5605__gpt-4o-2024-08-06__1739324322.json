    "I need to start by finding Tom's current age.",
    "Tom will be 30 in five years.",
    "So, I subtract 5 years from 30 to find Tom's current age.",
    "Tom is 25 years old now.",
    "Two years ago, Jared was twice as old as Tom was then.",
    "Two years ago, Tom's age would have been 25 - 2 = 23.",
    "Two years ago, Jared's age was twice that of Tom's age at that time.",
    "Therefore, Jared's age two years ago was 2 * 23 = 46.",
    "I need to find Jared's current age.",
    "If Jared was 46 two years ago, I add 2 years to find his current age.",
    "Jared's current age is 46 + 2 = 48."
