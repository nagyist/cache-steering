  "query": "Jack goes up three flights of stairs, then down six flights of stairs. If each flight of stairs has 12 steps that each each 8 inches high, how many feet further down is Jack than when he started?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how many steps Jack moves up when going up three flights of stairs.",
    "Three flights of stairs multiplied by 12 steps per flight equals 36 steps up.",
    "Next, calculate how many steps Jack moves down when going down six flights of stairs.",
    "Six flights of stairs multiplied by 12 steps per flight equals 72 steps down.",
    "Now, find the total net movement in steps by subtracting the steps Jack goes up from the steps he goes down.",
    "72 steps down minus 36 steps up equals 36 steps down.",
    "Each step is 8 inches high, so calculate the total vertical distance in inches.",
    "36 steps down multiplied by 8 inches per step equals 288 inches down.",
    "Convert the total vertical distance from inches to feet.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot, so divide 288 inches by 12.",
    "288 divided by 12 equals 24 feet."

  "solution": "24"
