  "query": "Out of the 500 marbles that Cindy had, she gave her four friends 80 marbles each. What's four times the number of marbles she has remaining?",
  "steps": [
    "Cindy started with 500 marbles.",
    "She has four friends and gave each of them 80 marbles.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of marbles she gave away.",
    "One friend received 80 marbles, so four friends received 4 times 80 marbles.",
    "Calculating 4 times 80 gives 320 marbles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many marbles Cindy has left.",
    "Cindy originally had 500 marbles and gave away 320 marbles.",
    "To find the remaining marbles, subtract the given away marbles from the original count: 500 - 320.",
    "500 - 320 equals 180 marbles remaining.",
    "The question asks for four times the number of marbles she has remaining.",
    "Calculate four times the remaining marbles: 4 times 180.",
    "4 times 180 equals 720."
