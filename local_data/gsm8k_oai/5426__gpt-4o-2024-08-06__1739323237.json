  "query": "Michael has a chicken farm. His chickens increase in number by 150 chickens annually. If the number of chickens on his farm now is 550, how many will he have after 9 years?",
  "steps": [
    "The current number of chickens on Michael's farm is 550.",
    "The annual increase in the number of chickens is 150.",
    "I need to calculate how many chickens will be added over the course of 9 years.",
    "I'll multiply the annual increase (150 chickens) by the number of years (9 years).",
    "150 chickens/year * 9 years = 1350 chickens.",
    "Now, I'll add the number of chickens currently on the farm (550) to the number of additional chickens (1350).",
    "550 + 1350 = 1900"
  ],
  "solution": "1900"
