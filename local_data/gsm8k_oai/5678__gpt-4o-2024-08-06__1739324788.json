  "query": "A particular train has some passenger cars and a number of cargo cars equal to half the number of passenger cars plus three. If the total number of cars is 71, counting the engine and caboose, how many passenger cars are in the train?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining variables: let P be the number of passenger cars and C be the number of cargo cars.",
    "According to the problem, C equals half the number of passenger cars plus three. So, C = (1/2)P + 3.",
    "It is also given that the total number of cars, including the engine and caboose, is 71. We assume the engine and caboose account for 2 cars in total.",
    "So, the equation for the total is: P + C + 2 = 71.",
    "Let's simplify the total equation: P + C = 71 - 2 = 69.",
    "Now we substitute the expression for C from the first condition into the total equation: P + (1/2)P + 3 = 69.",
    "Combine the P terms: 1P + (1/2)P = (3/2)P.",
    "Substitute into the equation: (3/2)P + 3 = 69.",
    "Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant on the left: (3/2)P = 66.",
    "Solve for P by multiplying both sides by 2/3, which gives P = 66 * (2/3).",
    "Calculate the value of P: P = 44.",
    "I will verify my steps. If P = 44, then C should be (1/2)*44 + 3 = 22 + 3 = 25.",
    "The total number of train cars should be P + C + 2 (engine and caboose): 44 + 25 + 2 = 71. This matches the information provided in the problem."
