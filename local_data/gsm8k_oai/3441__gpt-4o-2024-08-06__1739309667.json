  "query": "Brandon sold some geckos to a local pet shop. Brandon sold the geckos for 100$. The pet store sells them for 5 more than 3 times that. How much does the pet store profit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Brandon sold geckos for $100.",
    "The pet store sells them for 5 more than 3 times what Brandon sold them for.",
    "To find out how much the pet store sells them for, I need to calculate 3 times the amount Brandon sold them for and then add 5.",
    "Brandon sold them for $100, so I need to multiply 100 by 3.",
    "100 times 3 is 300.",
    "Next, I add 5 to 300.",
    "300 plus 5 is 305.",
    "The pet store sells the geckos for $305.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much the pet store profits.",
    "The profit can be calculated by subtracting the cost at which the pet store bought them from the price they sell them.",
    "The pet store bought the geckos for $100.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract 100 from 305.",
    "305 minus 100 is 205."

  "solution": "205"
