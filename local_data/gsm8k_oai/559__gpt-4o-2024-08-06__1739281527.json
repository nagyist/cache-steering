  "query": "Luna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget while her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. If the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, how much is Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the house rental budget be \\( x \\).",
    "Luna's food budget is 60% of her house rental budget, so the food budget is \\( 0.6x \\).",
    "According to the problem, \\( x + 0.6x = 240 \\) dollars.",
    "Combine like terms to get \\( 1.6x = 240 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 1.6: \\( x = \\frac{240}{1.6} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{240}{1.6} \\): \\( x = 150 \\).",
    "So, Luna's house rental budget is \\( 150 \\) dollars.",
    "Now, calculate the food budget: \\( 0.6 \\times 150 = 90 \\) dollars.",
    "The phone bill budget is 10% of the food budget: \\( 0.1 \\times 90 = 9 \\) dollars.",
    "Now, calculate Luna's total monthly budget for all expenses (house rental + food budget + phone bill budget): \\( 150 + 90 + 9 \\).",
    "Sum up the expenses: \\( 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \\)."
