  "query": "A factory manufactures cars with 5 doors. The factory was planning to produce 200 cars but due to metal shortages, they decreased the production by 50 cars. Due to a pandemic, they also had to cut production by another 50%. How many doors will the factory produce?",
  "steps": [
    "The factory initially planned to produce 200 cars.",
    "They decreased production by 50 cars due to metal shortages.",
    "200 cars initially planned - 50 cars decreased = 150 cars now planned.",
    "Due to the pandemic, they had to cut production by 50%.",
    "50% of 150 cars is 150 / 2 = 75 cars.",
    "They will produce only 75 cars after the 50% reduction.",
    "Each car has 5 doors.",
    "The total number of doors equals the number of cars multiplied by the number of doors per car.",
    "75 cars x 5 doors per car = 375 doors."

  "solution": "375"
