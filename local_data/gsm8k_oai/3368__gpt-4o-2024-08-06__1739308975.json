  "query": "Lilibeth and her friends go strawberry picking. Lilibeth fills 6 baskets where each basket holds 50 strawberries. If three of Lilibeth's friends pick the same amount as her, how many strawberries do Lilibeth and her friends pick in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate how many strawberries Lilibeth picks by herself.",
    "Each basket holds 50 strawberries, and Lilibeth fills 6 baskets.",
    "So, I multiply 6 baskets by 50 strawberries per basket: 6 * 50 = 300.",
    "Lilibeth picks 300 strawberries by herself.",
    "Next, I determine how many strawberries each of Lilibeth's friends pick.",
    "According to the problem, each of her three friends picks the same amount as Lilibeth.",
    "Therefore, each friend picks 300 strawberries.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of strawberries picked by her three friends.",
    "Since there are three friends, I multiply their individual amounts: 3 * 300 = 900.",
    "Her three friends pick 900 strawberries in total.",
    "Finally, I add together the strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her friends.",
    "Lilibeth picks 300 strawberries, and her friends pick 900 strawberries.",
    "300 + 900 = 1200."

  "solution": "1200"
