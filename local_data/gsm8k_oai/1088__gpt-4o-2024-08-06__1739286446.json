  "query": "We the People has 17 cows. Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has. If their cows are taken to a ranch to graze together, how many cows will be in the ranch altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how many cows Happy Good Healthy Family has.",
    "We the People has 17 cows.",
    "Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has.",
    "First, calculate three times the number of cows We the People has: 3 times 17 is 51.",
    "Now, add two more to this number: 51 plus 2 equals 53.",
    "Therefore, the Happy Good Healthy Family has 53 cows.",
    "Next, we find the total number of cows when both groups' cows are together in the ranch.",
    "Add the number of cows We the People has to the number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has.",
    "That is 17 cows plus 53 cows.",
    "17 plus 53 equals 70."
