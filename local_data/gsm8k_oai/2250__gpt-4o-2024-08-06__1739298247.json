  "query": "Thomas is making hummus. One of the ingredients in a hummus recipe is chickpeas. For one serving of hummus, the recipe calls for 1 cup of chickpeas. In a can of chickpeas, there are 16 ounces of chickpeas. In one cup of chickpeas, there are 6 ounces. To make 20 servings, how many cans of chickpeas should Thomas buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cups of chickpeas are needed for 20 servings of hummus.",
    "The recipe calls for 1 cup of chickpeas per serving.",
    "Therefore, for 20 servings, Thomas needs 20 cups of chickpeas.",
    "Next, I need to convert the 20 cups of chickpeas into ounces to determine how many ounces are required.",
    "Since each cup of chickpeas weighs 6 ounces, I can calculate the total ounces needed by multiplying 20 cups by 6 ounces per cup.",
    "20 cups * 6 ounces/cup = 120 ounces.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many cans of chickpeas Thomas would need based on the weight of chickpeas in each can.",
    "Each can of chickpeas contains 16 ounces.",
    "To find out how many cans are needed, I divide the total ounces required by the ounces per can.",
    "120 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 7.5 cans.",
    "Since Thomas cannot purchase half a can, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number of cans.",
    "Therefore, Thomas needs to buy 8 cans of chickpeas to have enough for 20 servings."

  "solution": "8"
