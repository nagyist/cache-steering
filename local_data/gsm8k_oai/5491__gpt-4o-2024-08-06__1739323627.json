  "query": "Of the 24 students in class, one-third are in the after-school chess program, and half of those students will be absent from school on Friday for the regional chess tournament. How many of the students in this class are going to that tournament?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many students are in the after-school chess program.",
    "There are 24 students in the class, and one-third of them are in the chess program.",
    "To calculate one-third of 24, I divide 24 by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8 students.",
    "So, there are 8 students in the after-school chess program.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of those 8 students will be absent for the tournament.",
    "Half of the students in the chess program will be absent.",
    "To calculate half of 8, I divide 8 by 2.",
    "8 divided by 2 equals 4 students."
