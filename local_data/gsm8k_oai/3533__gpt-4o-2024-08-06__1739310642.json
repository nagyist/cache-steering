  "query": "The area of square A is 25. The area of square B is 81. What's the length difference between the sides of square A and B?",
  "steps": [
    "The area of a square is calculated as side length squared.",
    "For square A, the area is 25.",
    "To find the side length of square A, I take the square root of 25.",
    "The square root of 25 is 5.",
    "For square B, the area is 81.",
    "To find the side length of square B, I take the square root of 81.",
    "The square root of 81 is 9.",
    "To find the length difference between the sides of square A and B, I subtract the side length of square A from the side length of square B.",
    "Subtracting 5 from 9 gives me 4."
