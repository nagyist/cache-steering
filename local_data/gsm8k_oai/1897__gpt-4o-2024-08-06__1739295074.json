  "query": "Mason is trying to download a 880 MB game to his phone. After downloading 310 MB, his Internet connection slows to 3 MB/minute. How many more minutes will it take him to download the game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how much of the game has already been downloaded. Mason has downloaded 310 MB.",
    "Next, find out how much more needs to be downloaded. The total size of the game is 880 MB.",
    "Subtract the amount already downloaded from the total size: 880 MB - 310 MB = 570 MB remaining to be downloaded.",
    "Now, calculate the time it will take to download the remaining 570 MB. His current download speed is 3 MB/minute.",
    "To find the time, divide the remaining download amount by the speed: 570 MB \u00f7 3 MB/minute.",
    "570 divided by 3 equals 190."
