  "query": "There are 12 carpets in house 1, 20 carpets in house 2, and 10 carpets in house 3. If house 4 has twice as many carpets as house 3, how many carpets do all 4 houses have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the number of carpets in each house.",
    "House 1 has 12 carpets.",
    "House 2 has 20 carpets.",
    "House 3 has 10 carpets.",
    "According to the problem, house 4 has twice as many carpets as house 3.",
    "House 3 has 10 carpets, so house 4 has 2 * 10 = 20 carpets.",
    "Now I need to add the number of carpets from all four houses to find the total.",
    "Adding the carpets from house 1, house 2, house 3, and house 4: 12 + 20 + 10 + 20.",
    "12 + 20 = 32.",
    "32 + 10 = 42.",
    "42 + 20 = 62."
