  "query": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the distance Tim travels during his work commute in one day.",
    "Tim rides his bike to work and back home, so he travels 20 miles each way.",
    "The total distance for one round trip to work is 20 miles + 20 miles = 40 miles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total distance Tim commutes during his 5 workdays.",
    "5 workdays * 40 miles per day = 200 miles.",
    "Next, I will consider the additional weekend bike ride.",
    "Tim rides 200 miles during his weekend bike ride.",
    "To find the total distance Tim bikes in a week, I will add the commute distance and the weekend ride distance.",
    "200 miles (commuting) + 200 miles (weekend ride) = 400 miles.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total time spent biking at a rate of 25 miles per hour.",
    "To find the time, I need to divide the total distance by his biking speed.",
    "Total distance = 400 miles, Biking speed = 25 mph.",
    "Time spent biking = 400 miles / 25 mph.",
    "400 / 25 = 16 hours."

  "solution": "16"
