  "steps": [
    "Jake delivers 234 newspapers a week.",
    "Miranda delivers twice as many as Jake.",
    "To find out how many Miranda delivers in a week, I will multiply 234 by 2.",
    "234 * 2 = 468",
    "Miranda delivers 468 newspapers a week.",

    "First, calculate how many newspapers Jake delivers in 4 weeks.",
    "234 newspapers/week * 4 weeks = 936 newspapers/month",
    "Now, calculate how many newspapers Miranda delivers in 4 weeks.",
    "468 newspapers/week * 4 weeks = 1872 newspapers/month",
    "To find out how many more newspapers Miranda delivers than Jake in a month, subtract the number Jake delivers from the number Miranda delivers.",
    "1872 - 936 = 936"
