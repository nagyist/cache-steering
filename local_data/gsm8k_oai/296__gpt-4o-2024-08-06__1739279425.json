  "query": "Chelsea has 24 kilos of sugar. She divides them into 4 bags equally. Then one of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground. How many kilos of sugar remain?",
  "steps": [
    "Chelsea starts with 24 kilos of sugar.",
    "She divides the sugar equally into 4 bags.",
    "To find out how much sugar each bag contains, I need to divide 24 kilos by 4.",
    "24 divided by 4 equals 6.",
    "So, each bag contains 6 kilos of sugar.",
    "One of the bags gets torn and half of the sugar falls to the ground.",
    "Half of 6 kilos is 3 kilos.",
    "This means 3 kilos of sugar from the torn bag falls to the ground.",
    "To find the remaining sugar from the torn bag, I subtract 3 kilos from 6 kilos.",
    "6 kilos minus 3 kilos is 3 kilos.",
    "So, the torn bag has 3 kilos of sugar left.",
    "The other 3 bags are unaffected, so they still have 18 kilos of sugar together (3 bags \u00d7 6 kilos each).",
    "Now, I add the sugar left in the torn bag to the sugar in the other bags.",
    "3 kilos in the torn bag plus 18 kilos in the other bags equals 21 kilos."
