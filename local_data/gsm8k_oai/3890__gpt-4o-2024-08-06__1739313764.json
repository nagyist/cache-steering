  "query": "Buoys are placed in the ocean at even intervals away from the beach to help swimmers monitor how far away from the beach they have swum. If a swimmer reaches the third buoy, they have swum out 72 meters. How many meters from the beach is the fourth buoy?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, I need to determine how far apart each buoy is from the next.",
    "I know that the distance to the third buoy is 72 meters.",
    "If the buoys are evenly spaced, then the distance between each consecutive buoy is the same.",
    "To find the distance between each buoy, I will divide 72 meters by 3, because the third buoy is the endpoint of reaching three buoys.",
    "Calculating: 72 meters / 3 buoys = 24 meters per buoy.",
    "Now that I know each buoy is 24 meters apart, I can calculate the distance to the fourth buoy.",
    "The distance to the third buoy is 72 meters, and I need to add one more interval (from the third buoy to the fourth).",
    "Adding 24 meters (one interval) to 72 meters gives me the distance to the fourth buoy.",
    "Calculating: 72 meters + 24 meters = 96 meters."
