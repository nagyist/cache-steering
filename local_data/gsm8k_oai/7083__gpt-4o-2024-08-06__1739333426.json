  "query": "Lois has 40 books. She gives a fourth of her books to her nephew. From her remaining books, she donates a third of her books to the library. Then she purchases 3 new books from the book store. How many books does Lois have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Lois initially has 40 books.",
    "She gives a fourth of her books to her nephew. A fourth of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 books.",
    "Lois gives away 10 books, so she has 40 - 10 = 30 books remaining.",
    "Lois donates a third of her remaining books to the library. A third of 30 is 30 / 3 = 10 books.",
    "Lois donates 10 books, so she has 30 - 10 = 20 books remaining.",
    "Lois purchases 3 new books from the book store.",
    "After purchasing, she has 20 + 3 = 23 books."
