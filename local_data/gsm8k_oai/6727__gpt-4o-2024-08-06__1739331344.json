  "query": "Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds. Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat. How many animals does Cara's cat catch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of animals Martha's cat catches.",
    "Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds.",
    "So, the total number of animals caught by Martha's cat is 3 (rats) + 7 (birds) = 10 animals.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many animals Cara's cat catches.",
    "Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times the number of animals Martha's cat catches.",
    "First, I calculate five times the number of animals Martha's cat catches: 5 * 10 = 50 animals.",
    "Then, I subtract 3 from that number to find how many animals Cara's cat catches: 50 - 3 = 47 animals."

  "solution": "47"
