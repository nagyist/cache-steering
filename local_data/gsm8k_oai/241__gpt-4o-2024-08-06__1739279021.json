  "query": "Mr. Lu owns a computer store. For last month, half of their sales are laptops, one-third are netbooks, and the rest are desktop computers. If Mr. Lu's store was able to sell a total of 72 computers, how many of them are desktop computers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Mr. Lu's store sold a total of 72 computers.",
    "The sales consist of laptops, netbooks, and desktop computers.",
    "It's given that half of the sales are laptops.",
    "Half of 72 computers would be 72/2.",
    "72 divided by 2 equals 36, so 36 computers are laptops.",
    "It's also given that one-third of the sales are netbooks.",
    "One-third of 72 computers would be 72/3.",
    "72 divided by 3 equals 24, so 24 computers are netbooks.",
    "Now I have accounted for laptops and netbooks. I need to find out how many are desktops.",
    "If 36 computers are laptops and 24 are netbooks, I will add these to find the sum of laptops and netbooks.",
    "36 plus 24 equals 60.",
    "The total number of laptops and netbooks is 60.",
    "The total number of computers sold is 72, so I subtract the total of laptops and netbooks from the total computers to find the number of desktops.",
    "72 minus 60 equals 12."

  "solution": "12"
