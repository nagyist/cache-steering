  "query": "An unusual bicycle has 20 spokes on the front wheel and twice as many spokes on the back wheel. How many spokes does the bicycle have?",
  "steps": [
    "The front wheel has 20 spokes.",
    "The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel.",
    "To find the number of spokes on the back wheel, I multiply the number of spokes on the front wheel by 2.",
    "20 (number of spokes on the front wheel) multiplied by 2 equals 40.",
    "So, the back wheel has 40 spokes.",
    "To find the total number of spokes on the bicycle, I need to add the number of spokes on the front wheel to the number of spokes on the back wheel.",
    "The front wheel has 20 spokes and the back wheel has 40 spokes.",
    "Adding these together gives 20 + 40.",
    "20 + 40 equals 60."
