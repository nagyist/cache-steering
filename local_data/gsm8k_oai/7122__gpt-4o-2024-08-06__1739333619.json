  "query": "Mark bought 2 pounds of tomatoes for $5 per pound and 5 pounds of apples, at $6 per pound. How much did he spend in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Mark spent on tomatoes.",
    "He bought 2 pounds of tomatoes at $5 per pound.",
    "The cost for tomatoes is 2 pounds * $5 per pound = $10.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the apples.",
    "Mark bought 5 pounds of apples at $6 per pound.",
    "The cost for apples is 5 pounds * $6 per pound = $30.",
    "To find the total amount Mark spent, I need to add the cost of tomatoes and apples together.",
    "The total cost is $10 (tomatoes) + $30 (apples) = $40."
