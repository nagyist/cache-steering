  "query": "There were 600 people in the stadium when the football game started. Before the game was over, one-fourth of the boys and one-eighth of the girls left early. How many people remained to see the end of the game if there were 240 girls at the beginning of the game?",
  "steps": [
    "There were initially 600 people in the stadium.",
    "There were 240 girls at the beginning of the game.",
    "To find the number of boys, subtract the number of girls from the total number of people: 600 - 240 = 360 boys.",
    "One-fourth of the boys left early, so calculate that: 360 / 4 = 90 boys left.",
    "One-eighth of the girls left early, so calculate that: 240 / 8 = 30 girls left.",
    "Calculate the remaining number of boys after some left: 360 - 90 = 270 boys stayed.",
    "Calculate the remaining number of girls after some left: 240 - 30 = 210 girls stayed.",
    "Add the remaining boys and girls to find the total number of people who stayed: 270 + 210 = 480 people."
