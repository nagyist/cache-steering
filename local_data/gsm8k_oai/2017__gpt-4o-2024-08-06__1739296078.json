  "query": "Jed\u2019s family wants to buy 6 different board games. Each board game costs $15 and Jed paid using a $100 bill. If the cashier gave Jed only $5 bills for his change, how many bills did Jed receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for 6 board games.",
    "Each board game costs $15.",
    "So, 6 board games will cost 6 * $15.",
    "6 * $15 equals $90.",
    "Jed paid with a $100 bill.",
    "I need to determine how much change Jed should receive.",
    "$100 (amount paid) - $90 (cost of the board games) equals $10.",
    "Jed should receive $10 in change.",
    "The cashier gives the change using only $5 bills.",
    "To find out how many $5 bills are in $10, I divide $10 by $5.",
    "$10 / $5 equals 2.",
    "Jed receives 2 bills of $5 each for his change."
