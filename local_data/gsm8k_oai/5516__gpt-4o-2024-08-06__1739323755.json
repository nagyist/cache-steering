  "steps": [
    "A cat has nine lives.",
    "A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So I need to subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has.",
    "9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6. So a dog has 6 lives.",
    "A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So I need to add 7 to the number of lives a dog has.",
    "6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13. So a mouse has 13 lives."
