  "query": "Bill is doing weight training before trying out for the boxing team. He gets two 2-gallon jugs and fills them 70% full with sand. If sand has a density of 5 pounds/gallon, how many pounds do Bill's improvised weights weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "Bill fills two 2-gallon jugs with sand.",
    "Each jug is filled 70% with sand.",
    "To find out how many gallons of sand are in each jug, calculate 70% of 2 gallons.",
    "70% of 2 gallons is 0.7 * 2 = 1.4 gallons.",
    "Each jug therefore contains 1.4 gallons of sand.",
    "The density of sand is 5 pounds per gallon.",
    "Calculate the weight of the sand in one jug by multiplying the gallons of sand with the density: 1.4 gallons * 5 pounds/gallon = 7 pounds.",
    "Both jugs together weigh 2 * 7 pounds = 14 pounds."

  "solution": "14"
