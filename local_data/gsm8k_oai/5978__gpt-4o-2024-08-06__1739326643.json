  "query": "Caitlin makes bracelets to sell at the farmer\u2019s market every weekend. Each bracelet takes twice as many small beads as it does large beads. If each bracelet uses 12 large beads, and Caitlin has 528 beads with equal amounts of large and small beads, how many bracelets can she make for this weekend?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many small beads and large beads are needed for each bracelet.",
    "Each bracelet uses 12 large beads.",
    "Each bracelet uses twice as many small beads as large beads.",
    "Calculate the number of small beads per bracelet: 2 times 12 large beads equals 24 small beads.",
    "For each bracelet, Caitlin needs 12 large beads and 24 small beads.",
    "Caitlin has a total of 528 beads, with an equal amount of large and small beads.",
    "Divide 528 beads equally between large and small beads: 528 / 2 equals 264 beads of each type.",
    "Determine the maximum number of bracelets based on large beads: 264 large beads divided by 12 large beads per bracelet equals 22 bracelets.",
    "Determine the maximum number of bracelets based on small beads: 264 small beads divided by 24 small beads per bracelet equals 11 bracelets.",
    "Caitlin can make the number of bracelets limited by the smaller quantity, which is based on the small beads."

  "solution": "11"
