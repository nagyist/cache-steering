  "query": "The leak in Jerry's roof drips 3 drops a minute into the pot he put under it. Each drop is 20 ml, and the pot holds 3 liters. How long will it take the pot to be full?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many milliliters are needed to fill the pot.",
    "I know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, so 3 liters is 3 * 1000 milliliters.",
    "3 liters = 3000 milliliters.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much water is dripping into the pot per minute.",
    "Each drop is 20 milliliters.",
    "There are 3 drops per minute.",
    "This means that 3 drops * 20 ml/drop = 60 milliliters are added to the pot each minute.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it will take to fill the pot.",
    "I need to divide the total volume of the pot by the amount of water added per minute.",
    "3000 milliliters / 60 milliliters/minute = 50 minutes."
