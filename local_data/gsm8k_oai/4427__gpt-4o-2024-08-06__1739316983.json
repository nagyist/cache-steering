  "query": "At the park, Naomi saw people riding 7 regular bikes and 11 children\u2019s bikes.  Regular bikes have 2 wheels and kid\u2019s bikes have 4 wheels.  How many wheels did Naomi see at the park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many wheels are on the regular bikes.",
    "There are 7 regular bikes and each has 2 wheels.",
    "To find the total wheels on the regular bikes, I multiply 7 bikes by 2 wheels per bike.",
    "7 bikes * 2 wheels per bike = 14 wheels",
    "Next, I need to determine how many wheels are on the children\u2019s bikes.",
    "There are 11 children\u2019s bikes and each has 4 wheels.",
    "To find the total wheels on the children\u2019s bikes, I multiply 11 bikes by 4 wheels per bike.",
    "11 bikes * 4 wheels per bike = 44 wheels",
    "Now, I add the total wheels from the regular bikes and the children\u2019s bikes to find the total number of wheels Naomi saw.",
    "14 wheels from regular bikes + 44 wheels from children\u2019s bikes = 58 wheels"

  "solution": "58"
