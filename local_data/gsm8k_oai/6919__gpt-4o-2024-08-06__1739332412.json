  "query": "In Mr. Bolton's class of 25 students, 2/5 of the students like maths, 1/3 of the remaining students like science, and the rest of the students like history. Calculate the combined total number of students who like history and those who like maths.",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of students in Mr. Bolton's class is 25.",
    "2/5 of these students like maths.",
    "To calculate the number of students who like maths, multiply 25 by 2/5.",
    "25 * (2/5) = 10",
    "So, 10 students like maths.",
    "Subtract the number of students who like maths from the total number of students to find the remaining students.",
    "25 - 10 = 15",
    "1/3 of the remaining students like science.",
    "To calculate the number of students who like science, multiply the remaining 15 students by 1/3.",
    "15 * (1/3) = 5",
    "So, 5 students like science.",
    "Subtract the number of students who like science from the remaining 15 students to find the number of students who like history.",
    "15 - 5 = 10",
    "So, 10 students like history.",
    "Combine the number of students who like history and those who like maths.",
    "10 (maths) + 10 (history) = 20"

  "solution": "20"
