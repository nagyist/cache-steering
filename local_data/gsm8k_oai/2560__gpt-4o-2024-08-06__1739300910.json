  "query": "Mr. Smith has incurred a 2% finance charge because he was not able to pay on time for his balance worth $150. If he plans to settle his balance today, how much will Mr. Smith pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out what the 2% finance charge on the $150 balance is.",
    "To do this, I calculate 2% of $150.",
    "2% as a decimal is 0.02.",
    "Multiply $150 by 0.02 to find the charge.",
    "$150 * 0.02 = $3.",
    "The finance charge is $3.",
    "Now, I add the finance charge to the original balance to find the total amount Mr. Smith needs to pay.",
    "$150 + $3 = $153."
