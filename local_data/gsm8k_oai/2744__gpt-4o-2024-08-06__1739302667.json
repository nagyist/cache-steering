  "query": "Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields. If a football field is 200 yards long and Ben's dog can run 400 feet/minute, how many minutes will it take his dog to fetch a potato he launches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the question. Ben's potato gun can launch a potato over a distance, and we need to determine how long it will take his dog to run and fetch the potato once it's launched.",
    "I know that Ben's gun can launch the potato 6 football fields.",
    "A football field is given as 200 yards long.",
    "I need to find out how long 6 football fields are in yards. So, multiplying 6 football fields by 200 yards per field gives 6 * 200 = 1200 yards.",
    "Now, I need to convert the distance in yards to feet. I know 1 yard equals 3 feet.",
    "Therefore, 1200 yards is equal to 1200 * 3 = 3600 feet.",
    "Ben's dog runs at a speed of 400 feet per minute.",
    "To find out how many minutes it will take the dog to run 3600 feet, I need to divide the total distance by the dog's speed.",
    "So, 3600 feet divided by 400 feet/minute = 3600 / 400 = 9 minutes."

  "solution": "9"
