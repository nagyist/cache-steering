  "query": "Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers.",
    "Kristin has 2 bell peppers. Since Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, Jaylen has 2 * 2 = 4 bell peppers.",
    "Kristin has 20 green beans. Half of Kristin's green beans is 20 / 2 = 10.",
    "Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, which is 10 - 3 = 7 green beans.",
    "Now, I will add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots, 2 cucumbers, 4 bell peppers, and 7 green beans.",
    "Adding them together: 5 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 18."

  "solution": "18"
