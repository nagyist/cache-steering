  "query": "Three days' temperatures were recorded for Bucyrus, Ohio. The temperatures were -14 degrees Fahrenheit, -8 degrees Fahrenheit, and +1 degree Fahrenheit. What was the average number of degrees (Fahrenheit) in Bucyrus, Ohio on the 3 days recorded?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the average temperature, I need to add together all the recorded temperatures.",
    "First, I add -14 degrees and -8 degrees. The result is -22 degrees.",
    "Next, I add the result from the previous step, -22 degrees, to +1 degree.",
    "-22 degrees plus +1 degree equals -21 degrees.",
    "Now I have the total sum of the temperatures, which is -21 degrees.",
    "I need to divide the total sum by the number of days to find the average temperature.",
    "There were 3 days, so I divide -21 degrees by 3.",
    "-21 degrees divided by 3 is -7 degrees."
