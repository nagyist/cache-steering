  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students entered the bus at the intermediate stop.",
    "There were initially 28 students on the bus.",
    "After stopping at the intersection, there were 58 students on the bus.",
    "I need to calculate the difference between the new number of students and the original number.",
    "58 - 28 = 30 students entered the bus at the intermediate stop.",
    "Now, I need to find 40% of the number of students who entered the bus.",
    "To find 40% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.4.",
    "30 * 0.4 = 12"
  ],
  "solution": "12"
