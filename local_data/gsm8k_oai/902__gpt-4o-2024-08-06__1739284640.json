  "query": "Troy had 300 straws. He fed 3/5 of the straws to the adult pigs and an equal number of straws to the piglets. If there were 20 piglets, how many straws did each piglet eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Troy had a total of 300 straws.",
    "He fed 3/5 of these straws to the adult pigs. To find out how many straws that is, I need to calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 300 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 300 = 180 \\). So, Troy fed 180 straws to the adult pigs.",
    "To find out how many straws Troy had left, I subtract the 180 straws given to the adult pigs from the original 300 straws.",
    "300 - 180 = 120. Troy had 120 straws remaining after feeding the adult pigs.",
    "The problem states that Troy fed an equal number of straws to the piglets as the remaining ones. Therefore, he fed all of the remaining 120 straws to the piglets.",
    "There were 20 piglets, and they ate the 120 straws equally.",
    "To find out how many straws each piglet ate, I divide the 120 straws by the number of piglets, which is 20.",
    "120 divided by 20 is 6."

  "solution": "6"
