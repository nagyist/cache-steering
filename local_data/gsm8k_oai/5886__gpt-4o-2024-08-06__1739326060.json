  "query": "At a middle school, 20% of the students are in the band. If 168 students are in the band, how many students go to the middle school?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that 20% of the students are in the band.",
    "I also know that 168 students are in the band.",
    "The term \"percent\" means per hundred, so 20% is equivalent to 20/100.",
    "To find the total number of students in the middle school, I can set up a proportion: 20/100 = 168/total number of students.",
    "I can solve this proportion for the total number of students by cross-multiplying.",
    "Cross-multiplying gives: 20 * (total number of students) = 168 * 100.",
    "Calculating 168 * 100 gives 16800.",
    "This gives me the equation: 20 * (total number of students) = 16800.",
    "To find the total number of students, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 20.",
    "16800 divided by 20 equals 840.",
    "I need to verify the calculation to make sure it's correct.",
    "I re-calculate 16800 \u00f7 20 and confirm it equals 840.",
    "Therefore, the total number of students in the middle school is 840."

  "solution": "840"
