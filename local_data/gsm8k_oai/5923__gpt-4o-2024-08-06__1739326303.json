  "query": "On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, there are three fireflies.",
    "The problem mentions they are joined by \"four less than a dozen\" more fireflies.",
    "A dozen is 12.",
    "Four less than a dozen is 12 - 4.",
    "12 - 4 equals 8.",
    "So, eight additional fireflies joined the initial group.",
    "Adding the initial three fireflies to the eight that joined: 3 + 8 equals 11.",
    "Two fireflies then flew away.",
    "Subtracting two fireflies from 11 leaves 11 - 2.",
    "11 - 2 equals 9."
