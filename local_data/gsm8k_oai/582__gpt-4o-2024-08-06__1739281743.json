  "query": "Haruto has tomato plants in his backyard. This year the plants grew 127 tomatoes. Birds had eaten 19 of the tomatoes. He picked the rest. If Haruto gave half of his tomatoes to his friend, how many tomatoes does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Haruto started with 127 tomatoes in total.",
    "Birds ate 19 of the tomatoes.",
    "To find out how many tomatoes Haruto had left after the birds ate some, I subtract 19 from 127.",
    "127 - 19 = 108 tomatoes",
    "Haruto picked 108 tomatoes.",
    "He gave half of these tomatoes to his friend.",
    "To find out how many tomatoes Haruto gave to his friend, I divide 108 by 2.",
    "108 / 2 = 54 tomatoes given to his friend",
    "To find out how many tomatoes Haruto has left, I subtract the 54 tomatoes he gave away from the 108 tomatoes he picked.",
    "108 - 54 = 54 tomatoes"
  ],
  "solution": "54"
