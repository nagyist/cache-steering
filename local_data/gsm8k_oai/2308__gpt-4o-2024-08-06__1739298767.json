  "query": "Peggy fell off her bike and skinned her knees.  She needed two bandages on her left knee and three bandages on her right knee.  If the box of bandages had 8 less than two dozen bandages before Peggy skinned her knees, how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of bandages in the box initially. Two dozen bandages means 24 bandages.",
    "The problem states that there are 8 less than two dozen bandages. Therefore, I subtract 8 from 24.",
    "24 - 8 = 16, so there were initially 16 bandages in the box.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many bandages Peggy used in total. She used 2 bandages on her left knee.",
    "Peggy also used 3 bandages on her right knee.",
    "Adding these together, 2 bandages + 3 bandages = 5 bandages.",
    "Now I need to determine how many bandages are left in the box after she used 5 bandages.",
    "I subtract the number of bandages used from the initial number of bandages. 16 bandages - 5 bandages = 11 bandages."
  ],
  "solution": "11"
