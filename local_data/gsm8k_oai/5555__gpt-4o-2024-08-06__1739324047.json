  "query": "Tilly counts 120 stars to the east of her house and six times that number to the west. How many stars does she count total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stars Tilly counts to the west.",
    "She counts six times the number of stars to the west compared to the east.",
    "She counts 120 stars to the east.",
    "To find the number of stars she counts to the west, I multiply 120 by 6.",
    "120 times 6 equals 720.",
    "Tilly counts 720 stars to the west.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of stars Tilly counts.",
    "I add the number of stars counted to the east and to the west together.",
    "120 (east) plus 720 (west) equals 840.",
    "The total number of stars Tilly counts is 840."
