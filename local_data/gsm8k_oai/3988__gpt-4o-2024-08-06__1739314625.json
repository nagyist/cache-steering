  "query": "DJ Snake's friends decided to give him treats to celebrate his engagement. Moksi took him and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night. Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000, and Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them. What was the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the gift from Moksi. He spends $4000 per night for two nights.",
    "The cost for two nights is 2 multiplied by $4000.",
    "2 nights times $4000 per night equals $8000.",
    "Next, I consider the gift from Lil Jon. He buys a car worth $30000.",
    "Lil Jon's gift value is straightforwardly $30000.",
    "Wynter's gift is a house worth four times the value of Lil Jon's car.",
    "The value of the car is $30000, so four times that value is 4 multiplied by $30000.",
    "4 times $30000 equals $120000.",
    "Now, I will add up the values of all the gifts.",
    "Moksi's gift = $8000, Lil Jon's gift = $30000, Wynter's gift = $120000.",
    "Add these together: $8000 + $30000 + $120000.",
    "The sum is $158000."

  "solution": "158000"
