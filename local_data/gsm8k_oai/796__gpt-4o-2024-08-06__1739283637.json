  "query": "Carla can cook a batch of waffles in 10 minutes and chicken-fried steak in 6 minutes. How long will it take her to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes Carla to cook one chicken-fried steak.",
    "I see that Carla can cook one chicken-fried steak in 6 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how long it would take her to cook 3 chicken-fried steaks.",
    "Since each steak takes 6 minutes, I multiply 6 minutes by 3 steaks.",
    "6 minutes per steak times 3 steaks equals 18 minutes.",
    "Now I know it takes 18 minutes to cook 3 chicken-fried steaks.",
    "I also need to determine how long it takes her to cook a batch of waffles.",
    "Carla can cook one batch of waffles in 10 minutes.",
    "To find the total cooking time, I need to add the time to cook the steaks and the time to cook the waffles.",
    "18 minutes for the steaks plus 10 minutes for the waffles equals 28 minutes."

  "solution": "28"
