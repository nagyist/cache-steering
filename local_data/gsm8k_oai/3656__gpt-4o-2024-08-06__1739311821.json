  "query": "A hand-crank pencil sharpener can sharpen one pencil every forty-five seconds. An electric version can sharpen one in twenty seconds. How many more pencils can the electric sharpener sharpen than the hand-crank sharpener in six minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pencils each type of sharpener can sharpen in six minutes.",
    "Six minutes is equivalent to 6 \u00d7 60 = 360 seconds.",
    "The hand-crank sharpener can sharpen one pencil every 45 seconds.",
    "To find out how many pencils the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen in 360 seconds, I divide 360 by 45.",
    "360 \u00f7 45 = 8. So, the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 8 pencils in six minutes.",
    "The electric sharpener can sharpen one pencil every 20 seconds.",
    "To find out how many pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen in 360 seconds, I divide 360 by 20.",
    "360 \u00f7 20 = 18. So, the electric sharpener can sharpen 18 pencils in six minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen compared to the hand-crank sharpener in the same amount of time.",
    "The electric sharpener can sharpen 18 pencils and the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 8 pencils in six minutes.",
    "18 - 8 = 10. Thus, the electric sharpener can sharpen 10 more pencils than the hand-crank sharpener in six minutes."
