  "query": "Jude bought three chairs for his house, all at the same price. He also bought a table that costs $50 and two sets of plates at $20 for each set. After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change. How much did each of the chairs cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount Jude actually paid after getting the $4 change.",
    "Jude gave the cashier $130 and received $4 back, so he paid $130 - $4 = $126.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total cost of the table and the plates.",
    "The table cost $50.",
    "The cost for the two sets of plates is 2 sets * $20 per set = $40.",
    "The total cost for the table and plates together is $50 + $40 = $90.",
    "Now, subtract the cost of the table and plates from the total amount Jude paid to find the cost of the three chairs.",
    "The amount spent on the chairs is $126 - $90 = $36.",
    "Jude bought three chairs, all at the same price, and their total cost is $36.",
    "To find the cost of each chair, divide the total cost of the chairs by the number of chairs: $36 / 3 = $12."
