  "query": "Alexander Bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson. If Christopher bought 80 joggers, how many more joggers does Christopher buy than Alexander?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by identifying how many joggers Tyson bought.",
    "Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson. We know Christopher bought 80 joggers.",
    "Since Christopher bought 80 joggers, and this amount is 20 times what Tyson bought, we set up an equation: 20 * (Tyson's joggers) = 80.",
    "Solving for Tyson's joggers, we divide both sides by 20: Tyson's joggers = 80 / 20.",
    "So, Tyson bought 4 joggers.",
    "Now, let's figure out how many joggers Alexander bought.",
    "Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. Since Tyson bought 4 joggers, Alexander bought 4 + 22 joggers.",
    "This means Alexander bought 26 joggers.",
    "Finally, we need to find out how many more joggers Christopher buys than Alexander.",
    "We subtract the number of joggers Alexander bought from the number of joggers Christopher bought: 80 - 26."
