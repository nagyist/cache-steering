  "query": "Francine has five full boxes of crayons and 5 loose crayons, and her friend has 27 loose crayons. They need to put all of their loose crayons in a box. How many more boxes do they need if Francine has a total of 85 crayons?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Francine has five full boxes of crayons, 5 loose crayons, and a total of 85 crayons.",
    "To find out how many crayons are in each box, I need to subtract the 5 loose crayons from Francine's total number of crayons.",
    "85 total crayons minus 5 loose crayons equals 80 crayons that are in the boxes.",
    "Francine has five full boxes, so I need to divide 80 by 5 to find out how many crayons are in each box.",
    "80 divided by 5 equals 16, so there are 16 crayons in each box.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total number of loose crayons Francine and her friend have together.",
    "Francine has 5 loose crayons and her friend has 27 loose crayons.",
    "Adding the loose crayons together, 5 plus 27 equals 32 loose crayons.",
    "I need to figure out how many boxes are required to hold the 32 loose crayons.",
    "Each box can hold 16 crayons, so I need to divide 32 by 16 to find out the number of boxes required.",
    "32 divided by 16 equals 2.",
    "I determine that 2 additional boxes are needed to hold all 32 loose crayons."
