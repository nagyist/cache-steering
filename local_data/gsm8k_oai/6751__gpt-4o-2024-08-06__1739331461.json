  "query": "After buying shirts worth $27 from a store, Dennis received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins for his change. How much money did Dennis have initially?",
  "steps": [
    "Dennis received $2 in $10 bills for his change.",
    "Therefore, he received a total of $20 from the $10 bills.",
    "Dennis also received $3 in loose coins.",
    "So, the total change Dennis received is $20 + $3 = $23.",
    "Dennis initially paid with enough money to cover $27 for the shirts, plus the $23 in change he received back.",
    "Let\u2019s add the total change he received ($23) to the cost of the shirts ($27) to find the total amount of money Dennis had initially.",
    "$27 + $23 = $50"
