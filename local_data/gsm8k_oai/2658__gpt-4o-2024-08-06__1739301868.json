  "query": "Zander collected 100 stickers. He gave some of his stickers to his two friends, Andrew and Bill. Andrew received 1/5 of Zander's stickers, while Bill received 3/10 of the remaining stickers. How many stickers did Andrew give to his two friends?",
  "steps": [
    "Zander collected a total of 100 stickers.",
    "First, I need to determine how many stickers Andrew received.",
    "Andrew received 1/5 of Zander's stickers.",
    "1/5 of 100 stickers is calculated as 100 * (1/5) = 20 stickers.",
    "So, Andrew received 20 stickers from Zander.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many stickers Zander had left after giving some to Andrew.",
    "Zander had 100 - 20 = 80 stickers remaining.",
    "Bill received 3/10 of the remaining stickers.",
    "3/10 of the remaining 80 stickers is calculated as 80 * (3/10) = 24 stickers.",
    "So, Bill received 24 stickers.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the question being asked, which is how many stickers Andrew gave to his two friends.",
    "It looks like I misunderstood something, as the question asked how many stickers Andrew gave, but the problem indicates Andrew and Bill were given stickers by Zander.",
    "Therefore, the question intended to ask how many stickers Zander gave to his two friends.",
    "Zander gave Andrew 20 stickers and Bill 24 stickers.",
    "In total, Zander gave away 20 + 24 = 44 stickers to his two friends."
