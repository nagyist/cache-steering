  "query": "When Herman\u2019s team is busy working on large projects he stops at the drive-through 5 days, every week to buy a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team.  Each meal costs $4.00.  This current project will last 16 weeks.  How much will Herman spend on breakfast?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many meals Herman buys each day. Herman buys breakfast for himself and 3 members of his team, so he buys a total of 1 + 3 = 4 meals each day.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of meals he buys in a week. Since Herman stops at the drive-through 5 days a week, he buys 5 days * 4 meals per day = 20 meals each week.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total cost of these meals in one week. Each meal costs $4.00, so 20 meals * $4.00 per meal = $80.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total cost over the entire duration of the project. The project lasts 16 weeks. Therefore, Herman will spend $80 per week * 16 weeks = $1,280."

  "solution": "1280"
