  "query": "Juvy has a garden that has 20 rows with 10 plants in each row. She plants parsley in the first 3 rows and rosemary in the last two rows. The rest of the rows will be planted with chives. How many chives will Juvy plant?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of rows in Juvy's garden.",
    "The garden has a total of 20 rows.",
    "Juvy plants parsley in the first 3 rows.",
    "Juvy plants rosemary in the last 2 rows.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of rows left for planting chives.",
    "The number of rows used for parsley and rosemary is 3 rows + 2 rows = 5 rows.",
    "Subtract the 5 rows from the total 20 rows to find how many rows are left for chives: 20 - 5 = 15 rows.",
    "Now, I determine how many plants are in each row.",
    "There are 10 plants in each row.",
    "To find the total number of chives, multiply the number of rows planted with chives (15 rows) by the number of plants per row (10 plants/row).",
    "15 rows * 10 plants/row = 150 chives."
  ],
  "solution": "150"
