  "query": "Percius has a collection of marbles. 40% of them are clear. 20% are black, and the remainder are all the other colors. A friend of his asks if he can take five marbles. On average, how many marbles of other colors will his friend end up getting?",
  "steps": [
    "Percius has a collection of marbles. We don't know the exact number of marbles, but we know the percentages of different types of marbles.",
    "40% of the marbles are clear.",
    "20% of the marbles are black.",
    "The marbles that are neither clear nor black form the remainder of the collection.",
    "To find the percentage of marbles that are of other colors, we add the percentages of clear and black marbles and subtract from 100%.",
    "Add 40% (clear) and 20% (black) to get 60%.",
    "Subtract 60% from 100% to get 40%. So, 40% of the marbles are of other colors.",
    "The friend takes 5 marbles at random from the collection.",
    "We need to find the expected number of marbles of other colors that his friend ends up getting.",
    "Since 40% of the marbles are of other colors, the probability that a single randomly selected marble is of another color is 0.4.",
    "The expected value of a certain event happening (e.g., selecting a marble of another color) when repeated several times is the sum of the probabilities over those repetitions.",
    "For 5 marbles, we calculate the expected number of marbles of other colors as 5 * 0.4.",
    "Calculate 5 * 0.4 to get the expected number of marbles of other colors.",
    "5 * 0.4 equals 2."
