  "query": "John decides to replace all his VHS with DVDs.  He can trade in his VHS for $2 each and then buy the DVDs for $10 each.  If he has 100 movies, how much does it cost to replace his movies?",
  "steps": [
    "John has 100 VHS. He can trade each VHS for $2.",
    "If he trades in 100 VHS, he will receive 100 * $2 = $200.",
    "John wants to buy 100 DVDs to replace his 100 VHS.",
    "Each DVD costs $10, so 100 DVDs will cost 100 * $10 = $1000.",
    "To find the total cost of replacing the VHS with DVDs, we need to subtract the trade-in amount from the total cost of the DVDs.",
    "The total cost of the DVDs is $1000, and he receives $200 from trading in the VHS.",
    "So, the net cost will be $1000 - $200 = $800."

  "solution": "800"
