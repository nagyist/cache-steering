  "query": "Jim ran 16 miles in 2 hours while Frank ran 20 miles in 2 hours. How many more miles did Frank run than Jim in an hour?",
  "steps": [
    "Jim ran 16 miles in 2 hours.",
    "To find out how many miles Jim ran in one hour, I divide 16 miles by 2 hours.",
    "16 miles \u00f7 2 hours = 8 miles per hour.",
    "Jim runs 8 miles in one hour.",
    "Frank ran 20 miles in 2 hours.",
    "To find out how many miles Frank ran in one hour, I divide 20 miles by 2 hours.",
    "20 miles \u00f7 2 hours = 10 miles per hour.",
    "Frank runs 10 miles in one hour.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more miles Frank ran than Jim in an hour.",
    "I subtract Jim's miles per hour from Frank's miles per hour.",
    "10 miles per hour - 8 miles per hour = 2 miles per hour."
