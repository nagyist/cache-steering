  "query": "Maria is baking cookies for Sally. Sally says that she wants 1/4 of her cookies to have nuts in them, 40% to have chocolate chips in them, and the remainder to have nuts and chocolate chips in them. When she adds nuts to the cookies, she uses 2 nuts per cookie. If she makes 60 cookies, how many nuts does she need?",
  "steps": [
    "Maria is making 60 cookies in total.",
    "Sally wants 1/4 of the cookies to have nuts in them.",
    "1/4 of 60 cookies is 60 / 4 = 15 cookies.",
    "Sally wants 40% of the cookies to have chocolate chips in them.",
    "40% of 60 cookies is 0.40 * 60 = 24 cookies.",
    "The remainder of the cookies will have both nuts and chocolate chips.",
    "To find how many cookies have both ingredients, subtract the sum of cookies with only nuts and only chocolate chips from the total.",
    "Cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips = 60 - (15 + 24) = 60 - 39 = 21 cookies.",
    "The cookies with only nuts have 2 nuts per cookie.",
    "For the 15 cookies that have only nuts, the total number of nuts needed is 15 * 2 = 30 nuts.",
    "The cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips also have 2 nuts per cookie.",
    "For the 21 cookies with both nuts and chocolate chips, the total number of nuts needed is 21 * 2 = 42 nuts.",
    "Adding the nuts for cookies with only nuts and cookies with both ingredients gives the total number of nuts needed.",
    "Total nuts needed = 30 nuts (for cookies with only nuts) + 42 nuts (for cookies with both) = 72 nuts."
