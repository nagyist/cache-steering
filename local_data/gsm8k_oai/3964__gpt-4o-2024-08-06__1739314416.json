  "query": "A conference center has six rooms. Each room can hold up to 80 people. Today, the conference center is only 2/3 full. How many people are in the conference center?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total maximum capacity of the conference center.",
    "There are six rooms and each room can hold up to 80 people.",
    "The total capacity is calculated by multiplying 6 (rooms) by 80 (people per room).",
    "6 multiplied by 80 equals 480.",
    "So, the total maximum capacity of the conference center is 480 people.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people are there when the center is 2/3 full.",
    "To find 2/3 of the total capacity, I multiply 480 by 2/3.",
    "First calculate 480 divided by 3, which equals 160.",
    "Then, multiply 160 by 2 to find 2/3 of the capacity.",
    "160 multiplied by 2 equals 320.",
    "Therefore, when the conference center is 2/3 full, there are 320 people in it."

  "solution": "320"
