  "steps": [
    "Johnny makes his crab dish 40 times a day.",
    "Each dish uses 1.5 pounds of crab meat.",
    "First, I need to find out how many pounds of crab meat Johnny uses in one day.",
    "Johnny uses 40 dishes * 1.5 pounds per dish = 60 pounds of crab meat per day.",
    "Crab meat sells for $8 per pound.",
    "I need to find out the cost of the crab meat used each day.",
    "The daily cost is 60 pounds * $8 per pound = $480.",
    "Johnny is closed 3 days a week, meaning he is open 4 days a week.",
    "Next, I calculate the weekly cost by multiplying the daily cost by the number of open days.",
    "Weekly cost is $480 per day * 4 days = $1920."

  "solution": "1920"
