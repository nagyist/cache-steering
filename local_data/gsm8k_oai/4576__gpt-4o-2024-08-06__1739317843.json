  "query": "Carter is a professional drummer.  He goes through 5 sets of drum sticks per show.  After the end of each show, he tosses 6 new drum stick sets to audience members.  He does this for 30 nights straight.  How many sets of drum sticks does he go through?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many sets of drum sticks Carter uses per show.",
    "Carter uses 5 sets of drum sticks during each show.",
    "Carter also tosses 6 sets of drum sticks to the audience after each show.",
    "That means he goes through a total of 5 + 6 = 11 sets of drum sticks for each show.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many shows Carter performs. He performs for 30 nights.",
    "Now, I can calculate the total number of sets of drum sticks he goes through by multiplying the number of sets per show by the number of shows.",
    "So, 11 sets per show multiplied by 30 shows equals 11 * 30.",
    "Calculating 11 * 30 gives me 330."

  "solution": "330"
