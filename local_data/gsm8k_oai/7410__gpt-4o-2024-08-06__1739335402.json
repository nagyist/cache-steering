  "query": "Boris has 24 books and he donates a fourth of his books to the library. Cameron has 30 books and he donates a third of his books to the library. After donating their books, how many books in total do Boris and Cameron have together?",
  "steps": [
    "Boris initially has 24 books.",
    "Boris donates a fourth of his books to the library.",
    "Calculate one-fourth of 24 books.",
    "One-fourth of 24 is 24 / 4, which equals 6.",
    "Boris donates 6 books.",
    "Subtract the 6 books Boris donates from his initial 24 books.",
    "24 - 6 = 18.",
    "Boris has 18 books left after his donation.",
    "Cameron initially has 30 books.",
    "Cameron donates a third of his books to the library.",
    "Calculate one-third of 30 books.",
    "One-third of 30 is 30 / 3, which equals 10.",
    "Cameron donates 10 books.",
    "Subtract the 10 books Cameron donates from his initial 30 books.",
    "30 - 10 = 20.",
    "Cameron has 20 books left after his donation.",
    "Add the number of books Boris and Cameron have after donations.",
    "Boris has 18 books and Cameron has 20 books.",
    "18 + 20 = 38."
