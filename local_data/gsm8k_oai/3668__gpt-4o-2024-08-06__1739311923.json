  "query": "Anderson makes mud masks for spa treatments. In every batch of mud that he mixes, he adds three sprigs of mint, and he adds two green tea leaves for every sprig of mint. He had to switch to a different kind of mud, which makes the other ingredients he adds half as effective. How many green tea leaves should Anderson add to a new batch of mud to get the same efficacy as before?",
  "steps": [
    "In the original batch, Anderson uses three sprigs of mint.",
    "For each sprig of mint, he adds two green tea leaves.",
    "Therefore, for three sprigs of mint, the number of green tea leaves added is 2 leaves/sprig * 3 sprigs = 6 leaves.",
    "Now, the new mud makes the other ingredients half as effective.",
    "To maintain the same efficacy, Anderson needs to use double the number of green tea leaves.",
    "Doubling the original number of green tea leaves means he should add 6 leaves * 2 = 12 leaves."
