  "query": "Carmen had 28 cats and 18 dogs before she gave 3 of the cats up for adoption. How many more cats than dogs does Carmen have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Carmen originally had 28 cats.",
    "Carmen gave 3 cats up for adoption.",
    "I will subtract 3 from 28 to find out how many cats are left.",
    "28 - 3 equals 25.",
    "So, now Carmen has 25 cats.",
    "Carmen originally had 18 dogs.",
    "The number of dogs did not change.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many more cats than dogs Carmen has.",
    "I will subtract the number of dogs from the number of cats.",
    "25 cats - 18 dogs equals 7."
