  "query": "Micah can type 20 words per minute and Isaiah can type 40 words per minute. How many more words can Isaiah type than Micah in an hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many minutes are in an hour, which is 60 minutes.",
    "Micah can type 20 words per minute. So, to find out how many words Micah can type in an hour, I need to multiply his typing speed by the number of minutes in an hour.",
    "Micah's typing speed is 20 words per minute. 20 words/minute multiplied by 60 minutes equals 1200 words in an hour.",
    "Isaiah can type 40 words per minute. I will now calculate how many words Isaiah can type in an hour.",
    "Isaiah's typing speed is 40 words per minute. 40 words/minute multiplied by 60 minutes equals 2400 words in an hour.",
    "I need to find out how many more words Isaiah can type than Micah in an hour by subtracting the number of words typed by Micah from the number of words typed by Isaiah in an hour.",
    "Isaiah types 2400 words in an hour and Micah types 1200 words in an hour. So, 2400 words minus 1200 words equals 1200 words."
