  "query": "For Roger's phone to function optimally, he can have a maximum of 50 apps on his phone. However, the recommended number of apps is 35. If Roger has twice the recommended number of apps, how many apps must he delete for his phone to function optimally again?",
  "steps": [
    "The maximum number of apps Roger's phone can handle optimally is 50.",
    "The recommended number of apps is 35.",
    "Roger currently has twice the recommended number of apps on his phone.",
    "Twice the recommended number of apps is 2 times 35, which equals 70.",
    "Roger has 70 apps currently on his phone.",
    "To function optimally, Roger needs no more than 50 apps.",
    "The difference between his current number of apps (70) and the maximum optimal number of apps (50) is 70 - 50.",
    "70 - 50 equals 20."
