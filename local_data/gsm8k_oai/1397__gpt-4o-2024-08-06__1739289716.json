  "query": "Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?",
  "steps": [
    "Marly adds 2 quarts of milk to the soup.",
    "He adds three times as much chicken stock as milk, so he adds 3 times 2 quarts of chicken stock.",
    "3 times 2 quarts of chicken stock is 6 quarts of chicken stock.",
    "He also adds 1 quart of pureed vegetables.",
    "The total amount of soup is the sum of milk, chicken stock, and pureed vegetables.",
    "The total amount of soup is 2 (milk) + 6 (chicken stock) + 1 (vegetables) = 9 quarts.",
    "Each bag can hold 3 quarts of soup.",
    "To find out how many bags he needs, divide the total amount of soup by the capacity of each bag.",
    "Divide 9 quarts by 3 quarts per bag.",
    "9 divided by 3 is 3."
