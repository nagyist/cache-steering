  "query": "Spot sells cookies in bags and boxes. Each bag has 7 cookies. Each box has 12 cookies.  How many more cookies are in 8 boxes than there are in 9 bags?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the number of cookies in 9 bags.",
    "Each bag contains 7 cookies.",
    "Therefore, 9 bags contain 9 * 7 cookies.",
    "9 * 7 equals 63.",
    "There are 63 cookies in 9 bags.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of cookies in 8 boxes.",
    "Each box contains 12 cookies.",
    "Therefore, 8 boxes contain 8 * 12 cookies.",
    "8 * 12 equals 96.",
    "There are 96 cookies in 8 boxes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more cookies are in 8 boxes than in 9 bags.",
    "I subtract the number of cookies in 9 bags from the number of cookies in 8 boxes.",
    "96 - 63 equals 33.",
