  "query": "Heather made four times as many pizzas as Craig made on their first day at work at Mr. Pizza Inns. On their second day, Heather made 20 fewer pizzas than Craig's number. If Craig made 40 pizzas on their first day and 60 more pizzas on their second day than their first day, calculate the total number of pizzas the two made together in the two days.",
  "steps": [
    "Craig made 40 pizzas on their first day.",
    "Heather made four times as many pizzas as Craig on the first day, so Heather made 4 * 40 pizzas.",
    "Calculating Heather's pizzas on the first day: 4 * 40 = 160 pizzas.",
    "On the second day, Craig made 60 more pizzas than he made on the first day.",
    "Craig made 40 + 60 pizzas on the second day.",
    "Calculating Craig's second-day pizzas: 40 + 60 = 100 pizzas.",
    "Heather made 20 fewer pizzas than Craig on the second day.",
    "Calculating Heather's pizzas on the second day: 100 - 20 pizzas.",
    "Calculating Heather's second-day pizzas: 100 - 20 = 80 pizzas.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total pizzas Craig made over the two days.",
    "Craig's total pizzas: 40 (first day) + 100 (second day).",
    "Calculating Craig's total pizzas: 40 + 100 = 140 pizzas.",
    "Next, calculate the total pizzas Heather made over the two days.",
    "Heather's total pizzas: 160 (first day) + 80 (second day).",
    "Calculating Heather's total pizzas: 160 + 80 = 240 pizzas.",
    "Finally, I will add Craig's and Heather's total pizzas to find the total number of pizzas made together.",
    "Total pizzas made together: 140 + 240.",
    "Calculating the total number of pizzas made together: 140 + 240 = 380 pizzas."
