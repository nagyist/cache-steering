  "query": "Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of squares in the grid is the number of rows multiplied by the number of squares in each row.",
    "There are 10 rows and 15 squares in each row, so the total number of squares is 10 * 15 = 150.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of squares that are colored red. Marla colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle.",
    "4 rows of 6 squares each means 4 * 6 = 24 squares are colored red.",
    "Marla colors all the squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows blue. Each of these 4 rows has 15 squares.",
    "4 rows * 15 squares per row = 60 squares are colored blue.",
    "To find out how many squares are colored green, I subtract the number of squares that are colored red and blue from the total number of squares.",
    "150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 squares."

  "solution": "66"
