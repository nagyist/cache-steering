  "query": "There are 248 pages in a book. Joanna can read 16 pages per hour. On Monday, she reads for 3 hours. On Tuesday, she reads for 6.5 hours. How many more hours does she need to read to finish the book?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many pages Joanna reads on Monday.",
    "Joanna reads 16 pages per hour and she reads for 3 hours on Monday.",
    "So, on Monday she reads 16 * 3 = 48 pages.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many pages Joanna reads on Tuesday.",
    "Joanna reads 16 pages per hour and she reads for 6.5 hours on Tuesday.",
    "So, on Tuesday she reads 16 * 6.5 = 104 pages.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of pages she has read on both days.",
    "Joanna reads 48 pages on Monday and 104 pages on Tuesday.",
    "So, she has read 48 + 104 = 152 pages in total.",
    "The book has 248 pages in total.",
    "To find out how many pages are left, I subtract the number of pages she has read from the total pages.",
    "248 - 152 = 96 pages are left to read.",
    "Joanna can read 16 pages per hour.",
    "To find out how many more hours she needs to read, I divide the remaining pages by the pages she can read per hour.",
    "96 / 16 = 6",
    "Joanna needs to read for 6 more hours to finish the book."

  "solution": "6"
