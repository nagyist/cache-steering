  "query": "Mr. Dor\u00e9 bought $140 worth of pants, a $43 shirt and a $15 tie. He pays with a $200 bill. How much will the saleswoman give him back?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total amount Mr. Dor\u00e9 spent on clothing.",
    "Mr. Dor\u00e9 spent $140 on pants.",
    "He also spent $43 on the shirt.",
    "Additionally, he spent $15 on the tie.",
    "Now, let's calculate the sum of these expenses: $140 (pants) + $43 (shirt) + $15 (tie).",
    "First, add $140 and $43. That equals $183.",
    "Next, add $15 to $183. This totals $198.",
    "So, Mr. Dor\u00e9 spent a total of $198.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much change the saleswoman will give him back.",
    "He paid with a $200 bill.",
    "I subtract the total amount spent ($198) from the amount he paid ($200).",
    "$200 minus $198 equals $2.",
    "Therefore, the saleswoman will give Mr. Dor\u00e9 $2 back."
