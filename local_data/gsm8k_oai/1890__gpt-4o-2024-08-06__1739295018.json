  "query": "Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate each person's folding rate per minute.",
    "Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes, so her rate is 3 towels / 5 minutes = 0.6 towels per minute.",
    "Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, so her rate is 5 towels / 10 minutes = 0.5 towels per minute.",
    "Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes, so his rate is 7 towels / 20 minutes = 0.35 towels per minute.",
    "Now I need to find their combined rate per minute by adding their individual rates.",
    "The combined rate per minute is 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.35 towels per minute.",
    "Performing the addition: 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1, then 1.1 + 0.35 = 1.45.",
    "Their combined rate is 1.45 towels per minute.",
    "Now I need to find out how many towels they can fold in one hour, which is 60 minutes.",
    "Multiply their combined rate by 60 minutes to find the total number of towels: 1.45 towels/minute * 60 minutes = 87 towels."

  "solution": "87"
