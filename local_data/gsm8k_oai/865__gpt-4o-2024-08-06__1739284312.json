  "query": "Jenny has a tummy ache. Her brother Mike says that it is because Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate.  If Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, how many did Jenny eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many chocolate squares Mike ate.",
    "The problem states that Mike ate 20 chocolate squares.",
    "Next, I need to calculate thrice the number of chocolate squares Mike ate.",
    "To find thrice the number of chocolate squares Mike ate, I multiply 20 by 3.",
    "20 multiplied by 3 equals 60.",
    "Now, I need to add 5 to this result to find out how many chocolate squares Jenny ate.",
    "60 plus 5 equals 65.",
    "Therefore, Jenny ate 65 chocolate squares."
