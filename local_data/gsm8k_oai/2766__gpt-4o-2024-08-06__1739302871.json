    "Lara initially bought 52 stems of flowers.",
    "She gave 15 flowers to her mom.",
    "Now, let's calculate how many flowers she gave to her grandma.",
    "Lara gave 6 more flowers to her grandma than she gave to her mom.",
    "So, the number of flowers given to her grandma is 15 + 6.",
    "15 + 6 equals 21.",
    "Lara gave 21 flowers to her grandma.",
    "Now, let's determine the total number of flowers given away.",
    "She gave 15 flowers to her mom and 21 flowers to her grandma.",
    "15 + 21 equals 36.",
    "Lara gave away 36 flowers in total.",
