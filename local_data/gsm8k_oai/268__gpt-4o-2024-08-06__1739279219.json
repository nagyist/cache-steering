  "query": "Trevor buys several bouquets of carnations. The first included 9 carnations; the second included 14 carnations; the third included 13 carnations. What is the average number of carnations in the bouquets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of carnations in all the bouquets.",
    "The number of carnations in the first bouquet is 9.",
    "The number of carnations in the second bouquet is 14.",
    "The number of carnations in the third bouquet is 13.",
    "Now I add these numbers together: 9 + 14 + 13.",
    "9 + 14 equals 23.",
    "23 + 13 equals 36.",
    "The total number of carnations is 36.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many bouquets Trevor bought.",
    "Trevor bought 3 bouquets.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of carnations by the number of bouquets.",
    "36 divided by 3 equals 12.",
    "The average number of carnations per bouquet is 12."
