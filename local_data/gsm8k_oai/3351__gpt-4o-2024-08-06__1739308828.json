  "query": "Jefferson hires a carriage to go to the church.  It is 20 miles away.  The horse can go 10 miles per hour.  It cost $30 per hour plus a flat fee of $20.  How much did he pay for the carriage?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the time it takes for the carriage to travel 20 miles.",
    "The horse can go 10 miles per hour, and the distance to the church is 20 miles.",
    "To find the time, I use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "So, time = 20 miles / 10 miles per hour = 2 hours.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost for the time spent traveling.",
    "The cost per hour is $30.",
    "For 2 hours, the cost is 2 hours * $30/hour = $60.",
    "In addition to the hourly cost, there is a flat fee of $20.",
    "The total cost is the sum of the hourly cost and the flat fee.",
    "So, total cost = $60 + $20 = $80."

  "solution": "80"
