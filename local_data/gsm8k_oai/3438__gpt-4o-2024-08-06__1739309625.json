    "On the first day, Penn made $10.",
    "On the second day, Penn made $4 more than the first day.",
    "So, on the second day, Penn made $10 + $4 = $14.",
    "On the third day, Penn made $4 more than the second day.",
    "So, on the third day, Penn made $14 + $4 = $18.",
    "On the fourth day, Penn made $4 more than the third day.",
    "So, on the fourth day, Penn made $18 + $4 = $22.",
    "On the fifth day, Penn made $4 more than the fourth day.",
    "So, on the fifth day, Penn made $22 + $4 = $26.",
    "Now, let's sum up all the earnings from each day: $10 + $14 + $18 + $22 + $26.",
    "$10 + $14 = $24",
