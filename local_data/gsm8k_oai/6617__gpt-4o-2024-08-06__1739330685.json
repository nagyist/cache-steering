  "query": "Elsa and her sister watch an opera show every year at Central City Opera. Last year, opera seating cost $85 per ticket. This year, it costs $102. What is the percent increase in the cost of each ticket?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the percent increase, I first need to identify the difference in cost between this year and last year.",
    "The cost last year was $85, and this year it is $102.",
    "The difference in cost is $102 - $85.",
    "Subtracting the two gives me $17.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the percent increase based on the original cost, which is $85.",
    "To find the percent increase, I use the formula: (Difference/Original Cost) * 100%.",
    "Substitute the numbers into the formula: ($17/$85) * 100%.",
    "First, I calculate the fraction: $17 divided by $85.",
    "The division gives me approximately 0.2.",
    "Now, I multiply 0.2 by 100 to get the percentage.",
    "This results in a 20% increase."
