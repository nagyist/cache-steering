  "query": "Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces. If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate eat 75% of the pizzas, how many pizza pieces are left uneaten?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate how many pieces each person eats.",
    "Each personal pan pizza is cut into 4 pieces.",
    "Bill eats 50% of his pizza. 50% of 4 pieces is 2 pieces.",
    "Dale also eats 50% of his pizza, which is 2 pieces.",
    "Ann eats 75% of her pizza. 75% of 4 pieces is 3 pieces.",
    "Cate also eats 75% of her pizza, which is 3 pieces.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many pieces each person leaves uneaten.",
    "Bill leaves 4 - 2 = 2 pieces uneaten.",
    "Dale also leaves 4 - 2 = 2 pieces uneaten.",
    "Ann leaves 4 - 3 = 1 piece uneaten.",
    "Cate also leaves 4 - 3 = 1 piece uneaten.",
    "Now, I'll add up all the uneaten pieces.",
    "2 (Bill) + 2 (Dale) + 1 (Ann) + 1 (Cate) = 6 pieces uneaten in total."
