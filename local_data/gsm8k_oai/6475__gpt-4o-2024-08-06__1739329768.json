  "query": "Three times the sum of marbles that Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60. If Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen, and Atticus has 4 marbles, how many marbles does Cruz have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will note that three times the sum of the marbles Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz have is equal to 60.",
    "This means that the sum of their marbles is 60 divided by 3.",
    "60 divided by 3 is 20. Therefore, Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz together have 20 marbles.",
    "It is given that Atticus has 4 marbles.",
    "Also, Atticus has half as many marbles as Jensen.",
    "If Atticus has 4 marbles, and he has half as many marbles as Jensen, then Jensen must have 2 times 4 marbles.",
    "2 times 4 is 8, so Jensen has 8 marbles.",
    "Now I need to find out how many marbles Cruz has.",
    "Adding the marbles that Atticus and Jensen have, I get 4 (Atticus) + 8 (Jensen) = 12 marbles.",
    "Since Atticus, Jensen, and Cruz together have 20 marbles in total, I will subtract the 12 marbles from 20 to find how many marbles Cruz has.",
    "20 minus 12 is 8."

  "solution": "8"
