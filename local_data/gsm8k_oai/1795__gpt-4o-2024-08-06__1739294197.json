  "query": "Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",
  "steps": [
    "Jenny collected 30 red marbles.",
    "Since Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.",
    "Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.",
    "Jenny collected 25 blue marbles.",
    "Mary collected half the number of blue marbles as Anie. Let the number of blue marbles collected by Anie be B.",
    "Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles as Jenny, so B = 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.",
    "Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles.",
    "Now, let's add up the blue marbles collected by all three friends:",
    "Jenny collected 25 blue marbles.",
    "Mary collected 25 blue marbles.",
    "Anie collected 50 blue marbles.",
    "The total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50."
