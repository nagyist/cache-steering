  "query": "Sammy has 2 more bottle caps than Janine. Janine has 3 times as many bottle caps as Billie. If Billie has 2 bottle caps, how many does Sammy have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bottle caps Janine has.",
    "I know Janine has 3 times as many bottle caps as Billie.",
    "Billie has 2 bottle caps.",
    "So, Janine has 3 times 2, which is 6 bottle caps.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many bottle caps Sammy has.",
    "Sammy has 2 more bottle caps than Janine.",
    "Since Janine has 6 bottle caps, Sammy has 6 + 2 bottle caps.",
    "Adding these together, Sammy has 8 bottle caps."
