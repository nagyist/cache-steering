  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many pages Nate has already read by calculating 20% of the total pages.",
    "The book is 400 pages long, so I calculate 20% of 400.",
    "20% as a decimal is 0.20.",
    "I multiply 400 by 0.20 to find the number of pages read: 400 * 0.20 = 80.",
    "Nate has read 80 pages so far.",
    "To find out how many pages are left, I subtract the number of pages read from the total pages: 400 - 80.",
    "400 - 80 equals 320.",
    "Nate needs to read 320 more pages to finish the book."
