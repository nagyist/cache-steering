  "query": "Jerry is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each pine tree makes 80 logs, each maple tree makes 60 logs, and each walnut tree makes 100 logs. If Jerry cuts up 8 pine trees, 3 maple trees, and 4 walnut trees, how many logs does he get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of logs from the pine trees.",
    "Each pine tree makes 80 logs.",
    "Jerry cuts up 8 pine trees.",
    "I multiply 8 pine trees by 80 logs per tree.",
    "8 * 80 = 640 logs from the pine trees.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of logs from the maple trees.",
    "Each maple tree makes 60 logs.",
    "Jerry cuts up 3 maple trees.",
    "I multiply 3 maple trees by 60 logs per tree.",
    "3 * 60 = 180 logs from the maple trees.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of logs from the walnut trees.",
    "Each walnut tree makes 100 logs.",
    "Jerry cuts up 4 walnut trees.",
    "I multiply 4 walnut trees by 100 logs per tree.",
    "4 * 100 = 400 logs from the walnut trees.",
    "Finally, I add the logs from all the types of trees together to get the total.",
    "640 logs (pine) + 180 logs (maple) + 400 logs (walnut) = 1220 logs."

  "solution": "1220"
