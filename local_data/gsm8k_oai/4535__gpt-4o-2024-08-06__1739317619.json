  "query": "There are 26 chickens, 40 piglets, and 34 goats at Stacy\u2019s farm. A really bad storm hits and half of all the animals get sick. How many animals in total get sick?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many animals get sick in total.",
    "There are 26 chickens on the farm.",
    "There are 40 piglets on the farm.",
    "There are 34 goats on the farm.",
    "First, I need to find the total number of all animals on the farm.",
    "The total number of animals is 26 (chickens) + 40 (piglets) + 34 (goats).",
    "Calculating the total, 26 + 40 = 66.",
    "Next, I need to add 66 and 34 to find the overall total.",
    "66 + 34 = 100.",
    "There are 100 animals in total at the farm.",
    "According to the problem, half of all the animals get sick.",
    "To find out how many animals get sick, I need to calculate half of 100.",
    "100 divided by 2 equals 50.",
    "Therefore, 50 animals in total get sick after the storm."
