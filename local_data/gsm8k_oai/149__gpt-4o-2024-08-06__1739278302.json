  "query": "In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. If Ernesto is 11 years old, how many years old is Jayden now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how old Ernesto will be in 3 years.",
    "Currently, Ernesto is 11 years old.",
    "In 3 years, Ernesto will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.",
    "In 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age at that time.",
    "Half of Ernesto's age in 3 years will be 14 / 2 = 7 years old.",
    "So, in 3 years, Jayden will be 7 years old.",
    "Now, I need to determine Jayden's current age.",
    "Currently, it is 3 years before Jayden will be 7 years old.",
    "So, Jayden's current age is 7 - 3 = 4 years old."
