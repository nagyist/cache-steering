  "query": "Happy Island has 60 turtles. This means there are 10 more than 2 times as many turtles on Happy Island as on Lonely Island. How many turtles are there on Lonely Island?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of turtles on Lonely Island be x.",
    "We know that the number of turtles on Happy Island is 10 more than 2 times the number of turtles on Lonely Island.",
    "This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 10.",
    "It's given that Happy Island has 60 turtles.",
    "Therefore, we have the equation: 2x + 10 = 60.",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x: 2x = 60 - 10.",
    "This simplifies to: 2x = 50.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find x: x = 50 / 2.",
    "Therefore, x = 25."
