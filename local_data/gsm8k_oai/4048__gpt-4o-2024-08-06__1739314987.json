  "query": "Ivanka wrote a book that took her 3 more months than it took Woody to write a book. Woody spent 1.5 years writing his book. How many months in total did Ivanka and Woody need to write their books?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how long it took Woody to write his book in months.",
    "Woody spent 1.5 years writing his book.",
    "A year has 12 months. So, 1.5 years is 1.5 * 12 months.",
    "1.5 * 12 = 18 months.",
    "Woody took 18 months to write his book.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it took Ivanka to write her book.",
    "Ivanka took 3 more months than Woody to write her book.",
    "So she spent 18 + 3 months writing her book.",
    "18 + 3 = 21 months.",
    "Ivanka took 21 months to write her book.",
    "Now, I need to add the months Woody and Ivanka spent writing their books.",
    "Woody spent 18 months and Ivanka spent 21 months.",
    "18 + 21 = 39 months."

  "solution": "39"
