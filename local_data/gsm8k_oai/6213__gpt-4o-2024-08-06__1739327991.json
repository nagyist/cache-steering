  "query": "Sally bought 3 photograph frames, each costing her $3. She paid with a $20 bill. How much change did she get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the photograph frames.",
    "There are 3 frames, each costing $3.",
    "I will multiply the number of frames by the cost of each frame: 3 frames \u00d7 $3/frame = $9.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money Sally initially used to pay for the frames.",
    "Sally paid with a $20 bill.",
    "Next, I subtract the total cost of the frames from the amount Sally paid to find out how much change she should receive.",
    "$20 - $9 = $11.",
    "So, Sally received $11 in change."

  "solution": "11"
