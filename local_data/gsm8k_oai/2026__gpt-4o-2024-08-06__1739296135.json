  "query": "Inez has $150. She spends one-half on hockey skates and a certain amount on hockey pads. If Inez has $25 remaining, how much did the hockey pads cost, together, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Inez starts with $150.",
    "She spends one-half of $150 on hockey skates.",
    "One-half of $150 is $150 / 2 = $75.",
    "So, she spends $75 on hockey skates.",
    "She has $150 - $75 = $75 remaining after buying the skates.",
    "After buying the hockey pads, she has $25 remaining.",
    "The amount she spends on hockey pads can be found by subtracting the $25 remaining from the $75 she had after buying the skates.",
    "$75 - $25 = $50."
