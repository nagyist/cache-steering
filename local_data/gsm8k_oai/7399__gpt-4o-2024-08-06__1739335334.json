  "query": "There are six oranges in a fruit basket. There are two fewer apples than oranges.  There are 3 times as many bananas as apples, and there are half as many peaches as bananas.  How many pieces of fruit are in the fruit basket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let me find the number of apples. The problem states that there are two fewer apples than oranges.",
    "There are six oranges, so the number of apples is six minus two.",
    "Six minus two equals four, therefore there are four apples.",
    "Next, I will find the number of bananas. The problem mentions that there are three times as many bananas as apples.",
    "Since there are four apples, the number of bananas is three times four.",
    "Three times four equals twelve, so there are twelve bananas.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of peaches. The problem states that there are half as many peaches as bananas.",
    "Since there are twelve bananas, half of twelve is the number of peaches.",
    "Half of twelve equals six, so there are six peaches.",
    "Now, I will find the total number of pieces of fruit by adding all the fruit together.",
    "There are six oranges, four apples, twelve bananas, and six peaches.",
    "Adding these together: six (oranges) + four (apples) + twelve (bananas) + six (peaches).",
    "Six plus four is ten. Ten plus twelve is twenty-two. Twenty-two plus six is twenty-eight."

  "solution": "28"
