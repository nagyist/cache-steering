  "query": "It takes Jerome 6 hours to run the trail around the park and it takes Nero 3 hours. If Jerome runs at 4 MPH, what speed (in MPH) does Nero run in the park?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that speed is calculated as distance divided by time.",
    "Jerome runs at 4 MPH and it takes him 6 hours to run the trail.",
    "To find the distance of the trail, I can multiply Jerome's speed by his time: 4 MPH * 6 hours = 24 miles.",
    "Now I know the distance of the trail is 24 miles.",
    "It takes Nero 3 hours to run the 24-mile trail.",
    "To find Nero's speed, I divide the distance of the trail by the time it takes him: 24 miles / 3 hours.",
    "Performing the division gives 8 MPH."
