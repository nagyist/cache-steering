  "query": "Maurice had only been horseback riding a handful of times in his life. His best friend, Matt, goes horseback riding regularly. When Maurice went to visit Matt for two weeks, he rode another 8 times. Each time, Matt went with him. Meanwhile, besides the times that Matt accompanied Maurice, he rode an additional 16 times. If the total number of times Matt rode during that two weeks is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit, how many times had Maurice been horseback riding before visiting Matt?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm looking for the number of times Maurice rode before his visit, let's call this number \\( x \\).",
    "During his visit, Maurice rode 8 times. Since Maurice rode \\( x \\) times before his visit, the total number of times Maurice rode overall is \\( x + 8 \\).",
    "Matt accompanied Maurice for all 8 of these rides during the visit.",
    "In addition to these 8 rides, Matt rode an additional 16 times by himself during the visit.",
    "Therefore, during the two weeks, Matt rode a total of \\( 8 + 16 = 24 \\) times.",
    "The problem states that this total number of times Matt rode (24 times) is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit.",
    "This gives us the equation: \\( 3x = 24 \\).",
    "Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 3 to get \\( x = \\frac{24}{3} \\).",
    "Calculating that, we find \\( x = 8 \\)."
