  "query": "Claire has 400 flowers in her garden. One hundred twenty are tulips, and the rest are roses. Eighty of the roses are white, while the rest are red. Each red rose is worth $0.75. How much will Claire earn if she can sell 1/2 of the total number of red roses?",
  "steps": [
    "Claire has a total of 400 flowers.",
    "Out of the 400 flowers, 120 are tulips.",
    "The rest of the flowers are roses, so I need to subtract the number of tulips from the total number of flowers: 400 - 120.",
    "400 - 120 equals 280. So, there are 280 roses.",
    "Eighty of these roses are white.",
    "The remaining roses are red, so I need to subtract the number of white roses from the total number of roses: 280 - 80.",
    "280 - 80 equals 200. So, there are 200 red roses.",
    "Claire can sell 1/2 of the total number of red roses.",
    "I need to calculate 1/2 of 200 red roses: 200 * 1/2.",
    "200 * 1/2 equals 100. Claire can sell 100 red roses.",
    "Each red rose is worth $0.75.",
    "To find out how much Claire will earn, I need to multiply the number of red roses she can sell by the worth of each rose: 100 * 0.75.",
    "100 * 0.75 equals 75."
