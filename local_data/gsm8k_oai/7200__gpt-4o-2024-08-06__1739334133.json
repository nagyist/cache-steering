  "query": "Owen bred 21 turtles, and Johanna has 5 fewer turtles than Owen. After 1 month, Owen has twice as many turtles as before and Johanna loses half of her turtles and donates the rest to Owen. How many turtles did Owen have?",
  "steps": [
    "Owen originally bred 21 turtles.",
    "Johanna has 5 fewer turtles than Owen, which means Johanna has 21 - 5 = 16 turtles.",
    "After 1 month, Owen has twice as many turtles as before. So, Owen now has 2 * 21 = 42 turtles.",
    "Johanna loses half of her turtles. Originally, she had 16 turtles, so half of those is 16 / 2 = 8 turtles lost.",
    "The rest of Johanna's turtles, 8 (16 - 8 = 8), are donated to Owen.",
    "Owen had 42 turtles after 1 month and then receives 8 more turtles from Johanna's donation. So in total, Owen now has 42 + 8 = 50 turtles."
