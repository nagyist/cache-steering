  "query": "Sophie buys five cupcakes at $2 each,  six doughnuts at $1 each,  four slices of apple pie at $2 per slice, and fifteen cookies at $0.60 each. How much does she spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the cupcakes.",
    "Sophie buys five cupcakes at $2 each.",
    "The cost of cupcakes is 5 cupcakes * $2 = $10.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the doughnuts.",
    "Sophie buys six doughnuts at $1 each.",
    "The cost of doughnuts is 6 doughnuts * $1 = $6.",
    "Now, I calculate the total cost of apple pie slices.",
    "Sophie buys four slices of apple pie at $2 per slice.",
    "The cost of apple pie slices is 4 slices * $2 = $8.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the cookies.",
    "Sophie buys fifteen cookies at $0.60 each.",
    "The cost of cookies is 15 cookies * $0.60 = $9.",
    "Now, I add up all the costs to find the total amount Sophie spends.",
    "Total cost = cost of cupcakes + cost of doughnuts + cost of apple pie slices + cost of cookies.",
    "Total cost = $10 + $6 + $8 + $9.",
    "Total cost = $33."

  "solution": "33"
