  "query": "Eden, Mary and Iris gather sand to fill their sandbox. Eden carried 4 buckets of sand. Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden. Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary. If each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, how many pounds of sand did they collect in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many buckets of sand Mary carried. Eden carried 4 buckets, and Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden.",
    "If Eden carried 4 buckets, then Mary carried 4 + 3 = 7 buckets.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many buckets of sand Iris carried. Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary.",
    "If Mary carried 7 buckets, then Iris carried 7 - 1 = 6 buckets.",
    "Now, I find the total number of buckets carried by Eden, Mary, and Iris combined.",
    "Eden carried 4 buckets, Mary carried 7 buckets, and Iris carried 6 buckets. So the total is 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 buckets.",
    "I need to find out how many pounds of sand there are in total. Each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand.",
    "The total weight of the sand collected is 17 buckets \u00d7 2 pounds per bucket = 34 pounds."
