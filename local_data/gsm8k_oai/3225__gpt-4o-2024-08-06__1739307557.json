  "query": "Chris bought 8 movies on DVD for $12 each and 4 movies on Blu-ray for $18 each. What is the average price he paid per movie?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost for the DVDs.",
    "Chris bought 8 DVDs at $12 each.",
    "Multiplying the number of DVDs by the price per DVD: 8 * $12 = $96.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost for the Blu-ray movies.",
    "Chris bought 4 Blu-ray movies at $18 each.",
    "Multiplying the number of Blu-rays by the price per Blu-ray: 4 * $18 = $72.",
    "Now, I find the total cost of all the movies combined.",
    "Adding the total cost of DVDs and Blu-rays: $96 + $72 = $168.",
    "Next, I determine the total number of movies Chris bought.",
    "Chris bought 8 DVDs and 4 Blu-rays.",
    "Adding the number of DVDs and Blu-rays: 8 + 4 = 12 movies.",
    "Now, I can calculate the average price per movie.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total cost by the total number of movies: $168 / 12.",
    "Dividing gives: $168 / 12 = $14."
