  "query": "There are 40 ducks in a pond.  50 percent of the ducks are Muscovy and 30 percent of the Muscovies are female.  How many female Muscovy ducks there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of the ducks are Muscovy.",
    "50 percent of the 40 ducks are Muscovy.",
    "To find 50 percent of 40, I multiply 40 by 0.5.",
    "40 * 0.5 = 20",
    "So, there are 20 Muscovy ducks.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many of these Muscovy ducks are female.",
    "30 percent of the Muscovy ducks are female.",
    "To find 30 percent of 20, I multiply 20 by 0.3.",
    "20 * 0.3 = 6",
    "Therefore, there are 6 female Muscovy ducks."

  "solution": "6"
