  "query": "Gary is buying chlorine for his rectangular pool, which is 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Gary needs to buy one quart of chlorine for every 120 cubic feet of water in his pool. If chlorine costs $3 a quart, how much does Gary spend on chlorine?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the volume of the pool.",
    "To do that, I'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth.",
    "The pool's dimensions are 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep.",
    "Multiplying these together: 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 6 = 480 cubic feet.",
    "Next, I determine how much chlorine Gary needs. He needs one quart for every 120 cubic feet of water.",
    "I divide the total volume of the pool by 120 to find out how many quarts of chlorine Gary needs: 480 \u00f7 120 = 4.",
    "Gary needs 4 quarts of chlorine.",
    "Chlorine costs $3 per quart.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the number of quarts by the price per quart: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12."

  "solution": "12"
