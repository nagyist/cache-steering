  "query": "Katy, Wendi, and Carrie went to a bread-making party.  Katy brought three 5-pound bags of flour.  Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, but Carrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought.  How much more flour, in ounces, did Carrie bring than Katy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much flour Katy brought. Katy brought three 5-pound bags of flour.",
    "Since Katy's flour is in three bags, I can calculate: 3 bags \u00d7 5 pounds per bag = 15 pounds of flour brought by Katy.",
    "Next, I should find out how much flour Wendi brought. She brought twice as much flour as Katy.",
    "Wendi's flour amount: 2 \u00d7 15 pounds = 30 pounds of flour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Carrie brought. Carrie brought 5 pounds less than Wendi.",
    "Carrie's flour amount: 30 pounds - 5 pounds = 25 pounds of flour.",
    "I have found the amounts: Katy brought 15 pounds and Carrie brought 25 pounds of flour. To find how much more Carrie brought than Katy, I should subtract Katy\u2019s amount from Carrie's.",
    "Difference in flour: 25 pounds - 15 pounds = 10 pounds more.",
    "The problem asks for the difference in ounces, not pounds. I have to convert pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound.",
    "To convert the 10 pounds difference to ounces: 10 pounds \u00d7 16 ounces per pound = 160 ounces."

  "solution": "160"
