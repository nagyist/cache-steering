  "query": "Victor, Austin, and Brian made traps to catch shrimp. Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp and Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's. Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total number of shrimp. If the boys then sold their shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp and then divided their earnings equally amongst themselves, how much money does each boy make?",
  "steps": [
    "Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp.",
    "Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's, so Austin caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp.",
    "Together, Victor and Austin caught 26 + 18 = 44 shrimp.",
    "Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total caught, which is 44 / 2 = 22 shrimp.",
    "In total, all three boys caught 26 + 18 + 22 = 66 shrimp.",
    "They sold shrimp at the rate of $7 for every 11 shrimp tails.",
    "To calculate the total earnings, we determine how many sets of 11 shrimp there are in 66: 66 / 11 = 6 sets.",
    "Each set earns them $7, so they earn 6 * $7 = $42 in total.",
    "The total earnings of $42 are divided equally among the three boys.",
    "Each boy gets $42 / 3 = $14."
