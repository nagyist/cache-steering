  "query": "One US cup equals 250ml. Brian is making lasagna for himself, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents. The recipe requires 1/2 a cup of milk per serving. How many 1L cartons of milk does Brian need to buy if each person is expected to eat 2 servings?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many people will eat the lasagna. The people include Brian, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents.",
    "The total number of people is Brian (1) + wife (1) + two kids (2) + Brian's parents (2) + wife's parents (2) = 8 people.",
    "Each person is expected to eat 2 servings. So, I need to calculate the total number of servings.",
    "The total number of servings = 8 people * 2 servings per person = 16 servings.",
    "The recipe requires 1/2 cup of milk per serving. So, I need to calculate the total amount of milk in cups for 16 servings.",
    "Total cups of milk needed = 16 servings * 1/2 cup per serving = 8 cups.",
    "Now I need to convert the total cups of milk into milliliters. Since one US cup equals 250 ml, I multiply the cups by 250 ml/cup.",
    "Total milliliters of milk needed = 8 cups * 250 ml/cup = 2000 ml.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many 1-liter cartons of milk are required. A 1-liter carton contains 1000 ml.",
    "Since 2000 ml of milk is needed, I divide 2000 ml by 1000 ml/carton to find the number of cartons required.",
    "2000 ml / 1000 ml/carton = 2 cartons."
