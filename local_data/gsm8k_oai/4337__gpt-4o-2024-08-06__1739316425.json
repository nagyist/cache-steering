  "query": "Carrie worked for 2 hours a day for 4 days to make and decorate a wedding cake. She was paid $22 an hour. The cost for supplies to make the cake was $54. How much profit did Carrie earn on the cake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many total hours Carrie worked.",
    "Carrie worked 2 hours a day for 4 days.",
    "Multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days: 2 hours/day * 4 days = 8 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Carrie earned from her 8 hours of work.",
    "At $22 per hour, Carrie earned 8 hours * $22/hour = $176.",
    "Carrie also had to pay for supplies, which cost $54.",
    "To find out Carrie's profit, subtract the cost of supplies from her earnings: $176 - $54.",
    "Perform the subtraction: $176 - $54 = $122."
  ],
  "solution": "122"
