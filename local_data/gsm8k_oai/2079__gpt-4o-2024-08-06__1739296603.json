  "query": "Kristy baked cookies because her friends are coming over to her house. She ate 2 of them and gave her brother 1 cookie. Her first friend arrived and took 3 cookies. The second and third friends to arrive took 5 cookies each. If there are 6 cookies left, how many cookies did Kristy bake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cookies Kristy had initially before any were eaten or given away.",
    "I will add up all the cookies that were eaten or given away.",
    "Kristy ate 2 cookies.",
    "She gave 1 cookie to her brother.",
    "Her first friend took 3 cookies.",
    "Her second friend took 5 cookies.",
    "Her third friend also took 5 cookies.",
    "There are 6 cookies left.",
    "Now, I'll sum up all the cookies eaten or taken: 2 (Kristy) + 1 (brother) + 3 (first friend) + 5 (second friend) + 5 (third friend) + the 6 that are left.",
    "2 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 22",
    "Kristy baked a total of 22 cookies."
