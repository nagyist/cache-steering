  "query": "Annie was given a pack of crayons. The pack contained 21 crayons. She already had a box of 36 crayons in her locker. Her friend Bobby gave her half the amount she already had in her locker. She decided to give her sister Mary 1/3 of her total amount of crayons. How many crayons does she give to Mary?",
  "steps": [
    "Annie was given a pack of crayons that contained 21 crayons.",
    "She already had 36 crayons in her locker.",
    "Let's calculate the total crayons Annie had initially: 21 (new pack) + 36 (in locker) = 57 crayons.",
    "Bobby gave her half the amount she already had in her locker, which was 36 crayons.",
    "Half of 36 is 36 / 2 = 18 crayons.",
    "Add the 18 crayons from Bobby to her total: 57 (initial total) + 18 (from Bobby) = 75 crayons.",
    "Annie decided to give Mary 1/3 of her total amount of crayons.",
    "Calculate 1/3 of Annie's total crayons: 75 / 3 = 25 crayons."
