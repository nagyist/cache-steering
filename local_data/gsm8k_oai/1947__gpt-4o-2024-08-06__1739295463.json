  "query": "Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans.  Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb.  How many jellybeans do they have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many jellybeans Caleb has.",
    "A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen jellybeans would be 3 times 12.",
    "Calculating 3 times 12 gives 36 jellybeans.",
    "Caleb has 36 jellybeans.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many jellybeans Sophie has.",
    "Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb.",
    "Half of Caleb's 36 jellybeans is calculated as 36 divided by 2.",
    "Calculating 36 divided by 2 gives 18 jellybeans.",
    "Sophie has 18 jellybeans.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total number of jellybeans Caleb and Sophie have together.",
    "I add Caleb's 36 jellybeans to Sophie's 18 jellybeans.",
    "Calculating 36 plus 18 gives 54.",
    "Caleb and Sophie have 54 jellybeans in total."
