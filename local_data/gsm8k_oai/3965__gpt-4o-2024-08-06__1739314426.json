  "query": "Dallas and Austin went to the pick-your-own orchard. Dallas picked 14 bags of apples and 9 bags of pears. Austin picked 6 bags of apples more than Dallas, and 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas. How many bags of fruit did Austin pick, in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying how many bags of apples Dallas picked.",
    "Dallas picked 14 bags of apples.",
    "Austin picked 6 more bags of apples than Dallas.",
    "To find out how many bags of apples Austin picked, I add 6 to the 14 bags that Dallas picked.",
    "14 + 6 = 20",
    "Austin picked 20 bags of apples.",
    "Next, I look at the bags of pears that Dallas picked.",
    "Dallas picked 9 bags of pears.",
    "Austin picked 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas.",
    "To find out how many bags of pears Austin picked, I subtract 5 from the 9 bags that Dallas picked.",
    "9 - 5 = 4",
    "Austin picked 4 bags of pears.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked.",
    "Austin picked 20 bags of apples and 4 bags of pears.",
    "To find the total, I add the number of bags of apples and pears Austin picked.",
    "20 + 4 = 24"
