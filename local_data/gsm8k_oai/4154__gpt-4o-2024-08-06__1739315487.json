  "query": "A four-layer pyramid is being built with each layer having three times as many sandstone blocks as the layer above it. The top layer is a single block. How many sandstone blocks are in the pyramid?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this, we need to determine how many layers there are and define how many blocks each layer contains.",
    "We know there are four layers.",
    "The top layer has 1 block.",
    "Each layer has three times as many blocks as the layer above it.",
    "Let's calculate the number of blocks for each layer starting from the top layer (layer 1) to the bottom (layer 4).",
    "Layer 1 has 1 block.",
    "Layer 2 has 3 times the number of blocks in layer 1, which is 3 * 1 = 3 blocks.",
    "Layer 3 has 3 times the number of blocks in layer 2, which is 3 * 3 = 9 blocks.",
    "Layer 4 has 3 times the number of blocks in layer 3, which is 3 * 9 = 27 blocks.",
    "To find the total number of blocks in the pyramid, we add the number of blocks in all layers.",
    "The total number of blocks is 1 (layer 1) + 3 (layer 2) + 9 (layer 3) + 27 (layer 4).",
    "Calculating the total: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40."
