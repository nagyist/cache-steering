  "query": "The Kwik-e-Tax Center charges $50 for a federal return, $30 for a state return, and $80 for quarterly business taxes. If they sell 60 federal returns, 20 state returns, and 10 quarterly returns in one day, what was their total revenue for the day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total revenue from the federal returns.",
    "They charge $50 for each federal return.",
    "They sold 60 federal returns.",
    "Total revenue from federal returns is 60 returns \u00d7 $50 per return = $3000.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total revenue from the state returns.",
    "They charge $30 for each state return.",
    "They sold 20 state returns.",
    "Total revenue from state returns is 20 returns \u00d7 $30 per return = $600.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total revenue from the quarterly business taxes.",
    "They charge $80 for each quarterly tax filing.",
    "They sold 10 quarterly returns.",
    "Total revenue from quarterly returns is 10 returns \u00d7 $80 per return = $800.",
    "Finally, I will add all the revenues together to find the total revenue for the day.",
    "The total revenue is $3000 (federal) + $600 (state) + $800 (quarterly) = $4400."
