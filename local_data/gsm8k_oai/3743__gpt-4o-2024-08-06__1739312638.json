  "query": "Calum runs a nightclub and decides to run a disco night to attract different customers. He is planning the event and is calculating how much he can spend on each item without spending more than he has budgeted. He only needs to buy 4 disco balls and 10 boxes of food. Each box of food costs $25. Calum\u2019s budget for the disco balls and food is $330. How much, in dollars, can Calum afford to spend on each disco ball?",
  "steps": [
    "Calum needs to calculate how much he can spend on each disco ball.",
    "First, I need to figure out the total cost of the boxes of food.",
    "Each box of food costs $25, and Calum needs 10 boxes.",
    "The total cost for the boxes of food is 10 boxes * $25 per box = $250.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much of the budget is left for the disco balls.",
    "Calum's total budget for both items is $330.",
    "Subtract the cost of the food from the total budget: $330 - $250 = $80.",
    "Calum has $80 left to spend on the disco balls.",
    "Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls.",
    "To find out how much he can spend on each disco ball, divide the remaining budget by the number of disco balls: $80 / 4 = $20."
