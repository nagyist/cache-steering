  "query": "Nate went out to do his daily exercises. In 8 seconds, he ran a distance equal to four times the length of a football field. He rested for a while, then ran 500 more meters. If the field's length is 168 meters, how far did Nate ran?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how far Nate ran in total.",
    "First, I know that Nate ran a distance equal to four times the length of a football field in 8 seconds.",
    "The length of the football field is given as 168 meters.",
    "I should calculate the distance Nate ran in those 8 seconds.",
    "Four times the length of the field is 4 times 168 meters.",
    "4 times 168 is 672 meters.",
    "So, Nate ran 672 meters in the initial part of his exercise.",
    "Next, Nate rested and then ran an additional 500 meters.",
    "To find the total distance Nate ran, I need to add the distance he ran initially to the distance he ran after resting.",
    "Initial distance was 672 meters, and the additional distance was 500 meters.",
    "I will add 672 meters to 500 meters.",
    "672 plus 500 is 1172 meters.",
    "I have calculated the total distance Nate ran."

  "solution": "1172"
