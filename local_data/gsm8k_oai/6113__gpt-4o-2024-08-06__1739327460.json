  "query": "Jackson is buying chairs for his restaurant. He has 6 tables with 4 seats and 12 tables with 6 seats. How many chairs total does Jackson need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many chairs are needed for the tables with 4 seats each.",
    "Jackson has 6 tables with 4 seats. To find the total number of chairs for these tables, I will multiply 6 tables by 4 seats.",
    "6 tables * 4 seats per table = 24 chairs",
    "Next, I will calculate how many chairs are needed for the tables with 6 seats each.",
    "Jackson has 12 tables with 6 seats. To find the total number of chairs for these tables, I will multiply 12 tables by 6 seats.",
    "12 tables * 6 seats per table = 72 chairs",
    "Now, to find the total number of chairs Jackson needs to buy, I will add the chairs needed for both types of tables together.",
    "24 chairs (from 4-seat tables) + 72 chairs (from 6-seat tables) = 96 chairs"

  "solution": "96"
