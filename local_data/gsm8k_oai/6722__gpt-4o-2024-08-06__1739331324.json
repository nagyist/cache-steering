  "query": "Yesterday, Vincent bought fifteen packs of stickers. Today, he bought ten more packs of stickers than yesterday. How many packs of stickers does Vincent have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many packs Vincent bought yesterday.",
    "Yesterday, Vincent bought fifteen packs of stickers.",
    "Next, determine how many packs Vincent bought today.",
    "Today, Vincent bought ten more packs than yesterday.",
    "Since he bought 15 packs yesterday, today he bought 15 + 10 packs.",
    "15 + 10 equals 25, so Vincent bought 25 packs today.",
    "Now, add the packs from yesterday and today to find the total.",
    "Vincent bought 15 packs yesterday and 25 packs today.",
    "Therefore, the total number of packs is 15 + 25.",
    "15 + 25 equals 40."
