  "query": "To make pizza, together with other ingredients, Kimber needs 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that she needs to make the pizza.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the quantities given in the problem: cups of water, cups of flour, and teaspoons of salt.",
    "We have 10 cups of water.",
    "We have 16 cups of flour.",
    "We need to calculate the teaspoons of salt, which is 1/2 times the number of cups of flour.",
    "The number of cups of flour is 16, so we calculate 1/2 times 16 to find the teaspoons of salt.",
    "1/2 times 16 equals 8. So, 8 teaspoons of salt are needed.",
    "Now, we combine all the quantities: 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 8 teaspoons of salt.",
    "To find the total, add these amounts together: 10 + 16 + 8.",
    "Performing the addition: 10 + 16 equals 26.",
    "Then, add the teaspoons of salt: 26 + 8 equals 34.",
    "The total combined number of cups and teaspoons is 34."
