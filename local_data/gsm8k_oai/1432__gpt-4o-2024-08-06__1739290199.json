  "query": "Venny spent $15000 on a used car which cost 40% of the original price. What was the original price of the car?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the used car price Venny paid is $15000.",
    "I understand that the $15000 is 40% of the original price of the car.",
    "To find the original price, I need to set up an equation where 40% of the original price equals $15000.",
    "I will represent the original price with the variable x. Thus, I need to solve the equation 0.40 * x = $15000.",
    "To find x, I divide both sides of the equation by 0.40.",
    "Now, calculating: $15000 / 0.40 = $37500.",
    "Therefore, the original price of the car was $37500."

  "solution": "37500"
