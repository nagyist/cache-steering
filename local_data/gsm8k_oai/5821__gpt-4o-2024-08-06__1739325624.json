  "query": "James hurts himself and decides to go to his primary care doctor.  His primary care doctor charges $300 for the visit and James's insurance covers 80%.  What is James's out-of-pocket cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much of the $300 charge is covered by James's insurance.",
    "The insurance covers 80% of the $300 charge.",
    "To find 80% of $300, I calculate \\(300 \\times 0.80\\).",
    "\\(300 \\times 0.80\\) equals 240.",
    "So, the insurance covers $240.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much James is responsible for out of his own pocket.",
    "James's out-of-pocket cost would be the total charge minus the amount covered by insurance.",
    "I subtract the insurance-covered amount ($240) from the total charge ($300).",
    "\\(300 - 240\\) equals 60.",
    "James's out-of-pocket cost is $60."

  "solution": "60"
