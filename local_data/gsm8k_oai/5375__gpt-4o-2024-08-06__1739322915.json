  "query": "Jason has three times as many toys as John. If John has 6 more toys than Rachel and Rachel has 1 toy, how many toys does Jason have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many toys John has.",
    "I know that Rachel has 1 toy.",
    "John has 6 more toys than Rachel.",
    "Since Rachel has 1 toy, John has 1 + 6 = 7 toys.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many toys Jason has.",
    "Jason has three times as many toys as John.",
    "Since John has 7 toys, Jason has 3 * 7 = 21 toys."
