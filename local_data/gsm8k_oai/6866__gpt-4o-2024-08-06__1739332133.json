  "query": "At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many geese are initially at the duck park. The number of geese is ten less than twice the number of ducks. There are 25 mallard ducks.",
    "Twice the number of ducks is \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\).",
    "The number of geese is \\( 50 - 10 = 40 \\).",
    "Now, I know there are initially 25 ducks and 40 geese at the park.",
    "Then, 4 more ducks arrive at the park.",
    "The new total number of ducks is \\( 25 + 4 = 29 \\).",
    "Next, I determine how many geese leave the park. Five less than 15 geese leave the park.",
    "The number of geese leaving is \\( 15 - 5 = 10 \\).",
    "After the geese leave, the number of geese remaining is \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\).",
    "Now, I need to find how many more geese than ducks remain at the park.",
    "I compare the remaining geese and ducks: \\( 30 - 29 = 1 \\)."
