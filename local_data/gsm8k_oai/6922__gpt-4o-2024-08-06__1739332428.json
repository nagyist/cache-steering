  "query": "Wendi lives on a plot of land that is 200 feet by 900 feet of grassland.  She raises rabbits on her property by allowing the rabbits to graze on the grass that grows on her land.  If one rabbit can eat enough grass to clear ten square yards of lawn area per day, and Wendi owns 100 rabbits, how many days would it take for Wendi's rabbits to clear all the grass off of her grassland property?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total area of the grassland in square feet. The dimensions given are 200 feet by 900 feet.",
    "I multiply the length and width to find the total area in square feet: 200 feet * 900 feet = 180,000 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to convert the area from square feet to square yards because the rabbits clear ten square yards per day. There are 9 square feet in a square yard (since 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet).",
    "I divide the total area in square feet by the number of square feet in a square yard to get the area in square yards: 180,000 square feet / 9 square feet per square yard = 20,000 square yards.",
    "According to the problem, one rabbit can clear ten square yards per day. Wendi owns 100 rabbits.",
    "The number of square yards that Wendi's 100 rabbits can clear in one day is 100 rabbits * 10 square yards per rabbit = 1,000 square yards per day.",
    "To find the number of days it would take the rabbits to clear the entire area, I need to divide the total area in square yards by the number of square yards cleared per day.",
    "Divide 20,000 square yards by 1,000 square yards per day: 20,000 / 1,000 = 20 days."
