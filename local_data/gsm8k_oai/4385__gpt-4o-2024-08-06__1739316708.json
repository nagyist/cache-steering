  "query": "To make a yellow score mixture, Taylor has to combine white and black scores in the ratio of 7:6. If she got 78 yellow scores, what's 2/3 of the difference between the number of black and white scores she used?",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand the problem: Taylor combines white and black scores in the ratio of 7:6 to get 78 yellow scores in total.",
    "The ratio of white scores to black scores is 7:6.",
    "Let\u2019s represent the white scores as 7x and black scores as 6x.",
    "The total number of scores, according to these expressions, will be 7x + 6x = 13x.",
    "We know that 13x equals the total number of yellow scores (78).",
    "Set up the equation 13x = 78 to solve for x.",
    "Divide both sides by 13 to get x = 78 / 13.",
    "Calculate 78 / 13 which equals 6. So, x = 6.",
    "Now, calculate the number of white scores: 7x = 7 * 6 = 42.",
    "Calculate the number of black scores: 6x = 6 * 6 = 36.",
    "We need to find the difference between the number of black scores and white scores: 42 - 36 = 6.",
    "The problem asks for 2/3 of this difference.",
    "Calculate 2/3 of 6: (2/3) * 6 = 4."
