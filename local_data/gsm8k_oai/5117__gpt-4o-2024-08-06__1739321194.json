  "query": "Mr. Resty has two identical 4-story buildings. The first floor has 2 apartment units while the rest of the floors have 5 apartment units on each floor. How many apartment units does Mr. Resty have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many apartment units there are in one building first.",
    "The first floor has 2 apartment units.",
    "The remaining floors, which are the second, third, and fourth floors, each have 5 apartment units.",
    "There are 3 floors with 5 apartment units each.",
    "I need to calculate the total apartment units on the remaining floors by multiplying the number of floors (3) with the number of units per floor (5).",
    "3 floors \u00d7 5 units/floor = 15 units",
    "Now, I need to add the units from the first floor to the total from the remaining floors: 15 units (floors 2-4) + 2 units (floor 1).",
    "2 units + 15 units = 17 units in one building.",
    "Mr. Resty has two identical buildings, so I need to multiply the number of units in one building (17) by 2.",
    "17 units/building \u00d7 2 buildings = 34 units"
  ],
  "solution": "34"
