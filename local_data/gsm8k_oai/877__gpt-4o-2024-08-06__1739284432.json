  "query": "Kimberly went strawberry picking with her family over the weekend. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many strawberries Kimberly's brother picked. He picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries.",
    "Calculate the total number of strawberries picked by her brother: \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\).",
    "Kimberly picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked.",
    "Calculate the number of strawberries Kimberly picked: \\(8 \\times 45 = 360\\).",
    "Her parents picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly.",
    "Calculate the number of strawberries her parents picked: \\(360 - 93 = 267\\).",
    "Add the number of strawberries picked by Kimberly, her brother, and her parents to find the total number of strawberries.",
    "Total number of strawberries: \\(45\\) (brother) \\(+ 360\\) (Kimberly) \\(+ 267\\) (parents) \\(= 672\\).",
    "There are four family members (Kimberly, her brother, and her parents), so divide the total number of strawberries equally among them.",
    "Calculate the number of strawberries each person would get: \\(672 \\div 4 = 168\\)."

  "solution": "168"
