  "query": "Amanda\u2019s garden contains 20 flowers and Peter\u2019s garden contains three times as many flowers as Amanda's. If Peter gave 15 flowers to his brother, how many flowers are left in his garden?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flowers are in Peter's garden initially.",
    "Amanda's garden has 20 flowers.",
    "Peter's garden has three times as many flowers as Amanda's.",
    "To find out how many flowers are in Peter's garden, I multiply 20 by 3.",
    "20 times 3 equals 60. So Peter has 60 flowers initially.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many flowers are left after Peter gives 15 flowers to his brother.",
    "I subtract 15 from 60 to find the number of flowers remaining in Peter's garden.",
    "60 minus 15 equals 45."
