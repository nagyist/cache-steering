  "query": "At an auction event, the price of a TV, whose cost was $500, increased by 2/5 times its initial price. The price of a phone, which was $400, also increased by 40% from its original price. If Bethany had taken both items to the auction, calculate the total amount she received for the items after the sale at the auction.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I find the increase in the price of the TV.",
    "The initial price of the TV is $500.",
    "The increase in the price of the TV is 2/5 times its initial price.",
    "To calculate the increase: 2/5 * $500 = $200.",
    "Now, I add the increase to the initial price of the TV.",
    "The new price of the TV is $500 + $200 = $700.",
    "Next, I find the increase in the price of the phone.",
    "The initial price of the phone is $400.",
    "The increase in the price of the phone is 40% of its initial price.",
    "To calculate the increase: 40% of $400 = 0.40 * $400 = $160.",
    "Now, I add the increase to the initial price of the phone.",
    "The new price of the phone is $400 + $160 = $560.",
    "The total amount Bethany received for both items is the sum of the new prices of the TV and the phone.",
    "The total amount is $700 + $560.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total amount: $700 + $560 = $1260."
