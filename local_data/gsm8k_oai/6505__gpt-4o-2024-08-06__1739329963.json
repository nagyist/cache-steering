  "query": "Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy took a quiz together. Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy. If Dorothy scored 90 marks, calculate the average marks scored by the three.",
  "steps": [
    "Dorothy scored 90 marks.",
    "Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, so I calculate Ivanna's score: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 \\).",
    "Calculating Ivanna's score: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 = 54 \\).",
    "Ivanna scored 54 marks.",
    "Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, so I calculate Tatuya's score: \\( 2 \\times 54 \\).",
    "Calculating Tatuya's score: \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\).",
    "Tatuya scored 108 marks.",
    "Now I calculate the total marks scored by the three: Tatuya's score + Ivanna's score + Dorothy's score.",
    "Total marks = 108 + 54 + 90",
    "Calculating total marks: 108 + 54 + 90 = 252",
    "There are three people, so I calculate the average marks by dividing the total marks by 3.",
    "Calculating average marks: \\( \\frac{252}{3} = 84 \\)"

  "solution": "84"
