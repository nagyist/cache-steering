  "query": "Teresa is 59 and her husband Morio is 71 years old. Their daughter, Michiko was born when Morio was 38.  How old was Teresa when she gave birth to Michiko?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how old Teresa was when Michiko was born, I need to determine how old Michiko is now.",
    "Morio was 38 when Michiko was born. Morio is currently 71.",
    "The difference in Morio's age when Michiko was born and now is 71 - 38.",
    "71 - 38 equals 33, so Michiko is 33 years old now.",
    "Teresa is currently 59 years old.",
    "Michiko is 33, so I subtract Michiko's age from Teresa's current age to find out how old Teresa was when Michiko was born.",
    "59 - 33 equals 26."
