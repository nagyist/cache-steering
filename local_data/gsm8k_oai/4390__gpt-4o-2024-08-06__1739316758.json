  "query": "If Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil does, and Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has in his account, and Bob has $60 in his account, how much less money does Jenna have in her account than Bob?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Phil has. The problem states that Phil has one-third of the amount of money that Bob has.",
    "Bob has $60 in his account.",
    "To find out how much Phil has, I calculate \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\). Thus, Phil has $20 in his account.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how much money Jenna has. Jenna has twice as much money as Phil.",
    "Phil has $20, so Jenna has \\( 2 \\times 20 \\).",
    "\\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\). Therefore, Jenna has $40 in her account.",
    "The question asks how much less money Jenna has compared to Bob.",
    "Bob has $60, and Jenna has $40.",
    "To find how much less Jenna has, I calculate \\( 60 - 40 \\).",
    "\\( 60 - 40 = 20 \\)."
