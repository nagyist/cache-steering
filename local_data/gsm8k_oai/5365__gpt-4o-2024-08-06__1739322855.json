  "query": "It takes 3 beehives to make enough wax to make 12 candles. How many hives does it take to make 96 candles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between the number of beehives and the number of candles produced.",
    "I know that 3 beehives produce enough wax for 12 candles.",
    "I need to find out how many candles are produced per beehive.",
    "Dividing 12 candles by 3 beehives gives me 4 candles per beehive.",
    "Now, I want to know how many beehives are needed to make 96 candles.",
    "I need to divide the total number of candles (96) by the number of candles per beehive (4) to find the number of hives needed.",
    "96 \u00f7 4 equals 24.",
    "Therefore, 24 beehives are needed to make 96 candles."

  "solution": "24"
