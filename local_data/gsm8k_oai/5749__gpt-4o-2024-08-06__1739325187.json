  "query": "Twelve coworkers go out for lunch together and order three pizzas. Each pizza is cut into eight slices. If each person gets the same number of slices, how many slices will each person get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices from the three pizzas.",
    "Each pizza has 8 slices.",
    "There are 3 pizzas, so I need to multiply the number of slices per pizza by the number of pizzas.",
    "3 pizzas \u00d7 8 slices per pizza = 24 slices.",
    "Now I know there are 24 slices in total.",
    "I need to divide these 24 slices equally among the 12 coworkers.",
    "The number of slices each coworker gets is 24 slices \u00f7 12 coworkers.",
    "24 \u00f7 12 = 2."
