  "query": "The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center. Together they have a total of 35 floors. How many floors does the Chrysler Building have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of floors in the Leeward Center be represented by L.",
    "The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center. So, the number of floors in the Chrysler Building can be represented as L + 11.",
    "Together, both buildings have 35 floors. Therefore, the equation is L + (L + 11) = 35.",
    "Simplify the equation: 2L + 11 = 35.",
    "Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation to isolate terms with L: 2L = 24.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for L: L = 12.",
    "Now that we know the Leeward Center has 12 floors, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building.",
    "The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, so it has 12 + 11 floors.",
    "Add to find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building: 12 + 11 = 23."
