    "First, I need to find the sum of the weights of Christine's two cats.",
    "The first cat weighs 7 pounds and the second cat weighs 10 pounds.",
    "I will add the two weights together: 7 pounds + 10 pounds = 17 pounds.",
    "Now I know that the sum of the cats' weights is 17 pounds.",
    "Christine's dog's weight is twice the sum of her two cats' weights.",
    "I will calculate twice the sum of the cats' weights: 2 \u00d7 17 pounds = 34 pounds.",
    "The dog's weight is 34 pounds."
