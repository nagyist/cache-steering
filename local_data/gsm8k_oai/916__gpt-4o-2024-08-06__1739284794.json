  "query": "The age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. The sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old. If Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, calculate the total number of pencils they have together.",
  "steps": [
    "Asaf's age is given as 50 years.",
    "Let Alexander's age be \\( A \\) years.",
    "We know the sum of Asaf's and Alexander's ages is 140.",
    "So, \\( 50 + A = 140 \\).",
    "Solving for \\( A \\), we get \\( A = 140 - 50 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( A = 90 \\).",
    "The age difference between Asaf and Alexander is \\( 90 - 50 = 40 \\) years.",
    "It is stated that the age difference (40) is half the total number of pencils Asaf has.",
    "Let \\( P \\) be the total number of pencils Asaf has. Therefore, \\( \\frac{P}{2} = 40 \\).",
    "Multiplying both sides by 2, we get \\( P = 80 \\).",
    "So, Asaf has 80 pencils.",
    "Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf.",
    "Therefore, the number of pencils Alexander has is \\( 80 + 60 = 140 \\).",
    "To find the total number of pencils they have together, add Asaf's and Alexander's pencils.",
    "The total number of pencils is \\( 80 + 140 = 220 \\)."
