  "query": "Rylee is bored and decides to count the number of leaves falling off the tree in her backyard. 7 leaves fall in the first hour. For the second and third hour, the leaves fall at a rate of 4 per hour. What is the average number of leaves which fell per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total number of leaves that fell in the three hours.",
    "In the first hour, 7 leaves fell.",
    "In the second hour, 4 leaves fell.",
    "In the third hour, 4 leaves fell.",
    "Adding these together gives the total number of fallen leaves: 7 + 4 + 4.",
    "Calculating this sum: 7 + 4 = 11, then 11 + 4 = 15.",
    "Now, I will find out the average number of leaves per hour.",
    "The average is calculated by dividing the total number of leaves by the number of hours.",
    "There were 3 hours in total.",
    "So, I will divide 15 by 3 to find the average.",
    "Calculating this gives: 15 divided by 3 equals 5."
