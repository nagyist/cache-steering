  "query": "On a shopping trip in a crowded store, Josie had to wait 3 minutes for a cart, 13 minutes for an employee to unlock a cabinet to get her a product, 14 minutes for a stocker to restock a shelf with what she wanted, and 18 minutes in line to check out. Her shopping trip took an hour and a half. How many minutes did Josie spend shopping instead of waiting?",
  "steps": [
    "First, convert the total time of the shopping trip from hours to minutes.",
    "Josie's shopping trip was an hour and a half, which is 1.5 hours.",
    "Convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).",
    "1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.",
    "Next, add up all the time Josie spent waiting.",
    "She waited 3 minutes for a cart, 13 minutes for the employee, 14 minutes for the stocker, and 18 minutes in line.",
    "Add all these waiting times together: 3 + 13 + 14 + 18.",
    "3 + 13 = 16.",
    "16 + 14 = 30.",
    "30 + 18 = 48 minutes.",
    "Now subtract the total waiting time from the total shopping trip time to find out how many minutes she spent shopping.",
    "90 minutes total trip - 48 minutes waiting = 42 minutes shopping."

  "solution": "42"
