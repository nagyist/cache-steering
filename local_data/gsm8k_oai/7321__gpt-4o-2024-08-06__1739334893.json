  "query": "A group of science students went on a field trip. They took 9 vans and 10 buses. There were 8 people in each van and 27 people on each bus. How many people went on the field trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of people traveling in the vans.",
    "There are 9 vans.",
    "Each van carries 8 people.",
    "To find the total number of people in the vans, I multiply the number of vans by the number of people per van: \\(9 \\times 8\\).",
    "Calculating \\(9 \\times 8\\) gives 72 people in vans.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people are on the buses.",
    "There are 10 buses.",
    "Each bus carries 27 people.",
    "To find the total number of people on the buses, I multiply the number of buses by the number of people per bus: \\(10 \\times 27\\).",
    "Calculating \\(10 \\times 27\\) gives 270 people in buses.",
    "To find the total number of people on the field trip, I add the number of people from the vans and the buses together.",
    "72 people from vans + 270 people from buses equals 342 people in total."

  "solution": "342"
