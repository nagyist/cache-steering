  "query": "Penny's canoe can carry 6 people, but if she wants to take her dog, she will only fit 2/3 of that number inside. If every person in a trip where Penny had her dog inside the canoe weighed 140 pounds, and the dog 1/4 as much weight, calculate the total weight the canoe was carrying?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate 2/3 of the number of people the canoe can carry, which is 6.",
    "2/3 of 6 is 2/3 * 6 = 4.",
    "Therefore, with Penny's dog inside, the canoe can carry 4 people.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total weight of the 4 people, with each person weighing 140 pounds.",
    "4 people x 140 pounds/person = 560 pounds for the people.",
    "The dog weighs 1/4 as much as one person, who weighs 140 pounds.",
    "1/4 of 140 pounds is 140/4 = 35 pounds.",
    "Now, I will add the total weight of the people and the dog to find the total weight the canoe was carrying.",
    "560 pounds (people) + 35 pounds (dog) = 595 pounds."

  "solution": "595"
