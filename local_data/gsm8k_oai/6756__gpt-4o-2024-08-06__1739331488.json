  "query": "John gave his fiancee a $4000 ring on their engagement day, a $2000 car as a gift on their wedding day, and a diamond brace twice as expensive as the ring he gave her during the engagement. What's the worth of the presents John gave to her fiancee?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will list out the values of the gifts mentioned.",
    "The ring given on the engagement day is valued at $4000.",
    "The car given as a gift on the wedding day is valued at $2000.",
    "The problem states that the diamond bracelet is twice as expensive as the $4000 ring.",
    "To calculate the value of the diamond bracelet, I'll multiply the cost of the ring by 2.",
    "The diamond bracelet is 2 * $4000 = $8000.",
    "Now, I will add up the total value of all the presents.",
    "The ring is $4000, the car is $2000, and the bracelet is $8000.",
    "The total value of the presents is $4000 + $2000 + $8000.",
    "The sum of these amounts is $14000."
