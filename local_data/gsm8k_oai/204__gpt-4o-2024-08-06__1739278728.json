  "query": "Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of pages in the stack of books.",
    "I know that 80 pages is equivalent to one inch. Jack's stack is 12 inches thick.",
    "So, the total number of pages is 80 pages/inch * 12 inches.",
    "Calculating this gives 80 * 12 = 960 pages in total.",
    "Jack has 6 books, and I need to find the average number of pages per book.",
    "To find the average number of pages per book, I divide the total number of pages by the number of books.",
    "960 pages / 6 books equals 160 pages per book on average."

  "solution": "160"
