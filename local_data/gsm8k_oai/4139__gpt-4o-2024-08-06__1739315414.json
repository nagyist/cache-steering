  "query": "Eric has 4 ninja throwing stars. His friend Chad has twice as many. Then Jeff bought 2 ninja stars from Chad. Jeff now has 6 throwing stars. How many ninja throwing stars do they have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many ninja throwing stars Chad has initially.",
    "Chad has twice as many throwing stars as Eric.",
    "Eric has 4 throwing stars.",
    "So, Chad has 2 times 4, which is 8 throwing stars.",
    "Now, I think about the transaction where Jeff buys 2 throwing stars from Chad.",
    "Chad originally had 8 throwing stars and sold 2 to Jeff, leaving him with 8 - 2 = 6 throwing stars.",
    "Jeff bought 2 throwing stars from Chad, so he has 6 throwing stars already according to the problem.",
    "I know Eric still has 4 throwing stars.",
    "Now, I add the ninja throwing stars: Eric's 4 + Chad's 6 + Jeff's 6 = 16."

  "solution": "16"
