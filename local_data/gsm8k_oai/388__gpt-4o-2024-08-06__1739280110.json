  "query": "John sublets his apartment to 3 people who each pay $400 per month.  He rents the apartment for $900 a month.  How much profit does he make in a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total rent John receives from the 3 subletters each month.",
    "Each subletter pays $400 per month.",
    "There are 3 subletters, so the total rent John receives from them each month is 3 times $400.",
    "3 times $400 is $1200.",
    "Now I need to determine the total rent John pays for the apartment each month.",
    "John pays $900 per month for the rent of the apartment.",
    "To find John's monthly profit, I need to subtract the rent he pays from the rent he receives.",
    "So, $1200 (rent received) - $900 (rent paid) equals $300.",
    "John's monthly profit is $300.",
    "To find John's annual profit, I need to multiply his monthly profit by the number of months in a year.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "$300 (monthly profit) times 12 is $3600."
  ],
  "solution": "3600"
