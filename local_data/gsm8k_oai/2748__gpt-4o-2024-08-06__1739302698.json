    "First, I need to calculate the decrease in the price of the book when it's decreased by 15%.",
    "15% of $400 is calculated as 0.15 * 400.",
    "0.15 * 400 equals $60.",
    "The new price after the decrease is $400 - $60.",
    "$400 - $60 equals $340.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the increase on the new price ($340) by 40%.",
    "40% of $340 is calculated as 0.40 * 340.",
    "0.40 * 340 equals $136.",
    "The final price after the increase is $340 + $136.",
    "$340 + $136 equals $476."
