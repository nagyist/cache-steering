  "query": "Jack is making barbecue sauce. He uses 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of honey. If each burger takes 1/4 cup of sauce and each pulled pork sandwich takes 1/6 cup, how many burgers can Jack make if he makes 18 pulled pork sandwiches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of barbecue sauce Jack makes. Jack uses 3 cups of ketchup, 1 cup of vinegar, and 1 cup of honey.",
    "I will add up these amounts of ingredients: 3 cups of ketchup + 1 cup of vinegar + 1 cup of honey = 5 cups of barbecue sauce.",
    "Jack makes a total of 5 cups of barbecue sauce.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how much sauce is used for the 18 pulled pork sandwiches. Each sandwich takes 1/6 cup of sauce.",
    "The total sauce used for 18 sandwiches is: 18 sandwiches * 1/6 cup per sandwich = 18/6 = 3 cups of sauce.",
    "I will subtract the sauce used for sandwiches from the total sauce to find out what's left for burgers: 5 cups total - 3 cups used for sandwiches = 2 cups left for burgers.",
    "Each burger takes 1/4 cup of sauce. I need to see how many burgers can be made with the remaining 2 cups of sauce.",
    "The number of burgers that can be made is: 2 cups of sauce / 1/4 cup per burger = 2 \u00f7 (1/4) = 2 * 4/1 = 8 burgers."
