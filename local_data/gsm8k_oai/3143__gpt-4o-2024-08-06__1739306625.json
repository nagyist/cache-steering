  "query": "Amy is collecting candy for the car pool. She has 5 chocolate bars, 7 times as many M&Ms as chocolate bars, and 6 times as many marshmallows as M&Ms. Amy then arranges the candies into baskets. If she fills each basket with 10 candies, how many baskets will Amy fill?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of M&Ms Amy has. I know she has 5 chocolate bars and 7 times as many M&Ms as chocolate bars.",
    "5 chocolate bars * 7 = 35 M&Ms.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of marshmallows Amy has. I know she has 6 times as many marshmallows as M&Ms.",
    "35 M&Ms * 6 = 210 marshmallows.",
    "Now, I have the number of each type of candy: 5 chocolate bars, 35 M&Ms, and 210 marshmallows. I need to find the total number of candies.",
    "Total number of candies = 5 chocolate bars + 35 M&Ms + 210 marshmallows = 250 candies.",
    "I need to determine how many baskets Amy can fill with 250 candies if each basket contains 10 candies.",
    "250 candies / 10 candies per basket = 25 baskets."
