  "query": "Marcos has to get across a 5 mile lake in his speedboat in 10 minutes so he can make it to work on time. How fast does he need to go in miles per hour to make it?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how fast Marcos needs to go in miles per hour to cross 5 miles in 10 minutes.",
    "First, let's determine how many hours 10 minutes is.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "So, 10 minutes is 10/60 of an hour.",
    "10/60 simplifies to 1/6 of an hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the speed in miles per hour.",
    "To find speed, divide the distance by time.",
    "The distance is 5 miles.",
    "The time is 1/6 of an hour.",
    "Now I'll divide 5 miles by 1/6 of an hour to get the speed in miles per hour.",
    "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.",
    "The reciprocal of 1/6 is 6.",
    "So, 5 miles divided by 1/6 of an hour is the same as 5 miles multiplied by 6.",
    "5 multiplied by 6 is 30."

  "solution": "30"
