    "First, I need to determine how much money Peter spent on soda.",
    "Peter brought $2 and left with $0.50.",
    "To find out how much he spent, I subtract $0.50 from $2.",
    "$2.00 - $0.50 = $1.50",
    "Peter spent $1.50 on soda.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many ounces of soda he bought with $1.50.",
    "The soda costs $0.25 per ounce.",
    "I will divide the total amount spent by the cost per ounce to find the number of ounces.",
    "$1.50 \u00f7 $0.25 = 6",
    "Peter bought 6 ounces of soda."
