  "query": "Rohan owns a 20-square meter coconut farm. Each square meter has 2 coconut trees and each tree has 6 coconuts. If the coconuts can be harvested every 3 months and each coconut costs $0.50, how much will he earn after 6 months?",
  "steps": [
    "Rohan has a farm that is 20 square meters in size.",
    "Each square meter contains 2 coconut trees.",
    "Therefore, the total number of coconut trees is 20 square meters multiplied by 2 trees per square meter.",
    "20 * 2 = 40 coconut trees.",
    "Each tree has 6 coconuts.",
    "Therefore, the total number of coconuts is 40 trees multiplied by 6 coconuts per tree.",
    "40 * 6 = 240 coconuts.",
    "Coconuts can be harvested every 3 months.",
    "Rohan can harvest twice in 6 months (once every 3 months).",
    "For each harvest, he gets 240 coconuts.",
    "In 6 months, he will have 2 harvests, each yielding 240 coconuts.",
    "2 * 240 = 480 coconuts in 6 months.",
    "Each coconut costs $0.50.",
    "Therefore, the total earnings from 480 coconuts is 480 multiplied by $0.50.",
    "480 * 0.50 = 240 dollars."

  "solution": "240"
