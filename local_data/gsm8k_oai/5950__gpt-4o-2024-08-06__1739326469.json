  "query": "During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how many necklaces Latch caught, I first need to determine how many necklaces Rhonda caught.",
    "I know from the problem that Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.",
    "Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux caught.",
    "So, I calculate Rhonda's necklaces as 12 divided by 2.",
    "12 divided by 2 is 6, so Rhonda caught 6 necklaces.",
    "Now I know the number of necklaces Rhonda caught. I will find out how many necklaces Latch caught.",
    "According to the problem, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.",
    "First, I'll calculate three times as many necklaces as Rhonda caught by multiplying 6 by 3.",
    "6 times 3 is 18.",
    "Then, I'll subtract 4 from this number to find the number of necklaces Latch caught.",
    "18 minus 4 is 14."

  "solution": "14"
