  "query": "The town of Belize has 400 homes. One fourth of the town's homes are white. One fifth of the non-white homes have a fireplace. How many of the non-white homes do not have a fireplace?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of the homes in Belize are white.",
    "There are 400 homes in total, and one fourth of them are white.",
    "To find the number of white homes, I calculate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 = 100 \\).",
    "So, there are 100 white homes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of non-white homes.",
    "The total number of homes is 400, and there are 100 white homes.",
    "To find the non-white homes, I subtract the number of white homes from the total number of homes: 400 - 100.",
    "400 - 100 = 300.",
    "There are 300 non-white homes.",
    "I need to find out how many of these non-white homes have a fireplace.",
    "One fifth of the non-white homes have a fireplace.",
    "To determine the number of non-white homes with fireplaces, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 300 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 300 = 60 \\).",
    "Thus, 60 non-white homes have a fireplace.",
    "Finally, I find the number of non-white homes that do not have a fireplace.",
    "There are 300 non-white homes in total, and 60 have a fireplace.",
    "To find the number that do not have a fireplace, subtract the homes with fireplaces from the total number of non-white homes: 300 - 60.",
    "300 - 60 = 240."
