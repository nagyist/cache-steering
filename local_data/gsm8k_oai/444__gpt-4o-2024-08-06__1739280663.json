  "query": "Reggie and his brother are having a basketball shooting contest. They each get to take 10 shots. Layups are worth 1 point, free throws are worth 2 points, and anything further away is worth 3 points. Reggie makes 3 layups, two free throws, and one long shot. His brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. How many points does Reggie lose by?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the points Reggie scored.",
    "Reggie made 3 layups, and each layup is worth 1 point.",
    "So, Reggie's points from layups = 3 * 1 = 3 points.",
    "Reggie also made 2 free throws, and each free throw is worth 2 points.",
    "So, Reggie's points from free throws = 2 * 2 = 4 points.",
    "Reggie made 1 long shot, and each long shot is worth 3 points.",
    "So, Reggie's points from long shots = 1 * 3 = 3 points.",
    "Now I add all of Reggie's points together: 3 (layups) + 4 (free throws) + 3 (long shot) = 10 points.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the points Reggie's brother scored.",
    "Reggie's brother made 4 long shots, and each long shot is worth 3 points.",
    "So, Reggie's brother's points = 4 * 3 = 12 points.",
    "I now need to find out how many points Reggie loses by.",
    "Reggie's brother scored 12 points, and Reggie scored 10 points.",
    "Reggie loses by 12 - 10 = 2 points."
