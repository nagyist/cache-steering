  "query": "Tim drops a ball off the roof of a 96-foot tall building. The ball bounces to half the height from which it fell on each bounce. How high will it bounce on the fifth bounce?",
  "steps": [
    "The ball starts by falling from a height of 96 feet.",
    "On the first bounce, the ball bounces to half the distance of the height it fell from, which is 96 feet.",
    "Calculate half of 96 feet, which is 96 / 2.",
    "96 / 2 equals 48 feet. So, on the first bounce, the ball bounces to 48 feet.",
    "On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to half the height it reached on the previous bounce.",
    "Calculate half of 48 feet, which is 48 / 2.",
    "48 / 2 equals 24 feet. So, on the second bounce, the ball bounces to 24 feet.",
    "Repeat the process for the third bounce: find half of 24 feet.",
    "24 / 2 equals 12 feet. So, on the third bounce, the ball bounces to 12 feet.",
    "For the fourth bounce, find half of 12 feet.",
    "12 / 2 equals 6 feet. So, on the fourth bounce, the ball bounces to 6 feet.",
    "Finally, for the fifth bounce, find half of 6 feet.",
    "6 / 2 equals 3 feet. So, on the fifth bounce, the ball bounces to 3 feet."
