  "query": "Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes. He decided to pay not more than $130 for them. He found a pair for $120, on which he got a discount of 30%. How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcus has a budget of $130 for the shoes.",
    "He found a pair originally priced at $120.",
    "There is a 30% discount on the $120 price.",
    "First, I need to calculate the discount amount: 30% of $120.",
    "30% of $120 is calculated as (30/100) * $120 = $36.",
    "Next, I subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the shoes.",
    "$120 - $36 = $84.",
    "The price Marcus will pay for the shoes is $84.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money Marcus saves compared to his maximum budget of $130.",
    "I subtract the sale price from Marcus\u2019s maximum budget: $130 - $84.",
    "$130 - $84 = $46."

  "solution": "46"
