  "query": "The football coach makes his players run up and down the bleachers 40 times. Each time they run up and down 32 stairs one way. If each stair burns 2 calories, how many calories does each player burn during this exercise?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stairs each player runs in one complete set of running up and down.",
    "Running up the bleachers consists of 32 stairs, and running down also consists of 32 stairs.",
    "So, in one complete trip of running up and then down, a player runs 32 stairs up and 32 stairs down.",
    "32 stairs up + 32 stairs down = 64 stairs in total for one complete trip.",
    "Now I know each player runs up and down 64 stairs per complete trip.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many total trips each player completes.",
    "The coach requires them to run up and down the bleachers 40 times.",
    "This means each player makes 40 complete trips.",
    "Since each trip consists of running 64 stairs, I need to calculate the total number of stairs run by one player during the 40 trips.",
    "Multiply the number of stairs per trip (64) by the number of trips (40).",
    "64 stairs/trip * 40 trips = 2560 stairs in total.",
    "Each stair burns 2 calories.",
    "So, the calories burned per stair need to be multiplied by the total number of stairs.",
    "2 calories/stair * 2560 stairs = 5120 calories."

  "solution": "5120"
