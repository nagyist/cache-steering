  "query": "A competition has racers competing on bicycles and tricycles to win a grand prize of $4000. If there are 40 people in the race, and 3/5 of them are riding on bicycles, how many wheels do the bicycles and tricycles in the race have combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many racers are riding bicycles.",
    "There are 40 people in the race, and 3/5 of them are on bicycles.",
    "Calculate the number of bicycle riders: (3/5) * 40.",
    "(3/5) * 40 = 24. So, 24 racers are on bicycles.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many racers are riding tricycles.",
    "Since there are 40 racers in total and 24 are on bicycles, the remaining racers must be on tricycles.",
    "Subtract the number of bicycle riders from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.",
    "So, there are 16 racers on tricycles.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of wheels from bicycles.",
    "Each bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "Multiply the number of bicycle riders by the number of wheels per bicycle: 24 * 2 = 48.",
    "Now calculate the total number of wheels from tricycles.",
    "Each tricycle has 3 wheels.",
    "Multiply the number of tricycle riders by the number of wheels per tricycle: 16 * 3 = 48.",
    "Finally, combine the wheels from bicycles and tricycles to find the total.",
    "Add the wheels from bicycles and tricycles: 48 + 48 = 96."

  "solution": "96"
