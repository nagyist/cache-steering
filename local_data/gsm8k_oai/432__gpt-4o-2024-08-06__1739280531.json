  "steps": [
    "Tina is getting $20 for each book she sells.",
    "She realizes a $120 profit.",
    "First, I need to calculate her costs and revenues.",
    "Her profit formula is Profit = Revenue - Cost.",
    "Revenue comes from selling the books at $20 each.",
    "Each book costs $5 to make, so cost for each book is $5.",
    "Revenue per book sold is $20.",
    "Cost is $5 per book, and revenue is $20 per book.",
    "For one book, Profit = Revenue - Cost = $20 - $5 = $15.",
    "Profit per book is $15.",
    "Tina has a total profit of $120.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many books she sold to get a profit of $120.",
    "Let the number of books she sells be 'x'.",
    "The profit from 'x' books is 15x = $120.",
    "To find 'x', solve the equation 15x = 120.",
    "Divide both sides by 15: x = 120 / 15.",
    "x = 8.",
    "Tina sold 8 books in total.",
    "Each customer buys 2 books at a time.",
    "I need to find how many customers bought 2 books each.",
    "Number of customers = Number of books / Number of books per customer.",
    "Number of customers = 8 books / 2 books per customer.",
    "Number of customers = 4."
