  "query": "Tom reads 10 hours over 5 days.  He can read 50 pages per hour.  Assuming he reads the same amount every day how many pages does he read in 7 days?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many hours Tom reads per day.",
    "Tom reads 10 hours over 5 days.",
    "To find the number of hours he reads per day, I divide 10 hours by 5 days.",
    "10 hours \u00f7 5 days = 2 hours per day.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many pages Tom reads in a day.",
    "Tom can read 50 pages per hour.",
    "If he reads 2 hours a day, I multiply 2 hours by 50 pages per hour to find how many pages he reads in a day.",
    "2 hours/day \u00d7 50 pages/hour = 100 pages per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many pages he reads in 7 days.",
    "Since he reads 100 pages per day, I multiply 100 pages by 7 days.",
    "100 pages/day \u00d7 7 days = 700 pages."

  "solution": "700"
