  "query": "Joyce, Michael, Nikki, and Ryn have a favorite movie. Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie. Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie, and Ryn's favorite movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's favorite movie. If Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long, calculate the total number of hours of their favorite movies together.",
  "steps": [
    "We know Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long.",
    "Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie. So, we can set up the equation: 3 * Michael's movie = 30.",
    "Solving for Michael's movie, we divide both sides by 3: Michael's movie = 30 / 3.",
    "Michael's movie is 10 hours long.",
    "Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie. So, Joyce's movie = 10 + 2.",
    "Joyce's movie is 12 hours long.",
    "Ryn's favorite movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's favorite movie. So, Ryn's movie = (4/5) * 30.",
    "Calculating Ryn's movie length: Ryn's movie = 24 hours.",
    "Now, I will add up the lengths of all their favorite movies: Joyce's movie (12 hours) + Michael's movie (10 hours) + Nikki's movie (30 hours) + Ryn's movie (24 hours).",
    "Adding them up: 12 + 10 + 30 + 24 = 76."

  "solution": "76"
