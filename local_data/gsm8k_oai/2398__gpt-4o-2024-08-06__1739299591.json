  "query": "A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the total length of the wire from feet and inches to inches only.",
    "The wire is 5 feet 4 inches long.",
    "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, I multiply 5 feet by 12 inches per foot.",
    "5 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.",
    "I add the additional 4 inches to the 60 inches.",
    "60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.",
    "Now, I know the total length of the wire in inches is 64 inches.",
    "To find the length of each part, I need to divide the total length by the number of parts, which is 4.",
    "So, I divide 64 inches by 4.",
    "64 inches \u00f7 4 = 16 inches."

  "solution": "16"
