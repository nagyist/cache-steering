  "query": "The ratio of fuel used in gallons to the distance covered in miles by Haley's car is 4:7. If Haley's car used 44 gallons of gas, calculate the distance it covered in miles.",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the ratio of fuel used to distance covered is 4:7.",
    "This means for every 4 gallons of fuel, 7 miles are covered.",
    "Haley's car used 44 gallons of gas.",
    "To find out how many sets of 4 gallons are in 44 gallons, I divide 44 by 4.",
    "44 divided by 4 is 11, so there are 11 sets of 4 gallons.",
    "According to the ratio, in each set of 4 gallons, 7 miles are covered.",
    "Therefore, I multiply 11 (the number of 4-gallon sets) by 7 (miles per set) to get the total distance.",
    "11 times 7 is 77."
  ],
  "solution": "77"
