  "query": "A radio show plays for 3 hours a day. They split their show into talking segments, ad breaks and songs. Talking segments last 10 minutes each, ad breaks last 5 minutes each and songs are played throughout the rest of the show. If the radio show includes 3 talking segments and 5 ad breaks in today\u2019s show, how long, in minutes, does the show play songs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total duration of the radio show in minutes.",
    "Since the show plays for 3 hours a day, I convert the hours into minutes.",
    "1 hour is 60 minutes, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total time taken up by the talking segments.",
    "There are 3 talking segments, and each lasts 10 minutes.",
    "So the total time for talking segments is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.",
    "Now, I calculate the total time taken up by the ad breaks.",
    "There are 5 ad breaks, and each lasts 5 minutes.",
    "So the total time for ad breaks is 5 * 5 = 25 minutes.",
    "Now, I add the time for talking segments and ad breaks to find out how much time is taken by these activities altogether.",
    "The total time for talking segments and ad breaks is 30 + 25 = 55 minutes.",
    "To find out how long the show plays songs, I subtract the total time taken by talking segments and ad breaks from the total show time.",
    "The total time for songs is 180 - 55 = 125 minutes."

  "solution": "125"
