  "query": "Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason has.  If Jason has two tattoos on each of his arms and three tattoos on each of his legs, how many tattoos does Adam have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tattoos Jason has in total.",
    "Jason has two arms, and he has two tattoos on each arm.",
    "So, Jason has 2 arms * 2 tattoos/arm = 4 tattoos on his arms.",
    "Jason also has two legs, and he has three tattoos on each leg.",
    "So, Jason has 2 legs * 3 tattoos/leg = 6 tattoos on his legs.",
    "Now, I can find the total number of tattoos Jason has by summing the tattoos on his arms and legs.",
    "Jason has 4 tattoos on his arms + 6 tattoos on his legs = 10 tattoos in total.",
    "According to the problem, Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason.",
    "First, I find twice the number of tattoos Jason has: 2 * 10 = 20 tattoos.",
    "Then, I add three to this number to find the total number of tattoos Adam has: 20 + 3 = 23 tattoos."

  "solution": "23"
