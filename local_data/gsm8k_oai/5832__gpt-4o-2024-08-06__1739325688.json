  "steps": [
    "Harvey started with 25 steaks.",
    "He had 12 steaks left after selling some.",
    "To find out how many steaks he sold initially, we subtract the remaining steaks from the starting amount: 25 - 12.",
    "25 - 12 equals 13.",
    "So, he initially sold 13 steaks.",
    "Then he sold 4 more steaks.",
    "To find the total number of steaks sold, I add the steaks sold first (13) to the steaks sold later (4).",
    "13 + 4 equals 17."
