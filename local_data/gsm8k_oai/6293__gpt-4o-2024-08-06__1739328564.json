  "query": "John invests in a bank and gets 10% simple interest.  He invests $1000.  How much money does he have after 3 years?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by understanding the problem. John invests $1000 at 10% simple interest.",
    "Simple interest means the interest is calculated only on the original principal amount each year.",
    "The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time.",
    "I know that the principal is $1000, the rate is 10%, and the time is 3 years.",
    "I convert the rate from a percentage to a decimal: 10% = 0.10.",
    "I plug the values into the formula: Interest = $1000 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 3.",
    "I calculate the interest: $1000 \u00d7 0.10 = $100.",
    "Then, I calculate: $100 \u00d7 3 = $300.",
    "The total interest earned over 3 years is $300.",
    "To find the total amount of money John has after 3 years, I add the interest to the principal.",
    "John's total amount is the principal, $1000, plus the interest, $300.",
    "Finally, I calculate: $1000 + $300 = $1300."

  "solution": "1300"
