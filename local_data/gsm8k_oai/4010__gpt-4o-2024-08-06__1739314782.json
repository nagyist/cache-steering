  "query": "Beth bakes 4, 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week.  If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many batches of cookies Beth bakes.",
    "Beth bakes 4 batches, and each batch is 2 dozen cookies.",
    "One dozen equals 12, so 2 dozen is 24 cookies.",
    "Therefore, each batch contains 24 cookies.",
    "Since she bakes 4 batches in a week, I need to find the total number of cookies.",
    "I multiply 4 batches by 24 cookies per batch to calculate the total number of cookies.",
    "4 batches * 24 cookies/batch = 96 cookies.",
    "Next, I need to share these 96 cookies among 16 people equally.",
    "I divide 96 cookies by 16 people to find out how many cookies each person gets.",
    "96 cookies \u00f7 16 people = 6 cookies per person."
