  "query": "Four tires and one battery together cost $224. Each tire costs $42. Calculate the price of the battery.",
  "steps": [
    "The total cost of four tires and one battery is given as $224.",
    "Each tire costs $42.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the four tires by multiplying the cost of one tire by four.",
    "4 tires \u00d7 $42 each = $168",
    "Now, I subtract the total cost of the four tires from the total cost of the four tires and one battery to find the cost of the battery.",
    "$224 (total cost) - $168 (cost of tires) = $56"
