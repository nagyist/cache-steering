  "query": "Facebook decided to award a productivity bonus to all its female employees who are mothers. This productivity bonus will total 25% of Facebook's annual earnings, which was $5,000,000 for the year 2020. It is known that Facebook employs 3300 employees; one-third are men, and of the women, 1200 are not mothers. How much was the bonus that each female mother employee received, assuming each one received an equal amount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total annual earnings of Facebook for the year 2020, which is given as $5,000,000.",
    "Calculate 25% of Facebook's annual earnings to find the total amount allocated for the productivity bonus: 25% of $5,000,000.",
    "25% can be calculated as 0.25, so multiply $5,000,000 by 0.25.",
    "$5,000,000 * 0.25 = $1,250,000. This is the total amount allocated for the bonus.",
    "Next, determine the number of women employed by Facebook. Start by finding the number of men.",
    "One-third of the employees are men, so the number of men is 1/3 of 3300.",
    "3300 * (1/3) = 1100 men.",
    "Now, calculate the number of women by subtracting the number of men from the total employee count.",
    "The number of women is 3300 - 1100 = 2200.",
    "Now, among the women, 1200 are not mothers. To find the number of female mothers, subtract the number of women who are not mothers from the total number of women.",
    "The number of female mothers = 2200 - 1200 = 1000.",
    "Now, divide the total bonus amount equally among the female mothers.",
    "The total bonus amount is $1,250,000, and it must be divided equally among 1000 female mothers.",
    "Divide $1,250,000 by 1000 to find the bonus each female mother received.",
    "$1,250,000 / 1000 = $1,250."
