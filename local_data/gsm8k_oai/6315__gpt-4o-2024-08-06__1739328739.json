  "query": "Jack is mad at his neighbors for blasting Taylor Swift all night, so he slashes three of their tires and smashes their front window. If the tires cost $250 each and the window costs $700, how much will Jack have to pay for the damages?",
  "steps": [
    "Jack slashes three tires.",
    "Each tire costs $250.",
    "To find the cost for the three tires, I need to multiply the cost of one tire by the number of tires slashed.",
    "Multiply 3 tires by $250 per tire.",
    "3 * 250 = 750",
    "The cost of the damaged tires is $750.",
    "Now consider the smashed window.",
    "The window costs $700.",
    "To find the total damages, add the cost of the tires and the cost of the window.",
    "750 (tires) + 700 (window) = 1450"
  ],
  "solution": "1450"
