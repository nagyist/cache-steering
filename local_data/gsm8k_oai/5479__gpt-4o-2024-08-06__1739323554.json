  "query": "A guy goes to the tool shop and buys 5 sets of drill bits.  Each set cost 6 dollars.  He then pays 10% tax on the order.  What was the total amount he paid?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost before tax. There are 5 sets of drill bits, and each set costs 6 dollars.",
    "Multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 5 sets * 6 dollars/set = 30 dollars.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%.",
    "To find the tax amount, multiply the total cost before tax by the tax rate: 30 dollars * 0.10 = 3 dollars.",
    "Finally, add the tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total amount paid: 30 dollars + 3 dollars = 33 dollars."

  "solution": "33"
