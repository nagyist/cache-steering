  "query": "Geric had twice as many bills as Kyla who has 2 fewer bills than Jessa.  After giving 3 bills to Geric, Jessa has 7 bills left. How many bills did Geric have at the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many bills Jessa had initially.",
    "We know Jessa gave 3 bills to Geric and had 7 bills left.",
    "If Jessa has 7 bills now, it means before giving the bills, she had 7 + 3 = 10 bills.",
    "Now let's determine how many bills Kyla had.",
    "According to the problem, Kyla has 2 fewer bills than Jessa.",
    "Since Jessa had 10 bills initially, Kyla had 10 - 2 = 8 bills.",
    "Next, we need to find out how many bills Geric had initially.",
    "Geric had twice as many bills as Kyla.",
    "Since Kyla had 8 bills, Geric had 2 * 8 = 16 bills.",
    "So, initially, Geric had 16 bills before Jessa gave him 3 more bills.",
    "I will double-check my steps to ensure there's no error.",
    "The problem's conditions are satisfied: Jessa initially had 10 bills, gave 3 to Geric and then had 7. Kyla had 8, and Geric, having twice as many as Kyla, had 16 initially."
