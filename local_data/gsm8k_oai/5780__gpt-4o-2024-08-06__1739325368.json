    "Travis gets a 30% discount on the regular ticket price.",
    "The regular ticket price is $2000.",
    "First, I need to calculate 30% of $2000.",
    "To find 30% of $2000, I multiply $2000 by 0.30.",
    "$2000 * 0.30 = $600.",
    "The discount amount is $600.",
    "To find the price Travis needs to pay, I subtract the discount from the regular price.",
    "$2000 - $600 = $1400."
