  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Madeline's total expenses for the month.",
    "Rent is $1200.",
    "Groceries cost $400.",
    "Medical expenses are $200.",
    "Utilities cost $60.",
    "Madeline wants to save $200 for emergencies.",
    "I will now add up all these expenses to find the total.",
    "$1200 (rent) + $400 (groceries) + $200 (medical expenses) + $60 (utilities) + $200 (savings) = $2060 total.",
    "Madeline needs a total of $2060 this month.",
    "She makes $15 per hour at her job.",
    "I need to determine how many hours she needs to work to cover $2060 in expenses.",
    "I will divide the total amount needed, $2060, by the amount she earns per hour, $15.",
    "$2060 \u00f7 $15 = 137.3333...",
    "Since Madeline cannot work a fraction of an hour, I need to round up to the nearest whole number.",
    "137.3333 rounded up is 138.",
    "Madeline needs to work 138 hours this month."
