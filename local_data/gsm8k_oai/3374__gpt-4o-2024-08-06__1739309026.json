  "query": "Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of insects collected by Aliya and her classmates.",
    "The boys collected 200 insects.",
    "The girls collected 300 insects.",
    "I need to add the number of insects collected by the boys and the girls to find the total number of insects.",
    "200 (insects by boys) + 300 (insects by girls) = 500 total insects.",
    "Next, the teacher wants to divide these insects equally among four groups.",
    "To find the number of insects per group, I'll divide the total number of insects by the number of groups.",
    "500 total insects \u00f7 4 groups = 125 insects per group."

  "solution": "125"
