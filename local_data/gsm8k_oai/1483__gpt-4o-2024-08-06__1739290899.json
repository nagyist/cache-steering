  "query": "Mia is buying Christmas gifts for her family. She has spent $30 on each of her 3 siblings, and the rest of her spending was for her parents. If Mia spent a total of $150 on Christmas gifts and each of her parents received gifts of equal value, how much money, in dollars, did she spend on each parent\u2019s gift?",
  "steps": [
    "Mia has three siblings.",
    "She spent $30 on each sibling.",
    "Calculate the total amount spent on her siblings by multiplying $30 by 3.",
    "$30 * 3 = $90.",
    "Mia has spent $90 in total on her siblings.",
    "She spent a total of $150 on all the gifts.",
    "Subtract the amount spent on her siblings from the total amount spent to find out how much she spent on her parents.",
    "$150 - $90 = $60.",
    "Mia spent $60 in total on her parents.",
    "Each parent received gifts of equal value.",
    "There are two parents.",
    "To find out how much Mia spent on each parent's gift, divide the total amount spent on parents by 2.",
    "$60 \u00f7 2 = $30."
