  "query": "There are 480 grains of rice in one cup. If half a cup is 8 tablespoons and one tablespoon is 3 teaspoons, how many grains of rice are in a teaspoon?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many grains of rice constitute a teaspoon.",
    "Start by figuring out how many grains of rice are in a tablespoon.",
    "First calculate the number of tablespoons in a full cup.",
    "Since half a cup is 8 tablespoons, a full cup is 8 * 2 = 16 tablespoons.",
    "There are 480 grains of rice in a full cup.",
    "Now, divide the rice grains by the number of tablespoons in a cup to find out how many grains are in each tablespoon: 480 grains / 16 tablespoons.",
    "480 / 16 = 30 grains per tablespoon.",
    "Next, determine how many grains of rice are in a teaspoon.",
    "A tablespoon is equivalent to 3 teaspoons.",
    "Divide the number of grains in a tablespoon by the number of teaspoons in it: 30 grains per tablespoon / 3 teaspoons per tablespoon.",
    "30 / 3 = 10 grains per teaspoon."
