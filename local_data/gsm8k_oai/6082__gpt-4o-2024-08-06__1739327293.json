  "query": "Chris has half as many cookies as Kenny. Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny. How many cookies do these three boys have, if Glenn has 24 cookies?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many cookies each of the boys has. I know that Glenn has 24 cookies.",
    "According to the problem, Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny.",
    "If Glenn has 24 cookies, I can calculate how many cookies Kenny has by dividing 24 by 4.",
    "24 divided by 4 is 6.",
    "So, Kenny has 6 cookies.",
    "Chris has half as many cookies as Kenny.",
    "Kenny has 6 cookies, so I need to calculate half of 6 to find out how many cookies Chris has.",
    "Half of 6 is 3.",
    "Chris has 3 cookies.",
    "Now I need to add up all the cookies to find the total number of cookies the three boys have.",
    "Chris has 3 cookies, Kenny has 6 cookies, and Glenn has 24 cookies.",
    "I add 3 + 6 + 24 to find the total number of cookies.",
    "3 + 6 is 9, and adding 24 gives 33."
