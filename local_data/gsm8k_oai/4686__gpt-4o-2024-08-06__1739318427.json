  "query": "Darcy washes and drys 20 shirts and 8 pairs of shorts. If he folds 12 of the shirts and 5 of the shorts, how many more remaining pieces of clothing does Darcy have to fold?",
  "steps": [
    "Darcy starts with 20 shirts and 8 pairs of shorts.",
    "He folds 12 shirts from the 20 shirts he has.",
    "To find out the number of shirts left to fold, subtract 12 from 20.",
    "20 - 12 = 8 shirts left to fold.",
    "He also folds 5 pairs of shorts out of the 8 pairs of shorts he has.",
    "To find out the number of shorts left to fold, subtract 5 from 8.",
    "8 - 5 = 3 pairs of shorts left to fold.",
    "Now, add the remaining shirts and shorts to find the total number of clothes left to fold.",
    "8 shirts + 3 pairs of shorts = 11 pieces of clothing left to fold."
