  "steps": [
    "Louie obtained 80% on the quiz.",
    "This means he answered 80% of the questions correctly.",
    "Let the total number of questions in the quiz be \\( x \\).",
    "If Louie got 80% correct, he got 20% incorrect.",
    "He made 5 mistakes.",
    "These 5 mistakes are the 20% of the total quiz questions.",
    "So, 20% of \\( x \\) is equal to 5.",
    "We can write this as the equation: \\( 0.2x = 5 \\).",
    "Solving for \\( x \\), divide both sides by 0.2: \\( x = \\frac{5}{0.2} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{5}{0.2} \\) which is equal to 25."
