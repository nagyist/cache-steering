  "query": "Tamika drove for 8 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour. Logan drove for 5 hours at 55 miles an hour. How many miles farther did Tamika drive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many miles Tamika drove.",
    "Tamika drove for 8 hours at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.",
    "To find the distance Tamika drove, I use the formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.",
    "So, Tamika's distance = 45 miles/hour \u00d7 8 hours.",
    "Calculating this, 45 \u00d7 8 = 360.",
    "Tamika drove 360 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many miles Logan drove.",
    "Logan drove for 5 hours at an average speed of 55 miles per hour.",
    "Using the same formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.",
    "Logan's distance = 55 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours.",
    "Calculating this, 55 \u00d7 5 = 275.",
    "Logan drove 275 miles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many miles farther Tamika drove compared to Logan.",
    "To find this, I subtract Logan's distance from Tamika's distance: 360 miles - 275 miles.",
    "Calculating this, 360 - 275 = 85.",
    "Tamika drove 85 miles farther than Logan."

  "solution": "85"
