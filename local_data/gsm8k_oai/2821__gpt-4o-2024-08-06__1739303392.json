  "query": "Matt orders 15 pounds of beef.  He cuts that into 12-ounce steaks.  How many steaks does he get?",
  "steps": [
    "Matt has ordered 15 pounds of beef.",
    "There are 16 ounces in one pound.",
    "I need to convert the total pounds to ounces to find out how many ounces of beef Matt has.",
    "So, 15 pounds of beef is equal to 15 \u00d7 16 ounces.",
    "15 \u00d7 16 = 240 ounces.",
    "Now that I know Matt has 240 ounces of beef, I need to determine how many 12-ounce steaks he can cut from this.",
    "To find out the number of steaks, I divide the total number of ounces by the number of ounces per steak.",
    "240 ounces divided by 12 ounces per steak is 240 \u00f7 12.",
    "240 \u00f7 12 = 20."

  "solution": "20"
