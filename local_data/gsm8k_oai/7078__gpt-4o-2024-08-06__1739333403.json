  "query": "There are 3 ducks in a pond and they all eat some pieces of bread thrown in the water. One duck eats half of all the pieces of bread. Another duck eats only 13 pieces of the bread and the last duck eats 7 pieces of bread. There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water, how many total pieces of bread were thrown in the pond?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the total number of pieces of bread thrown into the pond as \\( x \\).",
    "The first duck eats half of the pieces of bread, so it eats \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) pieces.",
    "The second duck eats 13 pieces of bread.",
    "The third duck eats 7 pieces of bread.",
    "There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water after the ducks have eaten.",
    "Therefore, the total pieces of bread eaten by the ducks is \\( \\frac{x}{2} + 13 + 7 \\).",
    "The equation relating the bread pieces eaten by ducks and the bread left is:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 13 + 7 + 30 = x\n\\]",
    "Simplifying the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 20 + 30 = x\n\\]",
    "Which simplifies further to:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 50 = x\n\\]",
    "Subtract \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n50 = x - \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]",
    "This can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n50 = \\frac{2x}{2} - \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]",
    "Combine the terms:\n\\[\n50 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]",
    "Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n100 = x\n\\]"
