  "query": "After sharing 100 stickers with her friends, Xia had five sheets of stickers left. If each sheet had ten stickers on it, how many stickers did Xia have at the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "Xia had five sheets of stickers left.",
    "Each sheet had ten stickers on it.",
    "So, there are 5 sheets * 10 stickers/sheet = 50 stickers remaining with Xia.",
    "Xia shared 100 stickers with her friends.",
    "To find the initial number of stickers Xia had, add the stickers she shared to the stickers she has left.",
    "100 stickers (shared) + 50 stickers (remaining) = 150 stickers."
