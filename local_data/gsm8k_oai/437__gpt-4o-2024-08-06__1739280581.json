  "query": "Lao is farming chickens. He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to determine the profit made on each chicken. Lao sells each chicken for $1.50.",
    "I also need to calculate the cost of feed per chicken. Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed.",
    "The cost of a bag of chicken feed is $2 for 20 pounds. Therefore, the cost per pound is $2 / 20 pounds = $0.10 per pound.",
    "Since each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed, the cost of feed per chicken is 2 pounds * $0.10/pound = $0.20.",
    "Now I can calculate the profit per chicken. The selling price per chicken is $1.50, and the cost per chicken (feed) is $0.20, so profit per chicken is $1.50 - $0.20 = $1.30.",
    "Lao makes a total profit of $65. I need to find out how many chickens he sold to make that profit.",
    "The profit per chicken is $1.30, and the total profit is $65.",
    "To find the number of chickens sold, I divide the total profit by the profit per chicken: $65 / $1.30.",
    "Calculating $65 / $1.30 gives me 50."

  "solution": "50"
