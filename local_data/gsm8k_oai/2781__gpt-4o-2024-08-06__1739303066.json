  "query": "When Patrick, Manu, and Amy participate in a race they realize that Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds. Manu took 12 more seconds to finish the race. If Amy is twice as fast as Manu, how long did it take her to finish the race?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it took Manu to finish the race.",
    "Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds.",
    "Manu took 12 more seconds than Patrick, so Manu's time is 60 + 12.",
    "Calculating Manu's time: 60 + 12 = 72 seconds.",
    "Now, I need to determine Amy's time.",
    "Amy is twice as fast as Manu.",
    "Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if Amy is twice as fast, she takes half the time Manu takes.",
    "Manu took 72 seconds. Half of 72 is 72 / 2.",
    "Calculating: 72 / 2 = 36 seconds."
