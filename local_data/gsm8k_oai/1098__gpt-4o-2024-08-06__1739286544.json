  "query": "Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?",
  "steps": [
    "I start with 30 watermelons.",
    "Each week, Jeremy eats 3 watermelons.",
    "Each week, Jeremy gives 2 watermelons to his dad.",
    "In total, each week, 5 watermelons are consumed (3 eaten + 2 given away).",
    "To find out how many weeks the watermelons will last, I divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used each week.",
    "So, I calculate: 30 \u00f7 5 = 6."
