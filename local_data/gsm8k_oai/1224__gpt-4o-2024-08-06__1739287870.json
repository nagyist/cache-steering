    "Jim starts with $80 in his investment portfolio.",
    "In the first year, the portfolio grows by 15%.",
    "I need to calculate the growth for the first year: $80 * 0.15 = $12.",
    "After the first year, Jim's portfolio is $80 + $12 = $92.",
    "Jim adds another $28 to his portfolio.",
    "After adding $28, his portfolio becomes $92 + $28 = $120.",
    "In the second year, the portfolio grows by 10%.",
    "I need to calculate the growth for the second year: $120 * 0.10 = $12.",
    "After the second year, Jim's portfolio is $120 + $12 = $132."
