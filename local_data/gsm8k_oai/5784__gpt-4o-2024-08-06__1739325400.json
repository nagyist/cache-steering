  "query": "Jay bought a book for $25, a pen for $4, and a ruler for $1. He paid with a fifty-dollar bill. How much change, in dollars, did Jay get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total amount Jay spent.",
    "The book costs $25.",
    "The pen costs $4.",
    "The ruler costs $1.",
    "Adding these amounts gives the total: $25 + $4 + $1.",
    "Calculate that: $25 + $4 = $29, then $29 + $1 = $30.",
    "Jay paid with a fifty-dollar bill.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much change Jay gets by subtracting the total spent from the amount he paid with.",
    "The calculation is $50 (amount paid) - $30 (total spent).",
    "Subtracting gives me the change: $50 - $30 = $20."
