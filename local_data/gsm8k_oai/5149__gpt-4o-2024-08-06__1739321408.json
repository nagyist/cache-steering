  "query": "Danny has a huge fish tank that contains 94 guppies, 76 angelfish, 89 tiger sharks, and 58 Oscar fish. If he sells 30 guppies, 48 angelfish, 17 tiger sharks, and 24 Oscar fish. How many fish will remain?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many guppies Danny will have after the sale.",
    "Danny initially has 94 guppies.",
    "He sells 30 guppies.",
    "Subtracting the guppies sold from the initial count: 94 - 30 = 64 guppies remaining.",
    "Next, I calculate how many angelfish Danny will have after the sale.",
    "Danny initially has 76 angelfish.",
    "He sells 48 angelfish.",
    "Subtracting the angelfish sold from the initial count: 76 - 48 = 28 angelfish remaining.",
    "Now, I determine how many tiger sharks Danny will have after the sale.",
    "Danny initially has 89 tiger sharks.",
    "He sells 17 tiger sharks.",
    "Subtracting the tiger sharks sold from the initial count: 89 - 17 = 72 tiger sharks remaining.",
    "Finally, I calculate how many Oscar fish Danny will have after the sale.",
    "Danny initially has 58 Oscar fish.",
    "He sells 24 Oscar fish.",
    "Subtracting the Oscar fish sold from the initial count: 58 - 24 = 34 Oscar fish remaining.",
    "To find the total number of fish remaining, I add the number of each type of fish remaining.",
    "Adding the remaining guppies, angelfish, tiger sharks, and Oscar fish: 64 + 28 + 72 + 34.",
    "Calculating the sum: 64 + 28 = 92.",
    "92 + 72 = 164.",
    "164 + 34 = 198."

  "solution": "198"
