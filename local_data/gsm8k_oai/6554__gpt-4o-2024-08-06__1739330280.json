  "query": "Michelle uses 40 beads in making a necklace. She uses 5 blue beads and 2 times as many red beads as blue beads. Then she uses the same number of white beads as the blue and red beads combined. If the rest of the beads she uses are silver, how many silver beads does she use?",
  "steps": [
    "Michelle uses 5 blue beads.",
    "The number of red beads is 2 times the number of blue beads, which is 2 * 5 = 10 red beads.",
    "The number of white beads is equal to the total number of blue and red beads. So, white beads = 5 + 10 = 15 white beads.",
    "The total number of beads which are not silver is the sum of blue, red, and white beads. Therefore, non-silver beads = 5 (blue) + 10 (red) + 15 (white) = 30 beads.",
    "The total number of beads Michelle uses to make the necklace is 40.",
    "The number of silver beads is the total number of beads minus the non-silver beads, which is 40 - 30 = 10 silver beads."
