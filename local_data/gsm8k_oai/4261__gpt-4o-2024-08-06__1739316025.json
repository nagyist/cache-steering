  "query": "There are 30 students in Ms. Leech's class. Twice as many girls as boys are in the class. There are 10 boys in the class and each boy today brought 5 cups for science activity class as Ms. Leech had instructed. If the total number of cups brought by the students in the class is 90, how many cups did each girl bring?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of boys in the class.",
    "According to the problem, there are 10 boys in the class.",
    "Next, I know that the class has twice as many girls as boys. I need to find the number of girls.",
    "Since there are twice as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 2 times 10, which is 20 girls.",
    "Now, I know there are 10 boys and 20 girls in the class, totaling 30 students.",
    "Each boy brought 5 cups for the science activity. I need to calculate the total number of cups brought by the boys.",
    "If each of the 10 boys brought 5 cups, then the total number of cups brought by the boys is 10 x 5 = 50 cups.",
    "Next, I have the total number of cups brought to the class, which is 90 cups.",
    "The cups brought by the girls, therefore, would be the total number of cups minus the cups brought by the boys: 90 - 50 = 40 cups.",
    "Finally, I need to find out how many cups each girl brought.",
    "If 20 girls brought a total of 40 cups, then each girl brought 40 / 20 = 2 cups."
