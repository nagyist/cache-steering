  "query": "Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many barrettes Annie has. It is given that she has 6 barrettes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many scrunchies she has. The problem states she has twice as many scrunchies as barrettes.",
    "Since Annie has 6 barrettes, she has 2 times 6 scrunchies. Therefore, she has 12 scrunchies.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many bobby pins she has. The problem states that she has three fewer bobby pins than barrettes.",
    "Since she has 6 barrettes, she has 6 minus 3 bobby pins. This means she has 3 bobby pins.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of hair decorations she has by adding the number of barrettes, scrunchies, and bobby pins.",
    "The total number of hair decorations is 6 barrettes + 12 scrunchies + 3 bobby pins = 21.",
    "Next, I need to find what percentage of the total hair decorations are bobby pins.",
    "The number of bobby pins (3) divided by the total number of hair decorations (21) gives the fraction of hair decorations that are bobby pins.",
    "The fraction is 3/21, which simplifies to 1/7.",
    "To find the percentage, I'll multiply 1/7 by 100.",
    "1/7 times 100 is approximately 14.2857...",
    "Finally, I need to round 14.2857... to the nearest percent."
