  "query": "There were 80 cars in a parking lot. At lunchtime, 13 cars left the parking lot but 5 more cars went in than left. How many cars are in the parking lot now?",
  "steps": [
    "There were originally 80 cars in the parking lot.",
    "13 cars left the parking lot at lunchtime.",
    "When 13 cars leave, we subtract 13 from 80.",
    "80 - 13 equals 67.",
    "However, 5 more cars went in than left. This means there were 5 more cars that entered than the 13 cars that left.",
    "The number of cars that went in is 13 + 5 because 5 more cars went in than left. This equals 18 cars going in.",
    "To find the new total, we add the 18 cars that went in to the 67 cars remaining after 13 left.",
    "67 + 18 equals 85."

  "solution": "85"
