  "query": "On a particular day, a car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it traveled from Ngapara to Zipra. If the car took 60 hours to travel from Ngapara to Zipra, calculate the total time the car traveled that day.",
  "steps": [
    "The time taken to travel from Ngapara to Zipra is given as 60 hours.",
    "The car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it took from Ngapara to Zipra.",
    "I need to calculate 80% of 60 hours to find the time taken from Ningi to Zipra.",
    "80% of 60 hours is computed as 0.8 multiplied by 60.",
    "0.8 times 60 equals 48 hours.",
    "The time taken to travel from Ningi to Zipra is 48 hours.",
    "To find the total travel time for the day, I need to add the travel times for both segments of the trip.",
    "The total travel time is 60 hours plus 48 hours.",
    "60 hours plus 48 hours equals 108 hours."
