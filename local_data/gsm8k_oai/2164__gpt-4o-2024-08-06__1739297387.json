  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many toys are action figures.",
    "There are 24 toys in total.",
    "1/4 of the toys are action figures.",
    "To find out how many action figures there are, I'll calculate 1/4 of 24.",
    "1/4 of 24 is 24 divided by 4.",
    "24 divided by 4 is 6.",
    "There are 6 action figures.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many toys are dolls.",
    "Since there are 24 toys in total and 6 of them are action figures, I subtract the action figures from the total number of toys.",
    "24 toys minus 6 action figures equals 18.",
    "There are 18 dolls."
