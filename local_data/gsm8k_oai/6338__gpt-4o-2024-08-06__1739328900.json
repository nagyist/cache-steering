  "query": "Lisa bought a new iPhone for $1000. She bought a phone contract that costs $200/month, a case that costs 20% of the cost of the phone, and headphones that cost half as much as the case. How much will Lisa spend on her phone in the first year?",
  "steps": [
    "Lisa bought a new iPhone for $1000.",
    "The phone contract costs $200 per month.",
    "The contract is for a year, which is 12 months.",
    "First, calculate the total cost of the contract for one year: $200/month * 12 months = $2400.",
    "The case costs 20% of the cost of the phone.",
    "Calculate 20% of $1000, which is 0.20 * $1000 = $200.",
    "The headphones cost half as much as the case.",
    "Calculate the cost of the headphones: $200 / 2 = $100.",
    "Add up all these costs to find the total spending: $1000 (iPhone) + $2400 (contract) + $200 (case) + $100 (headphones).",
    "Add the amounts: $1000 + $2400 + $200 + $100 = $3700."
