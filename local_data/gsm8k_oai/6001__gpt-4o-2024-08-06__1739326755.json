  "steps": [
    "First, I need to list all the temperatures Berry recorded during the week.",
    "The temperatures are: 99.1 (Sunday), 98.2 (Monday), 98.7 (Tuesday), 99.3 (Wednesday), 99.8 (Thursday), 99 (Friday), 98.9 (Saturday).",
    "Next, I will sum all of these temperatures.",
    "99.1 + 98.2 = 197.3",
    "197.3 + 98.7 = 296",
    "296 + 99.3 = 395.3",
    "395.3 + 99.8 = 495.1",
    "495.1 + 99 = 594.1",
    "594.1 + 98.9 = 693",
    "Now, I'll count the number of days for the average calculation. There are 7 days in a week.",
    "The sum of temperatures for the week is 693, and there are 7 days.",
    "I'll divide the total sum by the number of days to find the average temperature.",
    "693 \u00f7 7 = 99"
