  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of chairs in the church.",
    "There are 6 chairs in each row and 20 rows of chairs.",
    "To find the total number of chairs, I multiply the number of chairs per row by the number of rows.",
    "6 chairs/row * 20 rows = 120 chairs.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many people can sit in these chairs.",
    "Each chair holds 5 people.",
    "I will multiply the total number of chairs by the number of people each chair can hold.",
    "120 chairs * 5 people/chair = 600 people."
