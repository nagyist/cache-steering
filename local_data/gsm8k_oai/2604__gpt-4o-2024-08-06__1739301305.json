  "query": "Andrew bought 750 stickers. He shared some of his stickers with his friends, Daniel and Fred.  Daniel received 250 stickers, while Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel.   He kept the remaining stickers. How many stickers did Andrew keep?",
  "steps": [
    "Andrew initially bought 750 stickers.",
    "Daniel received 250 stickers.",
    "Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel.",
    "First, calculate the total number of stickers Fred received: Fred = Daniel + 120 = 250 + 120 = 370.",
    "Now, find out how many stickers Andrew gave away in total: stickers given = Daniel + Fred = 250 + 370.",
    "Calculate the total stickers given to Daniel and Fred: total given = 250 + 370 = 620.",
    "Subtract the total stickers given from the initial count to find how many Andrew kept: stickers kept = 750 - 620."
