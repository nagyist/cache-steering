  "query": "Celia is creating a budget for the next 4 weeks. She wants to spend no more than $100 a week on food. For rent for her apartment, she plans to spend $1500. She has $30 set aside for video streaming services for the month. She also has $50 planned for one month of cell phone usage. After she adds up all of her spending for the month she wants to set aside 10% of it to put into savings. How much money is Celia going to put into her savings account?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Celia's total spending on food for the 4 weeks.",
    "Celia spends $100 per week on food. Over 4 weeks, this amounts to 4 weeks * $100/week = $400.",
    "Next, I will add up all of Celia's planned expenses for the month. This includes food, rent, video streaming, and cell phone usage.",
    "Food: $400\nRent: $1500\nVideo streaming: $30\nCell phone: $50",
    "Now, I will sum these expenses: $400 + $1500 + $30 + $50",
    "The total monthly spending is $400 + $1500 + $30 + $50 = $1980.",
    "Celia wants to set aside 10% of her total spending for savings. To find 10%, I need to calculate 10% of $1980.",
    "10% of $1980 is calculated as $1980 * 0.10.",
    "$1980 * 0.10 = $198.",
    "Celia is going to put $198 into her savings account."
