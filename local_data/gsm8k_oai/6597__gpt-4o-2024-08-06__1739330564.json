  "query": "At a recent fishing tournament, Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob. Jacob did not think that he had any chance of winning, but Alex became overconfident and knocked over his bucket of fish, losing 23 fish back to the lake. If Jacob had 8 fish at the beginning, how many more fish does he need to catch to beat Alex by just 1 fish?",
  "steps": [
    "Jacob had 8 fish initially.",
    "Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob, so Alex caught 7 * 8 = 56 fish.",
    "Alex lost 23 fish by knocking over his bucket. Therefore, Alex now has 56 - 23 = 33 fish.",
    "Jacob wants to have 1 more fish than Alex. Alex currently has 33 fish.",
    "To have 1 more fish than Alex, Jacob needs 33 + 1 = 34 fish.",
    "Jacob currently has 8 fish.",
    "To reach 34 fish, Jacob needs to catch 34 - 8 = 26 additional fish."

  "solution": "26"
