  "query": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many players Mona grouped with in total based on the number of groups she joined.",
    "Mona joins 9 groups, and each group has 4 other players. So initially, she would have grouped with 9 groups * 4 players = 36 players.",
    "Next, I need to account for repeated players in the groups. It's mentioned that one group had two players she grouped with before and another group had one repeated player.",
    "The group with two repeated players means Mona met 2 new players there, so she grouped with 4 - 2 = 2 unique players in that group.",
    "The group with one repeated player means she met 3 new players there, so 4 - 1 = 3 unique players in that group.",
    "In the rest of the groups (7 groups), it's assumed there are no repeated players since there is no information indicating otherwise.",
    "For the 7 groups without any repeated players: 7 groups * 4 players = 28 unique players.",
    "Sum the unique players from these calculations: 2 (from the group with two repeats) + 3 (from the group with one repeat) + 28 (from the groups with no repeats) = 33."

  "solution": "33"
