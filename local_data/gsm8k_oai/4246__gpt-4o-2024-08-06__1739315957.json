  "query": "Mabel planted 4 tomato plants. One tomato plant bore 8 tomatoes and another bore 4 more tomatoes than the first. The two remaining plants each bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined. How many tomatoes does Mabel have?",
  "steps": [
    "Mabel planted 4 tomato plants in total.",
    "The first tomato plant bore 8 tomatoes.",
    "The second tomato plant bore 4 more tomatoes than the first.",
    "Since the first plant bore 8 tomatoes, the second plant bore 8 + 4 = 12 tomatoes.",
    "Together, the first two plants bore 8 + 12 = 20 tomatoes.",
    "Each of the remaining two plants bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined.",
    "Three times 20 (the number of tomatoes from the first two plants) is 3 x 20 = 60.",
    "So, each of the remaining two plants bore 60 tomatoes.",
    "The total tomatoes from the two remaining plants is 2 x 60 = 120.",
    "The total number of tomatoes from all plants is 20 (first two plants) + 120 (remaining two plants) = 140."

  "solution": "140"
