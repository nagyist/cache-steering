  "query": "Sam is twice as old as Sue. Kendra is 3 times as old as Sam. If Kendra is currently 18, what will be their total age in 3 years?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem statement provides that Kendra is currently 18 years old.",
    "We know that Kendra's age is 3 times that of Sam's age. Thus, Sam's current age is 18 / 3 = 6 years.",
    "According to the problem, Sam is twice as old as Sue. Thus, Sue's current age is 6 / 2 = 3 years.",
    "I now have the ages: Sam is 6, Sue is 3, and Kendra is 18.",
    "I need to find their ages in 3 years. In 3 years, Sam will be 6 + 3 = 9 years old.",
    "In 3 years, Sue will be 3 + 3 = 6 years old.",
    "In 3 years, Kendra will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.",
    "The total age in 3 years will be the sum of their ages: 9 (Sam) + 6 (Sue) + 21 (Kendra) = 36 years."
