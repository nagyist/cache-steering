  "query": "John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the caffeine content per ounce in the first drink.",
    "The first drink is 12 ounces with 250 grams of caffeine.",
    "To find the caffeine per ounce, I divide 250 grams by 12 ounces.",
    "250 grams \u00f7 12 ounces = 20.8333 grams per ounce.",
    "Now, I'll consider the second drink.",
    "The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce compared to the first drink.",
    "So, I multiply the caffeine per ounce of the first drink by 3.",
    "20.8333 grams per ounce \u00d7 3 = 62.5 grams per ounce.",
    "The second drink is only 2 ounces.",
    "I calculate the total caffeine in the second drink by multiplying the caffeine per ounce by the number of ounces.",
    "62.5 grams per ounce \u00d7 2 ounces = 125 grams.",
    "Next, I find the total caffeine in both drinks combined.",
    "The first drink contains 250 grams of caffeine.",
    "The second drink contains 125 grams of caffeine.",
    "I add the caffeine content of both drinks.",
    "250 grams + 125 grams = 375 grams.",
    "John also takes a caffeine pill with as much caffeine as the 2 drinks combined.",
    "The caffeine pill contains 375 grams of caffeine.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total caffeine consumption by adding the caffeine from both drinks and the caffeine pill.",
    "375 grams (drinks) + 375 grams (pill) = 750 grams."

  "solution": "750"
