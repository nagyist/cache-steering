  "query": "Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. How many birds are on the fence?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of birds on the fence be represented by \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, twice the number of birds is \\( 2x \\).",
    "Ten more than twice the number of birds is 50.",
    "Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\( 2x + 10 = 50 \\).",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides to find \\( 2x \\). This gives \\( 2x = 40 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( x = 20 \\)."
