    "Susan initially earned $600 from babysitting.",
    "She spent half of the $600 on clothes.",
    "Half of $600 is $600 / 2 = $300.",
    "After spending on clothes, she had $600 - $300 = $300 left.",
    "Next, she spent half of the remaining $300 on books.",
    "Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150.",
