  "query": "The ratio of boys to girls at the dance was 3:4. There were 60 girls at the dance. The teachers were 20% of the number of boys. How many people were at the dance?",
  "steps": [
    "The ratio of boys to girls is given as 3:4.",
    "There are 60 girls at the dance.",
    "Since the ratio of boys to girls is 3:4, for every 4 girls, there are 3 boys.",
    "Let's set up a proportion to find the number of boys. If 4 parts correspond to 60 girls, 1 part corresponds to 60 / 4 = 15.",
    "Now, multiply this 1 part by 3 to find the number of boys: 3 * 15 = 45 boys.",
    "Next, it is mentioned that the number of teachers is 20% of the number of boys.",
    "Calculate 20% of 45. 20% of 45 is (20/100) * 45 = 9.",
    "So, there are 9 teachers at the dance.",
    "Now let's add up all the people to find the total number of people at the dance.",
    "The total number of people is the number of boys, girls, and teachers: 45 boys + 60 girls + 9 teachers.",
    "45 + 60 = 105.",
    "105 + 9 = 114."
