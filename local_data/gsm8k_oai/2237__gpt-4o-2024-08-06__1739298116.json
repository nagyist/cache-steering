    "Mary received $100 as a surprise gift from her brother.",
    "She spent a quarter of this amount on a new video game.",
    "To find out how much she spent on the video game, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 \\).",

    "$100 - $25 = $75 remaining after buying the video game.",
    "Next, she spent a fifth of the remaining $75 on swimming goggles.",
    "To find out how much was spent on the swimming goggles, calculate \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 75 \\).",
    "A fifth of $75 is $15.",
    "Subtract the $15 spent on swimming goggles from the $75 she had left after buying the video game.",
    "$75 - $15 = $60 remaining after buying both the video game and the swimming goggles."
