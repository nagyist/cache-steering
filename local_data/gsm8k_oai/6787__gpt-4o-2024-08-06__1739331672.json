  "query": "Koby and Cherie want to light fireworks. Koby has bought 2 boxes of fireworks while Cherie has just 1 box of fireworks. Koby\u2019s boxes each contain 3 sparklers and 5 whistlers. Cherie\u2019s box has 8 sparklers and 9 whistlers. In total, how many fireworks do Koby and Cherie have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will find out how many sparklers Koby has in total. He has 2 boxes, and each box contains 3 sparklers.",
    "Koby's total sparklers = 2 boxes * 3 sparklers/box = 6 sparklers.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of whistlers Koby has. He has 2 boxes, and each box contains 5 whistlers.",
    "Koby's total whistlers = 2 boxes * 5 whistlers/box = 10 whistlers.",
    "Now, I will find out how many sparklers Cherie has. She has 1 box that contains 8 sparklers.",
    "Cherie's total sparklers = 8 sparklers.",
    "Next, I will find out how many whistlers Cherie has. Her box contains 9 whistlers.",
    "Cherie's total whistlers = 9 whistlers.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of sparklers both Koby and Cherie have. This will be Koby's sparklers plus Cherie's sparklers.",
    "Total sparklers = Koby's sparklers + Cherie's sparklers = 6 sparklers + 8 sparklers = 14 sparklers.",
    "Next, I will find out the total number of whistlers both Koby and Cherie have. This will be Koby's whistlers plus Cherie's whistlers.",
    "Total whistlers = Koby's whistlers + Cherie's whistlers = 10 whistlers + 9 whistlers = 19 whistlers.",
    "Finally, I will calculate the total number of fireworks by adding the total number of sparklers and whistlers.",
    "Total fireworks = Total sparklers + Total whistlers = 14 sparklers + 19 whistlers = 33 fireworks."
