  "query": "Jaylen\u2019s dog eats 1 cup of dog food in the morning and 1 cup of dog food in the evening.  If she buys a bag that has 32 cups of dog food, how many days can she feed her dog with it?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how much dog food Jaylen's dog eats in a full day.",
    "The dog eats 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening.",
    "Adding the morning and evening amounts, the total is 1 cup + 1 cup = 2 cups per day.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many days the 32-cup bag will last.",
    "To find the number of days, I divide the total amount of dog food by the amount the dog eats each day.",
    "I calculate 32 cups \u00f7 2 cups per day.",
    "32 \u00f7 2 equals 16.",
    "So, Jaylen can feed her dog for 16 days with the 32-cup bag."
