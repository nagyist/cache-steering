  "query": "Fern buys one pair of high heels for $60 and five pairs of ballet slippers for 2/3rds of the price of the high heels. How much does she pay total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the cost of the high heels, which is given as $60.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of a single pair of ballet slippers. They are priced at 2/3rds of the cost of the high heels.",
    "Calculating 2/3rds of $60: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = 40 \\). Thus, each pair of ballet slippers costs $40.",
    "Fern buys five pairs of ballet slippers, so I need to find the total cost for these slippers.",
    "Multiplying the cost of one pair of ballet slippers by the number of pairs: \\( 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\).",
    "Now, I will add the cost of the high heels to the total cost of the ballet slippers to find the total amount Fern pays.",
    "The total cost is calculated as follows: $60 (high heels) + $200 (ballet slippers) = $260."
