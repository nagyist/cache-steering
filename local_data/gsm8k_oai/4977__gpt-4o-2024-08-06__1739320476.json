  "query": "A desert garden\u2019s sprinkler system runs twice a day during the cool morning and evening hours. It waters the garden with four liters of water in the morning and six liters in the evening. How many days does it take the sprinkler system to use 50 liters of water?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much water is used by the sprinkler system in one day.",
    "The sprinkler uses 4 liters of water in the morning.",
    "The sprinkler uses 6 liters of water in the evening.",
    "To find the total water used in one day, I add the morning and evening usage: 4 liters + 6 liters.",
    "4 liters + 6 liters = 10 liters per day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many days it takes to use 50 liters of water.",
    "Since the system uses 10 liters per day, I divide the total water usage, 50 liters, by the daily usage, 10 liters per day.",
    "50 liters \u00f7 10 liters/day = 5 days."
  ],
  "solution": "5"
