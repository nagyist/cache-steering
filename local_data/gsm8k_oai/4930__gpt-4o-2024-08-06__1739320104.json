  "query": "James decides to cut down some trees.  In the first 2 days, he cuts down 20 trees each day.  For the next 3 days his 2 brothers help him cut down trees.  They cut 20% fewer trees per day than James.  How many total trees were cut down?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many trees James cuts down in the first 2 days.",
    "James cuts down 20 trees each day for 2 days.",
    "I multiply 20 trees per day by 2 days: 20 x 2 = 40 trees.",
    "Next, I consider the next 3 days, during which his 2 brothers help him cut trees.",
    "The problem states that his brothers cut 20% fewer trees than James per day.",
    "First, I calculate how many trees James cuts per day in terms of percentage: 20 trees per day is 100%.",
    "Thus, 20% of 20 is 0.2 x 20 = 4 trees.",
    "James' brothers cut 20 - 4 = 16 trees per day, each.",
    "In addition to James\u2019 20 trees per day, the two brothers cut 16 x 2 = 32 trees per day together.",
    "Therefore, the total trees cut per day when his brothers helped was 20 + 32 = 52 trees.",
    "I need to calculate the trees cut in those 3 days.",
    "I multiply 52 trees per day by 3 days: 52 x 3 = 156 trees.",
    "Now, I add the total trees cut in the first 2 days to the total trees cut in the next 3 days.",
    "40 trees in first 2 days + 156 trees in the next 3 days = 196 trees."
