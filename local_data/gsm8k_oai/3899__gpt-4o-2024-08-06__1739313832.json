  "query": "There are 56 pieces of fruit in a box. One-fourth of the box contains oranges. There are half as many peaches as oranges and five times as many apples as peaches. How many apples are in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many oranges are in the box. Since one-fourth of the fruit are oranges, I calculate 56 divided by 4.",
    "56 divided by 4 equals 14. So, there are 14 oranges in the box.",
    "Next, I find out how many peaches are in the box. There are half as many peaches as oranges.",
    "Half of 14 is 7. So, there are 7 peaches in the box.",
    "Now, I calculate how many apples are in the box. There are five times as many apples as peaches.",
    "Five times 7 is 35. Therefore, there are 35 apples in the box."
  ],
  "solution": "35"
