  "query": "Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of games that Carla won be denoted as \\( C \\).",
    "Since Frankie won half as many games as Carla, the number of games Frankie won is \\( \\frac{C}{2} \\).",
    "The total number of games played by Frankie and Carla is 30.",
    "Therefore, the sum of the games won by both Frankie and Carla is \\( C + \\frac{C}{2} = 30 \\).",
    "I need to solve the equation \\( C + \\frac{C}{2} = 30 \\).",
    "To eliminate the fraction, I\u2019ll multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the denominator.",
    "This results in: \\( 2C + C = 60 \\).",
    "Now, combine like terms: \\( 3C = 60 \\).",
    "To find \\( C \\), I'll divide both sides by 3.",
    "So, \\( C = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\).",
    "Carla won 20 games."
