  "query": "Randy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday \u2013 Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?",
  "steps": [
    "Randy is currently 12 years old.",
    "He wants to become an expert before he turns 20.",
    "The difference in years between 20 and 12 is 8 years.",
    "Randy has 8 years to practice and reach 10,000 hours.",
    "Each year, there are 52 weeks.",
    "Randy plans to take 2 weeks off for vacation each year.",
    "Therefore, he will practice for 52 - 2 = 50 weeks each year.",
    "He practices every weekday, Monday through Friday, so that's 5 days per week.",
    "The total number of practice days per year is 50 weeks \u00d7 5 days/week = 250 days.",
    "Randy needs to complete 10,000 hours of practice.",
    "He plans to distribute these practice hours over 8 years.",
    "The total number of practice days over 8 years is 8 years \u00d7 250 days/year = 2000 days.",
    "To find out how many hours he needs to practice each day, divide the total hours by the total practice days.",
    "10,000 hours \u00f7 2000 days = 5 hours/day."
