  "query": "Troy makes soup.  He buys 4 pounds of beef and 6 pounds of vegetables.  The vegetables cost $2 per pound and the beef is 3 times that price.  How much does everything cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the cost per pound of beef. Vegetables cost $2 per pound, and beef is 3 times that price.",
    "Beef costs 3 * $2 = $6 per pound.",
    "Next, calculate the total cost of the beef. Troy buys 4 pounds of beef.",
    "The total cost of the beef is 4 pounds * $6/pound = $24.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost of the vegetables. Troy buys 6 pounds of vegetables, with each pound costing $2.",
    "The total cost of the vegetables is 6 pounds * $2/pound = $12.",
    "Add the total cost of the beef and the total cost of the vegetables to find out how much everything costs.",
    "The total cost is $24 (beef) + $12 (vegetables) = $36."
