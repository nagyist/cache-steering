  "steps": [
    "Nick is currently 13 years old.",
    "His sister is 6 years older than Nick.",
    "So, his sister is 13 + 6 = 19 years old.",
    "Now, let's find the combined age of Nick and his sister.",
    "Nick's age is 13 and his sister's age is 19.",
    "The combined age of Nick and his sister is 13 + 19 = 32 years.",
    "Their brother's age is half of their combined age.",
    "Therefore, the brother's age is 32 / 2 = 16 years.",
    "We need to know how old their brother would be in 5 years.",
    "Currently, their brother is 16 years old.",
    "In 5 years, their brother would be 16 + 5 = 21 years old."
