  "query": "On Rudolph's car trip across town, he traveled 2 more than 5 miles and encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs.  How many stop signs per mile did Rudolph encounter on his trip across town?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total miles Rudolph traveled. It says he traveled 2 more than 5 miles.",
    "2 more than 5 miles means 5 + 2 miles.",
    "5 + 2 equals 7, so Rudolph traveled 7 miles.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many stop signs he encountered.",
    "He encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs.",
    "3 less than 17 means 17 - 3 stop signs.",
    "17 - 3 equals 14, so Rudolph encountered 14 stop signs.",
    "Now I'll calculate the number of stop signs per mile.",
    "To find the number of stop signs per mile, I need to divide the total number of stop signs by the number of miles traveled.",
    "So, 14 stop signs divided by 7 miles.",
    "14 divided by 7 equals 2."

  "solution": "2"
