  "query": "The ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. If the total number of coins they have is 440, and Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys, how many will she remain with?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will simplify the ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has, which is 10:45.",
    "I can simplify the ratio 10:45 by dividing both terms by 5, the greatest common divisor of 10 and 45.",
    "10 divided by 5 is 2, and 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, the simplified ratio is 2:9.",
    "Next, I will set up the equation based on the simplified ratio to determine how many coins Elsa and Amalie have.",
    "Let 2x represent the number of coins Elsa has, and 9x represent the number of coins Amalie has.",
    "Therefore, 2x + 9x = 440, the total number of coins they have.",
    "Combine the like terms: 2x + 9x equals 11x.",
    "Thus, the equation is 11x = 440.",
    "I will solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 11.",
    "440 divided by 11 equals 40. So, x = 40.",
    "Now that I know x equals 40, I will calculate how many coins Amalie has by multiplying 9 by 40.",
    "9 multiplied by 40 equals 360.",
    "Amalie has 360 coins in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many coins Amalie spends on toys. She spends 3/4 of what she has.",
    "To calculate 3/4 of 360, I multiply 360 by 3/4.",
    "360 divided by 4 equals 90.",
    "90 multiplied by 3 equals 270.",
    "Amalie spends 270 coins on toys.",
    "To find out how many coins Amalie remains with, I subtract the number of coins she spends from the total number of coins she has.",
    "360 minus 270 equals 90."

  "solution": "90"
