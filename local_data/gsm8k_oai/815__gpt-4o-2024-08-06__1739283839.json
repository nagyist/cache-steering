  "query": "Bingley has 5 bracelets. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. Then Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. How many bracelets does Bingley have remaining?",
  "steps": [
    "Bingley initially has 5 bracelets.",
    "Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets.",
    "A fourth of 16 is calculated as 16 / 4, which equals 4.",
    "Bingley receives 4 bracelets from Kelly.",
    "Add these 4 bracelets to Bingley's initial 5 bracelets.",
    "Bingley now has 5 + 4 = 9 bracelets.",
    "Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister.",
    "A third of 9 is calculated as 9 / 3, which equals 3.",
