  "query": "Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?",
  "steps": [
    "Georgia coughs 5 times a minute.",
    "Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia.",
    "So, Robert coughs 5 times 2, which is 10 times a minute.",
    "They both cough for 20 minutes.",
    "Georgia coughs 5 times a minute for 20 minutes. To find the total number of times Georgia coughs, multiply 5 by 20.",
    "5 times 20 equals 100. So, Georgia coughs 100 times in 20 minutes.",
    "Robert coughs 10 times a minute for 20 minutes. To find the total number of times Robert coughs, multiply 10 by 20.",
    "10 times 20 equals 200. So, Robert coughs 200 times in 20 minutes.",
    "To find out how many times they coughed together, add the number of times Georgia and Robert coughed.",
    "100 plus 200 equals 300."
