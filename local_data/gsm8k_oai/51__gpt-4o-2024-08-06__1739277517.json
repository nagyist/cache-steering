  "query": "Ann is cutting fabric to make curtains. She cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room, and a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much fabric Ann used for the living room curtains.",
    "The living room fabric is a rectangle measuring 4 feet by 6 feet.",
    "To find the area of the living room fabric, multiply the length by the width: 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the amount of fabric used for the bedroom curtains.",
    "The bedroom fabric is a rectangle measuring 2 feet by 4 feet.",
    "To find the area of the bedroom fabric, multiply the length by the width: 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet.",
    "Now, I have to determine the total amount of fabric used for both the living room and bedroom curtains.",
    "Add the area of the living room fabric and the bedroom fabric together: 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total amount of fabric on the bolt.",
    "The fabric bolt is 16 feet by 12 feet.",
    "To find the area of the entire bolt, multiply the length by the width: 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet.",
    "To find out how much fabric is left, subtract the total amount used from the total amount on the bolt.",
    "Subtract the used fabric from the total fabric: 192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet."
