  "query": "Sasha made 30 chocolate muffins for her school bake sale fundraiser. Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha, and Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins. If one muffin sold for $4, how much money did Sasha, Melissa, and Tiffany contribute to the fundraiser?",
  "steps": [
    "Sasha made 30 chocolate muffins.",
    "Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha.",
    "To find out how many muffins Melissa made, calculate 4 times 30.",
    "4 times 30 is 120. So, Melissa made 120 muffins.",
    "Add the number of muffins Sasha and Melissa made: 30 + 120.",
    "30 + 120 equals 150. Sasha and Melissa made a total of 150 muffins.",
    "Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins.",
    "Calculate half of 150, which is 150 divided by 2.",
    "150 divided by 2 is 75. So, Tiffany made 75 muffins.",
    "Add the number of muffins made by Sasha, Melissa, and Tiffany: 30 + 120 + 75.",
    "30 + 120 + 75 equals 225. The total number of muffins made is 225.",
    "Each muffin was sold for $4.",
    "To find out the total amount of money contributed to the fundraiser, multiply the total number of muffins by the price per muffin.",
    "Multiply 225 muffins by $4 per muffin.",
    "225 multiplied by 4 equals 900."

  "solution": "900"
