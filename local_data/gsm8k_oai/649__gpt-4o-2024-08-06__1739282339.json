  "query": "Some students want to buy pencils from a stationery shop. The price of one pencil is 20 cents. Tolu wants 3 pencils, Robert wants 5 pencils and Melissa wants 2 pencils. How much (in dollars) will the students spend altogether at the stationery shop?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Tolu will spend on pencils.",
    "Tolu wants 3 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents.",
    "To calculate the total cost for Tolu, I multiply 3 pencils by 20 cents/pencil.",
    "3 pencils * 20 cents/pencil = 60 cents.",
    "Next, I calculate how much Robert will spend.",
    "Robert wants 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents.",
    "To find Robert's total, I multiply 5 pencils by 20 cents/pencil.",
    "5 pencils * 20 cents/pencil = 100 cents.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much Melissa will spend.",
    "Melissa wants 2 pencils, and each pencil costs 20 cents.",
    "To calculate Melissa's total, I multiply 2 pencils by 20 cents/pencil.",
    "2 pencils * 20 cents/pencil = 40 cents.",
    "Now that I have the individual costs, I combine them to find the total amount spent by all the students.",
    "I add Tolu's cost (60 cents), Robert's cost (100 cents), and Melissa's cost (40 cents).",
    "60 cents + 100 cents + 40 cents = 200 cents.",
    "Finally, I need to convert the total cost from cents to dollars.",
    "There are 100 cents in a dollar.",
    "To convert cents to dollars, I divide 200 cents by 100.",
    "200 cents \u00f7 100 = 2 dollars."
