  "query": "In the class of 24 students, half are doing silent reading, and a third are playing board games. The rest are catching up on homework. How many students are catching up on homework?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students are doing silent reading.",
    "Half of the class is doing silent reading. There are 24 students total.",
    "Half of 24 is calculated by 24 / 2 = 12.",
    "So, 12 students are doing silent reading.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students are playing board games.",
    "A third of the class is playing board games.",
    "A third of 24 is calculated by 24 / 3 = 8.",
    "So, 8 students are playing board games.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many students are catching up on homework.",
    "I will sum the number of students doing silent reading and playing board games: 12 + 8 = 20.",
    "Therefore, 20 students are either doing silent reading or playing board games.",
    "Subtract the number of students doing silent reading and playing board games from the total number of students to find who are catching up on homework.",
    "24 - 20 = 4 students are catching up on homework."
