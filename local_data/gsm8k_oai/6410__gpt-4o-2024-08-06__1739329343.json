  "query": "Moore's family compared mobile phone plans to get the best deal. At T-Mobile, the family plan costs $50 per month for the first two lines and $16 for each additional line. At M-Mobile, the family plan costs $45 for the first two lines and $14 for each additional line. Moore's family needs to purchase 5 cell phone lines. How much cheaper is the M-Mobile than T-Mobile?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for T-Mobile for 5 lines.",
    "T-Mobile charges $50 for the first two lines.",
    "For the additional lines, T-Mobile charges $16 per line.",
    "Since the family needs 5 lines total, there are 3 additional lines.",
    "The cost of the additional 3 lines on T-Mobile is 3 * $16 = $48.",
    "Therefore, the total cost for T-Mobile is $50 (first two lines) + $48 (additional lines) = $98.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for M-Mobile for 5 lines.",
    "M-Mobile charges $45 for the first two lines.",
    "For the additional lines, M-Mobile charges $14 per line.",
    "The cost of the additional 3 lines on M-Mobile is 3 * $14 = $42.",
    "Therefore, the total cost for M-Mobile is $45 (first two lines) + $42 (additional lines) = $87.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much cheaper M-Mobile is than T-Mobile.",
    "The difference in cost is $98 (T-Mobile) - $87 (M-Mobile) = $11."
