  "query": "Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari. Sue made half as many as Kendra. Mari made 8 buttons. How many did Sue make?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many buttons Sue made.",
    "First, I need to determine how many buttons Kendra made.",
    "I am told that Mari made 8 buttons.",
    "Kendra made 4 more than five times as many as Mari.",
    "Five times the amount Mari made is 5 * 8 = 40.",
    "Kendra made 4 more than that, so Kendra made 40 + 4 = 44 buttons.",
    "Sue made half as many buttons as Kendra.",
    "Half of Kendra's buttons is 44 / 2 = 22."

  "solution": "22"
