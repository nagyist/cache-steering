  "query": "Marta was about to start the school year and needed to buy the necessary textbooks. She managed to buy five on sale, for $10 each. She had to order two textbooks online, which cost her a total of $40, and three she bought directly from the bookstore for a total of three times the cost of the online ordered books. How much in total did Martha spend on textbooks?",
  "steps": [
    "Marta bought five textbooks on sale for $10 each.",
    "To find the total cost for the on-sale textbooks, multiply the number of textbooks by the price per book: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).",
    "Marta ordered two textbooks online for a total cost of $40.",
    "She bought three textbooks directly from the bookstore.",
    "The total cost of the bookstore-bought textbooks is three times the cost of the online ordered books, so: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).",
    "Now, add the costs from all sources to find the total amount spent.",
    "The total is the sum of the on-sale textbooks, online textbooks, and bookstore textbooks: \\(50 + 40 + 120 = 210\\)."

  "solution": "210"
