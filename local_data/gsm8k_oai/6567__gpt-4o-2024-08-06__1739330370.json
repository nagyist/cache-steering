  "query": "John buys 5 notebooks that have 40 pages each.  He uses 4 pages per day.  How many days do the notebooks last?",
  "steps": [
    "John buys 5 notebooks.",
    "Each notebook has 40 pages.",
    "To find the total number of pages, I multiply the number of notebooks by the number of pages per notebook: 5 notebooks * 40 pages/notebook.",
    "5 * 40 = 200.",
    "John has a total of 200 pages.",
    "John uses 4 pages per day.",
    "To find how many days the notebooks will last, I divide the total number of pages by the number of pages John uses per day: 200 pages / 4 pages/day.",
    "200 / 4 = 50.",
    "So, the notebooks will last for 50 days."
