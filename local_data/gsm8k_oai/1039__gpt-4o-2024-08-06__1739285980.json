  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of apartments that have at least one resident.",
    "There are 120 apartments in total. 85% of them have at least one resident.",
    "To find 85% of 120, I calculate 0.85 * 120.",
    "0.85 * 120 = 102 apartments have at least one resident.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of apartments that have at least two residents.",
    "I am told that 60% of the apartments have at least two residents.",
    "To find 60% of 120, I calculate 0.60 * 120.",
    "0.60 * 120 = 72 apartments have at least two residents.",
    "To find the number of apartments with only one resident, I subtract the number of apartments with at least two residents from the number of apartments with at least one resident.",
    "102 apartments have at least one resident, and 72 have at least two residents.",
    "102 - 72 = 30 apartments have only one resident."
