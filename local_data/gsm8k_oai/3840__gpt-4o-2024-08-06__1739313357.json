  "query": "Fred has 38 red marbles, half as many green ones, and the rest are dark blue. If he has 63 marbles, how many of them are dark blue?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Fred has 38 red marbles.",
    "I'm also told that he has half as many green marbles as red ones.",
    "To find the number of green marbles, I divide the number of red marbles by 2. So, 38 divided by 2 is 19.",
    "Fred has 19 green marbles.",
    "To find out how many dark blue marbles he has, I need to add the number of red and green marbles.",
    "38 red marbles plus 19 green marbles equals 57 marbles.",
    "Fred has 63 marbles in total.",
    "To find the number of dark blue marbles, I need to subtract the sum of red and green marbles from the total number of marbles.",
    "63 minus 57 equals 6."
