  "query": "An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?",
  "steps": [
    "In the first year, the apple tree produces 40 apples.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of apples produced in the second year. It is 8 more than double the first year's production.",
    "Double the first year's production is 40 \u00d7 2 = 80 apples.",
    "Adding 8 gives the second year's production: 80 + 8 = 88 apples.",
    "For the third year's production, it decreased by one fourth compared to the second year due to an insect infestation.",
    "One fourth of the second year's production is 88 \u00d7 0.25 = 22 apples.",
    "Subtracting the decrease from the second year's production gives the third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples.",
    "Now, I add the production of all three years to find the total number of apples.",
    "The total production is 40 + 88 + 66 apples.",
    "Calculating the sum: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194."
