  "query": "The Zargon Destroyer spacecraft can travel at 2 billion miles per hour in normal space, but when moving through a black hole they travel three times faster.  If the Zargon Destroyer is making a voyage that travels seven hours in normal space and two hours through a black hole, how many billions of miles would they have traveled?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the distance traveled in normal space.",
    "The speed of the Zargon Destroyer in normal space is 2 billion miles per hour.",
    "The time traveled in normal space is 7 hours.",
    "Distance in normal space = speed \u00d7 time = 2 billion miles/hour \u00d7 7 hours.",
    "Distance in normal space = 14 billion miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the distance traveled through a black hole.",
    "The speed of the Zargon Destroyer through a black hole is three times faster than in normal space.",
    "Speed through a black hole = 2 billion miles/hour \u00d7 3 = 6 billion miles/hour.",
    "The time traveled through the black hole is 2 hours.",
    "Distance in a black hole = speed \u00d7 time = 6 billion miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours.",
    "Distance in a black hole = 12 billion miles.",
    "Now, I need to find the total distance traveled.",
    "Total distance = Distance in normal space + Distance in a black hole = 14 billion miles + 12 billion miles.",
    "Total distance = 26 billion miles."

  "solution": "26"
