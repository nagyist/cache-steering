  "query": "The green piece of yarn is 156 cm long. The red yarn is 8 cm more than three times the length of the green yarn. What is the number of centimeters in the total length for the 2 pieces of yarn?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the length of the red yarn first.",
    "The red yarn is 8 cm more than three times the length of the green yarn.",
    "First, I will calculate three times the length of the green yarn.",
    "The length of the green yarn is 156 cm.",
    "Three times the length of the green yarn is 3 * 156 cm.",
    "Calculating that gives me 3 * 156 = 468 cm.",
    "Now, I add 8 cm to this value to get the length of the red yarn.",
    "The length of the red yarn is 468 cm + 8 cm.",
    "This gives me 468 + 8 = 476 cm for the red yarn.",
    "Now, I will find the total length of both pieces of yarn.",
    "The total length is the sum of the lengths of the green and red yarns.",
    "The green yarn is 156 cm and the red yarn is 476 cm.",
    "Adding these together gives 156 cm + 476 cm.",
    "Calculating that gives 156 + 476 = 632 cm."
