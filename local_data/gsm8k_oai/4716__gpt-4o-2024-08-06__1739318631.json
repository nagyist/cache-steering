  "query": "There are 3 bicycles, 4 tricycles and 7 unicycles in the garage at Zoe's house. Each bicycle has 2 wheels, each tricycle has 3 wheels and each unicycle has 1 wheel. How many wheels are there in all?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to first determine how many wheels there are from the bicycles.",
    "There are 3 bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "To find the total number of wheels from the bicycles, I need to multiply the number of bicycles by the number of wheels per bicycle.",
    "3 bicycles * 2 wheels per bicycle = 6 wheels.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of wheels from the tricycles.",
    "There are 4 tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 wheels.",
    "To find the total number of wheels from the tricycles, I will multiply the number of tricycles by the number of wheels per tricycle.",
    "4 tricycles * 3 wheels per tricycle = 12 wheels.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total number of wheels from the unicycles.",
    "There are 7 unicycles, and each unicycle has 1 wheel.",
    "To find the total number of wheels from the unicycles, I will multiply the number of unicycles by the number of wheels per unicycle.",
    "7 unicycles * 1 wheel per unicycle = 7 wheels.",
    "Finally, I will add all the wheels together to find the total number of wheels in the garage.",
    "6 wheels (bicycles) + 12 wheels (tricycles) + 7 wheels (unicycles) = 25 wheels."
