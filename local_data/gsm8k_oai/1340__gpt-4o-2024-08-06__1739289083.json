  "query": "William is a jockey. He can ride his horse for 6 hours a day. Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time twice.  On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the conditions given in the problem.",
    "William can ride his horse for a maximum of 6 hours a day.",
    "He used the maximum riding time on two days.",
    "On two days, he rode for only 1.5 hours each day.",
    "On two other days, he rode for half the maximum time.",
    "I calculate the total hours for the days he used the maximum riding time. 6 hours per day for 2 days would be 6 * 2.",
    "6 * 2 = 12 hours for the maximum riding days.",
    "Next, I calculate the total hours for the two days he rode 1.5 hours each.",
    "1.5 hours per day for 2 days would be 1.5 * 2.",
    "1.5 * 2 = 3 hours for the two days he rode 1.5 hours each day.",
    "Then, I calculate the total hours for the two days he rode half the maximum time. Half of 6 hours is 3 hours.",
    "3 hours per day for 2 days would be 3 * 2.",
    "3 * 2 = 6 hours for the two days he rode half the maximum time each day.",
    "Now, I sum up all the hours: 12 hours (maximum days) + 3 hours (1.5-hour days) + 6 hours (half-time days).",
    "12 + 3 + 6 = 21 hours total riding time."

  "solution": "21"
