  "query": "Johnny is a guitar player and he has three colors of guitar picks: red, blue, and yellow. Half of his picks are red, one-third of the picks are blue, and the rest are yellow.  If he has 12 blue picks, what is the total number of yellow picks in his collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's identify what we know: Johnny has red, blue, and yellow guitar picks.",
    "The problem states that half of the picks are red.",
    "One-third of the picks are blue, and there are 12 blue picks.",
    "We can use the information about the blue picks to find the total number of picks.",
    "Since one-third of the picks are blue, and there are 12 blue picks, the total number of picks can be calculated by dividing 12 by one-third.",
    "Calculating: Total number of picks = 12 / (1/3) = 12 * 3 = 36 picks.",
    "Now, we know the total number of picks is 36.",
    "Half of the picks are red, so the number of red picks is 36 / 2 = 18 picks.",
    "One-third of the picks are blue, already knowing this is 12 picks.",
    "The rest of the picks are yellow.",
    "To find the yellow picks, subtract the red and blue picks from the total.",
    "Number of yellow picks = Total picks - Red picks - Blue picks = 36 - 18 - 12.",
    "Calculating: Number of yellow picks = 36 - 18 - 12 = 6."
