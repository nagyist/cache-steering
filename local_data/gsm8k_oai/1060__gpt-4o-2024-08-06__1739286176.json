  "query": "Barbie enjoys buying jewelry. One day, she bought 12 pairs of earrings, and gave half of them to Alissa, making Alissa's total number of collections to be triple the number of earrings she was given. How many earrings does Alissa have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Barbie bought 12 pairs of earrings.",
    "A pair contains 2 earrings, so I need to calculate the total number of earrings Barbie bought.",
    "12 pairs of earrings mean 12 \u00d7 2 = 24 earrings in total.",
    "Barbie gave half of the earrings to Alissa.",
    "Half of 24 earrings is 24 \u00f7 2 = 12 earrings.",
    "Alissa was given 12 earrings.",
    "According to the problem, the number of earrings Alissa has in her entire collection is triple the number of earrings she was given.",
    "If Alissa was given 12 earrings, then her total collection is 12 \u00d7 3.",
    "Now I calculate 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 earrings."

  "solution": "36"
