  "query": "Samara and three of her friends heard alligators spotted on the local river and decided to join a search organized by the wildlife service to capture the animals. After searching the whole day, Samara had seen 20 alligators while her friends had seen an average of 10 alligators each. Calculate the total number of alligators Samara and her friends saw.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many friends Samara has. The question states \"Samara and three of her friends,\" which means Samara has 3 friends.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total number of alligators her friends have seen. We are told they each saw an average of 10 alligators.",
    "If each of her 3 friends saw 10 alligators, the total number of alligators seen by her friends is 3 multiplied by 10.",
    "3 multiplied by 10 equals 30, so Samara's friends saw a total of 30 alligators.",
    "Now let's add the number of alligators Samara saw. She saw 20 alligators.",
    "To find the total number of alligators seen by Samara and her friends, we need to add the number Samara saw to the total seen by her friends.",
    "20 (Samara's alligators) plus 30 (her friends' alligators) equals 50."

  "solution": "50"
