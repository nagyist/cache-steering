  "query": "Hani said she would do 3 more situps per minute than Diana would. Diana then did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute. Calculate the total number of situps they did together.",
  "steps": [
    "Diana did situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute.",
    "Diana did a total of 40 situps.",
    "To find out how long it took her, I calculate the number of minutes she was exercising by dividing the total situps by her rate: 40 situps \u00f7 4 situps/minute = 10 minutes.",
    "Hani does situps at a rate of 3 more situps per minute than Diana, which means Hani's rate is 4 situps/minute + 3 situps/minute = 7 situps/minute.",
    "Hani exercises for the same duration as Diana, which is 10 minutes.",
    "To find the total situps Hani did, I multiply her rate by the time: 7 situps/minute \u00d7 10 minutes = 70 situps.",
    "Now I find the total number of situps done together, by adding the situps done by Diana and Hani: 40 situps + 70 situps = 110 situps."
