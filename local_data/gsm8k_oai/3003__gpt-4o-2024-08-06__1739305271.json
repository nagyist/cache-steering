  "query": "In mid-May, the depth of a river in Moreland is measured. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. If the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, how many feet deep was the river in mid-May?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the depth of the river in mid-May as \\( x \\) feet.",
    "By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So the depth in mid-June is \\( x + 10 \\) feet.",
    "By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than in mid-June.",
    "The depth of the river in mid-July is given as 45 feet.",
    "We know that in mid-July the depth is three times the mid-June depth. Therefore, \\( 3(x + 10) = 45 \\).",
    "Let's solve the equation \\( 3(x + 10) = 45 \\).",
    "First, divide both sides by 3: \\( x + 10 = 15 \\).",
    "Now, subtract 10 from both sides to find \\( x \\): \\( x = 5 \\)."
