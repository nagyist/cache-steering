  "query": "Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. If she had 60 pens and gave eight pens and 6 pencils to each of her seven friends and kept the rest for herself, how many pens and pencils did she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Catherine originally had an equal number of pencils and pens. She had 60 pens, which means she also had 60 pencils.",
    "Catherine gave eight pens to each of her seven friends. Let's calculate the total number of pens she gave away: \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\) pens.",
    "Catherine also gave six pencils to each of her seven friends. Let's calculate the total number of pencils she gave away: \\( 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\) pencils.",
    "Now, I will determine how many pens Catherine had left. She started with 60 pens and gave away 56. So, the number of pens left is \\( 60 - 56 = 4 \\) pens.",
    "Next, I will determine how many pencils Catherine had left. She started with 60 pencils and gave away 42. So, the number of pencils left is \\( 60 - 42 = 18 \\) pencils.",
    "Finally, I'll add the remaining pens and pencils to get the total number of writing instruments she had left: \\( 4 + 18 = 22 \\)."

  "solution": "22"
