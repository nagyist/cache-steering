  "query": "The bakery made 95 muffins. They will be packed in boxes with 5 muffins in each box. If there are only 10 available boxes, how many boxes do they still need to pack all the muffins?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many muffins would be packed into 10 boxes.",
    "Since each box contains 5 muffins, I multiply the number of boxes (10) by the number of muffins per box (5).",
    "10 boxes * 5 muffins per box = 50 muffins.",
    "Now I know that 50 muffins can be packed using the 10 available boxes.",
    "I need to find out how many muffins are left unpacked.",
    "I subtract the number of packed muffins (50) from the total number of muffins (95).",
    "95 muffins - 50 muffins = 45 muffins.",
    "There are 45 muffins left to pack.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many more boxes are required to pack the remaining 45 muffins.",
    "I divide the number of remaining muffins (45) by the number of muffins each box can hold (5).",
    "45 muffins \u00f7 5 muffins per box = 9 boxes.",
    "The bakery needs 9 more boxes to pack all the remaining muffins."
