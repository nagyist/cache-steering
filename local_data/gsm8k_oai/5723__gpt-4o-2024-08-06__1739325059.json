  "query": "There are 160 tissues inside a tissue box.   If Tucker bought 3 boxes, and used 210 tissues while he was sick with the flu, how many tissues would he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of tissues Tucker bought.",
    "Tucker bought 3 boxes and each box has 160 tissues.",
    "I will multiply the number of boxes (3) by the number of tissues per box (160).",
    "3 boxes * 160 tissues/box equals 480 tissues in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tissues Tucker used.",
    "Tucker used 210 tissues.",
    "To find out how many tissues Tucker has left, I will subtract the number of tissues used (210) from the total number of tissues he bought (480).",
    "480 tissues - 210 tissues equals 270 tissues."
