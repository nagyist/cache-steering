  "query": "Hayden eats 1 oz of mixed nuts as an evening snack.  He buys the bulk bag of mixed nuts that cost $25.00 a bag and holds 40 oz of mixed nuts.  There is currently a $5.00 coupon for this item.  How much will each serving of nuts cost, in cents, after the coupon is applied?",
  "steps": [
    "Hayden buys a 40 oz bag of mixed nuts for $25.00.",
    "There is a $5.00 coupon available for the bag.",
    "Subtract the $5.00 coupon from the original price: $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00.",
    "The cost after applying the coupon is $20.00 for the 40 oz bag.",
    "To find the cost per ounce, divide the total cost by the total ounces: $20.00 / 40 oz = $0.50 per ounce.",
    "Convert $0.50 to cents: $0.50 = 50 cents."
