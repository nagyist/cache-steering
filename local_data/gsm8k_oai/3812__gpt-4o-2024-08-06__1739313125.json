  "query": "Don throws 3 darts.  One is a bullseye worth 50 points.  One completely missed the target, so received no points. The third was worth half the points of the bullseye.  What is the final score from these 3 throws?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by calculating the points from each individual dart throw.",
    "The bullseye is worth 50 points. So, the first dart scores 50 points.",
    "The second dart completely missed the target, scoring 0 points.",
    "The third dart scored half the points of the bullseye. Half of 50 is 25 points.",
    "Now, add up the points from all three darts: 50 (first dart) + 0 (second dart) + 25 (third dart).",
    "Calculate the total score: 50 + 0 + 25 = 75."
