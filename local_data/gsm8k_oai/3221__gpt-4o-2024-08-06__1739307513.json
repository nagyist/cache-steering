  "query": "Kay has 14 siblings.  Kay is 32 years old.  The youngest sibling is 5 less than half Kay's age.  The oldest sibling is four times as old as the youngest sibling.  How old is the oldest sibling?",
  "steps": [
    "Kay is 32 years old. This will help us calculate the youngest sibling's age.",
    "Since the youngest sibling is 5 years less than half of Kay's age, I need to calculate half of Kay's age first.",
    "Half of Kay's age is 32 / 2, which equals 16.",
    "The age of the youngest sibling is 5 less than this, so I subtract 5 from 16.",
    "The youngest sibling is 16 - 5 = 11 years old.",
    "Now I need to find the age of the oldest sibling, who is four times as old as the youngest sibling.",
    "I multiply the age of the youngest sibling (11) by 4 to find the age of the oldest sibling.",
    "11 multiplied by 4 equals 44."
