  "query": "James can do a farmer's walk with 300 pounds per hand for 20 meters.  He can lift 30% more if he only goes 10 meters.  In addition, lifting straps give him another 20%.  How much can he move with lifting straps for 10 meters if he increases his 20-meter distance without straps by 50 pounds and everything else increases in proportion?",
  "steps": [
    "James can carry 300 pounds per hand for 20 meters without straps.",
    "Carrying 30% more for a shorter distance of 10 meters means he can increase each 300 pounds by 30%.",
    "30% of 300 pounds is 90 pounds.",
    "Therefore, for 10 meters, he can carry 300 + 90 = 390 pounds per hand.",
    "Now, adding lifting straps allows for an additional increase of 20%.",
    "20% of 390 pounds is 78 pounds.",
    "Therefore, with lifting straps for 10 meters, he can carry 390 + 78 = 468 pounds per hand.",
    "He increases his 20-meter distance weight without straps by 50 pounds. Thus, he carries 300 + 50 = 350 pounds per hand.",
    "If everything increases proportionally, we need to account for this increase.",
    "For 10 meters, we originally calculated 390 pounds per hand without considering the initial 50 pounds increase.",
    "The initial increase was 50 pounds. Hence, the originally calculated 10-meter weight (390) should have the same proportional increase applied.",
    "The proportional increase is calculated based on the change from 300 to 350 pounds.",
    "350 / 300 = 1.1667, implying an increase factor of 1.1667.",
    "The increase from 390 per hand should now be 390 * 1.1667 = 455.",
    "With lifting straps giving 20% more of the increased weight, compute 20% of 455 pounds.",
    "20% of 455 is 91 pounds.",
    "This gives a total of 455 + 91 = 546 pounds with the straps for 10 meters."
