  "query": "Brandon has been fired from half the businesses in town and has quit from a third of them. If there are 72 business in town, how many businesses can he still apply to?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many businesses Brandon has been fired from. There are a total of 72 businesses in town.",
    "Brandon has been fired from half of the businesses.",
    "Calculate half of 72 by dividing 72 by 2.",
    "72 divided by 2 equals 36.",
    "So, Brandon has been fired from 36 businesses.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many businesses Brandon has quit from.",
    "Brandon has quit from a third of the businesses.",
    "Calculate one third of 72 by dividing 72 by 3.",
    "72 divided by 3 equals 24.",
    "So, Brandon has quit from 24 businesses.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the total number of businesses Brandon cannot apply to, which are those he has been fired from or quit.",
    "Add the number of businesses he has been fired from to the number he has quit from: 36 plus 24.",
    "36 plus 24 equals 60.",
    "So, there are 60 businesses that Brandon cannot apply to.",
    "To find out how many businesses Brandon can still apply to, I subtract the number of businesses he cannot apply to from the total.",
    "Subtract 60 from 72.",
    "72 minus 60 equals 12.",
    "Thus, Brandon can still apply to 12 businesses."
