  "query": "There are 50 staplers in the stapler.  Stacie staples 3 dozen reports on her desk.  How many staplers are left in the stapler?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out what is meant by \"3 dozen reports.\" A dozen refers to 12 items.",
    "So, 3 dozen reports is equal to 3 x 12.",
    "3 x 12 equals 36. So Stacie staples 36 reports.",
    "Initially, there are 50 staplers in the stapler.",
    "I need to subtract the number of reports Stacie staples from the initial amount of staplers.",
    "50 staplers - 36 staplers = 14 staplers."

  "solution": "14"
