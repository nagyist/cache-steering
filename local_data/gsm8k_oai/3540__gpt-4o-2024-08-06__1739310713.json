  "query": "Baseball season opened up with the Chicago Cubs at home at Wrigley Field. They scored 2 home runs in the third inning, 1 home run in the fifth inning and 2 more home runs in the eighth inning. Their opponents, the Cardinals, scored 1 home run in the second inning and 1 home run in the fifth inning. How many more home runs did the Chicago Cubs score than the Cardinals in the game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs.",
    "The Cubs scored 2 home runs in the third inning.",
    "The Cubs scored 1 home run in the fifth inning.",
    "The Cubs scored 2 more home runs in the eighth inning.",
    "Adding those together, the Cubs scored 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 home runs in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of home runs scored by the Cardinals.",
    "The Cardinals scored 1 home run in the second inning.",
    "The Cardinals scored 1 more home run in the fifth inning.",
    "Adding those together, the Cardinals scored 1 + 1 = 2 home runs in total.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many more home runs the Cubs scored compared to the Cardinals.",
    "I subtract the total home runs scored by the Cardinals from the total home runs scored by the Cubs: 5 - 2 = 3."
