  "query": "Ephraim has two machines that make necklaces for his store. On Sunday the first machine made 45 necklaces. The second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine. How many necklaces were made in total on Sunday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many necklaces the second machine made.",
    "I know that the second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine.",
    "The first machine made 45 necklaces.",
    "To find out how many necklaces the second machine made, I need to multiply 45 by 2.4.",
    "Now, I'll calculate: 45 * 2.4.",
    "First, calculate 45 * 2 to get 90.",
    "Next, calculate 45 * 0.4, which is the same as 45 * (4/10) = 45 * 4 / 10 = 180 / 10 = 18.",
    "Now add the two results: 90 + 18 = 108.",
    "The second machine made 108 necklaces.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of necklaces made by both machines.",
    "Add the number of necklaces made by the first machine to the number made by the second machine.",
    "That's 45 (first machine) + 108 (second machine) = 153.",
    "So, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is 153."
