  "query": "Jackson's mother made little pizza rolls for Jackson's birthday party.  Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls and his friend Jerome ate twice that amount.  Tyler at one and half times more than Jerome.  How many more pizza rolls did Tyler eat than Jackson?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many pizza rolls Jerome ate. Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls, and Jerome ate twice as many.",
    "Since Jerome ate twice as many as Jackson, I calculate: 10 rolls * 2 = 20 rolls.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many pizza rolls Tyler ate. He ate one and a half times more than Jerome.",
    "One and a half times more means 1.5 times the amount that Jerome ate. So, I calculate: 20 rolls * 1.5 = 30 rolls.",
    "The next step is to determine how many more pizza rolls Tyler ate than Jackson.",
    "To find the difference, I subtract the amount Jackson ate from the amount Tyler ate: 30 rolls - 10 rolls = 20 rolls."

  "solution": "20"
