  "steps": [
    "Jack orders 3 sandwiches.",
    "Each sandwich costs $5.",
    "To find the total cost of the sandwiches, I multiply the number of sandwiches by the cost per sandwich: 3 sandwiches * $5/sandwich.",
    "3 * 5 = 15.",
    "The total cost of the sandwiches is $15.",
    "Jack pays with a $20 bill.",
    "To find out how much change he gets, I subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $20 - $15.",
    "20 - 15 = 5.",
    "Jack gets $5 in change."
