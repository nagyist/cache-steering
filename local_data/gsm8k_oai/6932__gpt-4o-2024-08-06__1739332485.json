  "query": "Diana gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. Her dad decided to raise her reward by 20%. Diana read for 12 hours this week. How many more minutes of video game time will she get as a result of her raise?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much video game time Diana initially earned from reading for 12 hours.",
    "Diana earns 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads.",
    "For 12 hours of reading, she earns 12 * 30 minutes = 360 minutes of video game time.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the increase in her reward by 20%.",
    "20% of her initial 360 minutes of video game time is calculated as 0.20 * 360 minutes.",
    "0.20 * 360 minutes = 72 minutes.",
    "Diana will now earn 72 more minutes of video game time due to the raise."

  "solution": "72"
