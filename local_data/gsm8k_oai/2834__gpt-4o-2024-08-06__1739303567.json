  "query": "The number of math problems that Marvin practiced today is three times as many as the number of problems he solved yesterday. His friend, Arvin, has practiced twice as many math problems on each day. How many math problems have they practiced altogether if Marvin solved 40 math problems yesterday?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many math problems Marvin practiced today.",
    "I know Marvin solved 40 math problems yesterday.",
    "Since Marvin practiced three times as many problems today, I multiply 40 by 3.",
    "40 times 3 equals 120.",
    "Marvin practiced 120 math problems today.",
    "Next, let's find out how many problems Arvin practiced.",
    "Arvin practiced twice as many math problems as Marvin on each day.",
    "Arvin practiced two times 40 math problems yesterday.",
    "2 times 40 equals 80.",
    "Arvin practiced 80 math problems yesterday.",
    "Arvin also practiced two times 120 math problems today.",
    "2 times 120 equals 240.",
    "Arvin practiced 240 math problems today.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of problems Marvin and Arvin practiced altogether.",
    "I add Marvin's problems: 40 (yesterday) + 120 (today) = 160.",
    "Marvin practiced a total of 160 math problems.",
    "I add Arvin's problems: 80 (yesterday) + 240 (today) = 320.",
    "Arvin practiced a total of 320 math problems.",
    "Now, I add Marvin's and Arvin's total problems together: 160 + 320.",
    "160 plus 320 equals 480."
