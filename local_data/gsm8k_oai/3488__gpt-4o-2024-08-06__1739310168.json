  "query": "Evan owns 40 fewer books than the number he had 2 years ago. Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now in five years. If Evan had 200 books two years ago, calculate the total number of books he will have in five years.",
  "steps": [
    "Two years ago, Evan had 200 books.",
    "Evan owns 40 fewer books now than he had two years ago.",
    "I calculate Evan's current number of books as follows: 200 books (two years ago) - 40 books = 160 books.",
    "Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now in five years.",
    "I need to determine five times the number of books Evan currently owns: 5 * 160 books = 800 books.",
    "Evan will have 60 more than that number in five years: 800 books + 60 books = 860 books.",
    "I conclude that in five years, Evan will have 860 books."

  "solution": "860"
