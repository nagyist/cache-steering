  "query": "Casey wants to decorate  her toenails and fingernails. First, she wants to do a base coat on each nail, then a coat of paint and finally a coat of glitter on every nail. It takes 20 minutes to apply each coat and 20 minutes for each coat to dry before applying the next one. Assuming Casey's nails will be done when all coats have been applied and dried,  how many minutes will it take her to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many types of coatings Casey will apply to each nail: base coat, paint coat, and glitter coat.",
    "There are three coats in total: base, paint, and glitter.",
    "Each coat takes 20 minutes to apply.",
    "Each coat also takes 20 minutes to dry before the next coat can be applied.",
    "Each coat therefore takes 20 minutes (application) + 20 minutes (drying) = 40 minutes per coat.",
    "Since there are three coats on each nail, I will multiply the time per coat by the number of coats.",
    "3 coats * 40 minutes per coat = 120 minutes in total.",
    "Therefore, it will take Casey 120 minutes to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails."

  "solution": "120"
