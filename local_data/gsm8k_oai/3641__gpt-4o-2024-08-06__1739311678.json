  "query": "Bobby wanted pancakes for breakfast.  The recipe on the box makes 21 pancakes.  While he ate 5 pancakes, his dog jumped up and was able to eat 7 before being caught.  How many pancakes does Bobby have left?",
  "steps": [
    "The recipe makes a total of 21 pancakes initially.",
    "Bobby ate 5 pancakes.",
    "To find out how many pancakes are left after Bobby eats, I need to subtract 5 from 21.",
    "21 pancakes - 5 pancakes = 16 pancakes remaining.",
    "Bobby's dog then ate 7 pancakes.",
    "To find out how many pancakes are left after the dog eats, I need to subtract 7 from the remaining 16 pancakes.",
    "16 pancakes - 7 pancakes = 9 pancakes remaining."
