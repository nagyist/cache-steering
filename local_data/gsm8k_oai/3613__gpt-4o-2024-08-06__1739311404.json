  "steps": [
    "Pam's current balance is $950 after withdrawing $250.",
    "This means before the withdrawal, the balance was $950 + $250 = $1200.",
    "The problem states that Pam's beginning balance tripled during the year to reach this amount before withdrawal.",
    "Let the initial balance be X. According to the problem, 3X = $1200.",
    "To find the initial balance, divide $1200 by 3.",

    "Double-check the calculation: 3 times $400 is indeed $1200."
