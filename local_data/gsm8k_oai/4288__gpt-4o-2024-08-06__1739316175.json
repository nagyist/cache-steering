  "query": "Wilson goes to a fast-food restaurant. He buys 2 hamburgers for $5 each and 3 bottles of cola for $2 each. Wilson uses his $4 discount coupon. How much money does he pay in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Wilson buys 2 hamburgers, each costing $5.",
    "To find the total cost of the hamburgers, I multiply 2 by $5.",
    "2 hamburgers x $5 each = $10",
    "Wilson also buys 3 bottles of cola, each costing $2.",
    "To find the total cost of the colas, I multiply 3 by $2.",
    "3 bottles of cola x $2 each = $6",
    "Now I add the costs of the hamburgers and the colas to find the total before the discount.",
    "Total cost before discount = $10 (hamburgers) + $6 (colas) = $16",
    "Wilson has a $4 discount coupon.",
    "I subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Wilson pays.",
    "$16 (total cost before discount) - $4 (discount) = $12"
  ],
  "solution": "12"
