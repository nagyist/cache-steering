  "query": "James has 28 marbles.  He puts them into 4 bags.  He puts the same number in each bag.  He then gives one bag away.  How many marbles does James have left?",
  "steps": [
    "James starts with 28 marbles.",
    "James puts the marbles into 4 bags with the same number in each bag.",
    "To find out how many marbles are in each bag, I divide 28 by 4.",
    "28 divided by 4 equals 7.",
    "So, there are 7 marbles in each bag.",
    "James gives one bag away.",
    "Since each bag contains 7 marbles, James gives away 7 marbles.",
    "Now I need to find out how many marbles James has left.",
    "James initially had 28 marbles, and he gave away 7 marbles.",
    "To find how many marbles are left, I subtract 7 from 28.",
    "28 minus 7 equals 21."
