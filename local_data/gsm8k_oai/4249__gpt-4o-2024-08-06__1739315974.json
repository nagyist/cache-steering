  "query": "Courtney liked to collect marbles.  She kept them in mason jars.  One jar had 80 marbles.  Her second jar had twice that amount.  She just started her third jar which currently has 1/4 the amount of her first jar.  How many marbles does she have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the number of marbles in each jar and then add them up to find the total number of marbles Courtney has.",
    "The first jar has 80 marbles.",
    "The second jar has twice the amount of the first jar.",
    "Twice 80 marbles is 2 * 80 = 160 marbles.",
    "The second jar has 160 marbles.",
    "The third jar has 1/4 of the number of marbles in the first jar.",
    "1/4 of 80 marbles is (1/4) * 80 = 20 marbles.",
    "The third jar has 20 marbles.",
    "Now, I will add the number of marbles from all three jars to find the total.",
    "80 marbles (first jar) + 160 marbles (second jar) + 20 marbles (third jar) = 260 marbles."

  "solution": "260"
