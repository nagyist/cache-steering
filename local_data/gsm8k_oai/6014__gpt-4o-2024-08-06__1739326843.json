  "query": "Sean buys 3 cans of soda, 2 soups, and 1 sandwich.  Each soup cost as much as the 3 combined sodas.  The sandwich cost 3 times as much as the soup.  If the soda cost $1 how much did everything cost together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the sodas. Sean buys 3 cans of soda, each costing $1.",
    "So, the total cost of the sodas is 3 x $1 = $3.",
    "Next, I need to figure out the cost of each soup. The problem states that each soup costs as much as the 3 combined sodas.",
    "Since the cost of the 3 sodas is $3, each soup costs $3.",
    "Sean buys 2 soups, so I need to calculate the total cost for the soups.",
    "The total cost of the soups is 2 x $3 = $6.",
    "Now, I need to determine the cost of the sandwich. The sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup.",
    "As one soup costs $3, the sandwich costs 3 x $3 = $9.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total cost of everything: sodas, soups, and sandwich.",
    "The total cost is $3 (sodas) + $6 (soups) + $9 (sandwich) = $18."

  "solution": "18"
