  "query": "Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces on Monday and 2 beaded necklaces on Tuesday. Then Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets and 7 beaded earrings on Wednesday. 20 beads are needed to make one beaded necklace. 10 beads are needed to make one beaded bracelet. 5 beads are needed to make one beaded earring. How many beads does Kylie use in total to make her jewelry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many beads Kylie uses for the necklaces.",
    "Kylie makes 10 necklaces on Monday and 2 on Tuesday, so she makes a total of 10 + 2 = 12 necklaces.",
    "Each necklace requires 20 beads, so for 12 necklaces, the number of beads required is 12 * 20 = 240 beads.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many beads Kylie uses for the bracelets.",
    "Kylie makes 5 bracelets on Wednesday.",
    "Each bracelet requires 10 beads, so for 5 bracelets, the number of beads required is 5 * 10 = 50 beads.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many beads Kylie uses for the earrings.",
    "Kylie makes 7 earrings on Wednesday.",
    "Each earring requires 5 beads, so for 7 earrings, the number of beads required is 7 * 5 = 35 beads.",
    "Finally, I will add up the beads used for the necklaces, bracelets, and earrings to find the total number of beads.",
    "The total number of beads used is 240 (necklaces) + 50 (bracelets) + 35 (earrings).",
    "Adding these gives 240 + 50 + 35 = 325."
