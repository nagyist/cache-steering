  "query": "Barry goes to a shop to buy a shirt he'd been admiring for quite some time. He tells the attendant that it's his birthday so she decides to give him a 15% special discount. The price tag on the shirt says $80. How much is he supposed to pay now, considering the special discount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the amount of the discount Barry will receive.",
    "The discount is 15% of the original price, which is 15% of $80.",
    "To calculate 15% of $80, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing 15 by 100, resulting in 0.15.",
    "Next, I'll multiply the original price ($80) by the decimal form of the percentage (0.15) to find the discount amount.",
    "$80 * 0.15 = $12. This is the discount Barry will receive on the shirt.",
    "I need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find out how much Barry will pay.",
    "Subtracting the discount from the original price: $80 - $12 = $68."

  "solution": "68"
