  "query": "Jessica is having a sweet tooth and bought 10 chocolate bars, 10 packs of gummy bears, and 20 bags of chocolate chips. Her total rang up to $150. If the cost of a pack of gummy bears is $2 and a bag of chocolate chips costs $5, how much does 1 chocolate bar cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Jessica bought 10 packs of gummy bears.",
    "Each pack of gummy bears costs $2.",
    "The total cost for gummy bears is 10 packs * $2/pack = $20.",
    "Jessica bought 20 bags of chocolate chips.",
    "Each bag of chocolate chips costs $5.",
    "The total cost for chocolate chips is 20 bags * $5/bag = $100.",
    "Jessica's total cost for gummy bears and chocolate chips is $20 + $100 = $120.",
    "Jessica's total bill is $150.",
    "The remaining cost must be for the 10 chocolate bars.",
    "The cost for the chocolate bars is $150 total - $120 for gummy bears and chocolate chips = $30.",
    "Jessica bought 10 chocolate bars.",
    "The cost of 10 chocolate bars is $30.",
    "Therefore, the cost of 1 chocolate bar is $30/10 = $3."
