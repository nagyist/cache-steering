  "query": "Carla is taking attendance for her sixth-grade class. She knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. If there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, how many students does Carla teach, including the ones in and out of the classroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the layout of the classroom. There are four rows with six desks each.",
    "Calculate the total number of desks: 4 rows * 6 desks/row = 24 desks.",
    "Next, calculate how many students are present in the classroom. It's mentioned that the desks are 2/3 full.",
    "Calculate 2/3 of 24 desks: 24 * (2/3) = 16 students present in the classroom.",
    "Add the students who are in the restroom. We know there are 2 students in the restroom.",
    "Add the students in the restroom to the number of students present: 16 present + 2 in restroom = 18 students present/in restroom.",
    "Now, calculate the number of students absent. It's mentioned that one less than three times the number of students in the restroom are absent.",
    "First, calculate three times the number of students in the restroom: 3 * 2 = 6.",
    "Subtract one from that product: 6 - 1 = 5 students are absent.",
    "Finally, calculate the total number of students Carla teaches by adding the students present, those in the restroom, and those absent: 18 present/in restroom + 5 absent = 23 students."
