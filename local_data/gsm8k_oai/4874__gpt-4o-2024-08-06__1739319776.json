  "query": "Fran baked 50 red macaroons and 40 green macarons. How many macaroons will remain if Fran ate 15 green macaroons and twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons?",
  "steps": [
    "Fran baked 50 red macaroons initially.",
    "Fran also baked 40 green macaroons initially.",
    "The problem states that Fran ate 15 green macaroons.",
    "Thus, the number of green macaroons Fran ate is 15.",
    "The problem also states that Fran ate twice as many red macaroons as she did green macaroons.",
    "Since Fran ate 15 green macaroons, she must have eaten 2 * 15 = 30 red macaroons.",
    "Next, we calculate how many red macaroons remain after Fran ate some.",
    "Initially, there were 50 red macaroons.",
    "After eating 30, the number of red macaroons remaining is 50 - 30 = 20.",
    "Now, we calculate how many green macaroons remain after Fran ate 15.",
    "Initially, there were 40 green macaroons.",
    "After eating 15, the number of green macaroons remaining is 40 - 15 = 25.",
    "To find the total number of macaroons remaining, we add the remaining red and green macaroons together.",
    "The remaining macaroons are 20 red + 25 green = 45 macaroons."
