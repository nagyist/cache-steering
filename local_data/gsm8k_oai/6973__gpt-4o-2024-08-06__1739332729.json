  "query": "A water tank has a capacity of 4000 gallons. Mack connects a pipe to the tank that fills the tank with water at the rate of 10 gallons per hour. How long will it take to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out what 3/4 of the tank's capacity is.",
    "The tank's full capacity is 4000 gallons, so I have to calculate 3/4 of 4000.",
    "3/4 of 4000 is calculated by multiplying 4000 by 3/4.",
    "4000 \u00d7 3/4 = 4000 \u00d7 0.75 = 3000 gallons.",
    "Now, I know that Mack wants to fill the tank to 3000 gallons.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it takes to fill the tank to this level with a filling rate of 10 gallons per hour.",
    "To find out how many hours it will take, I divide the number of gallons needed (3000) by the rate of filling (10 gallons per hour).",
    "3000 \u00f7 10 = 300 hours."
  ],
  "solution": "300"
