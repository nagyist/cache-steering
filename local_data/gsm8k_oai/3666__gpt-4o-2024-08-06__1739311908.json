  "query": "Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old.  Luka is exactly 2 years older than is Aubrey.  On Aubrey's 8th birthday, how many years old was Jordan's dog, Max?",
  "steps": [
    "Jordan's dog, Max, was born on Luka's 4th birthday.",
    "Luka is 2 years older than Aubrey.",
    "So, on Aubrey's 8th birthday, Luka will be 8 + 2 = 10 years old.",
    "Since Max was born when Luka was 4, Max's age on Aubrey's 8th birthday will be Luka's age (10) minus 4.",
    "Max's age on Aubrey's 8th birthday is 10 - 4 = 6 years old."

  "solution": "6"
