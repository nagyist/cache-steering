  "query": "Jill likes to watch shows on her favorite streaming service.  She watched a show that was 30 minutes long, and then watched another show that was 4 times longer.  How many total minutes did she spend watching shows?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the length of the first show in minutes. The problem states it's 30 minutes long.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the length of the second show. It is 4 times longer than the first show.",
    "To find the length of the second show, I'll multiply the length of the first show by 4: 30 minutes * 4 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I'll find the total time Jill spent watching both shows by adding the lengths of the two shows together.",
    "The total time is 30 minutes (first show) + 120 minutes (second show) = 150 minutes."

  "solution": "150"
