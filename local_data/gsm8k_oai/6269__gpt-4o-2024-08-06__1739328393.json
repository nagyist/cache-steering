  "query": "Tommy has 13 items in his pencil case. The pens are twice as many as the pencils and there's one eraser. How many pencils are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining variables. Let the number of pencils be P.",
    "According to the problem, the pens are twice as many as the pencils. Therefore, the number of pens would be 2P.",
    "Tommy has one eraser. So, there are P pencils, 2P pens, and 1 eraser in total.",
    "The sum of these items must equal the total number of items Tommy has, which is 13.",
    "So, we can write the equation: P (pencils) + 2P (pens) + 1 (eraser) = 13.",
    "Simplify this equation: 3P + 1 = 13.",
    "To isolate P, subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: 3P = 13 - 1, which simplifies to 3P = 12.",
    "Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for P: P = 12 / 3.",
    "This simplifies to P = 4.",
    "To ensure there is no error, let's verify: If P = 4, then 2P = 8 (number of pens), and there is 1 eraser. Therefore, the total count is 4 (pencils) + 8 (pens) + 1 (eraser) = 13."
