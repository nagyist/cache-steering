  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the number of paintings bought by the first group of customers.",
    "The first group consists of 4 customers and each bought 2 paintings.",
    "4 customers x 2 paintings per customer = 8 paintings.",
    "Next, I will calculate the number of paintings bought by the second group of customers.",
    "The second group consists of 12 customers and each bought 1 painting.",
    "12 customers x 1 painting per customer = 12 paintings.",
    "Lastly, I will calculate the number of paintings bought by the third group of customers.",
    "The third group consists of 4 customers and each bought 4 paintings.",
    "4 customers x 4 paintings per customer = 16 paintings.",
    "Now, I will add the paintings sold to each group to find the total number of paintings sold.",
    "8 paintings (first group) + 12 paintings (second group) + 16 paintings (third group) = 36 paintings."
