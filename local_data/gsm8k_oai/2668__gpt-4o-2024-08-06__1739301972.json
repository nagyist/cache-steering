  "query": "Hannah's family has ten pigs on their farm. They also have three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs and six more goats than cows. How many animals do they have on their farm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of pigs, which is already provided: 10 pigs.",
    "Now, calculate the number of cows. The problem states that they have three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs.",
    "Twice the number of pigs is 2 times 10, which equals 20.",
    "Three fewer than 20 is 20 minus 3, which equals 17 cows.",
    "Now, calculate the number of goats. The problem says they have six more goats than cows.",
    "The number of cows is 17, so the number of goats is 17 plus 6, which equals 23 goats.",
    "Finally, calculate the total number of animals on the farm by adding up pigs, cows, and goats.",
    "Number of pigs = 10, cows = 17, goats = 23.",
    "Total number of animals = 10 pigs + 17 cows + 23 goats = 50 animals."

  "solution": "50"
