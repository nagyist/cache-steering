  "query": "Annie does a survey of the sixth-grade classes to see who prefers pretzels to goldfish. In Miss Johnson's class, 1/6 of the students preferred goldfish. In Mr. Feldstein's class, 2/3rds of the students preferred goldfish. In Ms. Henderson's class, 1/5 of the students prefer goldfish. If each class has 30 students, how many people total prefer goldfish?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students in Miss Johnson's class prefer goldfish.",
    "Miss Johnson's class has 30 students.",
    "1/6 of the students prefer goldfish in Miss Johnson's class.",
    "To find 1/6 of 30, I do the calculation: 30 * (1/6).",
    "30 * (1/6) equals 5.",
    "So, in Miss Johnson's class, 5 students prefer goldfish.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students in Mr. Feldstein's class prefer goldfish.",
    "Mr. Feldstein's class also has 30 students.",
    "2/3rds of the students prefer goldfish in Mr. Feldstein's class.",
    "To find 2/3 of 30, I do the calculation: 30 * (2/3).",
    "30 * (2/3) equals 20.",
    "So, in Mr. Feldstein's class, 20 students prefer goldfish.",
    "Now, I will find out how many students in Ms. Henderson's class prefer goldfish.",
    "Ms. Henderson's class also has 30 students.",
    "1/5 of the students prefer goldfish in Ms. Henderson's class.",
    "To find 1/5 of 30, I do the calculation: 30 * (1/5).",
    "30 * (1/5) equals 6.",
    "So, in Ms. Henderson's class, 6 students prefer goldfish.",
    "Now, I will add the number of students who prefer goldfish from all three classes together.",
    "5 (Miss Johnson's class) + 20 (Mr. Feldstein's class) + 6 (Ms. Henderson's class) = 31."
