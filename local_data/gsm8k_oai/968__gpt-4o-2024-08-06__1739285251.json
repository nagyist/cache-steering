  "query": "Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary starts with 26 blue shirts.",
    "Mary starts with 36 brown shirts.",
    "She gives away half of her blue shirts.",
    "Half of 26 blue shirts is 26 / 2 = 13 blue shirts.",
    "So, she gives away 13 blue shirts.",
    "26 blue shirts - 13 blue shirts = 13 blue shirts left.",
    "She gives away a third of her brown shirts.",
    "A third of 36 brown shirts is 36 / 3 = 12 brown shirts.",
    "So, she gives away 12 brown shirts.",
    "36 brown shirts - 12 brown shirts = 24 brown shirts left.",
    "Now, she has 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts left.",
    "Adding the remaining blue and brown shirts gives 13 + 24 shirts.",
    "13 + 24 = 37 shirts."
