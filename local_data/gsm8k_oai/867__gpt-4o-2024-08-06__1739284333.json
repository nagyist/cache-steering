  "query": "Bob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how far ahead Bob is at the start. He has a 1 mile head-start.",
    "Bob runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour.",
    "Jim runs at a speed of 9 miles per hour.",
    "I need to find out how much faster Jim runs compared to Bob. This is done by subtracting Bob's speed from Jim's speed.",
    "9 miles per hour (Jim's speed) - 6 miles per hour (Bob's speed) = 3 miles per hour.",
    "Jim closes the distance between them at a rate of 3 miles per hour.",
    "Since Bob has a 1 mile head-start, I need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to close that 1 mile gap.",
    "To find the time, I divide the distance Jim needs to make up (1 mile) by Jim's speed advantage (3 miles per hour).",
    "1 mile / 3 miles per hour = 1/3 hours.",
    "1/3 hours needs to be converted into minutes to answer the question.",
    "There are 60 minutes in one hour, so 1/3 of an hour is 60 minutes divided by 3.",
    "60 minutes / 3 = 20 minutes."

  "solution": "20"
