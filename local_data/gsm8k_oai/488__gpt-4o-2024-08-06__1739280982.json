  "query": "Mrs. Smith wanted to buy wears worth $500. She went to a boutique with the $500 but by the time she had picked out everything she liked, she realized that she would need two-fifths more money than she had. If the shop owner gave her a discount of 15%, how much more money will she still need?",
  "steps": [
    "Mrs. Smith initially has $500 to spend.",
    "She realizes that she needs two-fifths more than she has.",
    "Two-fifths of $500 is calculated as \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = 200 \\).",
    "Adding this to the original $500, she needs $500 + $200 = $700 in total.",
    "The shop owner offers a discount of 15%.",
    "A 15% discount on $700 is calculated as \\( \\frac{15}{100} \\times 700 = 105 \\).",
    "Subtracting the discount from the total amount, the new total amount becomes $700 - $105 = $595.",
    "Mrs. Smith has $500 already.",
    "Calculating how much more money she needs, $595 - $500 = $95."
