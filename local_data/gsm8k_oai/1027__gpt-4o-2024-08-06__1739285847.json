  "query": "John commissions an artist to make him a 9 by 13 drawing.  A black and white drawing that size would cost $160.  He wants a color drawing so that is 50% more expensive.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by identifying the base cost of the black and white drawing, which is $160.",
    "The color drawing is 50% more expensive than the black and white version.",
    "To find how much more expensive the color drawing is, I calculate 50% of $160.",
    "50% of $160 is calculated as 0.50 * 160 = 80.",
    "Now, I add the extra cost of $80 to the original $160 to find the total cost of the color drawing.",
    "The total cost becomes $160 + $80 = $240."
  ],
  "solution": "240"
