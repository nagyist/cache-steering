  "query": "Karen bakes 50 chocolate chip cookies. She keeps 10 for herself, and she gives 8 to her grandparents. If Karen wants to give everyone in her class cookies, and there are 16 people in her class, how many cookies will each person receive?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how many cookies Karen has left after keeping some for herself and giving some to her grandparents.",
    "Karen initially has 50 cookies.",
    "She keeps 10 cookies for herself, so subtract 10 from 50. This leaves her with 40 cookies.",
    "Karen gives 8 cookies to her grandparents. Subtract 8 from the 40 cookies she has left. This leaves her with 32 cookies.",
    "Karen wants to give cookies to 16 people in her class.",
    "To find out how many cookies each person in her class will receive, divide the number of remaining cookies by the number of people in her class.",
    "Divide 32 cookies by 16 people.",
    "32 divided by 16 equals 2."
