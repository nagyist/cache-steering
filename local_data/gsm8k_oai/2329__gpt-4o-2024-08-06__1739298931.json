  "query": "Archie received his medical receipt from his doctor, and he needs to take antibiotics three times a day. If antibiotic costs $3 each and he needs to take it for a week, how much money does he need to buy the antibiotics?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Archie needs to take the antibiotics per day.",
    "The problem states that Archie needs to take antibiotics three times a day.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many days he needs to take the antibiotics.",
    "The problem mentions that he needs to take the antibiotics for a week.",
    "Since a week has 7 days, Archie will take antibiotics for 7 days.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of antibiotic doses Archie needs.",
    "He takes antibiotics 3 times a day for 7 days.",
    "Total doses = 3 doses/day * 7 days = 21 doses.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the antibiotics.",
    "Each antibiotic dose costs $3.",
    "Total cost = 21 doses * $3/dose = $63."

  "solution": "63"
