  "query": "Tomas ate 1.5 pounds of chocolate fudge last week. Katya ate half a pound of peanut butter fudge, while Boris ate 2 pounds of fudge. How many ounces of fudge did the 3 friends eat in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. The question is asking for the total amount of fudge in ounces that Tomas, Katya, and Boris ate together.",
    "I know that one pound is equivalent to 16 ounces.",
    "Tomas ate 1.5 pounds of chocolate fudge. I need to convert this to ounces.",
    "1.5 pounds times 16 ounces per pound equals 24 ounces. So, Tomas ate 24 ounces of fudge.",
    "Katya ate half a pound of peanut butter fudge. I need to convert this to ounces.",
    "0.5 pounds times 16 ounces per pound equals 8 ounces. So, Katya ate 8 ounces of fudge.",
    "Boris ate 2 pounds of fudge. I need to convert this to ounces.",
    "2 pounds times 16 ounces per pound equals 32 ounces. So, Boris ate 32 ounces of fudge.",
    "Now I need to find the total ounces of fudge eaten by all three friends.",
    "Adding the amounts together: 24 ounces (Tomas) + 8 ounces (Katya) + 32 ounces (Boris) equals 64 ounces."

  "solution": "64"
