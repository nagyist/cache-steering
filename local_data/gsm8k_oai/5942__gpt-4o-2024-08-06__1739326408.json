  "query": "Tyrah has six times as many pencils as Sarah has. Tim has eight times as many pencils as Sarah. If Tyrah has 12 pencils, how many does Tim have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many pencils Sarah has.",
    "We know that Tyrah has six times as many pencils as Sarah.",
    "Tyrah has 12 pencils.",
    "This means 6 times the number of pencils Sarah has is equal to 12.",
    "To find out how many Sarah has, divide 12 by 6.",
    "12 divided by 6 is 2.",
    "So, Sarah has 2 pencils.",
    "Now, Tim has eight times as many pencils as Sarah.",
    "Since Sarah has 2 pencils, to find how many Tim has, multiply 2 by 8.",
    "2 times 8 is 16."

  "solution": "16"
