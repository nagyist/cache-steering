  "query": "Gary counted the number of whiskers on the faces of his two cats.  Princess Puff has 14 whiskers, while Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess puff.  How many whiskers does Catman Do have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many whiskers Princess Puff has.",
    "Princess Puff has 14 whiskers.",
    "Next, I should find out how many whiskers Catman Do has.",
    "Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff.",
    "To find twice the number of whiskers Princess Puff has, I multiply 14 by 2.",
    "14 multiplied by 2 is 28.",
    "Now, I need to subtract 6 from 28 to find how many whiskers Catman Do has.",
    "28 minus 6 equals 22."
