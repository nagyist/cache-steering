  "query": "A spiral notebook costs $15, and a personal planner costs $10. How much would it cost in total to buy 4 spiral notebooks and 8 personal planners at a 20% discount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of 4 spiral notebooks without any discount. One spiral notebook costs $15.",
    "4 spiral notebooks would cost 4 \u00d7 $15 = $60.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of 8 personal planners without any discount. One personal planner costs $10.",
    "8 personal planners would cost 8 \u00d7 $10 = $80.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of both the spiral notebooks and personal planners before applying any discount.",
    "Total cost before discount is $60 (notebooks) + $80 (planners) = $140.",
    "There is a 20% discount on the total purchase. I need to calculate 20% of $140.",
    "20% of $140 is 0.20 \u00d7 $140 = $28.",
    "I need to subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted total cost.",
    "The total cost after 20% discount is $140 - $28 = $112."

  "solution": "112"
