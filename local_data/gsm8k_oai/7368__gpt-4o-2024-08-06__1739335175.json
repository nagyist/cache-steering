  "steps": [
    "Let's define the unknown number as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, a quarter of the number \\( x \\) is expressed as \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\).",
    "The problem states that fifteen more than a quarter of the number is 27.",
    "So, we can write the equation: \\( \\frac{x}{4} + 15 = 27 \\).",
    "To isolate \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), we need to subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: \\( \\frac{x}{4} = 27 - 15 \\).",
    "Subtracting 15 from 27 gives us \\( 12 \\). So, \\( \\frac{x}{4} = 12 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), we need to multiply both sides of the equation \\( \\frac{x}{4} = 12 \\) by 4.",
    "Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \\( x = 12 \\times 4 \\).",
    "Calculating \\( 12 \\times 4 \\) results in \\( 48 \\).",
    "Let's double-check our solution to ensure it satisfies the original condition.",
    "First, calculate a quarter of 48, which is \\( \\frac{48}{4} = 12 \\).",
    "Then add 15 to this result: \\( 12 + 15 = 27 \\).",
    "The calculated result, 27, matches the condition given in the problem."
