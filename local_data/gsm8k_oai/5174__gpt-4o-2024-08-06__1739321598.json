  "query": "Alex needs to be 54 inches tall to ride the newest roller coaster at the theme park. He is 48 inches tall this year. He hears a rumor that for every hour he hangs upside down, he can grow 1/12 of an inch. Normally he grows 1/3 of an inch per month. On average, how many hours does he need to hang upside down each month to be tall enough next year to ride the rollercoaster?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many inches Alex needs to grow to reach the required height for the roller coaster. He needs to be 54 inches tall and is currently 48 inches tall.",
    "54 inches - 48 inches = 6 inches. Alex needs to grow 6 inches.",
    "Next, let's calculate how much Alex will grow normally in a year if he grows 1/3 of an inch per month. There are 12 months in a year, so...",
    "1/3 inch/month * 12 months = 4 inches. Alex will grow 4 inches in a year normally.",
    "To determine the additional growth needed from hanging upside down, we subtract the normal growth from the total growth required.",
    "6 inches total needed - 4 inches normal growth = 2 inches. Alex needs to grow an additional 2 inches by hanging upside down.",
    "Now, let's find out how many inches he grows per hour by hanging upside down. He grows 1/12 of an inch for each hour spent hanging upside down.",
    "To find the number of hours needed to grow 2 inches, we set up the equation:",
    "(1/12 inch/hour) * x hours = 2 inches",
    "Solving for x gives: x = 2 inches * 12 hours/inch = 24 hours.",
    "Alex needs a total of 24 hours hanging upside down to grow the additional 2 inches within a year.",
    "Since the year has 12 months, we now calculate how many hours he needs to hang upside down per month.",
    "24 total hours / 12 months = 2 hours per month."

  "solution": "2"
