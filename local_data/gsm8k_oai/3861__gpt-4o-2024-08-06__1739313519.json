  "query": "In a town, there are four primary schools. Two of them can teach 400 students at a time, and the other two 340 students at a time. How many students at a time in total, can these four primary schools teach?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students the two schools that can accommodate 400 students each can teach together.",
    "Each of these two schools can teach 400 students. So for two schools: 400 students/school \u00d7 2 schools = 800 students.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students the other two schools can teach. Each of these can accommodate 340 students.",
    "Each of the two schools can teach 340 students. So for these two schools: 340 students/school \u00d7 2 schools = 680 students.",
    "Now, I will sum the students from both groups of schools to find the total number of students all four schools can teach.",
    "Total students = 800 students + 680 students = 1480 students."

  "solution": "1480"
