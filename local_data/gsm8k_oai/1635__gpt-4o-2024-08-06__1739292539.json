  "query": "Janet's grades for her first semester of college were 90, 80, 70, and 100. If her semester 2 average was 82 percent, how much higher was her semester 1 average compared to her semester 2 average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the average grade for Janet's first semester.",
    "The grades for her first semester are 90, 80, 70, and 100.",
    "I need to sum these grades: 90 + 80 + 70 + 100 = 340.",
    "Janet took 4 courses in the first semester, so I divide the total sum by 4 to get the average.",
    "340 divided by 4 equals 85.",
    "Janet's semester 1 average is 85 percent.",
    "Now, I need to compare this to her semester 2 average, which is 82 percent.",
    "To find out how much higher her semester 1 average is, I subtract the semester 2 average from the semester 1 average: 85 - 82.",
    "85 minus 82 equals 3."

  "solution": "3"
