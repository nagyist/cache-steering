  "query": "There are twice as many surfers on Malibu beach as in Santa Monica beach. If there are 20 surfers in Santa Monica, calculate the total number of surfers on the two beaches.",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the number of surfers on Malibu beach, which is twice the number on Santa Monica beach.",
    "I'm given that there are 20 surfers on Santa Monica beach.",
    "Since Malibu has twice as many, I need to multiply the number of surfers in Santa Monica by 2.",
    "20 surfers in Santa Monica * 2 = 40 surfers in Malibu.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of surfers on both beaches by adding the number of surfers in Santa Monica to those in Malibu.",
    "Total surfers = 20 (Santa Monica) + 40 (Malibu).",
    "20 + 40 = 60."
