  "query": "Betty\u2019s herb garden has 2 more than twice as many oregano plants as basil. If there are 5 basil plants, what is the total number of plants in the garden?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many oregano plants Betty has.",
    "I know the problem states that there are 2 more than twice as many oregano plants as there are basil.",
    "There are 5 basil plants.",
    "First, I should calculate twice the number of basil plants: 2 * 5 = 10.",
    "Then, I add 2 more to find the number of oregano plants: 10 + 2 = 12.",
    "Now, I know there are 5 basil plants and 12 oregano plants.",
    "To find the total number of plants, I will add the number of basil and oregano plants together: 5 + 12 = 17."
