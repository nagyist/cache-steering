  "query": "Last year, the school library purchased 50 new books. This year, it purchased 3 times as many books. If the library had 100 books before it purchased new books last year, how many books are in the library now?",
  "steps": [
    "The library initially had 100 books.",
    "Last year, the library purchased 50 new books.",
    "So, after last year's purchase, the total number of books was 100 + 50 = 150 books.",
    "This year, the library purchased 3 times as many books as last year.",
    "Last year, 50 books were purchased. Therefore, this year, 50 * 3 = 150 books were purchased.",
    "Add this year's purchase to the previous total of books: 150 + 150 = 300 books."

  "solution": "300"
