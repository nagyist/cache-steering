  "steps": [
    "Mrs. Thomson received $240 as an incentive.",
    "She spent 1/3 of the money on food.",
    "1/3 of $240 is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80 \\).",
    "Mrs. Thomson spent $80 on food.",
    "She spent 1/5 of the money on clothes.",
    "1/5 of $240 is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 240 = 48 \\).",
    "Mrs. Thomson spent $48 on clothes.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent on food and clothes.",
    "The total is $80 (food) + $48 (clothes) = $128.",
    "To find out how much money she has left after these expenses, subtract the total spent from the original amount.",
    "$240 - $128 = $112 remains after spending.",
    "Mrs. Thomson put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money.",
    "3/4 of the remaining $112 is calculated as \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 112 = 84 \\)."
