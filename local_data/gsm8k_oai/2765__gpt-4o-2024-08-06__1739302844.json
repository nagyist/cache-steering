  "query": "Saturday at the ice cream shop, there were twice as many people who ordered vanilla ice cream as ordered chocolate ice cream.  If 220 people ordered ice cream on Saturday, and 20% of those ordered vanilla ice cream, how many people ordered chocolate ice cream?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many people ordered vanilla ice cream. I know that 20% of the 220 people ordered vanilla ice cream.",
    "To find 20% of 220, I multiply 220 by 0.20.",
    "220 * 0.20 = 44",
    "So, 44 people ordered vanilla ice cream.",
    "According to the problem, there were twice as many people who ordered vanilla ice cream compared to chocolate ice cream.",
    "Let x be the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream.",
    "Then the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream is 2x.",
    "From step 3, the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream is 44, so we have 2x = 44.",
    "Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives x = 22.",
    "Therefore, 22 people ordered chocolate ice cream."

  "solution": "22"
