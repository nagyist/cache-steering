  "steps": [
    "The total prize money is $2,400.",
    "The first winner receives a third of the prize money.",
    "A third of $2,400 is calculated as $2,400 / 3.",
    "$2,400 divided by 3 is $800.",
    "So, the first winner receives $800.",
    "To find the remaining amount, subtract $800 from $2,400.",
    "$2,400 - $800 equals $1,600.",
    "This $1,600 is the remaining prize money.",
    "The next ten winners will each receive a 10th of this remaining amount.",
    "To find a 10th of $1,600, divide $1,600 by 10.",
    "$1,600 divided by 10 is $160."
