  "query": "Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?",
  "steps": [
    "Monica studied for 2 hours on Wednesday.",
    "On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours.",
    "On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total study time from Wednesday to Friday.",
    "Total time for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours.",
    "During the weekend, Monica studied as much as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which is 11 hours.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time from Wednesday to the weekend.",
    "The total study time over the five days is 11 + 11 = 22 hours."
