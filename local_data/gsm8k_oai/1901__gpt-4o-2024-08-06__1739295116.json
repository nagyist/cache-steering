  "query": "The total distance between 2 towns is 200 miles. Roger and his friend drove 1/4 of the total distance, taking 1 hour to do so. They take lunch for another 1 hour and then drove the remaining distance going at the same speed as before. What's the total amount of time, in hours, Roger and his friend took to travel between the two towns?",
  "steps": [
    "First, figure out how much distance Roger and his friend drove in the first leg of their journey. They drove 1/4 of the total distance.",
    "The total distance between the two towns is 200 miles. 1/4 of 200 miles is 200 miles divided by 4.",
    "200 divided by 4 is 50. So, they drove 50 miles in the first leg of the journey.",
    "Next, determine how long it took them to drive this 50-mile stretch. It took them 1 hour.",
    "Since they drove 50 miles in 1 hour, their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.",
    "Now, find out the distance remaining after the first leg of their journey. They still need to drive the remaining distance.",
    "The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already covered, which is 200 miles minus 50 miles.",
    "200 minus 50 is 150. So, they have 150 miles left to drive.",
    "Calculate how much time it would take to drive the remaining 150 miles at the same speed of 50 miles per hour.",
    "Time is distance divided by speed. So, time to drive 150 miles is 150 miles divided by 50 miles per hour.",
    "150 divided by 50 is 3. So, it takes 3 hours to drive the remaining distance.",
    "Add all the time intervals to calculate the total amount of time taken to travel between the two towns.",
    "The total time is the sum of the time for the first leg (1 hour), the lunch break (1 hour), and the time for the remaining distance (3 hours).",
    "1 + 1 + 3 equals 5. So, the total amount of time taken is 5 hours."
