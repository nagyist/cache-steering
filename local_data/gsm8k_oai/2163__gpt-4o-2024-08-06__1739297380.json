  "query": "Miles is a musician.  He owns three fewer trumpets than he has fingers, and two more guitars than he has hands.  He also owns two more trombones than he has heads, and one fewer French horn than he has guitars.  What is the total number of musical instruments that Miles owns?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fingers Miles has. Humans typically have 10 fingers.",
    "Miles owns three fewer trumpets than he has fingers. That means he has 10 - 3 = 7 trumpets.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many hands Miles has. Humans typically have 2 hands.",
    "Miles owns two more guitars than he has hands. That means he has 2 + 2 = 4 guitars.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many heads Miles has. Humans typically have 1 head.",
    "Miles owns two more trombones than he has heads. That means he has 1 + 2 = 3 trombones.",
    "Miles owns one fewer French horn than he has guitars. That means he has 4 - 1 = 3 French horns.",
    "Now, I will sum up all the musical instruments Miles owns: trumpets, guitars, trombones, and French horns.",
    "Adding up the instruments: 7 (trumpets) + 4 (guitars) + 3 (trombones) + 3 (French horns) = 17."

  "solution": "17"
