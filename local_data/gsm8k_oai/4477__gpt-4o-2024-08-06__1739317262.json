  "query": "Melanie baked 10 batches of brownies, with 20 brownies in each batch. She set aside 3/4 of the brownies in each batch for a bake sale, put 3/5 of the remaining in a container, and gave out the rest. How many brownies are given out?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of brownies Melanie baked. She baked 10 batches and each batch has 20 brownies.",
    "The total number of brownies is 10 batches * 20 brownies per batch = 200 brownies.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many brownies were set aside for the bake sale from each batch. Melanie set aside 3/4 of the brownies in each batch.",
    "3/4 of each batch's 20 brownies is (3/4) * 20 = 15 brownies per batch.",
    "Since there were 10 batches, the total number of brownies set aside for the bake sale is 10 batches * 15 brownies per batch = 150 brownies.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many brownies remained after setting aside those for the bake sale. Total brownies minus those set aside equals the remaining brownies.",
    "The remaining brownies after setting aside 150 brownies for the bake sale is 200 total brownies - 150 brownies = 50 brownies.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many of the remaining brownies were put into a container. Melanie put 3/5 of these remaining brownies into a container.",
    "3/5 of the 50 remaining brownies is (3/5) * 50 = 30 brownies.",
    "Finally, brownies given out are those remaining after setting aside for the bake sale and putting some in a container. I subtract the number of brownies put in the container from those remaining after the bake sale.",
    "The number of brownies given out is 50 remaining brownies - 30 brownies put in the container = 20 brownies."
