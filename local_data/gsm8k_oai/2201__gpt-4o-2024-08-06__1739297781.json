  "query": "Two days ago, Uncle Welly planted 50 roses on his vacant lot. Yesterday, he planted 20 more roses than the previous day. Today, he planted twice the number of roses than two days ago. How many roses did Uncle Welly plant in his vacant lot?",
  "steps": [
    "Two days ago, Uncle Welly planted 50 roses.",
    "Yesterday, he planted 20 more roses than the previous day. Let's calculate that.",
    "50 roses (from two days ago) + 20 additional roses = 70 roses yesterday.",
    "Today, he planted twice the number of roses than two days ago.",
    "Twice the number of roses planted two days ago would be 2 * 50 = 100 roses today.",
    "Now, let's sum up all the roses he planted over the three days.",
    "Roses two days ago: 50",
    "Roses yesterday: 70",
    "Roses today: 100",
    "Total roses = 50 + 70 + 100",
    "Calculating, 50 + 70 is 120.",
    "Adding 100 to 120 gives us 220."
