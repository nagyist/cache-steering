  "query": "Noel bakes 4 dozen donuts for his class. There are 30 students in class, but only 80% like donuts. How many donuts does each student who likes donuts get to eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many donuts Noel bakes in total. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen is 4 times 12.",
    "4 times 12 equals 48. So, Noel bakes 48 donuts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many students like donuts. There are 30 students in total, and 80% of them like donuts.",
    "To find 80% of the students, I calculate 80% of 30.",
    "80% of 30 is calculated as 0.8 times 30.",
    "0.8 times 30 equals 24. So, 24 students like donuts.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many donuts each student who likes donuts will get. I do this by dividing the total number of donuts by the number of students who like them.",
    "I divide 48 donuts by 24 students.",
    "48 divided by 24 equals 2."

  "solution": "2"
