  "query": "Eva learns for two semesters in a year. In 2019, she scored ten more marks in maths in the first semester than the second, 15 marks less in arts, and 1/3 marks less in science in the first semester than the second. If she got 80 marks in maths in the second semester, 90 marks in arts, and 90 in science, what's the total number of her marks in all the semesters?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Eva's maths score for the first semester. I know that she scored ten more marks in the first semester than in the second semester.",
    "According to the problem, she got 80 marks in the second semester for maths.",
    "Thus, in the first semester, Eva scored 80 + 10 = 90 marks in maths.",
    "Next, I need to figure out her arts scores in the first semester. She scored 15 marks less in the first semester than in the second semester.",
    "The problem indicates she scored 90 marks in arts in the second semester.",
    "Therefore, Eva scored 90 - 15 = 75 marks in arts in the first semester.",
    "Now, I need to calculate her science scores for the first semester. She scored 1/3 less in the first semester than in the second semester.",
    "She received 90 marks in science in the second semester.",
    "To find 1/3 less, I calculate (1/3) * 90 = 30; thus, in the first semester, she scored 90 - 30 = 60 marks in science.",
    "Now, I add all the marks together.",
    "First semester total: Maths = 90, Arts = 75, Science = 60.",
    "First semester total marks = 90 + 75 + 60 = 225.",
    "Second semester total: Maths = 80, Arts = 90, Science = 90.",
    "Second semester total marks = 80 + 90 + 90 = 260.",
    "Finally, I add the totals of both semesters together to find the total number of marks she received throughout the year.",
    "Eva's total marks for the year = 225 + 260 = 485."
