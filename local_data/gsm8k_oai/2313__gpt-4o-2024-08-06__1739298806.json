  "query": "Christian is twice as old as Brian. In eight more years, Brian will be 40 years old. How old will Christian be in eight years?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first determine Brian's age. In eight years, Brian will be 40 years old.",
    "To find Brian's current age, we subtract 8 years from 40 years.",
    "40 - 8 equals 32. So, Brian is currently 32 years old.",
    "The problem states that Christian is twice as old as Brian.",
    "Since Brian is 32, Christian's current age is 2 times 32.",
    "2 times 32 equals 64. Therefore, Christian is currently 64 years old.",
    "We need to find out how old Christian will be in eight years.",
    "To find Christian's age in eight years, add 8 years to his current age of 64.",
    "64 + 8 equals 72."

  "solution": "72"
