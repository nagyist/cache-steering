  "query": "Trevor and two of his neighborhood friends go to the toy shop every year to buy toys. Trevor always spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys, and Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys. If Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys, calculate how much money in total the three spend in 4 years.",
  "steps": [
    "Trevor spends $80 every year.",
    "Trevor spends $20 more than Reed every year.",
    "To find out how much Reed spends, subtract $20 from Trevor's expenditure: $80 - $20 = $60. So, Reed spends $60 every year.",
    "Reed spends 2 times as much as Quinn every year.",
    "To find out how much Quinn spends, divide Reed's expenditure by 2: $60 \u00f7 2 = $30. So, Quinn spends $30 every year.",
    "Now, I have the yearly expenditures: Trevor spends $80, Reed spends $60, and Quinn spends $30.",
    "Add their yearly spending together: $80 + $60 + $30 = $170. The total amount spent by all three in one year is $170.",
    "I need to find out how much they spend in total over 4 years.",
    "Multiply the total annual spending by 4: $170 \u00d7 4 = $680."
  ],
  "solution": "680"
