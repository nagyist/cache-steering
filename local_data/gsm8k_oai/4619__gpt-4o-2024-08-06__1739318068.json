  "query": "Bill the miner discovers a vein of fool's gold. He successfully sells 8 ounces to a merchant, but when he tries to sell to the sheriff he's arrested, fined $50 and run out of town on a rail. If Bill earned $9 for every ounce of fool's gold he sold, how much money is he left with?",
  "steps": [
    "Bill sold 8 ounces of fool's gold.",
    "He earned $9 for each ounce he sold.",
    "To find out how much money Bill earned from selling the fool's gold, I multiply the number of ounces sold by the price per ounce.",
    "8 ounces times $9 per ounce equals $72.",
    "Bill earned a total of $72 from selling the fool's gold.",
    "However, Bill was fined $50.",
    "To find out how much money Bill is left with, I need to subtract the fine from the amount he earned.",
    "$72 (earned) minus $50 (fine) equals $22."
