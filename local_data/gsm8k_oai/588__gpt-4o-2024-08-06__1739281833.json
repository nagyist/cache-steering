  "query": "John worked 8 hours a day every day from the 3rd to the 8th, including the 3rd and not including the 8th.  How many hours did he work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total number of days John worked.",
    "John started working on the 3rd and worked up until the 8th, but did not include the 8th.",
    "This means he worked from the 3rd through the 7th.",
    "Let's count the days: 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th.",
    "That is a total of 5 days.",
    "John worked 8 hours per day.",
    "To find the total hours, I need to multiply the number of days by the hours per day.",
    "So, \\(5 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 40 \\text{ hours}\\)."
  ],
  "solution": "40"
