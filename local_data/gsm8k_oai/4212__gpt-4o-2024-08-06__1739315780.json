  "query": "Braden had $400 in his money box. He had also placed a bet today with Byan that the Raptors will beat the Bulls. If the game's outcome was as Braden predicted, and he and Bryan had agreed to give the winner twice as much money as Braden had in his money box, calculate the total amount of money Braden had in his money box after winning the bet?",
  "steps": [
    "Braden initially had $400 in his money box.",
    "Braden made a bet with Bryan that the Raptors would beat the Bulls. If Braden won, the winnings would be twice the amount of money Braden had in his money box.",
    "Twice the amount of money Braden had in his money box is 2 times $400, which equals $800.",
    "Since Braden won the bet, Bryan owes Braden $800.",
    "After winning the bet, Braden's total money would be the initial money in the box plus the winnings from the bet: $400 + $800.",
    "Calculating this gives Braden a total of $1200."

  "solution": "1200"
