  "query": "Daniel owns a textile company. Every Monday he delivers 20 yards of fabric, and every Tuesday he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday. Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the amount of fabric delivered on Monday. Daniel delivers 20 yards of fabric on Monday.",
    "Next, calculate the amount of fabric delivered on Tuesday. He delivers twice the amount of Monday, which is 2 * 20 = 40 yards.",
    "Now, find out the amount of fabric delivered on Wednesday. He delivers 1/4 of what he delivers on Tuesday. So, it's 1/4 * 40 = 10 yards.",
    "Add up the total fabric delivered from Monday to Wednesday. Monday is 20 yards, Tuesday is 40 yards, and Wednesday is 10 yards. Total = 20 + 40 + 10 = 70 yards.",
    "Each yard of fabric costs $2. So, calculate the earnings by multiplying the total yards by the cost per yard: 70 * 2 = $140."

  "solution": "140"
