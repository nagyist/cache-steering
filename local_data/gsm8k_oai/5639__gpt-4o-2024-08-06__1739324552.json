  "query": "There are 30 major league baseball stadiums. Zach has a goal to take his son to see at least one game at each one. He has calculated the average cost for them to travel and see a game will be $900 per stadium. Zach can save $1,500 per year for his baseball stadium trips. How many years will it take Zach to accomplish his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for Zach and his son to visit all 30 baseball stadiums.",
    "The average cost per stadium is $900.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the number of stadiums (30) by the average cost per stadium ($900).",
    "30 stadiums * $900 per stadium = $27,000.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many years it will take Zach to save $27,000 if he saves $1,500 per year.",
    "I divide the total cost ($27,000) by the amount Zach can save per year ($1,500).",
    "$27,000 \u00f7 $1,500 per year = 18 years.",
    "This means Zach will take 18 years to save enough money to accomplish his goal of visiting all the stadiums."
