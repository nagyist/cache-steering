  "query": "Aunt May milks her cows twice a day. This morning she got 365 gallons of milk. This evening she got 380 gallons. She sold 612 gallons to the local ice cream factory.  She had 15 gallons left over from yesterday.  How many gallons of milk does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much milk Aunt May collected today.",
    "She collected 365 gallons in the morning and 380 gallons in the evening.",
    "I will add these two amounts together to find the total milk collected today: 365 + 380.",
    "365 + 380 = 745 gallons. So, Aunt May collected 745 gallons today.",
    "Next, I need to add the milk left over from yesterday to the amount collected today.",
    "Aunt May had 15 gallons left over from yesterday.",
    "I add the leftover milk to today's collection: 745 + 15.",
    "745 + 15 = 760 gallons. This is the total milk available today.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the amount of milk sold to the ice cream factory from the total milk available.",
    "Aunt May sold 612 gallons to the local ice cream factory.",
    "I subtract this amount from the total milk: 760 - 612.",
    "760 - 612 = 148 gallons."
  ],
  "solution": "148"
