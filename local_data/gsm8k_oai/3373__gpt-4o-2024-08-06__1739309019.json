  "query": "Shonda is throwing an Easter egg hunt for her 2 kids and their 10 friends. She is also supplying enough eggs for herself and the 7 other adults there to find eggs as well. If there are 15 Easter egg baskets for everyone to share and each ends up holding 12 Easter eggs, when they equally distribute all of the Easter eggs to everyone, how many eggs does each person get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of people involved in the Easter egg hunt.",
    "Shonda has 2 kids and 10 of their friends, which adds up to 12 children.",
    "Including Shonda, there are 8 adults.",
    "So, the total number of people, including kids and adults, is 12 (kids) + 8 (adults) = 20 people.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of Easter eggs available.",
    "There are 15 baskets and each basket holds 12 eggs.",
    "Therefore, the total number of eggs is 15 baskets * 12 eggs per basket = 180 eggs.",
    "To find out how many eggs each person gets, I need to divide the total number of eggs by the total number of people.",
    "So, each person gets 180 eggs / 20 people = 9 eggs per person."
