  "query": "To try to get the class to eat more vegetables, the teacher says that she will start giving them good character points that the class can redeem for a movie day if they earn enough. The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total points the class can earn each day. If there are 25 students and each can earn 2 points by eating their vegetables, the total points per day is 25 students * 2 points = 50 points.",
    "To win the movie day, the class needs 200 points. They have 10 days to achieve this. I need to calculate the total points they can earn in these 10 days.",
    "Each day, the class can earn 50 points. So, over 10 days, the class can earn 50 points/day * 10 days = 500 points.",
    "I made an error. The question states they need 200 points to win the movie day, which can be earned in fewer than 10 days. Therefore, I can focus on the 200-point target.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many days it takes to earn exactly 200 points given they earn 50 points per day. To do this, I'll use 200 points \u00f7 50 points/day = 4 days.",
    "Since they need to win the movie within two weeks (10 days), they only need 4 days to reach 200 points, which is easily within the 10-day timeframe.",
    "However, the question asks for the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week.",
    "First, let's focus on how many vegetables each student must eat to earn 200 points. Since each student can earn a maximum of 2 points from eating vegetables:\n200 points / 25 students = 8 points needed per student.",
    "To convert points needed per student to the vegetables eaten per student: \n8 points / 2 points per vegetable = 4 vegetables per student.",
    "Therefore, each student needs to eat 4 vegetables to contribute to the 200-point target. To find the weekly average for two weeks (which are 10 days), I will consider that there are 10 school days in two weeks. However, since the students need only to eat 4 vegetables overall to reach the goal, dividing by two weeks won't change the number.",
    "Each student must eat 4 vegetables overall to reach the target within two weeks. Thus, the average per week (though it can be achieved in less than a week) is 2 vegetables."
