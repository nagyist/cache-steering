  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Lee's monthly salary. To find this, I'll divide his annual salary by 12 months.",
    "Lee's monthly salary is $60,000 / 12 = $5,000.",

    "Two months' salary would be 2 x $5,000 = $10,000.",
    "Now, I need to determine how long it will take Lee to save $10,000.",
    "Lee can save $1,000 per month.",
    "To find out how many months it will take to save $10,000, I'll divide $10,000 by his monthly savings of $1,000.",
