  "query": "Annabelle collected a weekly allowance of $30. She spent a third of it buying junk food, then spent another $8 on sweets. Out of guilt she decides to save the rest. How much did she save?",
  "steps": [
    "Annabelle's weekly allowance is $30.",
    "She spent a third of her allowance on junk food.",
    "To find out how much she spent on junk food, calculate one third of $30.",
    "One third of $30 is $30 divided by 3.",
    "$30 divided by 3 equals $10.",
    "She spent $10 on junk food.",
    "Next, Annabelle spent $8 on sweets.",
    "So, she has already spent $10 on junk food and $8 on sweets.",
    "Add these two amounts: $10 + $8.",
    "$10 + $8 equals $18.",
    "Annabelle's total spending is $18.",
    "To find out how much she saved, subtract her spending from her total allowance.",
    "Subtract $18 from her $30 allowance: $30 - $18.",
    "$30 - $18 equals $12."

  "solution": "12"
