  "query": "A small poultry farm has 300 chickens, 200 turkeys and 80 guinea fowls. A strange, incurable disease hit the farm and every day the farmer lost 20 chickens, 8 turkeys and 5 guinea fowls. After a week, how many birds will be left in the poultry?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of chickens on the farm initially is 300.",
    "The total number of turkeys on the farm initially is 200.",
    "The total number of guinea fowls on the farm initially is 80.",
    "The disease causes the farm to lose 20 chickens every day.",
    "In one week, which is 7 days, the farm will lose 20 chickens per day * 7 days = 140 chickens.",
    "After a week, the number of chickens left is 300 - 140 = 160 chickens.",
    "The disease causes the farm to lose 8 turkeys every day.",
    "In one week, the farm will lose 8 turkeys per day * 7 days = 56 turkeys.",
    "After a week, the number of turkeys left is 200 - 56 = 144 turkeys.",
    "The disease causes the farm to lose 5 guinea fowls every day.",
    "In one week, the farm will lose 5 guinea fowls per day * 7 days = 35 guinea fowls.",
    "After a week, the number of guinea fowls left is 80 - 35 = 45 guinea fowls.",
    "Now, I need to sum up the remaining chickens, turkeys, and guinea fowls.",
    "The remaining number of birds is 160 chickens + 144 turkeys + 45 guinea fowls.",
    "Performing the calculation: 160 + 144 + 45 = 349."
