    "I need to determine how many new shirts Alex has, given information about Joe and Ben.",
    "I know Ben has 15 new shirts.",
    "Ben has eight more new shirts than Joe.",
    "I can calculate the number of shirts Joe has by subtracting 8 from Ben's shirts.",
    "15 (shirts Ben has) - 8 = 7",
