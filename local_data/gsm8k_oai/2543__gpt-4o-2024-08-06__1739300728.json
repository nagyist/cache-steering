  "query": "Matthew drinks 4 glasses of water per day. Each glass is 5 ounces. He decides to just buy a 35 ounces water bottle. How many times will he fill it each week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much water Matthew drinks in ounces per day.",
    "Matthew drinks 4 glasses per day and each glass is 5 ounces.",
    "So, Matthew drinks 4 glasses * 5 ounces = 20 ounces per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many ounces Matthew drinks in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so Matthew drinks 20 ounces * 7 days = 140 ounces per week.",
    "Matthew decides to use a 35-ounce water bottle.",
    "To find out how many times he will fill the bottle each week, I divide the total weekly water consumption by the bottle capacity.",
    "So, 140 ounces per week divided by 35 ounces per bottle = 4.",
    "This means Matthew will fill the 35-ounce bottle 4 times each week."
