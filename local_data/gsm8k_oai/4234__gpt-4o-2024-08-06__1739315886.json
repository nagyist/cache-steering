  "query": "There are three times as many hogs as cats in King Henry's kingdom. If there are 75 hogs, what's 5 less than 60% of the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cats are in King Henry's kingdom.",
    "I know there are three times as many hogs as cats, and there are 75 hogs.",
    "To find the number of cats, I can divide the number of hogs by 3.",
    "75 hogs divided by 3 equals 25 cats in the kingdom.",
    "Now I need to find 60% of the number of cats.",
    "60% of 25 cats is calculated as 0.60 multiplied by 25.",
    "0.60 times 25 equals 15.",
    "The problem asks for 5 less than this number.",
    "15 minus 5 equals 10."
