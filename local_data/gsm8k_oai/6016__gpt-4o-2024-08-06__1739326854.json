  "query": "Madison and Gigi have to run a total of 2400 meters in gym class. The track is 150 meters around. If they each have run 6 laps, how many more laps do they have to run before they reach 2400 meters?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how far Madison and Gigi have run already.",
    "Each lap is 150 meters long.",
    "Madison and Gigi have each run 6 laps.",
    "To find out how many meters they have run, I multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.",
    "6 laps times 150 meters per lap equals 900 meters.",
    "Since there are two people, Madison and Gigi, I need to account for both of them running 900 meters.",
    "I add their distances together: 900 meters + 900 meters equals 1800 meters.",
    "The total distance they need to run is 2400 meters.",
    "I subtract the distance already run (1800 meters) from the total distance needed (2400 meters) to find out how much more they need to run.",
    "2400 meters minus 1800 meters equals 600 meters remaining.",
    "I need to determine how many more laps are needed to cover the remaining 600 meters.",
    "I divide the remaining distance by the distance per lap: 600 meters divided by 150 meters per lap equals 4 laps."

  "solution": "4"
