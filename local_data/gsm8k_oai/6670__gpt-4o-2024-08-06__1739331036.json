  "query": "Three blue chips are in a jar which is 10% of the entire chips. If 50% of the chips are white and the rest are green, how many green chips are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the three blue chips make up 10% of the entire chips.",
    "To find the total number of chips, I set up the equation: 10% of total chips = 3 chips.",
    "Converting 10% to a decimal gives me 0.1.",
    "Thus, 0.1 multiplied by the total number of chips equals 3.",
    "To find the total number of chips, I divide 3 by 0.1, which is 3 / 0.1.",
    "3 divided by 0.1 equals 30, so there are 30 chips in total.",
    "I know 50% of the chips are white.",
    "Converting 50% to a decimal gives me 0.5.",
    "Calculating 50% of 30 gives me 0.5 x 30 = 15 white chips.",
    "Now, I know there are 30 chips total with 3 blue and 15 white.",
    "To find the remaining chips, I add the number of blue and white chips and subtract from the total.",
    "3 blue chips plus 15 white chips equals 18 chips.",
    "Subtracting the 18 chips from the total 30 chips gives 30 - 18.",
    "This equals 12, which should be the number of green chips."
