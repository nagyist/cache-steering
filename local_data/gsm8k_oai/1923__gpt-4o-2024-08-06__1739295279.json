  "query": "Katrina saw an ad that said if she signed up for her local recycling program, she could earn $5.00.  When she signed up, they told her for every friend that she referred, the friend would receive $5.00 and she would receive another $5.00 per friend.  That day, she had 5 friends sign up and another 7 friends by the end of the week.  How much money in total did she and her friends make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Katrina received for signing up herself.",
    "Katrina earns $5.00 when she signs up for the recycling program.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money Katrina earns from referring her friends.",
    "Katrina referred 5 friends on one day. For each friend, she receives $5.00.",
    "For the 5 friends, Katrina earns 5 friends \u00d7 $5.00 = $25.00.",
    "Katrina referred another 7 friends by the end of the week. For each friend, she again receives $5.00.",
    "For the 7 friends, Katrina earns 7 friends \u00d7 $5.00 = $35.00.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total amount of money Katrina made from signing up and referrals.",
    "Katrina's total earnings are $5.00 (for signing up) + $25.00 (from the first group of friends) + $35.00 (from the second group of friends) = $65.00.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much total money Katrina's friends made from signing up.",
    "Each of Katrina's 12 friends (5 friends from the first group and 7 friends from the second group) receives $5.00 for signing up.",
    "Therefore, the total money all her friends made is 12 friends \u00d7 $5.00 = $60.00.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total money made by adding together what Katrina and her friends made.",
    "The total amount of money made by Katrina and her friends is $65.00 (Katrina) + $60.00 (friends) = $125.00."
