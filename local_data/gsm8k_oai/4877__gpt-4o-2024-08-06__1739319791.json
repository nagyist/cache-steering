  "query": "Brianna reads two books a month. This year, she was given six new books as a gift, she bought eight new books, and she plans to borrow two fewer new books than she bought from the library. How many of her old books from her old book collection will she have to reread to have two books to read a month this year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of new books Brianna will have this year.",
    "Brianna received six new books as a gift.",
    "Brianna bought eight new books.",
    "Brianna plans to borrow two fewer new books than she bought, so she will borrow 8 - 2 = 6 new books.",
    "Now I add up all the new books: 6 (gifted) + 8 (bought) + 6 (borrowed) = 20 new books in total.",
    "There are 12 months in a year, and Brianna reads two books each month.",
    "This means she needs 12 x 2 = 24 books to read for the year.",
    "She has 20 new books available.",
    "To find out how many old books she needs to reread, I subtract the new books from the total books she needs: 24 - 20 = 4."
