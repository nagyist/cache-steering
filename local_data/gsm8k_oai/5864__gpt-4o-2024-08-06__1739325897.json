  "query": "Before he lost one, Policeman O'Brien had 5 more than twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson. If fire chief Simpson has 15 hats, how many hats does Policeman O'Brien now have?",
  "steps": [
    "Fire chief Simpson has 15 hats.",
    "Twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson would be 2 * 15 = 30 hats.",
    "Policeman O'Brien had 5 more than twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson.",
    "Therefore, Policeman O'Brien originally had 30 + 5 = 35 hats.",
    "It is mentioned Policeman O'Brien lost one hat.",
    "So now, Policeman O'Brien has 35 - 1 = 34 hats."
