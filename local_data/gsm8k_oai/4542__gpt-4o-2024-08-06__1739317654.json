  "query": "James has 3 fish tanks.  1 of the tanks has 20 fish in it and the other two have twice as many fish each as the first. How many total fish do they have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many fish are in the first tank. It is given that the first tank has 20 fish.",
    "Next, I find out how many fish are in each of the other two tanks. It is mentioned that each of these tanks has twice as many fish as the first tank.",
    "Twice as many fish means 2 times the number of fish in the first tank.",
    "So for each of the other two tanks, the number of fish is 2 times 20.",
    "I calculate 2 times 20, which is 40.",
    "Now, I know that each of the other two tanks has 40 fish.",
    "The total number of fish in the three tanks is the fish in the first tank plus the fish in each of the other two tanks.",
    "The total number of fish is 20 (from the first tank) plus 40 (from the second tank) plus 40 (from the third tank).",
    "I add these numbers: 20 + 40 + 40.",
    "20 + 40 is 60.",
    "60 + 40 is 100."

  "solution": "100"
