  "query": "Cheryl is signing up for a golf tournament that costs 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses to enter the tournament. If Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill, which costs $800, calculate the total amount she pays upon signing up for the golf tournament.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses.",
    "I'm given that the electricity bill costs $800.",
    "Cheryl spends $400 more on her monthly cell phone expenses than on the electricity bill.",
    "So, Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses are $800 + $400.",
    "I calculate $800 + $400 = $1200.",
    "Cheryl's monthly cell phone expenses are $1200.",
    "The cost to enter the golf tournament is 20% more than her monthly cell phone expenses.",
    "I will calculate 20% of $1200.",
    "First find 10% of $1200, which is $120.",
    "Then, double $120 to get 20%, which is $240.",
    "I now add the 20% increase to the original monthly cell phone expenses: $1200 + $240.",
    "Adding these gives $1440."

  "solution": "1440"
