  "query": "Lionel went to the grocery store and bought 14 boxes of Graham crackers and 15 packets of Oreos. To make an Oreo cheesecake, Lionel needs 2 boxes of Graham crackers and 3 packets of Oreos. After making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes he can with the ingredients he bought, how many boxes of Graham crackers would he have left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many Oreo cheesecakes Lionel can make with the ingredients he has.",
    "I should check how many cheesecakes can be made with the Graham crackers.",
    "Lionel has 14 boxes of Graham crackers.",
    "Each cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers.",
    "I divide the total boxes of Graham crackers by the number needed per cheesecake: 14 \u00f7 2 = 7 cheesecakes.",
    "Now, I check how many cheesecakes can be made with the Oreos.",
    "Lionel has 15 packets of Oreos.",
    "Each cheesecake requires 3 packets of Oreos.",
    "I divide the total packets of Oreos by the number needed per cheesecake: 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 cheesecakes.",
    "The limiting factor is the number of cheesecakes that can be made, which is the lower number of the two calculations: 5 cheesecakes.",
    "Since Lionel can make 5 cheesecakes, I calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers are used for 5 cheesecakes.",
    "5 cheesecakes x 2 boxes of Graham crackers per cheesecake = 10 boxes of Graham crackers used.",
    "Now, I calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers Lionel has left over.",
    "Starting with 14 boxes and using 10, Lionel has 14 - 10 = 4 boxes of Graham crackers left over."
