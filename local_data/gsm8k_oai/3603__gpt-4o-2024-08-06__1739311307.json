  "query": "Robi and Rudy contributed money to start a business that could earn them profit. Robi contributed $4000, and Rudy contributed 1/4 more money than Robi. If they made a profit of 20 percent of the total amount and decided to share the profits equally, calculate the amount of money each got.",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the amount Rudy contributed.",
    "Rudy contributed 1/4 more than Robi.",
    "Robi contributed $4000.",
    "Calculate 1/4 of Robi's contribution: $4000 * 1/4 = $1000.",
    "Add $1000 to Robi's contribution to find Rudy's contribution: $4000 + $1000 = $5000.",
    "Now, calculate the total contribution from both Robi and Rudy.",
    "Add Robi's and Rudy's contributions: $4000 + $5000 = $9000.",
    "Next, calculate the total profit, which is 20% of the total contribution.",
    "20% of $9000 is $9000 * 0.20 = $1800.",
    "They decided to share the profit equally.",
    "Divide the total profit by 2 to find the profit share for each.",
    "$1800 / 2 = $900.",
    "So, each person receives $900 as their share of the profit."

  "solution": "900"
