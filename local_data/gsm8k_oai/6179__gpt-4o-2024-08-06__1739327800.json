  "query": "Diane shows Sarah a game that deciphers at what age she will marry based on her name and current age. Sarah is 9 years old. The game consists of adding the number of letters in the player's name plus twice the player's age. According to the game, at what age will Sarah get married?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of letters in Sarah's name.",
    "Sarah's name has 5 letters.",
    "Next, I need to consider twice Sarah's age.",
    "Sarah is 9 years old, so twice her age is 9 * 2 = 18.",
    "Now, I will add the number of letters in Sarah's name to twice her age.",
    "5 (letters in name) + 18 (twice her age) = 23."

  "solution": "23"
