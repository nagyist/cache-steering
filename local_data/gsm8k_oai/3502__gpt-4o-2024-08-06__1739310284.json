  "query": "Spike the bearded dragon eats crickets to get protein in his diet. He hunts 5 crickets every morning and three times that over the afternoon and evening, munching on leafy greens and other vegetation in between. How many crickets does Spike hunt per day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider how many crickets Spike hunts in the morning.",
    "Spike hunts 5 crickets every morning.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many crickets Spike hunts in the afternoon and evening.",
    "Spike hunts three times the number of crickets in the afternoon and evening as he does in the morning.",
    "Three times 5 crickets is 5 x 3 = 15 crickets.",
    "Now I can add the morning crickets and the afternoon and evening crickets to find the total number of crickets hunted per day.",
    "5 crickets in the morning + 15 crickets in the afternoon and evening = 20 crickets in total."
