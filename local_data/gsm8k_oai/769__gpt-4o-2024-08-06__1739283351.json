    "The recommended cooking time is 5 minutes.",
    "5 minutes is equivalent to 5 \u00d7 60 = 300 seconds.",
    "Bill put the french fries in the oven for 45 seconds.",
    "To find the remaining cooking time, I need to subtract the time he already cooked them for from the total recommended cooking time.",
    "So, 300 seconds - 45 seconds = 255 seconds."
