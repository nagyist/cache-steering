  "query": "Janice's office is on the third floor, and she has to walk up 3 flights of stairs to get to her office.  In a single day, she goes up the three flights of stairs 5 times, down the the three flights of stairs 3 times, and uses the elevator the remainder of the time.  How many flights of stairs does Janice walk (up and down) in a single day?",
  "steps": [
    "Each time Janice walks up to her office, she walks up 3 flights of stairs.",
    "Janice walks up the stairs 5 times in a day.",
    "To find the total flights of stairs she walks up in a day, multiply the number of times she walks up by the number of flights per trip: 3 flights x 5 times = 15 flights.",
    "Each time Janice walks down from her office, she walks down 3 flights of stairs.",
    "Janice walks down the stairs 3 times in a day.",
    "To calculate the total flights of stairs she walks down in a day, multiply the number of times she walks down by the number of flights per trip: 3 flights x 3 times = 9 flights.",
    "To find the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a day, add the flights walked up to the flights walked down: 15 flights up + 9 flights down = 24 flights."
