  "query": "Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone.",
    "I need to find out how long it would take Moe to eat 1 piece of cuttlebone.",
    "To find the time for 1 piece, I divide the time for 40 pieces by 40.",
    "10 seconds for 40 pieces means 10/40 seconds per piece.",
    "Calculating 10/40 gives 0.25 seconds per piece.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it takes to eat 800 pieces.",
    "To find the total time for 800 pieces, I multiply the time per piece by 800.",
    "0.25 seconds per piece times 800 pieces is 0.25 * 800.",
    "Calculating 0.25 * 800 gives 200 seconds."

  "solution": "200"
