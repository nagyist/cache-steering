  "query": "There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?",
  "steps": [
    "I start with the total number of crayons, which is 120.",
    "I need to find out how many crayons are new. One third of the crayons are new.",
    "To find one third, I divide 120 by 3.",
    "120 \u00f7 3 = 40, so there are 40 new crayons.",
    "Next, I find out how many crayons are broken. 20% of the crayons are broken.",
    "To find 20% of 120, I multiply 120 by 0.20.",
    "120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24, so there are 24 broken crayons.",
    "Now, I need to find how many crayons are slightly used.",
    "To find the number of slightly used crayons, I subtract the number of new crayons and the number of broken crayons from the total.",
    "Total slightly used crayons = Total crayons - New crayons - Broken crayons.",
    "Total slightly used crayons = 120 - 40 - 24.",
    "120 - 40 = 80, and 80 - 24 = 56."

  "solution": "56"
