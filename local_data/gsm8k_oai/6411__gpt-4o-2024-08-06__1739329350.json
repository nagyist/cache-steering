  "query": "Rebecca makes her own earrings out of buttons, magnets, and gemstones.  For every earring, she uses two magnets, half as many buttons as magnets, and three times as many gemstones as buttons.  If Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings, how many gemstones will she need?",
  "steps": [
    "To start, I must determine how many magnets Rebecca uses per earring.",
    "According to the problem, Rebecca uses 2 magnets per earring.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many buttons Rebecca uses per earring.",
    "Rebecca uses half as many buttons as magnets per earring.",
    "Since she uses 2 magnets, she will use 2 / 2 = 1 button per earring.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many gemstones Rebecca uses per earring.",
    "Rebecca uses three times as many gemstones as buttons per earring.",
    "Since she uses 1 button per earring, she will use 1 * 3 = 3 gemstones per earring.",
    "Next, I must determine the total number of earrings Rebecca makes when she creates 4 sets.",
    "Typically, each set consists of 2 earrings, so 4 sets would have 4 * 2 = 8 earrings in total.",
    "Now, I must calculate the total number of gemstones needed for 8 earrings.",
    "Rebecca needs 3 gemstones per earring, so for 8 earrings, she will require 8 * 3 = 24 gemstones."

  "solution": "24"
