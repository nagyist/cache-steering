  "query": "Michael scored 260 points during his junior year on the school basketball team. He scored 20% more points during his senior year. How many points did he score during both years?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many points Michael scored during his senior year.",
    "Michael scored 20% more points during his senior year compared to his junior year.",
    "To find 20% of the points scored during his junior year, I calculate 20% of 260.",
    "20% of 260 is calculated as: 0.20 * 260 = 52.",
    "To find the total points scored during his senior year, I add the 20% increase to the original junior year score.",
    "So, senior year points = 260 + 52 = 312.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total points scored across both years.",
    "I add the points scored during the junior and senior years: 260 + 312.",
    "The total points scored during both years is 572."

  "solution": "572"
