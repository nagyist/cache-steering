  "query": "There were 349 pieces of candy in a bowl. Talitha took 108 pieces and Solomon took 153 pieces. How many pieces of candy remain in the bowl?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total number of pieces of candy taken from the bowl.",
    "Talitha took 108 pieces, and Solomon took 153 pieces.",
    "I will add the candies taken by Talitha and Solomon to find the total amount taken.",
    "108 + 153 = 261",
    "Now, I need to subtract the total number of candies taken from the initial number of candies in the bowl to find out how many remain.",
    "The initial number of candies in the bowl was 349.",
    "So I calculate 349 - 261.",
    "349 - 261 = 88"

  "solution": "88"
