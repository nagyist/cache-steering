  "query": "There are some jelly beans in a jar. Three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. If 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are there in the jar?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by identifying the fraction of red jelly beans that are coconut flavored.",
    "One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.",
    "We are given that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored.",
    "Since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, we can set up an equation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Red jelly beans} = 750 \\).",
    "To find the total number of red jelly beans, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4.",
    "Total red jelly beans = \\( 750 \\times 4 = 3000 \\).",
    "According to the problem, three fourths of the jelly beans are red.",
    "We can express this as: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Total jelly beans} = 3000 \\).",
    "To find the total number of jelly beans, set up the equation: \\( \\text{Total jelly beans} = \\frac{3000}{\\frac{3}{4}} \\).",
    "Simplify the division: \\( \\text{Total jelly beans} = 3000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\).",
    "Calculate: \\( 3000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4000 \\)."
