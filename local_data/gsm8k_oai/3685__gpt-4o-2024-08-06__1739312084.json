  "query": "85 paper stars are required to fill a glass jar. Luke has already made 33 stars, but he needs to fill 4 bottles. How many more stars must Luke make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many stars are needed to fill one bottle. 85 stars are required to fill one jar or bottle.",
    "Luke needs to fill 4 bottles. So, I will multiply the number of stars needed for one bottle by 4 to get the total number of stars needed.",
    "85 stars per bottle multiplied by 4 bottles equals 340 stars in total.",
    "Luke has already made 33 stars. So, I need to subtract the 33 stars from the total number needed, 340.",
    "340 stars needed minus 33 stars already made equals 307 stars."

  "solution": "307"
