  "query": "A pool has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles. If the pool needs 100 tiles to be completed, how many more tiles are needed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of tiles the pool currently has.",
    "The pool has 48 blue tiles and 32 red tiles.",
    "I add the number of blue tiles and the number of red tiles together: 48 + 32.",
    "48 + 32 equals 80.",
    "The pool currently has 80 tiles in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tiles are needed to complete the pool.",
    "The pool needs 100 tiles to be completed.",
    "I subtract the number of tiles the pool currently has (80) from the total needed (100).",
    "100 - 80 equals 20.",
    "20 more tiles are needed to complete the pool."
