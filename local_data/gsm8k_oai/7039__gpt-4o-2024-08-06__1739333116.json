  "query": "Jerry can run from his house to his school and back in the time it takes his brother Carson to run to the school. If it takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip from his house to his school and the school is 4 miles away, how fast does Carson run in miles per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerry takes 15 minutes for one trip from his house to school.",
    "Since Jerry can run to the school and back in the time Carson runs to the school, Jerry's total round trip time is equal to Carson's one-way trip time.",
    "For a round trip, Jerry takes 15 minutes to go to school and 15 minutes to return home, totaling 30 minutes.",
    "Therefore, it takes Carson 30 minutes for his one-way trip to the school.",
    "The school is 4 miles away from Jerry's house.",
    "Carson covers 4 miles in 30 minutes.",
    "To find Carson's speed in miles per hour, I need to know how many miles he runs in one hour.",
    "30 minutes is half an hour.",
    "If Carson runs 4 miles in 30 minutes, then in 1 hour (or 60 minutes), he would run twice that distance.",
    "4 miles * 2 = 8 miles in one hour."

  "solution": "8"
