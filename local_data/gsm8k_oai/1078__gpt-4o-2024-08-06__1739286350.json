  "query": "The centerpieces at Glenda\u2019s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of tables with 2 fish each.",
    "Since there are 32 tables in total, and one table has 3 fish, this means 31 tables have 2 fish each.",
    "Calculate the total number of fish for these 31 tables by multiplying 31 by 2.",
    "31 multiplied by 2 equals 62.",
    "Next, calculate the number of fish on the table with 3 fish.",
    "The table with 3 fish has, obviously, 3 fish on it.",
    "Now, add the totals from the 31 tables and the table with 3 fish.",
    "62 (from the 31 tables) plus 3 (from the table with 3 fish) equals 65."
