  "query": "Bran's tuition fee is $90. He does a part-time job that pays him $15 per month and he has a scholarship that takes care of 30% of his tuition fee. If he needs to pay his tuition fee within 3 months, how much does Bran still need to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "Bran's total tuition fee is $90.",
    "The scholarship covers 30% of his tuition fee.",
    "To find out how much the scholarship covers, calculate 30% of $90.",
    "30% of $90 is calculated as (30/100) * $90 = $27.",
    "So, the scholarship covers $27 of the tuition fee.",
    "To find out how much Bran still needs to pay, subtract the scholarship amount from the total tuition fee: $90 - $27 = $63.",
    "Bran's part-time job pays him $15 per month.",
    "Bran has 3 months to pay the remaining tuition fee amount.",
    "In 3 months, he will earn $15 * 3 = $45 from his part-time job.",
    "Subtract the amount he earns from his job in 3 months from the remaining tuition amount: $63 - $45 = $18.",
    "Therefore, Bran still needs to pay $18 to cover his tuition fee after accounting for his scholarship and earnings from his part-time job."
