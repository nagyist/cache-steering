  "steps": [
    "Sue has 48 nuts.",
    "Harry has twice as many nuts as Sue.",
    "To find out how many nuts Harry has, I multiply the number of nuts Sue has by 2.",
    "Harry has 48 \u00d7 2 = 96 nuts.",
    "Bill has 6 times as many nuts as Harry.",
    "To find out how many nuts Bill has, I multiply the number of nuts Harry has by 6.",
    "Bill has 96 \u00d7 6 = 576 nuts.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of nuts Bill and Harry have combined.",
    "I add the number of nuts Bill has to the number of nuts Harry has.",
