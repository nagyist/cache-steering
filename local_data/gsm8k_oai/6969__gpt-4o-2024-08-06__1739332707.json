  "query": "Turner wants to ride the rollercoaster 3 times, the Catapult 2 times and the Ferris wheel once. It costs 4 tickets to ride the rollercoaster, 4 tickets to ride the Catapult and 1 ticket to ride the Ferris wheel. How many tickets does Turner need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many tickets are needed for Turner to ride the rollercoaster 3 times.",
    "The rollercoaster costs 4 tickets per ride.",
    "Therefore, for 3 rides, Turner needs 3 x 4 tickets.",
    "3 x 4 equals 12.",
    "Turner needs 12 tickets for the rollercoaster rides.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many tickets are needed for Turner to ride the Catapult 2 times.",
    "The Catapult costs 4 tickets per ride.",
    "Therefore, for 2 rides, Turner needs 2 x 4 tickets.",
    "2 x 4 equals 8.",
    "Turner needs 8 tickets for the Catapult rides.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many tickets are needed for Turner to ride the Ferris wheel once.",
    "The Ferris wheel costs 1 ticket per ride.",
    "For 1 ride, Turner needs 1 ticket.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the tickets needed for each ride.",
    "Turner needs 12 tickets for the rollercoaster, 8 tickets for the Catapult, and 1 ticket for the Ferris wheel.",
    "12 + 8 + 1 equals 21.",
    "Turner needs a total of 21 tickets."
