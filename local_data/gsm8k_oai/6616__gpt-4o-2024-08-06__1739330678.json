  "query": "In Grade 4, there are two sections -- Diligence and Industry. The two sections have an equal number of students after 2 students were transferred from section Industry to Diligence. How many students were there in section Diligence before the transfer if, in both sections combined, there are a total of 50 students?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the original number of students in section Diligence be D.",
    "Let the original number of students in section Industry be I.",
    "We know that D + I = 50 because the total number of students in both sections is 50.",
    "After transferring 2 students from section Industry to section Diligence, the number of students in section Diligence becomes D + 2.",
    "And the number of students in section Industry becomes I - 2.",
    "After the transfer, the number of students in both sections is equal. So, D + 2 = I - 2.",
    "Now, we have two equations:\n1. D + I = 50\n2. D + 2 = I - 2",
    "From equation 2, we can express I in terms of D: I = D + 4.",
    "Now substitute I = D + 4 into equation 1: D + (D + 4) = 50.",
    "Simplify the equation: 2D + 4 = 50.",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides: 2D = 46.",
    "Divide by 2: D = 23."

  "solution": "23"
