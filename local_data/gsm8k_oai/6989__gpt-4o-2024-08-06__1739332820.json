  "query": "An artist spends 30 hours every week painting. If it takes her 3 hours to complete a painting, how many paintings can she make in four weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of hours the artist spends painting in four weeks.",
    "She spends 30 hours every week painting.",
    "Over four weeks, she would paint for 30 hours/week * 4 weeks.",
    "30 * 4 = 120 hours total over four weeks.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many paintings she can make with these 120 hours.",
    "It takes her 3 hours to complete one painting.",
    "To find out how many paintings she can complete in 120 hours, calculate 120 hours / 3 hours per painting.",
    "120 / 3 = 40 paintings."
