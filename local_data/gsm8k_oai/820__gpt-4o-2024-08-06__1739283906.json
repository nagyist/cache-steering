  "query": "James goes out to eat.  He orders a steak and egg meal for $16.  He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total bill amount before the tip is added.",
    "James's meal costs $16.",
    "His friend's meal costs $14.",
    "Adding these together, the total bill is $16 + $14 = $30.",
    "Next, I calculate the tip amount. The tip is 20% of the total bill.",
    "20% of $30 can be calculated as 0.20 x $30 = $6.",
    "I add the tip to the total bill to find the total amount they need to pay.",
    "The total amount including tip is $30 + $6 = $36.",
    "Since his friend pays for half the bill, I need to determine James's share of the bill.",
    "Half of the total bill ($30) is $30 / 2 = $15.",
    "James is responsible for paying his half of the bill plus the entire tip.",
    "So, James pays $15 (half of the bill) + $6 (the tip) = $21."

  "solution": "21"
