  "query": "There are 4 puppies and 3 dogs at a camp. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, what would be the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how much food one dog eats in a day.",
    "Since one dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, one dog eats a total of 4 pounds * 3 times = 12 pounds per day.",
    "There are 3 dogs at the camp, so the total food consumed by dogs is 12 pounds/dog per day * 3 dogs = 36 pounds a day.",
    "Next, let's find out how much food one puppy eats in a day.",
    "Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, meaning one puppy eats 4 pounds / 2 = 2 pounds per meal.",
    "Puppies eat three times as often as dogs. Since dogs eat 3 times a day, a puppy eats 3 times * 3 (since puppies eat three times more often) = 9 times a day.",
    "Therefore, each puppy eats 2 pounds/meal * 9 meals = 18 pounds per day.",
    "There are 4 puppies, so the total food consumed by puppies is 18 pounds/puppy per day * 4 puppies = 72 pounds a day.",
    "The total amount of food the dogs and the puppies eat in a day is the sum of the food consumed by dogs and puppies.",
    "Adding the food consumed by dogs (36 pounds) and puppies (72 pounds), the total food consumed is 36 pounds + 72 pounds = 108 pounds a day."
