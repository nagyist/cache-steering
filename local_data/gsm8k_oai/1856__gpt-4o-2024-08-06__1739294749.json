  "query": "Danny brings 3 watermelons to his family picnic. He cuts each watermelon into 10 slices. His sister brings 1 watermelon to the family picnic, and she cuts the watermelon into 15 slices. How many watermelon slices are there in total at the picnic?",
  "steps": [
    "Danny brings 3 watermelons.",
    "Each of Danny's watermelons is cut into 10 slices.",
    "To find the total number of slices from Danny's watermelons, I multiply 3 watermelons by 10 slices per watermelon.",
    "3 watermelons * 10 slices/watermelon = 30 slices.",
    "Danny's sister brings 1 watermelon.",
    "Her watermelon is cut into 15 slices.",
    "I need to find the total number of slices from Danny's sister's watermelon, which is just 1 watermelon * 15 slices.",
    "1 watermelon * 15 slices/watermelon = 15 slices.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of watermelon slices at the picnic by adding the slices Danny brought and the slices his sister brought.",
    "The total number of slices is 30 from Danny + 15 from his sister.",
    "30 slices + 15 slices = 45 slices."
