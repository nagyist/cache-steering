  "query": "On a tough week, Haji's mother sells goods worth $800, which is half the amount she sells on a good week. What's the total amount of money she makes if she has 5 good weeks and 3 tough weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Haji's mother makes in a good week.",
    "I know that in a tough week, she sells goods worth $800.",
    "According to the problem, this $800 is half the amount she sells in a good week.",
    "To find out how much she sells in a good week, I need to double the $800.",
    "$800 * 2 = $1600, so in a good week she sells $1600 worth of goods.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total amount she makes in the good weeks.",
    "She has 5 good weeks, and in each she sells $1600 worth of goods.",
    "5 good weeks * $1600 per week = $8000",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total amount she makes in the tough weeks.",
    "She has 3 tough weeks, and in each she sells $800 worth of goods.",
    "3 tough weeks * $800 per week = $2400",
    "To find the total amount of money she makes, I need to add the amounts from the good weeks and the tough weeks.",
    "$8000 (good weeks) + $2400 (tough weeks) = $10400"
  ],
  "solution": "10400"
