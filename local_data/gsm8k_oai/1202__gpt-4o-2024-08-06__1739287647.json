  "query": "A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment.",
    "The rent for the first apartment is $800 per month.",
    "The utilities for the first apartment add an additional $260 per month.",
    "The total rent and utilities cost for the first apartment is $800 + $260 = $1060.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of driving for the first apartment.",
    "The man will drive 31 miles per day for 20 days, which results in a total of 31 miles/day * 20 days = 620 miles per month.",
    "The cost per mile according to the IRS is 58 cents, or $0.58.",
    "The total driving cost for the first apartment is 620 miles * $0.58/mile = $359.60.",
    "I will combine the costs of rent, utilities, and driving for the first apartment.",
    "The total monthly cost for the first apartment is $1060 (rent and utilities) + $359.60 (driving) = $1419.60.",
    "I need to calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment similarly.",
    "The rent for the second apartment is $900 per month.",
    "The utilities for the second apartment add an additional $200 per month.",
    "The total rent and utilities cost for the second apartment is $900 + $200 = $1100.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of driving for the second apartment.",
    "The man will drive 21 miles per day for 20 days, which results in a total of 21 miles/day * 20 days = 420 miles per month.",
    "Using the cost per mile (58 cents), the total driving cost for the second apartment is 420 miles * $0.58/mile = $243.60.",
    "I will combine the costs of rent, utilities, and driving for the second apartment.",
    "The total monthly cost for the second apartment is $1100 (rent and utilities) + $243.60 (driving) = $1343.60.",
    "Finally, I need to find the difference in the total monthly costs between the two apartments.",
    "The difference is $1419.60 (first apartment) - $1343.60 (second apartment) = $76."
