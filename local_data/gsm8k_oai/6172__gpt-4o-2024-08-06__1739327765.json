  "query": "Jimmy has 18 cards. Jimmy gives three cards to Bob. If Jimmy gives Mary twice as many cards as he gave to Bob, how many cards does Jimmy have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Jimmy starts with 18 cards.",
    "Jimmy gives 3 cards to Bob.",
    "To find out how many cards Jimmy has left after giving cards to Bob, I subtract the 3 cards given from the original 18 cards.",
    "18 - 3 = 15 cards remaining after giving cards to Bob.",
    "Now, Jimmy gives Mary twice as many cards as he gave Bob.",
    "He gave 3 cards to Bob, so 3 * 2 = 6 cards are given to Mary.",
    "To find out how many cards Jimmy has left after giving cards to both Bob and Mary, I subtract the 6 cards given to Mary from the 15 cards remaining.",
    "15 - 6 = 9 cards remaining."
