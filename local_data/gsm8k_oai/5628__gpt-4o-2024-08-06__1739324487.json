  "query": "Mr. Desmond bought three times as many toys for his younger son as he bought for his elder son. If the elder son received 60 toys, how many toys did Mr Desmond buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many toys Mr. Desmond bought for his elder son.",
    "The elder son received a total of 60 toys.",
    "Now, let's find out how many toys were bought for the younger son.",
    "According to the problem, the younger son received three times as many toys as the elder son.",
    "So, the number of toys bought for the younger son is \\(3 \\times 60\\).",
    "Let's calculate \\(3 \\times 60\\).",
    "\\(3 \\times 60 = 180\\).",
    "Now we know that the younger son received 180 toys.",
    "To find the total number of toys Mr. Desmond bought, we need to add the toys bought for both sons.",
    "The total number of toys is \\(60 + 180\\).",
    "Let's calculate \\(60 + 180\\).",
    "\\(60 + 180 = 240\\)."

  "solution": "240"
