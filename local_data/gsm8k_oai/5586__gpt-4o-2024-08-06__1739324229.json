  "query": "There are 400 students in a local high school. 50 percent are freshmen or sophomores.  1/5 of freshmen and sophomores own a pet.  How many freshmen and sophomores do not own a pet?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the total number of students in the high school is 400.",
    "I need to find out how many students are freshmen or sophomores.",
    "I am told that 50 percent of the students are freshmen or sophomores.",
    "To find the number of freshmen and sophomores, I take 50 percent of 400.",
    "Calculating 50 percent of 400 gives me 0.5 * 400 = 200.",
    "So, there are 200 freshmen and sophomores.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these freshmen and sophomores own a pet.",
    "I am told that 1/5 of the freshmen and sophomores own a pet.",
    "To find out how many freshmen and sophomores own a pet, I need to calculate 1/5 of 200.",
    "1/5 of 200 is calculated as 200 / 5 = 40.",
    "So, 40 freshmen and sophomores own a pet.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many freshmen and sophomores do not own a pet.",
    "If 40 own a pet, then the number who do not own a pet is 200 - 40.",
    "Calculating 200 - 40 gives me 160."

  "solution": "160"
