  "query": "Mark just got a new puppy that cost $10. He also bought enough food for 3 weeks. He knows the puppy eats 1/3 cup of food a day. A bag of food with 3.5 cups costs $2. How much did all of this cost him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much food Mark needs for 3 weeks.",
    "A week has 7 days, so 3 weeks have 21 days.",
    "The puppy eats 1/3 cup of food per day.",
    "Multiply 1/3 cup per day by 21 days to find the total amount of food needed.",
    "1/3 cup/day * 21 days = 21/3 = 7 cups of food.",
    "Next, determine how many bags of food Mark needs.",
    "Each bag contains 3.5 cups.",
    "Mark needs 7 cups of food, and each bag has 3.5 cups.",
    "Divide the total cups needed (7) by the number of cups per bag (3.5).",
    "7 cups / 3.5 cups/bag = 2 bags.",
    "Each bag of food costs $2.",
    "Multiply 2 bags by $2 per bag to find the total cost of the food.",
    "2 bags * $2/bag = $4 for food.",
    "Add the cost of the puppy to the cost of the food.",
    "The puppy cost $10, and the food costs $4.",
    "$10 + $4 = $14."

  "solution": "14"
