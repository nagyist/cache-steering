    "Tate initially has 32 tickets.",
    "Tate buys 2 more tickets.",
    "Tate's total number of tickets is now 32 + 2 = 34.",
    "Peyton has half as many tickets as Tate.",

    "To find the total number of tickets Tate and Peyton have together, I add their tickets.",
    "34 (Tate's tickets) + 17 (Peyton's tickets) = 51."
