  "query": "Nadine went to a garage sale and spent $56. She bought a table for $34 and 2 chairs. Each chair cost the same amount. How much did one chair cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Nadine bought a table for $34.",
    "She also bought 2 chairs, and each chair cost the same amount.",
    "Nadine spent a total of $56 at the garage sale.",
    "To find out how much she spent on the chairs, I need to subtract the cost of the table from the total amount spent.",
    "$56 (total amount) - $34 (cost of the table) = $22.",
    "The total cost of the two chairs is $22.",
    "Since there are 2 chairs and each cost the same amount, I need to divide the total cost of the chairs by 2.",
    "$22 / 2 = $11."
