  "query": "A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much I save on one gallon of milk.",
    "The regular price of one gallon of milk is $3.",
    "The discounted price of one gallon of milk is $2.",
    "The savings per gallon of milk is $3 - $2 = $1.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total savings on 3 gallons of milk.",
    "The savings per gallon is $1.",
    "For 3 gallons, the savings is 3 x $1 = $3.",
    "Now, I need to find out the savings on one box of cereal.",
    "The discount on one box of cereal is $1.",
    "Then, I need to calculate the total savings on 5 boxes of cereal.",
    "The savings per box of cereal is $1.",
    "For 5 boxes, the savings is 5 x $1 = $5.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate the total savings from both the milk and cereal.",
    "The total savings from the milk is $3.",
    "The total savings from the cereal is $5.",
    "The combined savings is $3 (milk) + $5 (cereal) = $8."

  "solution": "8"
