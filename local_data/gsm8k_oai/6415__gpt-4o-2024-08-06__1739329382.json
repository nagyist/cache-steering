  "query": "There was only enough room for 21 people on a raft if no one wore life jackets. There were 7 fewer people who could fit on the raft if everyone wore life jackets. If 8 people on the raft needed life jackets, how many people could fit on the raft?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how many people can fit on the raft if everyone wears life jackets.",
    "The problem states that 7 fewer people can fit on the raft if everyone wears life jackets, compared to if no one wears life jackets.",
    "Since 21 people can fit without life jackets, this means 21 - 7 = 14 people can fit with everyone wearing life jackets.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many people can fit if 8 people are wearing life jackets.",
    "Each life jacket reduces the capacity by 7 divided by 21, which is a reduction of 1 person for every 3 life jackets, approximately.",
    "I understand that it cannot be fractional, so I'll aim for a direct deduction approach instead.",
    "In the scenario where everyone (14 people) wears a life jacket, the capacity is decreased by 7 people.",
    "Thus, wearing life jackets reduces the capacity by 1 person for every 2 life jacket users, effectively.",
    "With 8 people wearing life jackets, I need to determine the corresponding decrease in capacity.",
    "If 2 life jacket users means a reduction of 1 capacity, then 8 life jacket users means a reduction of 8/2 = 4 capacities.",
    "Therefore, the raft can accommodate 21 - 4 = 17 people when 8 people are wearing life jackets."
