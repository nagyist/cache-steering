  "query": "Adam bought 15 apples on Monday. On Tuesday he bought 3 times that quantity. On Wednesday he bought 4 times the quantity he bought on Tuesday. What is the total quantity Adam bought on these three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many apples Adam bought on Tuesday.",
    "He bought 3 times the quantity he bought on Monday.",
    "On Monday, Adam bought 15 apples.",
    "Thus, on Tuesday he bought 3 times 15 apples.",
    "3 times 15 equals 45.",
    "So, Adam bought 45 apples on Tuesday.",
    "Next, I determine how many apples Adam bought on Wednesday.",
    "He bought 4 times the quantity he bought on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday, Adam bought 45 apples.",
    "Thus, on Wednesday he bought 4 times 45 apples.",
    "4 times 45 equals 180.",
    "So, Adam bought 180 apples on Wednesday.",
    "Now I add up the total quantity of apples bought over the three days.",
    "On Monday, he bought 15 apples, on Tuesday 45 apples, and on Wednesday 180 apples.",
    "I add 15, 45, and 180 together.",
    "15 plus 45 equals 60.",
    "60 plus 180 equals 240.",
    "So, Adam bought a total of 240 apples over the three days."
