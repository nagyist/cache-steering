  "query": "Caleb, Andy and Billy went on a picnic with their father. Billy took 6 candies with him, Caleb took 11 and Andy left with 9. On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate how many candies each child started with before their father gave them more.",
    "Billy initially had 6 candies.",
    "Caleb initially had 11 candies.",
    "Andy initially had 9 candies.",
    "Next, their father bought a packet of 36 candies.",
    "Out of these 36 candies, the father gave 8 candies to Billy.",
    "Therefore, Billy now has 6 + 8 = 14 candies.",
    "The father gave 11 candies to Caleb.",
    "Therefore, Caleb now has 11 + 11 = 22 candies.",
    "Now, find out how many candies the father gave to Andy.",
    "Total candies were 36. After giving 8 to Billy and 11 to Caleb, he has handed out 8 + 11 = 19 candies.",
    "This means Andy will get 36 - 19 = 17 candies from the pack.",
    "Andy initially had 9 candies, so now he has 9 + 17 = 26 candies.",
    "Now, let's find how many more candies Andy has than Caleb.",
    "Andy has 26 candies, and Caleb has 22 candies.",
    "The difference is 26 - 22 = 4 candies."
