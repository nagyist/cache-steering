  "query": "There are two babysitters named Mila and Agnes. Mila makes $10 an hour while Agnes makes $15 an hour. Agnes works 8 hours each week. How many hours does Mila need to work to earn as much as Agnes in a month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Agnes earns in one week.",
    "Agnes makes $15 per hour and she works 8 hours per week.",
    "To find her weekly earnings: 15 dollars/hour * 8 hours = 120 dollars.",
    "Agnes earns $120 per week.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how much Agnes earns in a month.",
    "There are typically 4 weeks in a month.",
    "To find Agnes's monthly earnings: 120 dollars/week * 4 weeks = 480 dollars.",
    "Agnes earns $480 in a month.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many hours Mila needs to work to earn $480.",
    "Mila earns $10 per hour.",
    "To find out how many hours Mila needs to work: 480 dollars / 10 dollars/hour = 48 hours."
