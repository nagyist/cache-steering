  "query": "Tommy goes for a run around his neighborhood and decides to calculate how many wheels he saw. All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many wheels are on all the trucks Tommy saw.",
    "Each truck has 4 wheels.",
    "Tommy saw 12 trucks.",
    "To find the total number of wheels on the trucks, I multiply the number of trucks by the number of wheels per truck.",
    "12 trucks * 4 wheels per truck = 48 wheels from trucks.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many wheels are on all the cars Tommy saw.",
    "Each car also has 4 wheels.",
    "Tommy saw 13 cars.",
    "To find the total number of wheels on the cars, I multiply the number of cars by the number of wheels per car.",
    "13 cars * 4 wheels per car = 52 wheels from cars.",
    "Now, I have to find the total number of wheels Tommy saw, which is the sum of the wheels from trucks and cars.",
    "Total wheels = 48 wheels from trucks + 52 wheels from cars.",
    "48 + 52 = 100."

  "solution": "100"
