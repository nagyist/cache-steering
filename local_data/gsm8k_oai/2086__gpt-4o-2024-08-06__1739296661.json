  "query": "A jewelry store is restocking its shelves. The necklace stand, which can hold 12 necklaces, currently holds 5 necklaces. The ring display, which can hold 30 rings, currently holds 18 rings. The bracelet display, which can hold 15 bracelets, currently holds 8 bracelets. The store\u2019s supplier charges $4 per necklace, $10 per ring, and $5 per bracelet. How much, in dollars, will the store need to pay to fill the displays?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many more necklaces are required to fill the necklace stand.",
    "The necklace stand can hold 12 necklaces, and currently holds 5.",
    "So, the number of additional necklaces needed is 12 - 5 = 7.",
    "Next, I calculate how many more rings are needed for the ring display.",
    "The ring display can hold 30 rings, and it currently holds 18.",
    "Therefore, the number of additional rings needed is 30 - 18 = 12.",
    "Now, I determine how many more bracelets are needed for the bracelet display.",
    "The bracelet display can hold 15 bracelets, and currently holds 8.",
    "Hence, the number of additional bracelets needed is 15 - 8 = 7.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost to fill the displays with the additional items.",
    "Each additional necklace costs $4, and I need 7 necklaces.",
    "The total cost for the necklaces is 7 * 4 = $28.",
    "Each additional ring costs $10, and I need 12 rings.",
    "The total cost for the rings is 12 * 10 = $120.",
    "Each additional bracelet costs $5, and I need 7 bracelets.",
    "The total cost for the bracelets is 7 * 5 = $35.",
    "Now, I add the costs for the necklaces, rings, and bracelets to find the total cost.",
    "The total cost is $28 + $120 + $35 = $183."

  "solution": "183"
