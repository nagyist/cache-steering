  "query": "Marcus, Humphrey, and Darrel are bird watching. Marcus sees 7 birds, Humphrey sees 11 birds, and Darrel sees 9 birds. How many birds does each of them see on average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It wants the average number of birds seen by Marcus, Humphrey, and Darrel.",
    "To find the average, I need to sum up the total number of birds seen by the three of them.",
    "Marcus sees 7 birds.",
    "Humphrey sees 11 birds.",
    "Darrel sees 9 birds.",
    "I will add these numbers together: 7 + 11 + 9.",
    "7 + 11 equals 18.",
    "18 + 9 equals 27.",
    "The total number of birds seen by all three is 27.",
    "Now, I need to find the average number of birds seen. There are 3 people.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of birds by the number of people: 27 divided by 3.",
    "27 divided by 3 equals 9."
