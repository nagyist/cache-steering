  "query": "A one-year subscription to a newspaper is offered with a 45% discount. How much does the discounted subscription cost if a subscription normally costs $80?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's understand the problem clearly. We have a normal subscription price of $80.",
    "We are given a discount of 45% on this subscription price.",
    "To find out the amount discounted, we need to calculate 45% of $80.",
    "First, I will convert the percentage to a decimal. 45% is the same as 0.45 in decimal form.",
    "Next, I will multiply the normal price by the discount rate to find the discount amount. So, $80 multiplied by 0.45 gives us the discount value.",
    "80 * 0.45 = 36. This means the discount amount is $36.",
    "Now, to find the discounted subscription cost, I will subtract the discount from the original price.",
    "80 - 36 = 44. So, the discounted subscription costs $44."

  "solution": "44"
