    "Quinton brought 40 cupcakes to school.",
    "He gave 1 cupcake to each of the 18 students in Ms. Delmont's class.",
    "He gave away 18 cupcakes to Ms. Delmont's class.",

    "He gave away 16 cupcakes to Mrs. Donnelly's class.",
    "He also gave a cupcake to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal.",
    "This means he gave away 1 cupcake to each of those 4 additional people.",
    "In total, he gave 4 cupcakes to Ms. Delmont, Mrs. Donnelly, the school nurse, and the school principal.",
    "The total number of cupcakes given away is 18 (Ms. Delmont's class) + 16 (Mrs. Donnelly's class) + 4 (teachers, nurse, principal).",
    "18 + 16 + 4 = 38 cupcakes given away.",
    "Originally, Quinton had 40 cupcakes.",
    "He gave away 38 cupcakes.",
    "To find out how many cupcakes he had left, subtract the cupcakes given away from the total he brought.",
