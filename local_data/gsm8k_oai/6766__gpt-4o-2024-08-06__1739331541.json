  "query": "Miriam has five times as many albums as Katrina. Katrina has six times the number of albums as Bridget. Bridget has 15 fewer albums than Adele. How many albums do they have together if Adele has 30 albums?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many albums Bridget has. I know that Bridget has 15 fewer albums than Adele.",
    "Adele has 30 albums. So, Bridget has \\(30 - 15\\) albums.",
    "\\[30 - 15 = 15\\]",
    "Bridget has 15 albums.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many albums Katrina has. Katrina has six times the number of albums as Bridget.",
    "Since Bridget has 15 albums, Katrina has \\(6 \\times 15\\) albums.",
    "\\[6 \\times 15 = 90\\]",
    "Katrina has 90 albums.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many albums Miriam has. Miriam has five times as many albums as Katrina.",
    "Katrina has 90 albums, so Miriam has \\(5 \\times 90\\) albums.",
    "\\[5 \\times 90 = 450\\]",
    "Miriam has 450 albums.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of albums the four of them have together.",
    "Adele has 30 albums, Bridget has 15 albums, Katrina has 90 albums, and Miriam has 450 albums.",
    "I add all these albums together: \\(30 + 15 + 90 + 450\\).",
    "\\[30 + 15 = 45\\]",
    "\\[45 + 90 = 135\\]",
    "\\[135 + 450 = 585\\]"
  ],
  "solution": "585"
