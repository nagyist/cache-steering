  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of bags of chips already bought by Jeremy and Stacy.",
    "Jeremy buys 3 bags.",
    "Stacy buys 4 bags.",
    "Adding them together, Jeremy and Stacy have 3 + 4 = 7 bags of chips.",
    "They need a total of 10 bags for the party.",
    "To find out how many more bags are needed, subtract the bags already bought from the total needed: 10 - 7 = 3.",
    "Emily needs to buy the remaining bags of chips."
