  "query": "Mark wants to tip his server 20% on a $200 check. If his friend agrees to kick in $10, how much should Mark add?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate what 20% of $200 is.",
    "To find 20% of $200, I can multiply 200 by 0.2.",
    "200 * 0.2 equals 40.",
    "So, a 20% tip on $200 is $40.",
    "Mark's friend is contributing $10 towards the tip.",
    "I need to subtract the $10 contribution from the total tip amount of $40.",
    "$40 minus $10 equals $30.",
    "Therefore, Mark should add $30 to the check."

  "solution": "30"
