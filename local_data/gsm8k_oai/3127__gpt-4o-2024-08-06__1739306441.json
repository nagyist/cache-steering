  "query": "Matt is four times as old as Fem. Currently, Fem is 11 years old. In two years, what is the sum of the ages of Matt and Fem?",
  "steps": [
    "Fem's current age is given as 11 years.",
    "Matt is four times as old as Fem, so I must calculate 4 times 11.",
    "4 times 11 is 44. So, Matt is currently 44 years old.",
    "The question asks for their ages in two years.",
    "Fem's age in two years will be 11 plus 2, which is 13 years.",
    "Matt's age in two years will be 44 plus 2, which is 46 years.",
    "I need to find the sum of their ages in two years, so I add 13 and 46.",
    "13 plus 46 equals 59."
