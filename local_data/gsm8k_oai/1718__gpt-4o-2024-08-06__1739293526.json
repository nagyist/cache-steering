  "query": "A pelican caught 13 fish and a kingfisher caught 7 more fish than the pelican. If a fisherman caught 3 times the total amount of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught, how many more fish did the fisherman catch than the pelican?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fish the kingfisher caught.",
    "The pelican caught 13 fish.",
    "The kingfisher caught 7 more fish than the pelican.",
    "So, the kingfisher caught 13 + 7 fish.",
    "13 + 7 equals 20.",
    "The kingfisher caught 20 fish.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total amount of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught together.",
    "The pelican caught 13 fish and the kingfisher caught 20 fish.",
    "The total amount of fish is 13 + 20.",
    "13 + 20 equals 33.",
    "The pelican and kingfisher together caught 33 fish.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many fish the fisherman caught.",
    "The fisherman caught 3 times the total amount of fish caught by the pelican and kingfisher.",
    "So, the fisherman caught 3 times 33 fish.",
    "3 times 33 equals 99.",
    "The fisherman caught 99 fish.",
    "Finally, I need to find out how many more fish the fisherman caught than the pelican.",
    "The fisherman caught 99 fish and the pelican caught 13 fish.",
    "The difference is 99 - 13.",
    "99 - 13 equals 86."

  "solution": "86"
