  "query": "The Grey's bought several chickens at a sale. John took 5 more of the chickens than Mary took. Ray took 6 chickens less than Mary. If Ray took 10 chickens, how many more chickens did John take than Ray?",
  "steps": [
    "Ray took 10 chickens.",
    "Ray took 6 chickens less than Mary.",
    "To find out how many chickens Mary took, I add 6 to the number of chickens Ray took.",
    "Mary took \\(10 + 6 = 16\\) chickens.",
    "John took 5 more chickens than Mary.",
    "To find out how many chickens John took, I add 5 to the number of chickens Mary took.",
    "John took \\(16 + 5 = 21\\) chickens.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more chickens John took than Ray.",
    "I calculate the difference between the number of chickens John and Ray took.",
    "The difference is \\(21 - 10 = 11\\) chickens."
