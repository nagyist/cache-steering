  "query": "Jenna is hemming her prom dress. The dress's hem is 3 feet long. Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the length of the hem from feet to inches.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot. So, I multiply 3 feet by 12 inches per foot.",
    "3 feet * 12 inches/foot = 36 inches.",
    "Now I know the hem length is 36 inches.",
    "Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long.",
    "To find out how many stitches Jenna needs to make, I'll divide the total hem length by the length of each stitch.",
    "36 inches / (1/4 inch per stitch) = 36 * 4 = 144 stitches.",
    "Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute.",
    "To find out how many minutes it takes, I'll divide the total number of stitches by the number of stitches per minute.",
    "144 stitches / 24 stitches/minute = 6 minutes."
