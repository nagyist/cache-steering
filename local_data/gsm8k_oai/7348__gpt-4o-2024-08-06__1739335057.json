  "query": "Amy biked 12 miles yesterday. If she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, how many miles did she bike in total in the two days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to define how many miles Amy biked today based on the information given.",
    "The information states that she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday.",
    "Yesterday, Amy biked 12 miles.",
    "Twice as far as yesterday is 2 times 12 miles, which equals 24 miles.",
    "Three miles less than 24 miles is 24 miles minus 3 miles.",
    "So, Amy biked 24 - 3 = 21 miles today.",
    "Now, to find the total miles Amy biked in the two days, I will add the miles from yesterday and today.",
    "Yesterday she biked 12 miles, and today she biked 21 miles.",
    "Adding them together gives 12 + 21.",
    "12 + 21 equals 33."

  "solution": "33"
