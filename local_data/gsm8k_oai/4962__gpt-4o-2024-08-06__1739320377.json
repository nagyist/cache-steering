  "query": "Kendra wants enough shirts that she only has to do laundry once every two weeks. She wears one shirt to school for each of the five weekdays. Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club. On Saturday, she wears one shirt all day. On Sunday, she wears a different shirt to church than she does for the rest of the day. How many shirts does she need to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "Kendra wears one shirt to school every weekday, so that\u2019s 5 shirts.",
    "On three of these weekdays, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club, adding 3 more shirts.",
    "On Saturday, she wears one shirt all day, which adds 1 more shirt.",
    "On Sunday, she wears a different shirt to church in the morning, and changes into another shirt for the rest of the day, adding 2 more shirts.",
    "For one week, she needs 5 (school) + 3 (club) + 1 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 11 shirts.",
    "Since she wants to do laundry once every two weeks, she needs 2 times the number of shirts she needs in one week.",
    "2 weeks\u2019 worth of shirts is 11 shirts per week times 2 weeks = 22 shirts."
