  "query": "Two boxes for carrying oranges with a capacity of 80 and 50 were filled with 3/4 and 3/5 of the way full with oranges, respectively. Calculate the total number of oranges the boxes have together.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find how many oranges are in the first box.",
    "The first box has a capacity of 80.",
    "It is filled 3/4 of the way full with oranges.",
    "To calculate the number of oranges in the first box, I multiply the capacity by the fraction it is filled: 80 * (3/4).",
    "80 * (3/4) equals 60.",
    "So, there are 60 oranges in the first box.",
    "Next, I find how many oranges are in the second box.",
    "The second box has a capacity of 50.",
    "It is filled 3/5 of the way full with oranges.",
    "To calculate the number of oranges in the second box, I multiply the capacity by the fraction it is filled: 50 * (3/5).",
    "50 * (3/5) equals 30.",
    "So, there are 30 oranges in the second box.",
    "Now, I add the number of oranges in both boxes together to find the total number.",
    "60 (from the first box) + 30 (from the second box) equals 90."

  "solution": "90"
