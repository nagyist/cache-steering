  "query": "During one hour, Tom can read 12 pages of a book. How many pages would he be able to read during 2 hours if he could increase his reading speed by a factor of 3?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many pages Tom reads in one hour at his normal speed.",
    "Tom can read 12 pages in one hour.",
    "Next, I need to determine his reading speed after increasing it by a factor of 3.",
    "If his original speed is 12 pages per hour, after increasing it by a factor of 3, his new reading speed would be 12 pages/hour \u00d7 3 = 36 pages per hour.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many pages he can read in 2 hours at this new speed.",
    "In 2 hours, at a speed of 36 pages per hour, he would read 36 pages/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 72 pages."

  "solution": "72"
