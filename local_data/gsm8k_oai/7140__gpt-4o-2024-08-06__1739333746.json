  "query": "Marissa's sunflower is  21 inches taller than her little sister. If her sister is 4 feet 3 inches tall, how tall is Marissa's sunflower in feet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the sister's height in total inches.",
    "The sister's height is given as 4 feet 3 inches.",
    "I know that 1 foot equals 12 inches.",
    "So, 4 feet equal 4 times 12 inches, which is 48 inches.",
    "Now, I need to add the 3 inches to the 48 inches.",
    "48 inches plus 3 inches equals 51 inches.",
    "The sister is 51 inches tall.",
    "Marissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her sister.",
    "To find the height of the sunflower, I need to add 21 inches to the sister's height of 51 inches.",
    "51 inches plus 21 inches equals 72 inches.",
    "Now, I need to convert 72 inches back into feet to find the final answer.",
    "I divide 72 inches by 12 inches per foot.",
    "72 divided by 12 equals 6."
