  "query": "On a construction site, the Laker cement factory provided 500 bags of cement sold to Mr. Zander at $10 per bag. Mr. Zander also received twenty lorries of construction sand, each carrying 10 tons of sand, sold at $40 per ton. How much money did Mr. Zander pay for these construction materials?",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the cost per bag of cement, which is $10.",
    "Identify the number of cement bags sold to Mr. Zander, which is 500 bags.",
    "Calculate the total cost of cement by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag: 500 bags * $10/bag.",
    "500 * 10 equals $5000.",
    "Identify the cost per ton of sand, which is $40.",
    "Identify the number of lorries and the amount of sand each carries: 20 lorries, each carrying 10 tons.",
    "Calculate the total tons of sand by multiplying the number of lorries by the tons per lorry: 20 * 10.",
    "20 * 10 equals 200 tons.",
    "Calculate the total cost of sand by multiplying the total tons by the cost per ton: 200 tons * $40/ton.",
    "200 * 40 equals $8000.",
    "Add the total cost of cement and the total cost of sand to find the overall total: $5000 + $8000.",
    "$5000 + $8000 equals $13000."

  "solution": "13000"
