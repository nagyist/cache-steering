  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many whole apple pies were sold. The apple pie is cut into 8 slices.",
    "Milton sold 56 apple pie slices over the weekend.",
    "To find out how many whole apple pies were sold, I divide the number of apple pie slices sold by the number of slices per apple pie.",
    "56 apple pie slices \u00f7 8 slices per apple pie = 7 apple pies.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many whole peach pies were sold. The peach pie is cut into 6 slices.",
    "Milton sold 48 peach pie slices over the weekend.",
    "To find out how many whole peach pies were sold, I divide the number of peach pie slices sold by the number of slices per peach pie.",
    "48 peach pie slices \u00f7 6 slices per peach pie = 8 peach pies.",
    "Next, I add together the number of apple pies and peach pies sold to get the total number of pies sold.",
    "7 apple pies + 8 peach pies = 15 pies."
