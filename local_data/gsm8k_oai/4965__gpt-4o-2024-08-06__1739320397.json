  "query": "John buys 2 shirts. The first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt. If the first shirt costs $15, how much, in dollars, did the shirts cost in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the price of the second shirt.",
    "I know that the first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt.",
    "The price of the first shirt is given as $15.",
    "To find the price of the second shirt, I subtract $6 from the price of the first shirt.",
    "15 - 6 = $9.",
    "The second shirt costs $9.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of the shirts.",
    "The price of the first shirt is $15 and the price of the second shirt is $9.",
    "I add these two amounts to find the total cost.",
    "15 + 9 = $24."
