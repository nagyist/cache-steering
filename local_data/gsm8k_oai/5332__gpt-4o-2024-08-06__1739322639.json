  "query": "Max loves to play video games. He played for 2 hours on Wednesday and the same time on Thursday. On Friday his friends came to play together with him, so Max spent over three hours more on playing than on Wednesday. How many hours on average has Max spent playing video games during these three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many hours Max played on each day.",
    "Max played for 2 hours on Wednesday.",
    "Max also played for 2 hours on Thursday.",
    "On Friday, Max played over three hours more than he did on Wednesday. So, 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.",
    "Therefore, on Friday, Max played for 5 hours.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of hours played over the three days.",
    "On Wednesday, he played for 2 hours.",
    "On Thursday, he played for 2 hours.",
    "On Friday, he played for 5 hours.",
    "Total hours played = 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average number of hours spent playing video games over three days.",
    "The average is calculated by dividing the total hours by the number of days.",
    "Total number of days = 3.",
    "Average hours = Total hours / Number of days = 9 / 3.",
    "9 divided by 3 is 3."
  ],
  "solution": "3"
