  "query": "Jackie walks 2 miles each day while Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day. How many more miles, in all, does Jackie walk than Jessie walk in 6 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many miles Jackie walks in 6 days.",
    "Jackie walks 2 miles each day, so I multiply 2 miles per day by 6 days.",
    "2 miles/day * 6 days = 12 miles.",
    "Next, I calculate how many miles Jessie walks in 6 days.",
    "Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day, so I multiply 1.5 miles per day by 6 days.",
    "1.5 miles/day * 6 days = 9 miles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more miles Jackie walks than Jessie.",
    "I subtract the number of miles Jessie walks from the number of miles Jackie walks.",
    "12 miles (Jackie) - 9 miles (Jessie) = 3 miles."
