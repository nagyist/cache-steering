  "query": "Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee yesterday. Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water yesterday. How many cups of liquid did the two boys drink yesterday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know the total amount of liquid both Elijah and Emilio drank in pints.",
    "Elijah drank 8.5 pints of coffee.",
    "Emilio drank 9.5 pints of water.",
    "Now, I add the amounts they each drank to find the total in pints: 8.5 pints + 9.5 pints.",
    "8.5 + 9.5 equals 18. So, together, they drank 18 pints.",
    "Next, I must convert pints to cups. I need to remember that there are 2 cups in a pint.",
    "I multiply the total pints by 2 to get the number of cups: 18 pints * 2 cups per pint.",
    "18 * 2 equals 36. Therefore, the two boys drank a total of 36 cups of liquid."

  "solution": "36"
