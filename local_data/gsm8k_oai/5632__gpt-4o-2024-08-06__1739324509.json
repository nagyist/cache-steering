  "query": "Tom is binge-watching a show on Netflix. The show has 90 episodes, each one of which is 20 minutes long because there are no commercials. If Tom can spend two hours a day watching the show, how many days will it take him to finish watching the show?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total amount of time Tom will spend watching the 90 episodes.",
    "Each episode is 20 minutes long.",
    "I need to calculate the total time for all 90 episodes.",
    "Total time = number of episodes \u00d7 duration per episode = 90 \u00d7 20 minutes.",
    "90 \u00d7 20 = 1800 minutes. So, Tom needs 1800 minutes to watch all episodes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many minutes Tom can watch per day.",
    "Tom spends two hours a day watching the show.",
    "Since one hour has 60 minutes, two hours equal 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Tom can watch 120 minutes per day.",
    "To find the number of days it will take Tom, I divide the total minutes by the minutes per day.",
    "Number of days = total minutes \u00f7 minutes per day = 1800 \u00f7 120.",
    "1800 \u00f7 120 = 15."
  ],
  "solution": "15"
