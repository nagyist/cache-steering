  "query": "Sally Draper gave her dad Don Draper 10oz of rum on his pancakes. Don can consume a maximum of 3 times that amount of rum for a healthy diet. If he already had 12oz of rum earlier that day, how many oz of rum can Don have after eating all of the rum and pancakes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much rum Don can consume in total for a healthy diet.",
    "Don can consume a maximum of 3 times the amount of rum that Sally gave him, which is 10oz.",
    "Calculating 3 times 10oz gives me 30oz.",
    "Now I know that Don can consume a total of 30oz of rum for a healthy diet.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how much rum Don has already consumed before considering the pancakes.",
    "Sally gave him 10oz of rum on his pancakes, and he had already consumed 12oz earlier that day.",
    "Adding 10oz and 12oz together gives me 22oz of rum that Don has already consumed.",
    "Now I can determine how much more rum Don can consume.",
    "The healthy limit is 30oz, and Don has consumed 22oz, so I need to subtract 22oz from 30oz.",
    "30oz - 22oz equals 8oz, which is the additional amount of rum Don can have."

  "solution": "8"
