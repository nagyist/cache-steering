  "query": "1 chocolate bar costs $1.50 and can be broken into 3 sections to make 3 s'mores.  Ron is hosting a boy scout camp out in his backyard for 15 scouts.  He wants to make sure that there are enough chocolate bars for everyone to have 2 s'mores each.  How much will he spend on chocolate bars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine the total number of s'mores needed.",
    "There are 15 scouts, and each will have 2 s'mores, so we need to calculate 15 \u00d7 2.",
    "15 \u00d7 2 = 30, so Ron needs to make 30 s'mores.",
    "Each chocolate bar can be broken into 3 sections, which can make 3 s'mores. Therefore, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are required to make 30 s'mores.",
    "To find this, we divide the total number of s'mores by the number of s'mores that can be made per chocolate bar: 30 \u00f7 3.",
    "30 \u00f7 3 = 10, so Ron needs 10 chocolate bars.",
    "Each chocolate bar costs $1.50. To find out the total amount Ron will spend, we need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by the cost per bar: 10 \u00d7 1.50.",
    "10 \u00d7 1.50 = 15. Therefore, Ron will spend $15 on chocolate bars."

  "solution": "15"
