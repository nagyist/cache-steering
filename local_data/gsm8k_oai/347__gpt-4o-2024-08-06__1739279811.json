  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many songs Jeremy listened to today.",
    "Jeremy listened to five fewer songs yesterday than today.",
    "Yesterday, he listened to nine songs.",
    "Let's let \"x\" be the number of songs Jeremy listened to today.",
    "Jeremy listened to nine songs yesterday, which is five fewer than today. So, 9 = x - 5.",
    "To find \"x\", I need to solve the equation 9 = x - 5.",
    "Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives me 9 + 5 = x.",
    "Doing the arithmetic, 9 + 5 equals 14.",
    "Thus, x = 14, which means Jeremy listened to 14 songs today.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days.",
    "Yesterday, he listened to 9 songs, and today he listened to 14 songs.",
    "Adding these together gives me 9 + 14.",
    "Calculating that, 9 + 14 equals 23."
