  "query": "Jodi and Vance are researching on a deserted island and have to stay on the island for a certain number of weeks to carry out their research. On their first expedition, they stayed for three weeks on the island. They spent two weeks more on the second expedition than they spent on their first expedition. They spent twice as many weeks on their last expedition as they spent on their second expedition. Calculate the total number of days they spent on the island on all the trips.",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of weeks Jodi and Vance spent on their first expedition. The problem states they spent three weeks on their first expedition.",
    "Next, determine the number of weeks they spent on their second expedition. The problem states they spent two weeks more than their first expedition. Thus, they spent 3 weeks + 2 weeks = 5 weeks on their second expedition.",
    "Now, determine the number of weeks they spent on their last expedition. The problem states they spent twice as many weeks on their last expedition as the second expedition. Twice the 5 weeks = 10 weeks on their last expedition.",
    "Calculate the total number of weeks spent on all expeditions by summing the weeks from each: 3 weeks (first) + 5 weeks (second) + 10 weeks (last) = 18 weeks.",
    "Convert the total weeks into days. Knowing that there are 7 days in a week, multiply: 18 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 126 days."

  "solution": "126"
