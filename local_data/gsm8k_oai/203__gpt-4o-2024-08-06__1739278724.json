  "query": "Benny bought  2 soft drinks for$ 4 each and 5 candy bars. He spent a total of 28 dollars. How much did each candy bar cost?",
  "steps": [
    "Benny bought 2 soft drinks at $4 each.",
    "To find the total cost of the soft drinks, multiply the price of one soft drink by the number of soft drinks: 2 * $4 = $8.",
    "Benny also bought 5 candy bars.",
    "He spent a total of $28.",
    "To find out how much he spent on candy bars, subtract the total cost of the soft drinks from the total amount spent: $28 - $8 = $20.",
    "Now, we know that $20 was spent on 5 candy bars.",
    "Divide the total cost of the candy bars by the number of candy bars to find the cost of each candy bar: $20 / 5 = $4."
