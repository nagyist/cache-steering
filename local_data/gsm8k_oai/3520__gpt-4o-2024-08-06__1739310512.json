  "query": "Haley is getting ready to watch a comet fly over her house. She spends two hours shopping for a telescope, half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard, three times the setup time making snacks, and 20 minutes watching the comet. What percentage of the total time she spent on all those activities was spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total time spent on all activities.",
    "Haley spends 2 hours shopping for a telescope.",
    "She spends half an hour setting up, which is 0.5 hours.",
    "She spends three times the setup time making snacks, so 3 times 0.5 hours equals 1.5 hours.",
    "She spends 20 minutes watching the comet.",
    "To have all times in hours, I'll convert 20 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, 20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 hours, which is approximately 0.3333 hours.",
    "Now I'll sum up all the time spent: 2 hours shopping + 0.5 hours setting up + 1.5 hours making snacks + 0.3333 hours watching = 4.3333 hours total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the percentage of the total time that was spent watching the comet.",
    "The time spent watching the comet is 0.3333 hours.",
    "To find the percentage, I divide the comet watching time by the total time and multiply by 100: (0.3333 / 4.3333) * 100.",
    "Calculating: (0.3333 / 4.3333) = 0.0769.",
    "Multiplying by 100 gives 7.69.",
    "Rounding 7.69 to the nearest percent gives 8%."

  "solution": "8"
