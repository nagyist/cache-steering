  "query": "In India, it cost $1 to purify a gallon of fresh water. Each person needs 1/2 a gallon of fresh water a day. In a family of 6, how much will it cost for fresh water for the day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much water a single person needs in a day.",
    "Each person needs 1/2 a gallon of fresh water a day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much water a family of 6 will need in a day.",
    "Since each person needs 1/2 a gallon, a family of 6 will need 6 x 1/2 gallons of water.",
    "Calculate 6 x 1/2: \\(6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3\\) gallons of water.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much it costs to purify 3 gallons of fresh water.",
    "Since it costs $1 to purify a gallon of water, purifying 3 gallons will cost 3 x $1.",
    "Calculate 3 x $1: $3."
