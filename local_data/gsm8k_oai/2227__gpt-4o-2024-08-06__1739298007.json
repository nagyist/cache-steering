  "query": "Russel and Jen went to the circus. Jen played a shooting game twice, while Russel rode the carousel three times. If the shooting game costs 5 tickets and the carousel costs 3 tickets. How many tickets did they use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tickets Jen spent on the shooting game.",
    "Jen played the shooting game twice. Each game costs 5 tickets.",
    "So, Jen used 2 times 5 tickets, which is 10 tickets for the shooting game.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many tickets Russel spent on the carousel.",
    "Russel rode the carousel three times. Each ride costs 3 tickets.",
    "Thus, Russel used 3 times 3 tickets, which is 9 tickets for the carousel.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of tickets both Jen and Russel used.",
    "Jen used 10 tickets, and Russel used 9 tickets.",
    "Adding these together, 10 + 9 gives me the total number of tickets used.",
    "The total number of tickets used is 19."
