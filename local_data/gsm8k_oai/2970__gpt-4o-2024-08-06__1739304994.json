  "query": "Marlon had 30 female baby bunnies in his hutch. They matured after four months, and he gave 2/5 of them to his friend Rodney. If after another three months the bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 kittens each, calculate the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch now.",
  "steps": [
    "Marlon initially had 30 female baby bunnies.",
    "After four months, all the bunnies matured. He gave 2/5 of them to his friend Rodney.",
    "Let's calculate 2/5 of 30. \n2/5 of 30 is (2/5) * 30 = 12.",
    "So, Marlon gave away 12 bunnies to Rodney.",
    "Now, the number of bunnies Marlon has left is 30 - 12 = 18.",
    "After another three months, these 18 bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 kittens each.",
    "Each of the 18 bunnies gave birth to 2 kittens, so the total number of new kittens born is 18 * 2 = 36.",
    "To find the total number of bunnies Marlon has now, I need to add the original 18 bunnies to the 36 new kittens.",
    "18 (original bunnies) + 36 (new kittens) = 54 bunnies."
