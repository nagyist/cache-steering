  "query": "Joanie wants to join a gym to get into shape. The gym costs $12 per month and has a $50 down payment. How much will she need to pay for the first 3 years?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Joanie will pay per month.",
    "The monthly cost is $12.",
    "Next, I should calculate the total monthly cost for the three years.",
    "There are 12 months in a year, so for 3 years, she will be paying for 3 x 12 months = 36 months.",
    "The cost for 36 months at $12 per month is 36 x $12 = $432.",
    "Now, I need to add the initial down payment of $50 to the total cost.",
    "The total cost Joanie will pay is $432 (for monthly payments) + $50 (down payment) = $482."
