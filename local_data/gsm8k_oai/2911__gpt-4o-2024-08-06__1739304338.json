  "query": "Greg bought a 20-pack of granola bars to eat at lunch for the week. He set aside one for each day of the week, traded three of the remaining bars to his friend Pete for a soda, and gave the rest to his two sisters. How many did each sister get when they split them evenly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many days Greg needs a granola bar for lunch during the week. A typical week has 7 days.",
    "Greg sets aside 7 granola bars for each day of the week.",
    "He bought a 20-pack of granola bars. After setting aside 7, I subtract 7 from 20 to find out how many remain.",
    "20 minus 7 equals 13. So, Greg has 13 granola bars remaining.",
    "Next, Greg trades 3 of the remaining bars to his friend Pete. I need to subtract these 3 bars from the 13 he has.",
    "13 minus 3 equals 10. He now has 10 granola bars left.",
    "Greg gives the remaining 10 granola bars to his two sisters to split evenly.",
    "I divide the 10 granola bars by 2 to find out how many each sister gets.",
    "10 divided by 2 equals 5.",
    "Each sister gets 5 granola bars when they split them evenly."
