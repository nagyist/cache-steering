  "query": "Benny is baking pies for a bake sale. He plans to make ten pumpkin pies, which cost $3 each to make, and twelve cherry pies, which cost $5 each to make. If he wants to make a profit of $20 selling all the pies, how much does he have to charge for each pie if both kinds sell at the same price?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of making the pies.",
    "Benny is making 10 pumpkin pies at $3 each. The total cost for the pumpkin pies is 10 * $3 = $30.",
    "Benny is also making 12 cherry pies at $5 each. The total cost for the cherry pies is 12 * $5 = $60.",
    "Now I can calculate the total cost of making all the pies by adding the cost of pumpkin pies and cherry pies.",
    "The total cost is $30 (pumpkin) + $60 (cherry) = $90.",
    "Benny wants to make a profit of $20 in addition to the total cost.",
    "The total amount Benny needs to make from selling the pies is $90 (cost) + $20 (profit) = $110.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pies Benny is selling in total.",
    "He is selling 10 pumpkin pies + 12 cherry pies = 22 pies in total.",
    "To find the price he should charge for each pie, I'll divide the total amount he wants to make ($110) by the total number of pies (22).",
    "$110 divided by 22 pies equals $5 per pie."

  "solution": "5"
