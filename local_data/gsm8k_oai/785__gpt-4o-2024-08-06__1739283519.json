  "query": "On a particular week, Fatima's restaurant served 25 people food and drinks, and 3/5 of that number came to buy coffee. How many people did not buy coffee in the restaurant?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many people came to the restaurant.",
    "The problem states that the restaurant served food and drinks to 25 people.",
    "I need to calculate how many of those people came just for coffee.",
    "The problem specifies that 3/5 of the total number came to buy coffee.",
    "To find out how many people bought coffee, I need to calculate 3/5 of 25.",
    "First, multiply 25 by 3: \\( 25 \\times 3 = 75 \\).",
    "Then, divide the result by 5: \\( 75 \\div 5 = 15 \\).",
    "So, 15 people bought coffee.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people did not buy coffee.",
    "To do that, subtract the number of people who bought coffee from the total number of people.",
    "The calculation is \\( 25 - 15 = 10 \\).",
    "Therefore, 10 people did not buy coffee."
