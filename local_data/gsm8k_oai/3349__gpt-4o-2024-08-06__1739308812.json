  "query": "Sara\u2019s house is 100 square feet larger than 2 times Nada's house. If Sara's house is 1000 square feet, how many square feet is Nada's house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will express the relationship between the sizes of Sara's and Nada's houses using an equation. Let N be the square feet of Nada's house.",
    "According to the problem, Sara's house is 100 square feet larger than 2 times Nada's house.",
    "This relationship can be expressed as: Sara's house = 2 * Nada's house + 100.",
    "Sara's house is 1000 square feet. So I can set up the equation: 1000 = 2 * N + 100.",
    "The next step is to solve this equation for N.",
    "First, subtract 100 from both sides of the equation: 1000 - 100 = 2 * N.",
    "This simplifies to: 900 = 2 * N.",
    "Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for N: 900 / 2 = N.",
    "This results in: N = 450."

  "solution": "450"
