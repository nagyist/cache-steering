  "query": "Jenny is trying to convince her cat to walk on a leash. The cat spends twenty minutes resisting. Then Jenny coaxes the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute. How many minutes does this whole process take?",
  "steps": [
    "Jenny's cat spends 20 minutes resisting.",
    "Next, the cat walks 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute.",
    "I need to calculate the time it takes for the cat to walk 64 feet.",
    "Time taken to walk = Distance / Rate.",
    "Substituting the values, Time = 64 feet / 8 feet/minute = 8 minutes.",
    "Now, I have to add the resisting time and walking time together.",
    "The cat resisted for 20 minutes and walked for 8 minutes.",
    "Total time spent = 20 minutes (resisting) + 8 minutes (walking).",
    "20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes."
  ],
  "solution": "28"
