  "query": "On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball. On Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball. How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students played kickball on Thursday.",
    "I know from the problem that on Thursday, 9 fewer students played compared to Wednesday.",
    "On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball.",
    "So, on Thursday, the number of students who played is 37 - 9.",
    "Calculating 37 - 9, I get 28 students played on Thursday.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of students who played kickball on both Wednesday and Thursday.",
    "I add the number of students from Wednesday (37) to the number of students from Thursday (28).",
    "Calculating 37 + 28, I get 65."
