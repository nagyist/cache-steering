  "query": "There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms in the lab. The number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms. If there are 12 uniforms in the lab, and the lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, how many coats and uniforms in total does each lab tech get?",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the number of uniforms in the lab. According to the problem, there are 12 uniforms.",
    "Determine the relationship between the number of lab coats and uniforms. There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms.",
    "Calculate the number of lab coats using the relationship. 6 times 12 uniforms equals 72 lab coats.",
    "Now, find the number of lab techs. The problem states the number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms.",
    "Calculate the number of lab techs: half of 12 uniforms equals 6 lab techs.",
    "Determine the total number of coats and uniforms. Add the number of lab coats (72) and uniforms (12), which gives us 72 + 12 = 84 total items.",
    "Each lab tech shares the coats and uniforms equally among them. Therefore, divide the total number of items by the number of lab techs.",
    "Calculate the amount each lab tech receives: 84 total items divided by 6 lab techs equals 14 coats and uniforms per lab tech."
