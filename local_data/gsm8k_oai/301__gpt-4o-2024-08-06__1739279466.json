  "query": "240 sixth-grade students were asked about the number of novels they read per month. 1/6 of students read three or more novels, 35% of students read two novels, 5/12 of students read one novel, and the rest of the students do not read anything. Calculate the number of students who do not read novels.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find how many students read three or more novels.",
    "There are 240 students in total.",
    "1/6 of 240 students read three or more novels.",
    "To find 1/6 of 240, I calculate \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 240 = 40 \\).",
    "So, 40 students read three or more novels.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many students read two novels.",
    "35% of 240 students read two novels.",
    "I need to find 35% of 240.",
    "0.35 times 240 equals \\( 0.35 \\times 240 = 84 \\).",
    "Therefore, 84 students read two novels.",
    "Next, I calculate how many students read one novel.",
    "5/12 of 240 students read one novel.",
    "Calculating \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\times 240 \\) gives me 100.",
    "So, 100 students read one novel.",
    "To find out the number of students who do not read any novels, I will subtract the number of students who read novels from the total number of students.",
    "The number of students who read at least one novel is 40 (three or more) + 84 (two novels) + 100 (one novel).",
    "40 + 84 + 100 equals 224.",
    "Thus, 224 students read at least one novel.",
    "The number of students who don't read any novels is the total number of students minus those who read novels.",
    "240 - 224 equals 16."

  "solution": "16"
