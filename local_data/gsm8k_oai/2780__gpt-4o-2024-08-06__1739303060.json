  "query": "Crystal wanted to sell everything left in her pastry class before closing for the night.  She reduced her $3.00 cupcakes and her $2.00 cookies by half.  How much money did she make if she sold the last 16 cupcakes and 8 cookies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the new price of the cupcakes after the discount.",
    "The original price of the cupcakes is $3.00.",
    "Crystal reduced the price by half, so the new price of each cupcake is $3.00 / 2 = $1.50.",
    "Next, I find out the new price of the cookies after the discount.",
    "The original price of the cookies is $2.00.",
    "Crystal reduced the price by half, so the new price of each cookie is $2.00 / 2 = $1.00.",
    "Now, I calculate how much money she made from the cupcakes.",
    "She sold the last 16 cupcakes at $1.50 each, so she made 16 * $1.50 = $24.00 from the cupcakes.",
    "Next, I calculate how much money she made from the cookies.",
    "She sold the last 8 cookies at $1.00 each, so she made 8 * $1.00 = $8.00 from the cookies.",
    "Finally, I add the money made from selling cupcakes and cookies to find the total.",
    "$24.00 from cupcakes + $8.00 from cookies = $32.00."
