  "query": "Jenny decided to get a cat with her girlfriend.  They agreed to split all the costs down the middle except for they would each buy their own toys for the cat.  The adoption fee was $50, the vet visits cost $500 for the first year and the monthly cost of food was $25.  She bought $200 in toys.  How much did Jenny spend on the cat in the first year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total shared costs for the cat.",
    "The adoption fee is $50.",
    "The vet visits cost $500 for the first year.",
    "The monthly cost of food is $25, so for a year, that would be $25 x 12 months.",
    "Calculating the yearly cost of food: $25 x 12 = $300.",
    "Adding the shared costs: $50 (adoption fee) + $500 (vet visits) + $300 (food) = $850.",
    "Jenny and her girlfriend split the shared costs evenly.",
    "To find Jenny's share of the shared costs, divide $850 by 2.",
    "$850 / 2 = $425.",
    "Next, I need to account for the toys Jenny bought.",
    "Jenny spent $200 on toys.",
    "To find Jenny\u2019s total expenditure, add her share of the shared costs to the cost of the toys.",
    "$425 (shared costs) + $200 (toys) = $625."
  ],
  "solution": "625"
