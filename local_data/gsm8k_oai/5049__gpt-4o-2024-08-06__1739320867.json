  "query": "Armand is playing a guessing game with his dad where he has to guess a number his dad is thinking of. His dad tells him that the number, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51. What is the number?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number Armand has to guess as x.",
    "According to the problem, when this number x is multiplied by 3, it is three less than twice 51.",
    "First, calculate twice 51: 2 * 51 = 102.",
    "According to the problem, 3x = 102 - 3.",
    "Calculate 102 - 3 to simplify the equation: 102 - 3 = 99.",
    "Now we have the equation 3x = 99.",
    "To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 99 / 3.",
    "Calculate 99 / 3: 99 divided by 3 equals 33."

  "solution": "33"
