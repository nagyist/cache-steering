  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Dawn will take to paint the series of 12 paintings.",
    "Dawn takes 2 hours to paint 1 painting.",
    "For 12 paintings, the total time required is 12 paintings * 2 hours per painting.",
    "12 * 2 equals 24 hours. So, Dawn will take 24 hours to complete all the paintings.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much money Dawn makes per hour.",
    "Dawn is earning a total of $3,600.00 for the 12 paintings.",
    "The money earned per hour is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the total number of hours worked.",
    "So, $3,600.00 divided by 24 hours will give me the hourly rate.",
    "3600 / 24 equals 150.",
    "Dawn makes $150 per hour."
