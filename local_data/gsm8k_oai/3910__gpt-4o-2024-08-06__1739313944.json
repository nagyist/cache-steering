  "query": "Mason is three times younger than Sydney and Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father. If Mason is 20 years old, how old is his father?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's establish Mason's age, which is given as 20 years old.",
    "Since Mason is three times younger than Sydney, we need to interpret this correctly. \"Three times younger\" often means dividing by a factor, which can be tricky conceptually, but I will assume it means Sydney is three times older than Mason.",
    "Thus, Sydney's age would be 3 times Mason's age: 3 * 20 = 60 years old.",
    "Now, it is given that Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father.",
    "To find Mason's father's age, we add 6 years to Sydney's age: 60 + 6 = 66."

  "solution": "66"
