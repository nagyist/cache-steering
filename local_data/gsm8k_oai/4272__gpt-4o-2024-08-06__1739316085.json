  "query": "For 12 servings of Chicken Surprise, you need 4.5 pounds of chicken and 24 ounces of stuffing. How many ounces would one serving of Chicken Surprise be?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the weight of chicken from pounds to ounces since the question asks for the weight in ounces.",
    "There are 16 ounces in a pound.",
    "So, 4.5 pounds of chicken is 4.5 x 16 = 72 ounces of chicken.",
    "Next, I need to find the total weight of all ingredients in ounces.",
    "The stuffing is already given in ounces, 24 ounces.",
    "Adding the chicken and stuffing together, the total weight for 12 servings is 72 ounces + 24 ounces = 96 ounces.",
    "To find the weight of one serving, I need to divide the total weight by the number of servings, which is 12.",
    "96 ounces divided by 12 servings equals 8 ounces per serving."

  "solution": "8"
