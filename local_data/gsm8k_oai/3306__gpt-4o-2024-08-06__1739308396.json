  "steps": [
    "Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day.",
    "In the first week, he jogs for 3 days.",
    "Each day he jogs for 30 minutes, so in the first week he jogs 3 days * 30 minutes = 90 minutes.",
    "In the second week, he jogs for 5 days.",
    "Each day he jogs for 30 minutes, so in the second week he jogs 5 days * 30 minutes = 150 minutes.",
    "To find the total jogging time over two weeks, I need to add the minutes from both weeks: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.",
    "Since the result is in minutes, I need to convert it to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "240 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours."
