  "query": "3 cloves of garlic can repel 2 vampires, 8 vampire bats or 3 wights. How many cloves of garlic are needed to repel 30 vampires, 12 wights and 40 vampire bats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem, which involves calculating how many cloves of garlic are required to repel a certain number of vampires, vampire bats, and wights based on given ratios.",
    "I will start by determining how many cloves of garlic are needed for 30 vampires based on the given ratio. \n3 cloves of garlic repel 2 vampires.",
    "I set up a proportion: \\(\\frac{3 \\text{ cloves}}{2 \\text{ vampires}} = \\frac{x \\text{ cloves}}{30 \\text{ vampires}}\\).",
    "Cross-multiply to solve for x: \\(2x = 3 \\times 30\\).",
    "Calculate \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\).",
    "Therefore, \\(2x = 90\\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find x: \\(x = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\\).",
    "Now, 45 cloves of garlic are needed to repel 30 vampires.",
    "Next, I calculate how many cloves of garlic are needed to repel 40 vampire bats.",
    "3 cloves of garlic repel 8 vampire bats.",
    "Set up a proportion: \\(\\frac{3 \\text{ cloves}}{8 \\text{ bats}} = \\frac{x \\text{ cloves}}{40 \\text{ bats}}\\).",
    "Cross-multiply to solve for x: \\(8x = 3 \\times 40\\).",
    "Calculate \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).",
    "Thus, \\(8x = 120\\).",
    "Divide both sides by 8: \\(x = \\frac{120}{8} = 15\\).",
    "Therefore, 15 cloves of garlic are needed to repel 40 vampire bats.",
    "Lastly, I calculate how many cloves of garlic are needed to repel 12 wights.",
    "3 cloves of garlic repel 3 wights.",
    "Set up a proportion: \\(\\frac{3 \\text{ cloves}}{3 \\text{ wights}} = \\frac{x \\text{ cloves}}{12 \\text{ wights}}\\).",
    "Cross-multiply to solve for x: \\(3x = 3 \\times 12\\).",
    "Calculate \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\).",
    "So, \\(3x = 36\\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3: \\(x = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\\).",
    "Therefore, 12 cloves of garlic are needed to repel 12 wights.",
    "Now I sum up all the cloves needed: 45 (for vampires) + 15 (for bats) + 12 (for wights).",
    "Calculate: \\(45 + 15 + 12 = 72\\)."
