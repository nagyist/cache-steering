  "query": "Bella is making bracelets for her 6 friends. She needs 8 beads per bracelet. She has 36 beads. How many more beads does she need to make all six bracelets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many beads are needed for all six bracelets.",
    "Each bracelet needs 8 beads.",
    "For 6 bracelets, the total number of beads needed is 6 multiplied by 8.",
    "6 times 8 equals 48 beads.",
    "So, Bella needs 48 beads in total.",
    "I know Bella currently has 36 beads.",
    "To find out how many more beads she needs, I subtract the number of beads she has from the total number of beads needed.",
    "48 beads needed minus 36 beads she has equals 12 beads."

  "solution": "12"
