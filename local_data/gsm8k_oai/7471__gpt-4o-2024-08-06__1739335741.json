  "query": "Janet, a third grade teacher, is picking up the sack lunch order from a local deli for the field trip she is taking her class on. There are 35 children in her class, 5 volunteer chaperones, and herself. She she also ordered three additional sack lunches, just in case there was a problem. Each sack lunch costs $7. How much do all the lunches cost in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of people Janet is buying sack lunches for.",
    "There are 35 children in Janet's class.",
    "There are 5 volunteer chaperones.",
    "Janet herself is also attending the trip.",
    "Adding these together: 35 children + 5 chaperones + 1 teacher = 41 people.",
    "Janet ordered three additional sack lunches in case of any issues.",
    "Adding the additional sack lunches to the total number of people: 41 people + 3 additional = 44 lunches needed.",
    "Each sack lunch costs $7.",
    "To find the total cost of all the lunches, I need to multiply the number of lunches by the cost per lunch.",
    "44 lunches \u00d7 $7 per lunch = $308."
  ],
  "solution": "308"
