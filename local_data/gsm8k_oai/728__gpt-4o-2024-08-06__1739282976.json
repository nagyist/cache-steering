  "query": "Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "Whitney has two $20 bills.",
    "The total amount of money Whitney has is 2 * $20 = $40.",
    "Whitney wants to buy 2 posters.",
    "Each poster costs $5.",
    "The total cost for the posters is 2 * $5 = $10.",
    "Whitney also wants to buy 3 notebooks.",
    "Each notebook costs $4.",
    "The total cost for the notebooks is 3 * $4 = $12.",
    "Whitney plans to buy 2 bookmarks.",
    "Each bookmark costs $2.",
    "The total cost for the bookmarks is 2 * $2 = $4.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total cost of all the items.",
    "The total cost is $10 (posters) + $12 (notebooks) + $4 (bookmarks) = $26.",
    "Whitney started with $40.",
    "I need to subtract the total cost of the items from the amount Whitney has.",
    "The remaining money Whitney has is $40 - $26 = $14."
