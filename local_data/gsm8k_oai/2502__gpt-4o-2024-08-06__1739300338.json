  "query": "James gets bored with his game so decides to play a different one.  That game promises 100 hours of gameplay but 80% of that is boring grinding.  However, the expansion does add another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.  How much enjoyable gameplay does James get?",
  "steps": [
    "The game promises 100 hours of gameplay in total.",
    "80% of this gameplay is boring grinding.",
    "To find out how many hours are boring, calculate 80% of 100.",
    "80% of 100 hours is (80/100) * 100 = 80 hours.",
    "Subtract the boring hours from the total to find the enjoyable gameplay: 100 hours - 80 hours = 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay in the base game.",
    "The expansion adds another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.",
    "Add the enjoyable gameplay from the base game and the expansion: 20 hours + 30 hours.",
    "20 hours + 30 hours = 50 hours of enjoyable gameplay."
