  "query": "During a fundraiser, each of the 20 members of a group sold candy bars which costs $0.50 each. If each member sold an average of 8 candy bars, how much money did they earn from their candy bars sales, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of candy bars sold by the group.",
    "Each group member is 20, and each sold an average of 8 candy bars.",
    "The total number of candy bars sold will be 20 members multiplied by 8 candy bars each.",
    "20 multiplied by 8 equals 160. So, the group sold a total of 160 candy bars.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total money earned from the candy bar sales.",
    "Each candy bar costs $0.50.",
    "The total earnings will be the total number of candy bars sold, 160, multiplied by the cost per candy bar, $0.50.",
    "160 multiplied by $0.50 equals $80.",
    "So, the group earned a total of $80 from the candy bar sales."
