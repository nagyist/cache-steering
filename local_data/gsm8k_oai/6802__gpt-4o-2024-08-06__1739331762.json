  "query": "Big boxes contain 7 dolls each. Small boxes contain 4 dolls each. There are 5 big boxes and 9 small boxes. How many dolls are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many dolls are in the big boxes.",
    "There are 5 big boxes, and each big box contains 7 dolls.",
    "To find the total number of dolls in the big boxes, I multiply 5 by 7.",
    "5 times 7 equals 35. So, there are 35 dolls in the big boxes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many dolls are in the small boxes.",
    "There are 9 small boxes, and each small box contains 4 dolls.",
    "To find the total number of dolls in the small boxes, I multiply 9 by 4.",
    "9 times 4 equals 36. So, there are 36 dolls in the small boxes.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of dolls by adding the dolls from the big boxes and the small boxes together.",
    "I already calculated that there are 35 dolls in the big boxes and 36 dolls in the small boxes.",
    "I add 35 and 36 to get the total number of dolls.",
    "35 plus 36 equals 71."
