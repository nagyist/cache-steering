  "query": "Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks by a tree when going to school and scared them away when they saw her. While coming back from school, she realized the number of beavers had doubled and the number of chipmunks had decreased by 10. What's the total number of animals she saw that day?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, Aubree saw 20 beavers.",
    "Initially, Aubree saw 40 chipmunks.",
    "The total number of animals Aubree saw initially is 20 beavers + 40 chipmunks = 60 animals.",
    "On her way back, Aubree saw that the number of beavers had doubled.",
    "The doubled number of beavers is 20 beavers * 2 = 40 beavers.",
    "On her way back, the number of chipmunks had decreased by 10.",
    "The new number of chipmunks is 40 chipmunks - 10 chipmunks = 30 chipmunks.",
    "The total number of animals she saw on her way back is 40 beavers + 30 chipmunks = 70 animals.",
    "To find the total number of animals she saw that day, add the number of animals she saw initially to the number of animals she saw on her way back.",
    "The total number of animals she saw that day is 60 animals (initially) + 70 animals (on the way back) = 130 animals."
