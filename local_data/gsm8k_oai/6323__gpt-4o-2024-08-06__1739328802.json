  "query": "There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?",
  "steps": [
    "Start with the initial number of jellybeans in the jar, which is 90.",
    "Samantha took 24 jellybeans.",
    "Subtract the 24 jellybeans that Samantha took. 90 - 24 = 66.",
    "Shelby ate 12 jellybeans.",
    "Subtract the 12 jellybeans that Shelby ate. 66 - 12 = 54.",
    "Add up the total number of jellybeans that Samantha and Shelby took. 24 + 12 = 36.",
    "Shannon refilled the jar with half the amount that Samantha and Shelby took. Half of 36 is 18.",
    "Add the 18 jellybeans that Shannon added to the jar. 54 + 18 = 72."
