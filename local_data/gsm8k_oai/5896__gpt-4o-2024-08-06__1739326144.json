  "query": "There are 6 girls and 8 boys in the school play. If both parents of each kid attend the premiere, how many parents will be in the auditorium?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of children in the school play.",
    "There are 6 girls and 8 boys.",
    "To find the total number of children, I add the number of girls and the number of boys: 6 + 8.",
    "6 + 8 equals 14. So there are 14 children in the play.",
    "Each child has two parents attending the premiere.",
    "To find the total number of parents, I multiply the number of children by the number of parents each child has: 14 * 2.",
    "14 * 2 equals 28."

  "solution": "28"
