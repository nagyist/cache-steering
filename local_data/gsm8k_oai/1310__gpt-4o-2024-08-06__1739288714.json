  "query": "Stacy is a high school Calculus teacher.  She assigns 45 problems for homework.  There are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response, and 7 more free response than true/false.  How many true/false questions are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let \\( x \\) be the number of true/false questions.",
    "The number of free response questions is \\( x + 7 \\) because there are 7 more free response questions than true/false questions.",
    "The number of multiple choice questions is \\( 2(x + 7) \\) as there are twice as many multiple choice questions as free response questions.",
    "The total number of questions is the sum of true/false, free response, and multiple-choice questions.",
    "Therefore, the equation is: \n\\[ x + (x + 7) + 2(x + 7) = 45 \\]",
    "Simplify the equation:\n\\[ x + x + 7 + 2(x + 7) = 45 \\]",
    "This becomes:\n\\[ x + x + 7 + 2x + 14 = 45 \\]",
    "Combine like terms:\n\\[ 4x + 21 = 45 \\]",
    "Subtract 21 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 4x = 24 \\]",
    "Divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ x = 6 \\]"

  "solution": "6"
