  "query": "Belinda can throw a ball at a speed of 20 feet/second. If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how far the ball travels before it hits the ground.",
    "The ball is flying for 8 seconds and the speed of the ball is 20 feet/second.",
    "To find the distance traveled by the ball, I use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "Distance = 20 feet/second \u00d7 8 seconds = 160 feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how long it will take the border collie to cover the same distance of 160 feet.",
    "The speed of the border collie is 5 feet/second.",
    "To find the time it takes for the border collie to reach the distance, I use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "Time for the border collie = 160 feet / 5 feet/second = 32 seconds."

  "solution": "32"
