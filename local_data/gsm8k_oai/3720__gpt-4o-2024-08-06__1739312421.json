  "query": "A baker sells pastries for $5 and works 7 days a week. On Monday he sold 2. Every day the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day. On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the sales pattern. The baker sells 2 pastries on Monday.",
    "Each subsequent day, the number of sales increases by 1.",
    "On Tuesday, sales are 2 + 1 = 3.",
    "On Wednesday, sales are 3 + 1 = 4.",
    "On Thursday, sales are 4 + 1 = 5.",
    "On Friday, sales are 5 + 1 = 6.",
    "On Saturday, sales are 6 + 1 = 7.",
    "On Sunday, sales are 7 + 1 = 8.",
    "List the sales figures for each day: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.",
    "Add these numbers to find the total sales for the week: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8.",
    "The total sales for the week is 35 pastries.",
    "To find the average number of pastries sold per day, divide the total sales by the number of days in the week (7 days).",
    "35 pastries \u00f7 7 days = 5 pastries per day."
