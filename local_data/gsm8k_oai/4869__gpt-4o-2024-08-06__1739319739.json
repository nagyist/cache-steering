  "query": "Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many blisters are on each arm.",
    "There are 60 blisters on each arm.",
    "Brenda has two arms, so I need to multiply the number of blisters on one arm by 2 to get the total number of blisters on both arms.",
    "60 blisters/arm * 2 arms = 120 blisters on both arms.",
    "Next, I need to consider the number of blisters on the rest of her body.",
    "The problem states there are 80 blisters on the rest of her body.",
    "To find the total number of blisters on Brenda's body, I need to add the number of blisters on her arms to the number of blisters on the rest of her body.",
    "120 blisters on arms + 80 blisters on rest of body = 200 blisters in total."
