  "query": "James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?",
  "steps": [
    "James has 5 oranges.",
    "Each orange is broken into 8 pieces.",
    "So, in total, 5 oranges produce 5 x 8 = 40 pieces.",
    "These 40 pieces are split equally among 4 people.",
    "Each person gets 40 / 4 = 10 pieces.",
    "Each orange contains 80 calories.",
    "Since each orange is broken into 8 pieces, each piece is 80 / 8 = 10 calories.",
    "Each person gets 10 pieces.",
    "So, each person receives 10 pieces x 10 calories/piece = 100 calories."

  "solution": "100"
