  "query": "Lena played video games for 3.5 hours last weekend. Her brother played 17 minutes more than she did. How many minutes together did Lena and her brother play video games last weekend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the time Lena played from hours to minutes.",
    "Lena played for 3.5 hours. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, I will multiply 3.5 by 60.",
    "3.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 210 minutes. Lena played for 210 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long her brother played.",
    "Her brother played 17 minutes more than Lena.",
    "Since Lena played for 210 minutes, her brother played for 210 + 17 minutes.",
    "210 + 17 = 227 minutes. Her brother played for 227 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total time both Lena and her brother played.",
    "I will add the minutes Lena played to the minutes her brother played: 210 + 227.",
    "210 + 227 = 437 minutes."

  "solution": "437"
