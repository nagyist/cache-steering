  "query": "Sarah decided to pull weeds from her garden. On Tuesday she pulled 25 weeds. The next day she pulled three times the number of weeds she did the day before. On Thursday her allergies bothered her and she could only pull up one-fifth of the weeds she pulled on the day before. Finally, on Friday it rained for half the day and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. In total, how many weeds did she pull up?",
  "steps": [
    "On Tuesday, Sarah pulled 25 weeds.",
    "On Wednesday, she pulled three times the number of weeds she did on Tuesday. So, she pulled 3 times 25, which is 75 weeds.",
    "On Thursday, she pulled one-fifth of the weeds she pulled on Wednesday. So, she pulled 75 divided by 5, which is 15 weeds.",
    "On Friday, she pulled 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. So, she pulled 15 minus 10, which is 5 weeds.",
    "To find the total number of weeds she pulled up, we add the number of weeds from each day: 25 (Tuesday) + 75 (Wednesday) + 15 (Thursday) + 5 (Friday).",
    "The total number of weeds pulled is 25 + 75 + 15 + 5 = 120 weeds."
