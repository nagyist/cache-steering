  "query": "There are 42 apples in a crate. 12 crates of apples were delivered to a factory. 4 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away. The remaining apples were packed into boxes that could fit 10 apples each. How many boxes of apples were there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of apples delivered to the factory.",
    "There are 42 apples per crate and 12 crates delivered.",
    "To find the total number of apples, I multiply the number of apples per crate by the number of crates: 42 apples/crate * 12 crates.",
    "42 multiplied by 12 equals 504 apples.",
    "Next, I account for the rotten apples. There are 4 rotten apples that need to be subtracted from the total.",
    "The total number of usable apples is then 504 apples - 4 rotten apples.",
    "504 minus 4 equals 500 usable apples.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many boxes can be filled with these remaining 500 apples if each box holds 10 apples.",
    "I divide the total number of usable apples by the number of apples per box: 500 apples / 10 apples/box.",
    "500 divided by 10 equals 50 boxes."

  "solution": "50"
