  "query": "Tonya is in a hamburger eating contest. Each hamburger is 4 ounces. Last year the winner ate 84 ounces. How many hamburgers does she have to eat to beat last year's winner?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many ounces Tonya needs to eat to beat last year's winner. The winner ate 84 ounces.",
    "To beat the winner, Tonya needs to eat more than 84 ounces of hamburgers. Therefore, she needs to eat at least 85 ounces.",
    "Each hamburger weighs 4 ounces. I need to calculate how many 4-ounce hamburgers amount to at least 85 ounces.",
    "I can calculate the minimum number of hamburgers needed by dividing 85 ounces by 4 ounces per hamburger.",
    "85 divided by 4 equals 21.25.",
    "Since Tonya cannot eat a fraction of a hamburger in the competition, I must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she eats more than 84 ounces.",
    "Rounding 21.25 up gives 22 hamburgers."

  "solution": "22"
