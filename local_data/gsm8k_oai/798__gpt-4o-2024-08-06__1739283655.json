  "query": "Patsy is gearing up for this weekend\u2019s graduation.  She needs to have 6 appetizers per each of her 30 guests.  She\u2019s making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket and 2 dozen kebabs.  How many more dozen appetizers does she need to make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of appetizers required. Patsy wants 6 appetizers per guest and she is expecting 30 guests.",
    "Calculate the total appetizers needed: 6 appetizers/guest * 30 guests = 180 appetizers.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of appetizers she is already planning to make.",
    "Each dozen contains 12 appetizers. So, calculate the total appetizers from each type:",
    "3 dozen deviled eggs: 3 * 12 = 36 appetizers.",
    "2 dozen pigs in a blanket: 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers.",
    "2 dozen kebabs: 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers.",
    "Add the appetizers she is planning to make: 36 (deviled eggs) + 24 (pigs in a blanket) + 24 (kebabs) = 84 appetizers.",
    "Now, find out how many more appetizers she needs to make: 180 (needed) - 84 (already planned) = 96 more appetizers required.",
    "I need to convert the additional 96 appetizers needed into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 appetizers, I will divide by 12.",
    "96 appetizers / 12 = 8 dozen."

  "solution": "8"
