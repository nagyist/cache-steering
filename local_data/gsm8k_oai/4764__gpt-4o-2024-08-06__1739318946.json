  "query": "To increase her water intake to the recommended level by her doctor, Happy has to take 40% more cups of water than she takes now. If she is currently drinking 15 cups of water every week, what's the recommended number of cups per week?",
  "steps": [
    "Happy currently drinks 15 cups of water every week.",
    "Her doctor recommends that she should increase her intake by 40%.",
    "To find out how many more cups she needs to drink, I need to calculate 40% of her current intake.",
    "40% of 15 cups is calculated as 0.40 * 15.",
    "0.40 * 15 equals 6 cups.",
    "So, Happy needs to drink 6 more cups than she currently does.",
    "To find the total recommended number of cups, I add the additional cups to her current intake.",
    "That means 15 cups + 6 cups equals 21 cups.",
    "Therefore, the recommended number of cups of water per week for Happy is 21 cups."
