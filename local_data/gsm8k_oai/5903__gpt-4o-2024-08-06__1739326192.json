  "query": "The coffee shop sold 8 more than four times the number of lattes as it did teas. If 6 teas were sold how many lattes did the coffee shop sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I have the information that the coffee shop sold 6 teas.",
    "The problem states that the number of lattes sold is 8 more than four times the number of teas sold.",
    "I know that four times the number of teas sold is calculated by multiplying 6 (the number of teas) by 4.",
    "Calculating this: \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\).",
    "Now I need to add 8 to this result, because the number of lattes is 8 more than four times the teas.",
    "Calculating this: \\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\).",
    "The coffee shop sold 32 lattes."

  "solution": "32"
