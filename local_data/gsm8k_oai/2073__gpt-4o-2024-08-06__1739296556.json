  "query": "Alex had 36 ounces of jelly beans. He ate 6 ounces. Then he divided the rest equally into 3 piles. How much does each pile weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "Alex initially had 36 ounces of jelly beans.",
    "He ate 6 ounces of jelly beans.",
    "To find the amount remaining, subtract the 6 ounces he ate from the initial 36 ounces.",
    "36 ounces - 6 ounces = 30 ounces.",
    "Now, he has 30 ounces of jelly beans remaining.",
    "He divides the 30 ounces equally into 3 piles.",
    "To find out how much each pile weighs, divide 30 ounces by 3.",
    "30 ounces / 3 = 10 ounces."
