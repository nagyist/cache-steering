  "query": "An alien invades Earth.  It abducts 200 people.  He returns 80% of the people abducted.  After that he takes 10 people to another planet.  He took the rest to his home planet.  How many people did he take to his home planet?",
  "steps": [
    "The alien abducts 200 people initially.",
    "He returns 80% of those 200 people.",
    "To find out how many people are returned, calculate 80% of 200.",
    "80% of 200 is 0.8 * 200.",
    "0.8 * 200 equals 160.",
    "So, 160 people are returned to Earth.",
    "Subtract the 160 people who were returned from the original 200 people.",
    "200 - 160 equals 40 people who were not returned.",
    "The alien takes 10 of those 40 people to another planet.",
    "Subtract the 10 people taken to another planet from the 40 people who were not returned.",
    "40 - 10 equals 30.",
    "So, 30 people were taken to his home planet."
