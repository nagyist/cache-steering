  "query": "Making an equal number of drums of paint each day, a paint mixer takes three days to make 18 drums of paint. How many days will it take for him to make 360 drums of paint?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many drums of paint are made each day.",
    "It takes 3 days to make 18 drums of paint.",
    "I divide the total number of drums (18) by the number of days (3) to find the number of drums made per day.",
    "18 drums \u00f7 3 days = 6 drums per day.",
    "Now that I know the painter makes 6 drums per day, I need to find out how many days it will take to make 360 drums.",
    "I divide the total number of drums needed (360) by the number of drums made per day (6).",
    "360 drums \u00f7 6 drums per day = 60 days."
