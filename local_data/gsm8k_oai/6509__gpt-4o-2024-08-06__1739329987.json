  "query": "Sylvie is feeding her turtles. Each turtle needs 1 ounce of food per 1/2 pound of body weight. She has 30 pounds of turtles. Each jar of food contains 15 ounces and costs $2.  How much does it cost to feed the turtles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to determine the total body weight of Sylvie's turtles. She has 30 pounds of turtles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many ounces of food the turtles require. Each turtle needs 1 ounce of food per 1/2 pound of body weight. This means for every pound, each turtle needs 2 ounces of food.",
    "So for 30 pounds of turtles, they need 30 pounds * 2 ounces/pound = 60 ounces of food in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many jars of food Sylvie needs to purchase. Each jar contains 15 ounces of food.",
    "If each jar contains 15 ounces and the turtles need 60 ounces in total, then I calculate the number of jars as 60 ounces / 15 ounces/jar = 4 jars.",
    "The cost of each jar is $2.",
    "Therefore, the total cost is 4 jars * $2/jar = $8."

  "solution": "8"
