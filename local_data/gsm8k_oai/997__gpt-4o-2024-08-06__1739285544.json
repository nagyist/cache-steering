  "query": "Ittymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?",
  "steps": [
    "Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck split the fish equally. This means they each have the same number of fish.",
    "Oomyapeck eats 22 fish eyes in a day. He also gives two eyes to his dog, totaling 24 eyes.",
    "Since fish typically have 2 eyes, Oomyapeck's consumption of 24 eyes implies that 12 fish have been caught. (Because 24 / 2 = 12).",
    "If there are 12 fish and they are split equally among Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck, this means each person gets an equal share from these 12 fish.",
    "12 fish divided by 3 people (Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck) equals 4 fish per person."
