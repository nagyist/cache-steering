  "query": "To get ready for the new school year, Mary brought her two kids shopping. She bought her son James, a coat for $40 and two pairs of jeans. She bought his sister Jamie, a pair of shoes for $30. The total cost of the items was $110. If the two pairs of jeans for James cost the same price, how much did one pair of jeans cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total cost of the items Mary bought for her son James. I know she bought him a coat for $40 and two pairs of jeans.",
    "Let the cost of one pair of jeans be \\( x \\). Then the cost of two pairs of jeans would be \\( 2x \\).",
    "Therefore, the total cost of the items for James would be \\( 40 + 2x \\).",
    "Next, I will determine the total known cost of the items bought for Jamie. I know she bought a pair of shoes for $30.",
    "The total amount spent by Mary is given as $110.",
    "Therefore, the equation for the total cost is: \\( 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \\).",
    "I will now simplify this equation: \\( 40 + 30 \\) gives me $70.",
    "So the equation becomes \\( 70 + 2x = 110 \\).",
    "Next, I will isolate \\( 2x \\) by subtracting 70 from both sides: \\( 2x = 110 - 70 \\).",
    "Solving this gives: \\( 2x = 40 \\).",
    "To find the cost of one pair of jeans, I will divide both sides of the equation by 2: \\( x = 40 / 2 \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( x = 20 \\).",
    "Thus, one pair of jeans costs $20."
