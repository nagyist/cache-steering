  "query": "Pria bought a new car that advertised an estimated gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon. The car has a 12-gallon tank. She filled her car full of gas and was able to drive a total of 372 miles. What was the difference, in miles per gallon, between Pria's mileage and the advertised mileage?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the actual gas mileage Pria achieved with her car.",
    "I know that she drove a total of 372 miles on a full 12-gallon tank of gas.",
    "To find the actual gas mileage, I divide the total miles driven by the number of gallons used.",
    "Performing the calculation: 372 miles \u00f7 12 gallons = 31 miles per gallon.",
    "Now, I compare Pria's actual mileage with the advertised mileage.",
    "The advertised mileage is 35 miles per gallon.",
    "Subtract the actual mileage from the advertised mileage to find the difference: 35 mpg - 31 mpg.",
    "The difference is 4 miles per gallon."
