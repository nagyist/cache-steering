  "query": "A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?",
  "steps": [
    "The tomato plant starts with 100 tomatoes.",
    "Jane picks 1/4 of the 100 tomatoes for use in the house.",
    "Calculating 1/4 of 100: 100 / 4 = 25.",
    "Jane picks 25 tomatoes initially.",
    "Subtracting the 25 picked tomatoes from the initial 100: 100 - 25 = 75.",
    "After the initial picking, 75 tomatoes remain on the plant.",
    "The following week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes.",
    "Subtracting these 20 tomatoes from the remaining 75: 75 - 20 = 55.",
    "After picking 20 tomatoes, 55 tomatoes remain on the plant.",
    "The week after that, Jane picks twice the number she picked the previous week.",
    "Twice the number of 20 is: 2 * 20 = 40.",
    "Jane picks 40 tomatoes in the second week.",
    "Subtracting these 40 tomatoes from the remaining 55: 55 - 40 = 15.",
    "After picking 40 more tomatoes, 15 tomatoes remain on the plant."
