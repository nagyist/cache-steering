  "query": "Liezl prepared four sets of 2-dozen paper cups for her daughter's birthday party. If 5 cups were damaged and 30 were not used, how many paper cups were used?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many paper cups were in the four sets that Liezl prepared.",
    "Each set consists of 2-dozen paper cups. A dozen equals 12, so 2-dozen equals 2 x 12 = 24.",
    "Liezl prepared four sets, each containing 24 paper cups.",
    "I now multiply the number of sets (4) by the number of cups in each set (24).",
    "4 x 24 = 96. So, Liezl initially had 96 paper cups in total.",
    "I know that 5 cups were damaged, meaning these were not used.",
    "I subtract the damaged cups (5) from the total number of cups (96) to find the number of usable cups.",
    "96 - 5 = 91. So, there were 91 usable cups.",
    "From these usable cups, 30 were not used.",
    "I need to subtract the unused cups (30) from the number of usable cups (91) to find out how many were actually used.",
    "91 - 30 = 61. Thus, 61 paper cups were used."

  "solution": "61"
