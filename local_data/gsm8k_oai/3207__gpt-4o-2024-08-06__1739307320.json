  "query": "On a Sunday morning, Josephine sold milk in the farm stall. The buyers brought their containers. She filled three containers with two liters each, two containers with 0.75 liters each, and five containers with 0.5 liters each. How many liters of milk did Josephine sell in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total milk from the containers with two liters each.",
    "Josephine filled three containers with two liters each, so I multiply 3 containers by 2 liters.",
    "3 containers * 2 liters = 6 liters",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total milk from the containers with 0.75 liters each.",
    "Josephine filled two containers with 0.75 liters each, so I multiply 2 containers by 0.75 liters.",
    "2 containers * 0.75 liters = 1.5 liters",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total milk from the containers with 0.5 liters each.",
    "Josephine filled five containers with 0.5 liters each, so I multiply 5 containers by 0.5 liters.",
    "5 containers * 0.5 liters = 2.5 liters",
    "Finally, I need to add up all the liters of milk from each group of containers.",
    "6 liters + 1.5 liters + 2.5 liters = 10 liters"
  ],
  "solution": "10"
