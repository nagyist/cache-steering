  "query": "Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of tickets sold over the three days.",
    "The total revenue from selling tickets is $960, and each ticket costs $4.",
    "To find the number of tickets sold, I will divide the total revenue by the price of one ticket.",
    "I calculate $960 divided by $4.",
    "960 divided by 4 equals 240. So, Carol sold 240 tickets in total over the three days.",
    "Next, I need to find the average number of tickets sold per day.",
    "There are three days in total.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of tickets sold (240) by the number of days (3).",
    "240 divided by 3 equals 80.",
    "So, on average, Carol sold 80 tickets per day."
