  "query": "Julie started her own landscaping business. She charges $4 an hour for mowing lawns and $8 for pulling weeds. In September she mowed lawns for 25 hours and pulled weeds for 3 hours. If she worked the same number of hours in October, how much money did she earn in September and October?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Julie earned in September for mowing lawns.",
    "She charges $4 an hour for mowing lawns and worked 25 hours.",
    "To find the earnings from mowing lawns, multiply 25 hours by $4.",
    "25 hours * $4/hour = $100",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Julie earned in September for pulling weeds.",
    "She charges $8 an hour for pulling weeds and worked 3 hours.",
    "To find the earnings from pulling weeds, multiply 3 hours by $8.",
    "3 hours * $8/hour = $24",
    "Now, I will add the earnings from both activities to find her total earnings for September.",
    "$100 (mowing) + $24 (weeds) = $124",
    "The problem states she worked the same number of hours in October as she did in September.",
    "This means she earned the same amount in October as she did in September, which is $124.",
    "To find her total earnings for both September and October, I need to add the amounts from those two months.",
    "$124 (September) + $124 (October) = $248"
  ],
  "solution": "248"
