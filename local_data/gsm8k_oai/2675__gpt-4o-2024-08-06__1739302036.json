  "query": "After working for Mrs. Jane, Jason was paid 60 more coins than Jayden. If Jayden received 300 coins, how many coins did Mrs. Jane give to the boys in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many coins Jason received.",
    "I know that Jason received 60 more coins than Jayden.",
    "Jayden received 300 coins.",
    "So, to find out how many coins Jason received, I add 60 to Jayden's 300 coins.",
    "300 coins + 60 coins = 360 coins for Jason.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of coins that Mrs. Jane gave to both Jason and Jayden.",
    "Jayden received 300 coins and Jason received 360 coins.",
    "I need to add these amounts together: 300 coins + 360 coins = 660 coins."
