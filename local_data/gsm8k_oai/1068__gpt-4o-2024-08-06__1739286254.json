  "query": "Matt is playing basketball. In the first quarter, he made 2-point shots four times and 3-point shots twice. How many points did he score for that quarter?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many 2-point shots Matt made. He made 2-point shots four times.",
    "Next, I calculate the total points from 2-point shots. The number of 2-point shots is 4, and each is worth 2 points.",
    "Total points from 2-point shots = 4 * 2 = 8 points.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 3-point shots Matt made. He made 3-point shots twice.",
    "I will calculate the total points from 3-point shots. The number of 3-point shots is 2, and each is worth 3 points.",
    "Total points from 3-point shots = 2 * 3 = 6 points.",
    "To find the overall total points from both types of shots, I add the points from 2-point shots and 3-point shots together.",
    "Total points scored in the quarter = 8 points (from 2-point shots) + 6 points (from 3-point shots).",
    "8 + 6 equals 14."

  "solution": "14"
