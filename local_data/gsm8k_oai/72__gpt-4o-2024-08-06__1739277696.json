  "query": "Nancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the total capacity of the aquarium, I need to calculate the volume.",
    "The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.",
    "The length of the aquarium is 4 feet.",
    "The width of the aquarium is 6 feet.",
    "The height of the aquarium is 3 feet.",
    "So, the total volume is 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3 cubic feet.",
    "Calculating the volume gives me 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.",
    "Next, 24 \u00d7 3 = 72 cubic feet.",
    "The total capacity of the aquarium is 72 cubic feet.",
    "Nancy fills the aquarium halfway initially.",
    "Half of 72 cubic feet is 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 cubic feet.",
    "While Nancy is away, the cat spills half of the water in the aquarium.",
    "Half of 36 cubic feet is 36 \u00f7 2 = 18 cubic feet.",
    "After the spill, there are 18 cubic feet of water left in the aquarium.",
    "When Nancy returns, she triples the amount of water.",
    "Triple of 18 cubic feet is 18 \u00d7 3 = 54 cubic feet.",
    "Therefore, after Nancy refills the aquarium, there are 54 cubic feet of water."

  "solution": "54"
