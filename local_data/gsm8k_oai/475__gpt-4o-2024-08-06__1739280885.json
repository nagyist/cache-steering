  "query": "Maggie picked 40 apples. Kelsey picked 28 apples. Layla picked some apples, too. The three averaged 30 apples picked. How many did Layla pick?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of apples picked to meet the average.",
    "There are three people, and the average number of apples picked per person is 30.",
    "To find the total apples picked by all three, multiply the average by the number of people: 30 apples/person * 3 people = 90 apples.",
    "Next, calculate the number of apples picked by Maggie and Kelsey together.",
    "Maggie picked 40 apples and Kelsey picked 28 apples.",
    "Add 40 and 28: 40 + 28 = 68 apples.",
    "Now, determine how many apples Layla picked. Subtract the apples Maggie and Kelsey picked from the total apples.",
    "Subtract 68 from 90: 90 - 68 = 22 apples."

  "solution": "22"
