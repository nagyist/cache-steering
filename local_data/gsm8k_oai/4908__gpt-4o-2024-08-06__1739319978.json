  "query": "Noah has two closets. Each closet can fit 1/4 as much as Ali's closet, which can fit 200 pairs of jeans.  How many jeans can both Noah\u2019s closets fit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pairs of jeans one of Noah's closets can fit.",
    "I know that each of Noah's closets can fit 1/4 as many pairs as Ali's closet.",
    "Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans.",
    "Now I calculate 1/4 of 200 to find out how many pairs one of Noah's closets can fit.",
    "1/4 of 200 is 200 divided by 4.",
    "200 divided by 4 equals 50.",
    "So, one of Noah's closets can fit 50 pairs of jeans.",
    "Noah has two closets, so I need to find out how many pairs can both his closets fit together.",
    "I will multiply the number of pairs one closet can fit (50) by 2 because there are two closets.",
    "50 times 2 equals 100."

  "solution": "100"
