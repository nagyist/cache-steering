  "query": "Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?",
  "steps": [
    "Josh has 18 yards of ribbon initially.",
    "Josh wants to divide the ribbon equally among 6 gifts.",
    "Each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon.",
    "First, I calculate how much ribbon will be used for 6 gifts.",
    "I multiply the 2 yards per gift by the 6 gifts to find the total ribbon used.",
    "2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.",
    "Now I subtract the ribbon used from the total ribbon Josh had initially.",
    "18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards."
