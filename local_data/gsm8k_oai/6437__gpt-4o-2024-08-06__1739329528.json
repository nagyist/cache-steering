  "query": "A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total time it takes for a robot to complete one battery. This includes both gathering the materials and creating the battery.",
    "Gathering materials takes 6 minutes and creating the battery takes 9 minutes.",
    "I add these two times together: 6 minutes + 9 minutes = 15 minutes.",
    "So, it takes a single robot 15 minutes to manufacture one battery.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 5 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in one hour. Therefore, 5 hours is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.",
    "Now, I divide the total minutes available (300 minutes) by the time it takes to make one battery (15 minutes).",
    "300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries.",
    "This means one robot can manufacture 20 batteries in 5 hours.",
    "The factory has 10 robots working simultaneously.",
    "So, I multiply the number of batteries one robot can manufacture (20 batteries) by the number of robots (10).",
    "20 batteries * 10 robots = 200 batteries.",
    "Therefore, the factory can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours."
