  "query": "A 10 meters yarn was cut into 5 equal parts. If 3 parts were used for crocheting, how long was used for crocheting?",
  "steps": [
    "The original length of the yarn is 10 meters.",
    "The yarn is cut into 5 equal parts.",
    "To find the length of each part, divide the total length by the number of parts: 10 meters / 5 parts.",
    "10 meters divided by 5 equals 2 meters per part.",
    "3 parts were used for crocheting.",
    "To find the total length used for crocheting, multiply the length of one part by the number of parts used: 2 meters/part * 3 parts.",
    "2 meters/part times 3 parts equals 6 meters."
