  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many aluminum cans Sarah collected yesterday.",
    "Sarah collected 50 aluminum cans yesterday.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many aluminum cans Lara collected yesterday.",
    "Lara collected 30 more cans than Sarah yesterday.",
    "So, Lara collected 50 + 30 = 80 aluminum cans yesterday.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of cans collected by Sarah and Lara yesterday.",
    "Sarah and Lara collected 50 + 80 = 130 aluminum cans yesterday.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many cans Sarah collected today.",
    "Today, Sarah collected 40 aluminum cans.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cans Lara collected today.",
    "Today, Lara collected 70 aluminum cans.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of cans collected by Sarah and Lara today.",
    "Sarah and Lara collected 40 + 70 = 110 aluminum cans today.",
    "Finally, I need to find out how many fewer cans they collected today than yesterday.",
    "The difference is 130 - 110 = 20 cans."
