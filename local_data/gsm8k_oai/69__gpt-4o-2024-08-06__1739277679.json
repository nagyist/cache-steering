  "steps": [
    "Carly collected 7 starfish.",
    "Each starfish has 5 arms.",
    "To find the total number of arms from the 7 starfish, I need to multiply the number of starfish by the number of arms each has.",
    "7 starfish * 5 arms = 35 arms from the starfish.",
    "Carly also collected one seastar.",
    "The seastar has 14 arms.",
    "Next, I need to add the number of arms from the starfish and the seastar to find the total number of arms.",
    "35 arms from the starfish + 14 arms from the seastar = 49 arms."
