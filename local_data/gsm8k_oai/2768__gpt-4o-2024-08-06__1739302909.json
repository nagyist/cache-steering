    "Robert starts with 25 balls.",
    "Tim has 40 balls initially.",
    "Tim gave Robert half of his 40 balls, so I need to find half of 40.",
    "Half of 40 is calculated by dividing 40 by 2.",
    "40 divided by 2 is 20.",
    "So, Tim gives Robert 20 balls.",
    "Now, I add the 20 balls from Tim to Robert's initial 25 balls.",
    "25 + 20 equals 45."
