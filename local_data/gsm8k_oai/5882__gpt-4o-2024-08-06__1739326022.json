  "query": "On Saturdays and Sundays, Suzanne makes french toast for the family.  She and her husband each have 1 whole slice and her daughters split 1 slice.  She uses a thick sliced bread that comes 12 slices per loaf.  Over 52 weeks, how many loaves of bread will she need to make french toast?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many slices of bread are consumed each weekend.",
    "On Saturdays, Suzanne and her husband eat 1 slice each, so that is 2 slices. Her daughters split 1 slice, which is an additional 1 slice.",
    "So on Saturday, they consume a total of 2 + 1 = 3 slices.",
    "On Sundays, the routine will be the same as Saturday.",
    "Therefore, on Sunday as well, they consume 3 slices.",
    "In total for one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they consume 3 slices on Saturday plus 3 slices on Sunday.",
    "So, for one weekend, the total consumption is 3 + 3 = 6 slices.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many slices are consumed in 52 weekends.",
    "I multiply the number of slices per weekend by the number of weeks: 6 slices/weekend * 52 weekends = 312 slices.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many loaves of bread this will require.",
    "Each loaf contains 12 slices of bread.",
    "I divide the total number of slices needed by the slices per loaf: 312 slices / 12 slices/loaf.",
    "This division gives me 26 loaves.",
    "Since 312 divided by 12 is exactly 26, it means there is no remainder and no additional bread is needed for extra slices."

  "solution": "26"
