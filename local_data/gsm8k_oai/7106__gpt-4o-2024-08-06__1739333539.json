  "query": "Alex has 4 new shirts. Joe has 3 more new shirts than Alex. If Ben has eight more new shirts than Joe, how many new shirts does Ben have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many new shirts Joe has.",
    "I know that Joe has 3 more new shirts than Alex.",
    "Alex has 4 new shirts.",
    "Therefore, Joe has 4 + 3 = 7 new shirts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many new shirts Ben has.",
    "I know that Ben has eight more new shirts than Joe.",
    "Joe has 7 new shirts.",
    "Therefore, Ben has 7 + 8 = 15 new shirts."
