  "query": "Oscar wants to train for a marathon. He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run. How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "Oscar starts at 2 miles.",
    "His goal is to reach a 20-mile run.",
    "The difference between his goal and current distance is 20 miles - 2 miles = 18 miles.",
    "He plans to add 2/3 of a mile per week.",
    "To find out how many weeks it will take, divide the total increase in distance needed (18 miles) by the weekly increase (2/3 mile).",
    "Calculate 18 \u00f7 (2/3).",
    "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2.",
    "So, 18 \u00f7 (2/3) is the same as 18 \u00d7 (3/2).",
    "Calculate 18 \u00d7 3 = 54.",
    "Divide by 2 to complete the multiplication: 54 \u00f7 2 = 27."
  ],
  "solution": "27"
