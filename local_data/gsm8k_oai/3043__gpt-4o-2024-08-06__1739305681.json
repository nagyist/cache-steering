  "query": "Mark started the day with 14 buttons. His friend Shane gave him 3 times that amount of buttons. Then his other friend Sam asked if he could have half of Mark\u2019s buttons. How many buttons did Mark end up with?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark started with 14 buttons.",
    "Shane gave Mark 3 times that amount of buttons.",
    "3 times 14 is 42.",
    "So, Shane gave Mark 42 buttons.",
    "Now, I add the buttons Shane gave Mark to the original amount Mark had.",
    "14 (original buttons) + 42 (buttons from Shane) = 56 buttons in total.",
    "Sam asked if he could have half of Mark's buttons.",
    "Half of 56 is 28.",
    "After giving half of the buttons to Sam, I subtract 28 from 56.",
    "56 - 28 = 28"
