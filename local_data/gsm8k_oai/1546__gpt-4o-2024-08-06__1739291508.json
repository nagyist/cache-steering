  "query": "A woman is trying to decide whether it will be quicker to take an airplane or drive herself to a job interview. If she drives herself, the trip will take her 3 hours and 15 minutes.  If she takes an airplane, she will first need to drive 10 minutes to the airport, and then wait 20 minutes to board the plane.  After that, she will be on the airplane for one-third of the time it would have taken her to drive herself before landing in the destination city. Finally, it will take her an additional 10 minutes to get off the airplane and arrive at her interview site after the plane lands.  Given this information, how many minutes faster is it for her to take the airplane?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes for her to drive herself to the interview. It is given that driving takes her 3 hours and 15 minutes.",
    "Next, I will convert the driving time into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Adding the additional 15 minutes gives 180 + 15 = 195 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total time it will take if she chooses to take the airplane.",
    "The first part of the airplane route involves driving 10 minutes to the airport.",
    "Then, she waits 20 minutes to board the plane.",
    "Now I calculate the time spent on the airplane. It is one-third of the time it would have taken her to drive. I already calculated that driving takes 195 minutes, so one-third of 195 minutes is 195 / 3 = 65 minutes.",
    "Finally, she will take an additional 10 minutes after landing to arrive at her interview site.",
    "I will now sum all the times associated with taking the airplane: the 10 minutes of driving, 20 minutes of waiting, 65 minutes flying, and 10 minutes after landing. That is 10 + 20 + 65 + 10 = 105 minutes.",
    "I need to find out how many minutes faster it is to take the airplane compared to driving.",
    "I subtract the airplane time from the driving time: 195 minutes (driving) - 105 minutes (airplane) = 90 minutes."
