  "query": "In four years, Suzy will be twice Mary's age then. If Suzy is 20 now, how old is Mary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to write down the information given. Suzy is currently 20 years old.",
    "In four years, Suzy will be 20 + 4 = 24 years old.",
    "We are told that in four years, Suzy's age will be twice Mary's age. Mathematically, this can be represented as: 24 = 2 * (Mary's age in four years).",
    "To find Mary's age in four years, I need to solve the equation: 24 = 2 * (Mary's age in four years).",
    "Dividing both sides by 2 gives me Mary's age in four years as 12.",
    "Currently, Mary's age would be 12 - 4 = 8 because four years from now she will be 12.",
    "I have calculated that Mary is currently 8 years old."

  "solution": "8"
