  "query": "Derrick measures the length of his yard. The length of Alex's yard is half the size of Derrick's and the length of Brianne's yard is 6 times the size of Alex's. If Brianne's yard is 30 yards long, how long is Derrick's yard, in yards?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out the length of Derrick's yard. To do this, I first need to know the relationships between the yard lengths.",
    "The problem states that Brianne's yard is 6 times the size of Alex's.",
    "I know that Brianne's yard is 30 yards long.",
    "If Brianne's yard is 6 times Alex's, then I can find Alex's yard by dividing Brianne's yard length by 6.",
    "30 yards / 6 = 5 yards.",
    "Therefore, Alex's yard is 5 yards long.",
    "The problem also states that the length of Alex's yard is half the size of Derrick's yard.",
    "To find Derrick's yard, I multiply Alex's yard length by 2.",
    "5 yards * 2 = 10 yards."

  "solution": "10"
