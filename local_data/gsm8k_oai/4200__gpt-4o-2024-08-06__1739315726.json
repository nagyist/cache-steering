  "query": "Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. If Alexis has 60 mangoes, how many mangoes does all of them have combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define the variables to keep track of the mangoes each person has. Let D represent the number of mangoes Dilan has, A represent the number of mangoes Ashley has, and X represent the number of mangoes Alexis has.",
    "We know that Alexis has 60 mangoes, so X = 60.",
    "According to the problem, Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. Therefore, X = 4 * (D + A).",
    "Since we know X = 60, we can set up the equation: 60 = 4 * (D + A).",
    "To find D + A, we need to solve the equation: (D + A) = 60 / 4.",
    "60 divided by 4 equals 15. So, D + A = 15.",
    "Now we know that Alexis has 60 mangoes and Dilan and Ashley combined have 15 mangoes.",
    "To find the total number of mangoes they have combined, we add Alexis's mangoes with the combined count of Dilan and Ashley.",
    "The total number of mangoes they have combined is 60 + 15 = 75."

  "solution": "75"
