  "query": "Fabian bought a brand new computer mouse and keyboard to be able to work from home. The cost of the keyboard was three times greater than the cost of the mouse. If the mouse cost $16, how much did Fabian spent on his new accessories?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the mouse costs $16.",
    "The problem states that the keyboard costs three times more than the mouse.",
    "To find the cost of the keyboard, I need to multiply the cost of the mouse by 3.",
    "Calculating the cost of the keyboard: $16 * 3 = $48.",
    "Now that I know the cost of both the mouse and the keyboard, I can find the total cost.",
    "The total cost is the sum of the cost of the mouse and the cost of the keyboard.",
    "Total cost = $16 (mouse) + $48 (keyboard) = $64."

  "solution": "64"
