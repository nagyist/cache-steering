  "query": "Anton has three times as many cards in his collection as Heike does. Ann has six times as many cards as Heike does. If Ann has 60 cards, how many more cards does Ann have more than Anton?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know Ann has six times as many cards as Heike.",
    "It's given that Ann has 60 cards.",
    "I can set up the equation: Ann's cards = 6 \u00d7 Heike's cards.",
    "So, 60 = 6 \u00d7 Heike's cards.",
    "To find the number of cards Heike has, divide 60 by 6.",
    "60 \u00f7 6 = 10.",
    "Heike has 10 cards.",
    "Anton has three times as many cards as Heike.",
    "So, I calculate Anton's cards: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.",
    "Anton has 30 cards.",
    "Now, I need to find how many more cards Ann has than Anton.",
    "Ann has 60 cards and Anton has 30 cards.",
    "To find the difference, subtract Anton's cards from Ann's cards: 60 - 30.",
    "60 - 30 = 30."

  "solution": "30"
