  "query": "Ethan makes beeswax candles.  For each candle, he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil.  If he makes three less than 10 candles, what will be the combined weight of the candles in ounces?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many candles Ethan makes.",
    "The problem states that he makes three less than 10 candles.",
    "So, 10 - 3 = 7 candles.",
    "Next, I need to find out the weight of one candle.",
    "Each candle uses 8 ounces of beeswax.",
    "Each candle also uses 1 ounce of coconut oil.",
    "Therefore, the total weight of one candle would be 8 + 1 = 9 ounces.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total combined weight of all the candles.",
    "He makes 7 candles, and each candle weighs 9 ounces.",
    "The total weight is 7 candles * 9 ounces each = 63 ounces."
  ],
  "solution": "63"
