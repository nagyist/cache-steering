  "query": "Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?",
  "steps": [
    "Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill.",
    "Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth.",
    "We need to find how long it takes Tom to climb the hill in minutes first.",
    "Elizabeth takes 30 minutes, so Tom takes 4 times 30 minutes.",
    "4 times 30 minutes is 120 minutes.",
    "Now, we convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "We divide 120 minutes by 60 to find the number of hours.",
    "120 divided by 60 is 2 hours."
