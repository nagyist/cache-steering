  "query": "After uploading her video to Youtube, Kallie received 4000 views on the first day. When she checked her channel 4 days later, she realized that the number of views had increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day. If 50000 more people viewed the video after another two days, determine the number of views the video had gained on Youtube?",
  "steps": [
    "Kallie initially received 4000 views on the first day.",
    "After 4 days, the number of views increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day.",
    "The increase is 10 times the views on the first day, so it's 10 * 4000 = 40000.",
    "Now, let's add this increase to the original number of views: 4000 + 40000 = 44000 views after 4 days.",
    "After another two days, 50000 more people viewed the video.",
    "Add these new views to the total from before: 44000 + 50000 = 94000 views."

  "solution": "94000"
