    "Divide 184 by 2 to find the number of dogs: \\(d = \\frac{184}{2}\\).",

    "Calculate 1/4 of 184: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 184 = 46\\).",

    "The owner also decides to sell 3/4 of the dogs.",
    "Calculate 3/4 of 92: \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 92 = 69\\).",
    "The owner sells 69 dogs.",
    "Calculate the remaining dogs: \\(92 - 69 = 23\\).",
