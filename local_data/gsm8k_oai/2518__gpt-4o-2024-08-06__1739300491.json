  "query": "Elsa gets 500 MB of cell phone data each month. If she spends 300 MB watching Youtube and 2/5 of what's left on Facebook, how many MB of data does she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Elsa starts with 500 MB of data each month.",
    "She spends 300 MB watching Youtube.",
    "To find out how much data she has left, I need to subtract the data used for Youtube from the total data. That is, 500 MB - 300 MB.",
    "500 MB - 300 MB equals 200 MB of data remaining.",
    "Elsa then uses 2/5 of the remaining 200 MB on Facebook.",
    "To calculate 2/5 of 200 MB, I multiply 200 MB by 2/5.",
    "200 MB multiplied by 2/5 equals 80 MB.",
    "She uses 80 MB on Facebook.",
    "To find out how much data Elsa has left after Facebook, I subtract the data used for Facebook from the remaining data after Youtube. That is, 200 MB - 80 MB.",
    "200 MB - 80 MB equals 120 MB."
