  "query": "Quinton is looking to add 4 fruit trees to his backyard.  He wants to plant 2 apple trees that will be 10 feet wide each and need 12 feet between them.  The peach trees will be closer to the house and will grow to be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between each tree.  All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the space required for the apple trees.",
    "Each apple tree will be 10 feet wide.",
    "There are 2 apple trees, so their combined width is 2 x 10 = 20 feet.",
    "Additionally, the apple trees need 12 feet of space between them.",
    "So the total space for the apple trees is 20 + 12 = 32 feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the space needed for the peach trees.",
    "Each peach tree will grow to be 12 feet wide.",
    "There are 2 peach trees, so their combined width is 2 x 12 = 24 feet.",
    "The peach trees need 15 feet of space between them.",
    "So the total space for the peach trees is 24 + 15 = 39 feet.",
    "Now, to find the total space needed for all the trees, I add the space required for the apple and peach trees.",
    "This will be 32 feet (for the apple trees) + 39 feet (for the peach trees).",
    "Thus, the total space the trees will take up in the yard is 32 + 39 = 71 feet."

  "solution": "71"
