  "query": "Mr. and Mrs. Hugo went on a road trip. On the first day, they traveled 200 miles. On the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far. On the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined. How many miles did they travel for 3 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine how many miles the Hugos traveled on the second day.",
    "On the first day, they traveled 200 miles.",
    "On the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far as the first day.",
    "I will calculate 3/4 of 200 miles: (3/4) * 200 = 150.",
    "So on the second day, they traveled 150 miles.",
    "Next, I will determine how many miles they traveled on the third day.",
    "I will first calculate the total miles traveled on the first two days: 200 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 350 miles.",
    "On the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined.",
    "I will calculate 1/2 of 350 miles: (1/2) * 350 = 175.",
    "On the third day, they traveled 175 miles.",
    "Now, I will find the total number of miles they traveled over the 3 days.",
    "I will add the miles from each day: 200 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) + 175 miles (third day) = 525 miles."

  "solution": "525"
