  "query": "With 82 students, there are 2 students for each computer. If there are 16 more students, how many computers must they have in total to continue with 2 students per computer?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that with 82 students and 2 students per computer, I need to find out how many computers there are already.",
    "I divide the 82 students by 2 students per computer.",
    "82 divided by 2 is 41. So, there are currently 41 computers.",
    "Now, I need to consider what happens if there are 16 more students.",
    "Adding 16 more students to the original 82 students gives me a total of 98 students.",
    "With 98 students and the requirement of 2 students per computer, I need to calculate how many computers are needed now.",
    "I divide the 98 students by 2 students per computer to find out how many computers are needed.",
    "98 divided by 2 is 49. So, they need 49 computers in total."
