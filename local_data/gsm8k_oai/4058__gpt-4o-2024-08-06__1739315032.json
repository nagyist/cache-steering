    "I need to find out how old Tom's dog is going to be in six years.",
    "Currently, Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog.",
    "In 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years old.",
    "I can find Tom's brother's current age by subtracting six years from 30.",
    "Tom's brother is currently 30 - 6 = 24 years old.",
    "Since Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog, I can divide Tom's brother's current age by 4 to find out Tom's dog's current age.",
    "Tom's dog's current age is 24 / 4 = 6 years old.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the age of Tom's dog in six years.",
    "In six years, Tom's dog will be 6 + 6 = 12 years old."
