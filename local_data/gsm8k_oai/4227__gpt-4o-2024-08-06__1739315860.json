  "query": "A community is building a metal fence. Each fence panel is made of 3 metal sheets, and 2 metal beams. The fence is made of 10 fence panels. If each sheet is made of 10 metal rods and each metal beam is made of 4 metal rods, how many metal rods does the community need for the fence?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many metal sheets are used in total for all 10 fence panels.",
    "Each fence panel is made up of 3 metal sheets.",
    "Since there are 10 fence panels, the total number of metal sheets needed is 10 panels \u00d7 3 sheets per panel = 30 sheets.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many metal beams are used in total for all 10 fence panels.",
    "Each fence panel is made up of 2 metal beams.",
    "Since there are 10 fence panels, the total number of metal beams needed is 10 panels \u00d7 2 beams per panel = 20 beams.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many metal rods are required for all the metal sheets.",
    "Each metal sheet is made of 10 metal rods.",
    "So, for 30 metal sheets, the total number of metal rods needed is 30 sheets \u00d7 10 rods per sheet = 300 rods.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many metal rods are required for all the metal beams.",
    "Each metal beam is made of 4 metal rods.",
    "So, for 20 metal beams, the total number of metal rods needed is 20 beams \u00d7 4 rods per beam = 80 rods.",
    "Finally, I will add together the metal rods needed for both the sheets and the beams to find the total number of metal rods needed.",
    "The total number of metal rods needed is 300 rods (from sheets) + 80 rods (from beams) = 380 rods."
