  "query": "A shop sells laptops at $600 each and a smartphone at $400.  Celine buys two laptops and four smartphones for her children. How much change does she get back if she has $3000?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the cost of two laptops. Each laptop costs $600.",
    "Cost of two laptops = 2 * $600 = $1200.",
    "Next, determine the cost of four smartphones. Each smartphone costs $400.",
    "Cost of four smartphones = 4 * $400 = $1600.",
    "Now, add the costs of the laptops and smartphones to find the total cost of the purchases.",
    "Total cost = $1200 (laptops) + $1600 (smartphones) = $2800.",
    "Celine has $3000. To find out how much change she gets back, subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount of money she initially has.",
    "Change = $3000 - $2800 = $200."
