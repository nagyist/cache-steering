  "query": "Phoebe eats 1 serving and gives her dog 1 serving of peanut butter for a bedtime snack. Each jar of peanut butter has 15 servings.  How many jars will she need to make sure she and her dog have enough to last for 30 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Phoebe eats 1 serving of peanut butter each day.",
    "Her dog also eats 1 serving of peanut butter each day.",
    "Together, Phoebe and her dog eat 2 servings of peanut butter per day.",
    "I need to find out how many total servings are needed for 30 days.",
    "There are 2 servings consumed each day, and there are 30 days.",
    "So, the total number of servings needed is 2 servings/day * 30 days.",
    "Calculating this gives 2 * 30 = 60 servings.",
    "Each jar contains 15 servings.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many jars are needed for 60 servings.",
    "I divide the total number of servings needed, 60, by the number of servings per jar, 15.",
    "60 servings \u00f7 15 servings/jar = 4 jars.",
    "Phoebe will need 4 jars to have enough peanut butter for 30 days."
