  "query": "Oliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese. He wants to know which is the better value, so instead of just looking at the overall price, he looks at the price per ounce. The larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the price per ounce for each box.",
    "I'll start with the larger box. It weighs 30 ounces and costs $4.80.",
    "To find the price per ounce, divide the total cost by the number of ounces: $4.80 / 30 ounces.",
    "Keep in mind that $4.80 is 480 cents (since there are 100 cents in a dollar).",
    "So, 480 cents / 30 ounces = 16 cents per ounce for the larger box.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the price per ounce for the smaller box. It weighs 20 ounces and costs $3.40.",
    "Convert $3.40 into cents, which is 340 cents.",
    "Divide the total cost by the number of ounces: 340 cents / 20 ounces.",
    "340 cents / 20 ounces = 17 cents per ounce for the smaller box.",
    "Now, I need to compare the price per ounce of the two boxes to determine the better value.",
    "The larger box costs 16 cents per ounce, and the smaller box costs 17 cents per ounce.",
    "The larger box has the lower cost per ounce."

  "solution": "16"
