  "query": "Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?",
  "steps": [
    "We're told the number of women at the office is reduced by 20% when 6 women are in the meeting.",
    "If reducing the women by 20% means 6 women, then these 6 women are 20% of the total women.",
    "To find the total number of women, we use the equation: 0.20 * total_women = 6.",
    "To find total_women, divide 6 by 0.20, which calculates to 6 / 0.20 = 30.",
    "There are 30 women in the office before the meeting started.",
    "There is an even number of men and women in Ryan's office.",
    "Since there are 30 women, the number of men must also be 30.",
    "The total number of people working at Ryan's office equals the sum of the men and women.",
    "Therefore, the total number of people at the office is 30 men + 30 women = 60 people."

  "solution": "60"
