  "query": "Jason joined the military when he turned 18.  It took him 8 years to raise to the rank of chief.  Then 25% longer than that to go from chief to master chief.  He then spent 10 years more in the military before retiring.  How old was he when he retired?",
  "steps": [
    "Jason joined the military at age 18.",
    "It took him 8 years to rise to the rank of chief.",
    "To reach the rank of chief, Jason was 18 + 8 = 26 years old.",
    "From chief to master chief, it took him 25% longer than the 8 years he spent to become chief.",
    "25% of 8 years is \\( 0.25 \\times 8 = 2 \\) years.",
    "Thus, it took him 8 + 2 = 10 years to go from chief to master chief.",
    "Jason was 26 + 10 = 36 years old when he became a master chief.",
    "After becoming a master chief, he spent an additional 10 years in the military before retiring.",
    "Therefore, Jason was 36 + 10 = 46 years old when he retired."
