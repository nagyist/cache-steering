  "query": "James supercharges his car which increases his car's speed by 30%.  He then cuts weight by 15% which increases the speed a further 10 mph.  If his car's original speed was 150 mph what is the new speed?",
  "steps": [
    "James's original speed is 150 mph.",
    "Supercharging the car increases the speed by 30%.",
    "30% of 150 mph is calculated as 0.30 \u00d7 150 = 45 mph.",
    "Adding this increase to the original speed gives 150 + 45 = 195 mph.",
    "The weight reduction increases the speed by an additional 10 mph.",
    "Adding this increase gives 195 + 10 = 205 mph."

  "solution": "205"
