  "query": "A group of nine turtles sat on a log.  Two less than three times the original number of turtles climbed onto the log with the original group, creating an even larger group on the log.  Suddenly, half of the large group of turtles were frightened by a sound and jumped off of the log and ran away.  How many turtles remained on the log?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the original number of turtles on the log.",
    "The original group of turtles consists of 9 turtles.",
    "I need to calculate the number of additional turtles that climbed onto the log.",
    "The problem states that \"two less than three times the original number of turtles\" climbed onto the log.",
    "To find three times the original number of turtles, I multiply 9 by 3.",
    "3 times 9 is equal to 27.",
    "Now, I subtract 2 from 27 to find the number of additional turtles.",
    "27 minus 2 equals 25.",
    "Therefore, 25 turtles climbed onto the log in addition to the original 9.",
    "To find the total number of turtles on the log, I add the original group and the new turtles.",
    "9 plus 25 equals 34.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of turtles that ran away.",
    "Half of the large group of turtles were frightened and jumped off.",
    "Half of 34 is equal to 34 divided by 2.",
    "34 divided by 2 equals 17.",
    "So, 17 turtles ran away.",
    "To find the number of turtles that remained on the log, I subtract the number of turtles that ran away from the total.",
    "34 minus 17 equals 17."
