  "query": "Lucy plans to purchase potato chips for a party. Ten people will be at the party, including Lucy. The potato chips cost 25 cents per pound. How much will Lucy pay (in dollars) for the potato chips if she wants each person to get 1.2 pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pounds of potato chips are needed in total.",
    "There are ten people at the party, including Lucy. Each person will get 1.2 pounds of potato chips.",
    "To find the total pounds needed, I multiply the number of people by the amount per person: 10 people * 1.2 pounds/person.",
    "10 * 1.2 is 12.",
    "So, Lucy needs to buy 12 pounds of potato chips.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much 12 pounds of potato chips will cost.",
    "Potato chips cost 25 cents per pound.",
    "To find the total cost in cents, I multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound: 12 pounds * 25 cents/pound.",
    "12 * 25 is 300 cents.",
    "To convert the cost from cents to dollars, I divide by 100, since there are 100 cents in a dollar.",
    "300 cents / 100 is 3 dollars."
