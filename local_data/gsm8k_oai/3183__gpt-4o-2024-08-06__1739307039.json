  "query": "There are 400 students. 120 students take dance as their elective. 200 students take art as their elective. The rest take music. What percentage of students take music?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students who take music.",
    "There are 400 students in total.",
    "120 students take dance.",
    "200 students take art.",
    "I will add the students taking dance and art to find how many students do not take music.",
    "120 (dance) + 200 (art) = 320 students take either dance or art.",
    "To find the number of students taking music, I will subtract the number of students taking dance or art from the total number of students.",
    "400 (total students) - 320 (students taking dance or art) = 80 students take music.",
    "Now, I need to find the percentage of students who take music.",
    "I will use the formula for percentage: (part/total) \u00d7 100%.",
    "The part is 80 students taking music, and the total is 400 students.",
    "(80/400) \u00d7 100% = 20%."
