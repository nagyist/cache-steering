    "Each dandelion produces 300 seeds.",
    "1/3 of the seeds land in water and die. Let's calculate how many seeds that is: 300 * (1/3) = 100 seeds.",
    "Subtract the seeds that land in water from the total number of seeds: 300 - 100 = 200 seeds remain.",
    "1/6 of the original number of seeds are eaten by insects. That means 300 * (1/6) = 50 seeds are eaten by insects.",
    "Subtract the seeds eaten by insects from the remaining seeds: 200 - 50 = 150 seeds remain.",
    "Half of the remaining seeds sprout and are immediately eaten. Let's calculate how many that is: 150 * (1/2) = 75 seeds.",
    "Subtract the seeds that are eaten from sprouting: 150 - 75 = 75 seeds remain.",
    "These remaining 75 seeds are the ones that survive long enough to flower."
