  "query": "Remi wants to drink more water. He has a refillable water bottle that holds 20 ounces of water. That week Remi refills the bottle 3 times a day and drinks the whole bottle each time except for twice when he accidentally spills 5 ounces the first time and 8 ounces the second time. In 7 days how many ounces of water does Remi drink?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how many ounces Remi drinks if he refills the bottle 3 times a day for 7 days without any spills.",
    "Each refill is 20 ounces.",
    "Remi refills the bottle 3 times a day. So, he drinks 20 ounces \u00d7 3 times = 60 ounces per day.",
    "Over 7 days, he drinks 60 ounces/day \u00d7 7 days = 420 ounces without spills.",
    "Now calculate the ounces lost from the spills.",
    "Remi spills 5 ounces the first time.",
    "Remi spills 8 ounces the second time.",
    "Total ounces spilled = 5 ounces + 8 ounces = 13 ounces.",
    "Subtract the spilled ounces from the total without spills to find out how much he actually drinks.",
    "Total ounces Remi drinks = 420 ounces - 13 ounces = 407 ounces."

  "solution": "407"
