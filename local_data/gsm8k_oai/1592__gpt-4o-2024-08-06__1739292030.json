    "Betty has 20 books.",
    "Her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty.",
    "To find how many books her sister has, first calculate 1/4 of Betty's books: 1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5.",
    "Since her sister has 5 more books than Betty, add these to Betty's books: 20 + 5 = 25.",
    "Her sister has 25 books.",
    "To find the total number of books they both have, add Betty's and her sister's books together: 20 + 25.",
    "20 + 25 = 45."
