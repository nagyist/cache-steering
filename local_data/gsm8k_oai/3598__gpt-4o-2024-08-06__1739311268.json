  "query": "Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons in addition to her 10 pieces of macarons for a party. If 15 pieces of macarons are left over, how many pieces of macarons were eaten?",
  "steps": [
    "Emma bought 3 dozens of macarons.",
    "A dozen is equivalent to 12 pieces.",
    "So, 3 dozens of macarons equals 3 * 12 pieces.",
    "3 * 12 = 36 pieces of macarons.",
    "Emma already had 10 pieces of macarons.",
    "The total number of macarons that Emma had is 36 pieces from the dozens plus the 10 pieces she already had.",
    "36 + 10 = 46 pieces of macarons.",
    "Emma had a total of 46 pieces of macarons for the party.",
    "There were 15 pieces of macarons left over after the party.",
    "The number of macarons that were eaten is the total number she had minus the number left over.",
    "46 - 15 = 31 pieces of macarons were eaten."
