  "steps": [
    "The cost of the dictionary is $5.",
    "The cost of the dinosaur book is $11.",
    "The cost of the children's cookbook is $5.",
    "To find the total cost of the books, add the individual prices: $5 + $11 + $5.",
    "Calculate the sum: $5 + $11 = $16.",
    "Add the cost of the children's cookbook: $16 + $5 = $21.",
    "The total cost of all three books is $21.",
    "Emir has saved $19.",
    "To find out how much more money Emir needs, subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost: $21 - $19.",
