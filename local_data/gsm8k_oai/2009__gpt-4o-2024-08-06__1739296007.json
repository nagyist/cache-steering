  "query": "The marching band has 110 members.  There are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind, and twice as many woodwinds as brass.  How many brass players are there?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out the number of brass players in the marching band.",
    "The total number of band members is given as 110.",
    "The problem states that there are 4 times as many percussion players as woodwind players.",
    "It also states that there are twice as many woodwinds as brass players.",
    "Let's assume the number of brass players is B.",
    "Since there are twice as many woodwinds as brass, the number of woodwind players is 2B.",
    "Since there are 4 times as many percussion players as woodwinds, the number of percussion players is 4 times 2B, which is 8B.",
    "The total number of members is the sum of brass, woodwind, and percussion players.",
    "The equation for the total number of band members is B (brass) + 2B (woodwinds) + 8B (percussion) = 110.",
    "Simplifying the equation gives me B + 2B + 8B = 11B.",
    "The equation becomes 11B = 110.",
    "To solve for B, I divide both sides by 11.",
    "So, B = 110 / 11.",
    "Calculating the division gives me B = 10."
