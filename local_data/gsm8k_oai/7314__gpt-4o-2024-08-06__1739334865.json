  "query": "A chef needs to make french fries.  He can get 25 fries out of 1 potato.  He has 15 potatoes and he needs 200 fries.  How many potatoes will he have leftover?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many fries the chef can make with 1 potato.",
    "1 potato gives 25 fries.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many potatoes are needed to make 200 fries.",
    "To find out, I'll divide 200 fries by the number of fries per potato, which is 25.",
    "200 divided by 25 equals 8. This means the chef needs 8 potatoes to make 200 fries.",
    "The chef has a total of 15 potatoes.",
    "I need to calculate how many potatoes will be left after using 8 potatoes.",
    "15 potatoes minus 8 potatoes used equals 7 potatoes remaining."
