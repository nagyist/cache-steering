  "query": "Arven bought five puppies for a total cost of $800. Three puppies are on sale for $150 each. How much does each of those two other puppies cost if they cost the same?",
  "steps": [
    "Arven bought five puppies in total for $800.",
    "Three of the puppies each cost $150.",
    "To find the total cost of the three puppies, I multiply 3 by $150.",
    "3 puppies * $150 per puppy = $450",
    "Now, I'll find out how much Arven spent on the other two puppies by subtracting the cost of the three puppies from the total cost.",
    "$800 (total cost) - $450 (cost of 3 puppies) = $350",
    "The remaining $350 is the total cost of the two other puppies.",
    "These two puppies cost the same, so I will divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each.",
    "$350 / 2 = $175"
