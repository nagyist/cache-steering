Her brother Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn for his friends. How many bags of popcorn does Shelby have left for the party?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of popcorn bags made by Shelby and her mom.",
    "They made 12 bags of buttered popcorn.",
    "They also made 10 bags of caramel popcorn.",
    "To find the total number of popcorn bags, add the popcorn bags together: 12 bags of buttered + 10 bags of caramel = 22 bags in total.",
    "Next, identify how many bags Alan took.",
    "Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn.",
    "He also took 1 bag of caramel popcorn.",
    "In total, Alan took 3 + 1 = 4 bags of popcorn.",
    "Subtract the number of bags Alan took from the total number of popcorn bags made.",
    "22 total bags - 4 bags Alan took = 18 bags left."
