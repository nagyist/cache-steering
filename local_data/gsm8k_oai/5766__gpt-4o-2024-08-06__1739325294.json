  "query": "Haylee has 3 dozen guppies in her aquarium.  Jose has half as many guppies as Haylee in his tank.  Charliz has one-third of what Jose has in his tank.  Nicolai has 4 times as many guppies as Charliz in his pond. How many guppies do the four friends have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many guppies Haylee has. A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen would be calculated as 3 times 12.",
    "3 times 12 equals 36. So, Haylee has 36 guppies.",
    "Next, calculate how many guppies Jose has. Jose has half as many guppies as Haylee.",
    "Half of 36 is calculated by dividing 36 by 2.",
    "36 divided by 2 equals 18. So, Jose has 18 guppies.",
    "Now, calculate how many guppies Charliz has. Charliz has one-third of what Jose has.",
    "One-third of 18 is calculated by dividing 18 by 3.",
    "18 divided by 3 equals 6. So, Charliz has 6 guppies.",
    "Next, calculate how many guppies Nicolai has. Nicolai has 4 times as many guppies as Charliz.",
    "4 times 6 equals 24. So, Nicolai has 24 guppies.",
    "Finally, add together the total number of guppies for all four friends.",
    "Haylee has 36, Jose has 18, Charliz has 6, and Nicolai has 24 guppies.",
    "The total number of guppies is calculated as 36 plus 18 plus 6 plus 24.",
    "36 plus 18 equals 54, and 54 plus 6 equals 60, and 60 plus 24 equals 84."
