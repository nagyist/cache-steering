  "query": "For every sandwich that he eats, Sam eats four apples. If he eats 10 sandwiches every day for one week, how many apples does he eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between sandwiches and apples. Sam eats four apples for every sandwich he eats.",
    "Sam eats 10 sandwiches every day.",
    "Since Sam eats four apples per sandwich, I need to multiply the number of sandwiches he eats by the number of apples he eats per sandwich.",
    "10 sandwiches multiplied by 4 apples per sandwich equals 40 apples per day.",
    "Now, I need to compute the total number of apples Sam eats in one week. There are 7 days in a week.",
    "I will multiply the number of apples Sam eats in one day by the number of days in a week.",
    "40 apples per day multiplied by 7 days equals 280 apples in a week."

  "solution": "280"
