  "query": "In a 5-day Fishing competition, Jackson was able to reel a total of 6 fishes per day, Jonah was able to reel 4 fishes per day and George was able to reel 8 fishes per day. How many fishes were they able to catch throughout the competition if they are on the same team?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of fishes Jackson caught over the 5-day competition. He caught 6 fishes per day.",
    "Multiplying the number of fishes Jackson caught per day (6) by the number of competition days (5), I get the total number of fishes Jackson caught: 6 * 5 = 30.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of fishes Jonah caught. He caught 4 fishes per day.",
    "Multiplying the number of fishes Jonah caught per day (4) by the number of competition days (5), I get the total number of fishes Jonah caught: 4 * 5 = 20.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of fishes George caught. He caught 8 fishes per day.",
    "Multiplying the number of fishes George caught per day (8) by the number of competition days (5), I get the total number of fishes George caught: 8 * 5 = 40.",
    "To find out how many fishes they caught together, I need to add the total number of fishes each of them caught.",
    "Adding the number of fishes caught by Jackson (30), Jonah (20), and George (40), I get the total number of fishes: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90."
