  "query": "Alma is taking a walk and comes across four goats standing behind a fence. Alma has a bag of baby carrots she brought to have for a snack and decides to feed the goats with them. Alma wants to make sure all the goats get the same amount of carrots, so she starts counting them out. She has 47 baby carrots. If she wants to give the exact same amount of carrots to each goat and wants to feed them all the carrots she can, how many will she have left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Alma wants to distribute the carrots evenly among the four goats.",
    "She has a total of 47 baby carrots.",
    "To find out how many carrots each goat can get evenly, I need to divide 47 by 4.",
    "47 divided by 4 equals 11 with a remainder.",
    "I calculate 47 divided by 4 to get 11.75.",
    "Since she cannot give a fraction of a carrot to a goat, I use 11 as the quotient.",
    "Next, I multiply 11 (quotient) by 4 (number of goats) to find out how many carrots are distributed.",
    "11 times 4 equals 44.",
    "44 carrots are distributed evenly to the goats.",
    "I subtract 44 from the total 47 carrots to find out how many are left over.",
    "47 minus 44 equals 3."

  "solution": "3"
