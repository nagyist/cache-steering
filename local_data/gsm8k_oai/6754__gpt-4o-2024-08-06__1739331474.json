  "query": "Randy, Peter, and Quincy all drew pictures. Peter drew 8 pictures. Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter. If they drew 41 pictures altogether, how many did Randy draw?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pictures Quincy drew.",
    "Quincy drew 20 more pictures than Peter, who drew 8 pictures.",
    "That means Quincy drew 8 + 20 = 28 pictures.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pictures that Randy drew.",
    "The total number of pictures drawn by all three is 41.",
    "Peter drew 8 pictures and Quincy drew 28 pictures.",
    "Adding Peter's and Quincy's pictures gives 8 + 28 = 36 pictures.",
    "Since they drew 41 pictures altogether, Randy must have drawn the remaining pictures.",
    "Therefore, Randy drew 41 - 36 = 5 pictures."
