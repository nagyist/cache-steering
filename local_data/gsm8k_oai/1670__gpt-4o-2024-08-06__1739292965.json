  "query": "If a basket is capable of holding 40 fruit altogether, and there are 3 times as many apples as oranges, how many oranges are there?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to represent the number of oranges and apples using algebraic expressions.",
    "Let the number of oranges be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, there are 3 times as many apples as oranges.",
    "Thus, the number of apples can be represented as \\( 3x \\).",
    "The total number of fruits in the basket is given as 40.",
    "This can be represented with the equation: \\( x + 3x = 40 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, I combine the terms: \\( 4x = 40 \\).",
    "Now, I need to solve for \\( x \\), which represents the number of oranges.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 4: \\( x = 40 / 4 \\).",
    "I calculate \\( x = 10 \\).",
    "Let me double-check: if there are 10 oranges, then there are \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\) apples.",
    "The total number of fruits is \\( 10 + 30 = 40 \\), which matches the problem's condition."
