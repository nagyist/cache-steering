  "query": "Jessica has a basic cable television service for $15 per month. If she adds the movie channels, it will cost an additional $12 per month. The sports channels cost $3 less per month than the movie channels. If Jessica adds the movie channels and the sports channels, what will her total monthly payment be?",
  "steps": [
    "Jessica's basic cable television service costs $15 per month.",
    "Adding the movie channels costs an additional $12 per month.",
    "Calculate the cost of the sports channels. The sports channels cost $3 less than the movie channels.",
    "The movie channels cost $12, so the sports channels will cost $12 - $3 = $9 per month.",
    "Jessica adds both the movie channels and the sports channels to her basic cable service.",
    "Calculate the total monthly cost by adding the cost of the basic service, movie channels, and sports channels.",
    "The total cost is $15 (basic service) + $12 (movie channels) + $9 (sports channels).",
    "Perform the addition: $15 + $12 + $9 = $36."
