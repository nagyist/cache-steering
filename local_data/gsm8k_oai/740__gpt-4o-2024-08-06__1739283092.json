  "query": "Angie bought three times as many pretzels at the mall as Shelly did. Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry. If Barry bought 12 pretzels, how many did Angie buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pretzels Shelly bought. The problem states that Shelly bought half as many pretzels as Barry.",
    "Barry bought 12 pretzels.",
    "Therefore, Shelly bought half of Barry's 12 pretzels.",
    "Half of 12 is calculated as 12 / 2, which is 6.",
    "Shelly bought 6 pretzels.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many pretzels Angie bought. According to the problem, Angie bought three times as many pretzels as Shelly.",
    "Since Shelly bought 6 pretzels, I will multiply 6 by 3 to find out how many pretzels Angie bought.",
    "6 times 3 equals 18."
