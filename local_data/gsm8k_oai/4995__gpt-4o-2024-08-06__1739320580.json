  "query": "John buys 20 hours of music a month.  The average length of a song is 3 minutes.  He buys each song for $.50.  How much does he pay for music a year?",
  "steps": [
    "John buys 20 hours of music each month.",
    "I need to find out how many songs that equates to each month.",
    "Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 20 hours of music is 20 x 60 = 1200 minutes of music.",
    "Each song is 3 minutes long, so I need to divide the total minutes of music by the length of each song to find out how many songs he's buying each month.",
    "1200 minutes divided by 3 minutes per song equals 400 songs per month.",
    "John pays $0.50 for each song.",
    "To find out how much he spends each month, I need to multiply the number of songs by the cost per song.",
    "400 songs multiplied by $0.50 equals $200 per month.",
    "Now I need to calculate how much he pays for music in a year.",
    "There are 12 months in a year, so I need to multiply the monthly cost by 12.",
    "$200 multiplied by 12 equals $2400 per year."

  "solution": "2400"
