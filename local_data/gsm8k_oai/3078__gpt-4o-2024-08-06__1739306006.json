  "query": "Barbi lost 1.5 kilograms each month for a year. Luca lost 9 kilograms every year for 11 years. How many more kilograms did Luca lose than Barbi?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many kilograms Barbi lost in total over the year.",
    "Barbi lost 1.5 kilograms each month.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "I calculate Barbi's total weight loss as 1.5 kilograms per month multiplied by 12 months.",
    "1.5 kg/month * 12 months = 18 kg.",
    "Barbi lost a total of 18 kilograms in one year.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many kilograms Luca lost in total over the 11 years.",
    "Luca lost 9 kilograms every year.",
    "I calculate Luca's total weight loss as 9 kilograms per year multiplied by 11 years.",
    "9 kg/year * 11 years = 99 kg.",

    "Now, I need to find out how many more kilograms Luca lost than Barbi.",
    "Luca lost 99 kilograms, and Barbi lost 18 kilograms.",
    "I subtract Barbi's total weight loss from Luca's total weight loss to find the difference.",
    "99 kg - 18 kg = 81 kg."
