  "query": "Sheena is sewing the bridesmaid\u2019s dresses for her sister\u2019s wedding. She can sew one dress in 12 hours. There are 5 bridesmaids in the wedding. If Sheena sews the dresses 4 hours each week, how many weeks will it take her to complete them?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of hours required to sew all the bridesmaids' dresses. Since Sheena can sew one dress in 12 hours and there are 5 bridesmaids, she will need 5 dresses.",
    "To find the total sewing time for all the dresses, I multiply 12 hours per dress by 5 dresses.",
    "12 hours/dress * 5 dresses = 60 hours",
    "Next, I need to determine how many weeks it will take Sheena to sew for a total of 60 hours, given that she sews 4 hours each week.",
    "To find the number of weeks needed, I divide the total hours required, 60 hours, by the number of hours Sheena sews per week, which is 4 hours.",
    "60 hours \u00f7 4 hours/week = 15 weeks"
  ],
  "solution": "15"
