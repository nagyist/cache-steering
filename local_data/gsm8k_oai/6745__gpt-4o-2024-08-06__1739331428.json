  "query": "There were 250 balloons in one package. Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends. Dante changed his mind and asked each of his friends to give him 11 balloons. How many balloons does each friend have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Dante starts with 250 balloons.",
    "He shares them evenly among his 5 friends.",
    "To find out how many each friend gets originally, I should divide 250 by 5.",
    "250 divided by 5 is 50.",
    "Each friend gets 50 balloons initially.",
    "Dante then asks each friend to give him 11 balloons.",
    "If each friend gives him 11 balloons, I must subtract 11 from the 50 each friend originally had.",
    "50 minus 11 is 39.",
    "Each friend has 39 balloons now."
