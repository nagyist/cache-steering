  "query": "3 people run for president.  John manages to capture 150 votes. James captures 70% of the remaining vote.  If there were 1150 people voting, how many more votes did the third guy get than John?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of votes.",
    "The total number of votes is given as 1150.",
    "John received 150 votes.",
    "To find out how many votes James and the third person together received, I subtract John's votes from the total.",
    "1150 total votes minus 150 votes for John equals 1000 votes remaining for James and the third person.",
    "James captures 70% of the remaining votes.",
    "To determine how many votes James received, I calculate 70% of 1000.",
    "70% of 1000 is 0.70 * 1000 = 700 votes for James.",
    "To find the number of votes the third person received, I subtract James' votes from the remaining votes.",
    "The remaining votes after James and John = 1000 votes - 700 votes = 300 votes received by the third person.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more votes the third guy received than John.",
    "The third guy received 300 votes.",
    "John received 150 votes.",
    "To find the difference, subtract the number of votes John received from the number of votes the third guy received.",
    "300 votes - 150 votes = 150 votes more for the third guy than John."
