  "query": "When you take Hiram's age and then add 12, you get 4 less than twice Allyson's age. If Hiram is 40 years old, how old is Allyson?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine Allyson's age based on the given conditions.",
    "Hiram's age is given as 40 years.",
    "If I add 12 to Hiram's age, the expression becomes 40 + 12.",
    "Calculating this gives me 52.",
    "This result, 52, equals 4 less than twice Allyson's age.",
    "Let's represent Allyson's age as A.",
    "The equation based on the problem is 52 = 2A - 4.",
    "To find 2A, I will add 4 to both sides of the equation: 52 + 4 = 2A.",
    "Calculating this gives me 56 = 2A.",
    "To find Allyson's age, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 2: A = 56 / 2.",
    "Calculating this gives me A = 28."
