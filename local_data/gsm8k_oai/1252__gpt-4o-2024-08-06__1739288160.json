  "query": "Marnie makes bead bracelets. She bought 5 bags of 50 beads and 2 bags of 100 beads. If 50 beads are used to make one bracelet, how many bracelets will Marnie be able to make out of the beads she bought?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of beads Marnie bought in total.",
    "Marnie bought 5 bags with 50 beads each. I calculate the total beads from these bags.",
    "5 bags * 50 beads per bag = 250 beads from these bags.",
    "Next, Marnie bought 2 bags with 100 beads each. I calculate the total beads from these bags.",
    "2 bags * 100 beads per bag = 200 beads from these bags.",
    "I now need to add the beads from both types of bags to find the total number of beads.",
    "250 beads (from 50-bead bags) + 200 beads (from 100-bead bags) = 450 beads in total.",
    "I know that 50 beads are needed to make one bracelet.",
    "To find out how many bracelets can be made, I divide the total number of beads by the number of beads needed for one bracelet.",
    "450 beads \u00f7 50 beads per bracelet = 9 bracelets."

  "solution": "9"
