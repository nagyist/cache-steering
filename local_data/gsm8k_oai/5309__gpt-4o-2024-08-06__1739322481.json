  "query": "Vivian is responsible for making sure her students get 2 15-minute recess breaks a day, a 30-minute lunch and another 20-minute recess break.  How much time do her students spend outside of class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time for the 15-minute recess breaks. There are two 15-minute recesses a day.",
    "If each recess is 15 minutes, then two recesses would be 15 minutes + 15 minutes.",
    "15 + 15 equals 30 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to add the lunchtime duration. The students have a 30-minute lunch.",
    "Adding the lunch duration to the recess time, I start with the 30 minutes from the recesses.",
    "Then I add the 30 minutes for lunch. So, 30 + 30 equals 60 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to consider the additional 20-minute recess.",
    "The total time spent is already 60 minutes from the previous calculation.",
    "I add the 20 minutes from the extra recess to 60 minutes.",
    "60 + 20 equals 80 minutes."

  "solution": "80"
