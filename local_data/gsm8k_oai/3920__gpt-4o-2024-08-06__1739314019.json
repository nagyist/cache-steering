  "query": "There are 4 alligators living on a golf course in Florida. If the number of alligators doubles every six months, how many alligators will there be at the end of a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to determine the initial number of alligators.",
    "There are 4 alligators at the start.",
    "Next, I need to understand how the number of alligators changes over time.",
    "The number of alligators doubles every six months.",
    "I need to calculate the number of alligators after six months.",
    "After six months, the number of alligators will double. So, 4 alligators * 2 = 8 alligators.",
    "Now, I need to find out what happens after another six months, which is at the end of one year.",
    "At the end of the year, the number of alligators will double again. So, 8 alligators * 2 = 16 alligators.",
    "I have determined how many alligators there will be at the end of the year."

  "solution": "16"
