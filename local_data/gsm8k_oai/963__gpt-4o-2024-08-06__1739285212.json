  "query": "Oleg is an event organizer. He is organizing an event with 80 guests where 40 of them are men, half the number of men are women, and the rest are children. If he added 10 children to the guest list, how many children will there be at the event?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of guests at the event is 80.",
    "Out of these 80 guests, 40 are men.",
    "The problem states that half the number of men are women.",
    "Half of 40 men is 20, so there are 20 women at the event.",
    "Let\u2019s calculate the number of guests that are not men or women, which are the children.",
    "There are 80 total guests, and 40 men plus 20 women make a total of 60.",
    "So, the number of children is 80 - 60 = 20.",
    "According to the problem, Oleg is adding 10 more children to the guest list.",
    "So, originally there were 20 children, and adding 10 more gives us 20 + 10.",
    "20 + 10 equals 30."

  "solution": "30"
