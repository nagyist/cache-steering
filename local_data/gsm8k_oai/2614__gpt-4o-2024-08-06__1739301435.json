  "query": "Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?",
  "steps": [
    "Megan bought a dozen eggs at the store, which is 12 eggs.",
    "Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, which is also 12 eggs.",
    "Adding these together, Megan starts with 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.",
    "Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet.",
    "Megan also used 4 eggs to bake a cake.",
    "In total, Megan used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs.",
    "Subtract the used eggs from the total: 24 - 6 = 18 eggs are left.",
    "Megan gave half of her remaining eggs to her aunt.",
    "Half of 18 eggs is 18 \u00f7 2 = 9 eggs.",
    "Subtract the eggs given to her aunt from the remaining eggs: 18 - 9 = 9 eggs are left.",
    "Megan plans to divide these 9 eggs equally for her next 3 meals.",
    "Divide the eggs by the number of meals: 9 \u00f7 3 = 3 eggs per meal."
