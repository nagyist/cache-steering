  "query": "Jazel has 3 sticks. One stick is 3 centimeters long. The second stick is twice as long while the third stick is 1 centimeter shorter than the second stick. What is the total length of Jazel's sticks when they are put together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the length of the first stick is given as 3 centimeters.",
    "The second stick is described as being twice as long as the first stick.",
    "So, I calculate the length of the second stick: 3 cm * 2 = 6 cm.",
    "Next, I know that the third stick is 1 centimeter shorter than the second stick.",
    "I calculate the length of the third stick: 6 cm - 1 cm = 5 cm.",
    "Now, I have the lengths of all three sticks: 3 cm, 6 cm, and 5 cm.",
    "I add these lengths together to find the total length when all sticks are put together: 3 cm + 6 cm + 5 cm.",
    "Performing the addition: 3 + 6 = 9, then 9 + 5 = 14."

  "solution": "14"
