  "query": "Kim drinks a 1.5-quart bottle of water.  She then drinks a 12 ounce can of water.  How many ounces of water did she drink?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to convert the 1.5-quart bottle into ounces.",
    "I know that 1 quart is equal to 32 ounces.",
    "So, 1.5 quarts would be 1.5 times 32 ounces.",
    "1.5 times 32 is equal to 48 ounces.",
    "Kim drank 48 ounces of water from the 1.5-quart bottle.",
    "She also drank a 12 ounce can of water.",
    "I need to add the 48 ounces from the bottle to the 12 ounces from the can.",
    "48 plus 12 equals 60.",
    "Therefore, Kim drank a total of 60 ounces of water."

  "solution": "60"
