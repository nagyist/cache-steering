  "query": "A phone factory makes twice as many phones as last year. Last year\u2019s production was 5000 phones. If a quarter of this year\u2019s production is sold, how many phones are left in the factory?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total production for this year.",
    "This year, the factory made twice as many phones as last year.",
    "Last year's production was 5000 phones.",
    "So, twice that amount means this year the factory made 2 * 5000 phones.",
    "Calculating, 2 * 5000 = 10000 phones.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many phones were sold this year.",
    "A quarter of this year's production was sold.",
    "A quarter of the production is (1/4) * 10000.",
    "Calculating, (1/4) * 10000 = 2500 phones were sold.",
    "To find out how many phones are left, I subtract the sold phones from this year's production.",
    "So, 10000 - 2500 = 7500 phones are left in the factory."

  "solution": "7500"
