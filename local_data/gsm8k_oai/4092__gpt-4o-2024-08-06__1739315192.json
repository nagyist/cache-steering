  "query": "Melody needs to read 20 pages for her English class, 16 pages for her Science class, 8 pages for her Civics, and 12 pages for Chinese class. She decided to read one-fourth of the number of pages for each class tomorrow. How many pages will she read tomorrow?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of pages Melody will read for her English class tomorrow. She is planning to read one-fourth of the pages for each class.",
    "Melody needs to read 20 pages for her English class in total.",
    "One-fourth of 20 is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\) pages.",
    "Next, I'll find the number of pages Melody will read for her Science class tomorrow.",
    "She needs to read 16 pages in total for her Science class.",
    "One-fourth of 16 is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\) pages.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many pages Melody will read for her Civics class tomorrow.",
    "She needs to read 8 pages in total for her Civics class.",
    "One-fourth of 8 is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\) pages.",
    "Finally, I'll determine how many pages she will read for her Chinese class tomorrow.",
    "She needs to read 12 pages in total for her Chinese class.",
    "One-fourth of 12 is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\) pages.",
    "Now, I will add up all the pages she plans to read for each class tomorrow.",
    "The number of pages Melody will read tomorrow is \\( 5 + 4 + 2 + 3 \\).",
    "Adding these together, \\( 5 + 4 = 9 \\).",
    "Then, adding 2, \\( 9 + 2 = 11 \\).",
    "Finally, adding 3, \\( 11 + 3 = 14 \\)."
