  "query": "Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have a total of 200 bananas. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia. If  Lydia has 60 bananas, how many bananas does Donna have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the total number of bananas is 200. This is shared among Dawn, Lydia, and Donna.",
    "I am given that Lydia has 60 bananas.",
    "I also know that Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.",
    "If Lydia has 60 bananas, then Dawn has 60 + 40 bananas.",
    "Calculating Dawn's bananas: 60 + 40 equals 100.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many bananas Donna has.",
    "I know the total number of bananas is 200, which equals Dawn's bananas plus Lydia's bananas plus Donna's bananas.",
    "Dawn has 100 bananas, Lydia has 60 bananas.",
    "Let the number of bananas Donna has be x.",
    "Equation for total bananas: 100 (Dawn) + 60 (Lydia) + x (Donna) = 200.",
    "So, 100 + 60 + x = 200.",
    "This simplifies to 160 + x = 200.",
    "Now, solve for x by subtracting 160 from both sides of the equation: x = 200 - 160.",
    "Calculating 200 - 160 gives 40.",
    "Therefore, Donna has 40 bananas."
