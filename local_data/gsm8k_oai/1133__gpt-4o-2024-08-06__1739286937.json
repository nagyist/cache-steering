  "query": "Marcus is having a water balloon party. He has 100 balloons. Each balloon holds 3 ounces of water. He can buy 50 ounces of water for $2.5 a bottle. If he walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, how much change will he have after he buys all the water he needs?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcus needs to fill 100 balloons.",
    "Each balloon holds 3 ounces of water.",
    "So, he needs 100 balloons * 3 ounces/balloon = 300 ounces of water.",
    "Water is sold in bottles that contain 50 ounces each.",
    "Marcus needs to determine how many bottles of water are required to get at least 300 ounces.",
    "300 ounces / 50 ounces per bottle = 6 bottles are needed.",
    "Each bottle costs $2.5.",
    "So, the total cost for 6 bottles is 6 bottles * $2.5/bottle = $15.",
    "Marcus walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, which equals $20.",
    "Marcus spends $15 on water, so his change is $20 - $15 = $5."

  "solution": "5"
