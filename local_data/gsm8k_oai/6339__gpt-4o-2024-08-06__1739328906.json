  "query": "Sofia and her mother go to the grocery store and buys 10kgs of oranges to be used in their home for the week. While at the store, Sofia's father calls and says they're to add 5 more kgs since their neighbor also wanted some supplies. When they reach home, they estimated that for the next coming two weeks they'll have to buy twice as many oranges each week for the supplies to be enough. What the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks.",
  "steps": [
    "Sofia and her mother initially buy 10 kgs of oranges.",
    "Sofia's father calls and says to add 5 more kgs. So, they buy 10 kgs + 5 kgs = 15 kgs in total during the first week.",
    "For the next two weeks, they need to buy twice as many oranges each week compared to the first week.",
    "Twice as many oranges for each of the next two weeks means 15 kgs * 2 = 30 kgs per week.",
    "In the second week, they will buy 30 kgs of oranges.",
    "In the third week, they will also buy 30 kgs of oranges.",
    "Now, we sum up the total oranges bought over the three weeks: 15 kgs (first week) + 30 kgs (second week) + 30 kgs (third week).",
    "The total quantity of oranges bought after the three weeks is 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 kgs."
