  "query": "Bridgette and Alex are getting married. Bridgette is inviting 84 guests, and Alex is inviting two thirds of that number of guests. They hired a caterer to make a plated meal for each guest at the wedding reception. The caterer always makes ten extra plates just in case something goes wrong. Each plate of steak and asparagus in garlic butter will have 8 asparagus spears on it. How many asparagus spears will the caterer need in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Bridgette is inviting 84 guests.",
    "Alex is inviting two thirds of the number of guests as Bridgette.",
    "To find the number of guests Alex is inviting, I need to calculate two thirds of 84.",
    "Two thirds of 84 is calculated as (2/3) * 84.",
    "(2/3) * 84 = 56.",
    "Alex is inviting 56 guests.",
    "Total number of guests invited is the sum of guests invited by Bridgette and Alex.",
    "The total number of guests is 84 (Bridgette's guests) + 56 (Alex's guests).",
    "84 + 56 = 140 guests.",
    "The caterer makes one plated meal for each guest, plus ten extra plates.",
    "The total number of plates needed is the number of guests plus ten.",
    "140 guests + 10 extra plates = 150 plates.",
    "Each plate will have 8 asparagus spears.",
    "To find the total number of asparagus spears needed, multiply the number of plates by the number of asparagus spears per plate.",
    "150 plates * 8 asparagus spears per plate = 1200 asparagus spears."
