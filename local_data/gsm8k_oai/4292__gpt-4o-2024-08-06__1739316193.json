  "query": "Jordan and Perry took a boat out to the lake to go fishing on a Monday morning. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught double what Jordan caught. On the way back to shore, the boat tipped over and they lost one-fourth of their total catch. How many fish remain?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fish Jordan caught. The problem states that Jordan caught 4 fish.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many fish Perry caught. The problem says Perry caught double what Jordan caught. So, Perry caught 2 times 4 fish.",
    "Calculating that, 2 times 4 is 8. So, Perry caught 8 fish.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of fish they caught together. Jordan caught 4 fish and Perry caught 8 fish.",
    "Adding those together, 4 plus 8 equals 12. They caught 12 fish in total.",
    "The problem says they lost one-fourth of their total catch when the boat tipped over. So, I need to calculate one-fourth of 12 fish.",
    "One-fourth of 12 is calculated as 12 divided by 4, which is 3.",
    "They lost 3 fish. Now, I need to find out how many fish remain.",
    "To find the remaining fish, I subtract the lost fish from the total catch. So, 12 minus 3 equals 9."

  "solution": "9"
