  "query": "Grandma Olga has 3 daughters and 3 sons.  If all her daughters each have 6 sons, and each of her sons has 5 daughters, how many grandchildren does she have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify how many daughters grandma Olga has. She has 3 daughters.",
    "Each daughter has 6 sons. Therefore, to find out how many grandsons she has through her daughters, we multiply the number of daughters by the number of sons each has. This is \\(3 \\times 6\\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\(18\\) grandsons from her daughters.",
    "Now, let's determine how many sons grandma Olga has. She has 3 sons.",
    "Each son has 5 daughters. So, to find out how many granddaughters she has through her sons, we multiply the number of sons by the number of daughters each has. This is \\(3 \\times 5\\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\(15\\) granddaughters from her sons.",
    "To find out the total number of grandchildren, we add up the number of grandsons and granddaughters. So, we add 18 grandsons and 15 granddaughters, which is \\(18 + 15\\).",
    "Calculating this gives us a total of \\(33\\) grandchildren."
