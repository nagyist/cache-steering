  "query": "Josue planted a tree in his backyard that grows at the rate of 2 feet per week. If the tree is currently 10 feet tall, what would be the tree's total height after 4 months (assuming each month is 4 weeks long)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of weeks in 4 months.",
    "Each month is assumed to be 4 weeks long, so 4 months is 4 x 4 = 16 weeks.",
    "The tree grows 2 feet per week. I need to calculate how much the tree will grow in 16 weeks.",
    "The growth in 16 weeks is 2 feet/week x 16 weeks = 32 feet.",
    "The tree is currently 10 feet tall. I need to add the growth of 32 feet to the current height.",
    "The total height of the tree after 4 months is 10 feet + 32 feet = 42 feet."

  "solution": "42"
