  "query": "Carl buys index cards for his class.  He gives each student 10 index cards.  He teaches 6 periods a day and each class has 30 students.  If a 50 pack of index cards cost $3 how much did he spend on them all?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl gives each student 10 index cards.",
    "He teaches 6 periods a day, with each class having 30 students.",
    "First, I will calculate the total number of students he teaches daily.",
    "6 periods * 30 students per period = 180 students.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of index cards needed.",
    "180 students * 10 index cards per student = 1800 index cards.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many packs of index cards are needed.",
    "Each pack contains 50 index cards.",
    "I will divide the total number of index cards needed by the number of index cards per pack.",
    "1800 index cards \u00f7 50 index cards per pack = 36 packs.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total cost.",
    "Each pack costs $3.",
    "So, 36 packs * $3 per pack = $108."

  "solution": "108"
