  "query": "Chalktown High School had their prom last weekend. There were 123 students who attended. If 3 students attended on their own, how many couples came to the prom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of students who attended in couples.",
    "The problem states that 3 students attended on their own.",
    "So, the number of students who attended with a partner is 123 - 3.",
    "Subtracting, I get 123 - 3 = 120 students attended in couples.",
    "Next, to find the number of couples, I need to divide the number of students who attended as couples by 2.",
    "I divide 120 by 2, which results in 60.",
    "Therefore, there were 60 couples who attended the prom."
  ],
  "solution": "60"
