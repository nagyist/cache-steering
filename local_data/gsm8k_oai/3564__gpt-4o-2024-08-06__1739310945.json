  "query": "Tina buys a loaf of bread for $50, 2oz of ham for $150, and a cake for $200. What percent of the cost is the ham and bread?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of all the items Tina buys.",
    "Tina buys a loaf of bread for $50, ham for $150, and a cake for $200.",
    "Let's add these amounts to find the total cost: $50 + $150 + $200.",
    "The total cost is $400.",
    "Next, I should calculate the cost of the ham and bread combined.",
    "The cost of the bread is $50, and the cost of the ham is $150.",
    "I add these two amounts: $50 + $150.",
    "The combined cost of the ham and bread is $200.",
    "Now, I calculate what percent of the total cost ($400) is the combined cost of the ham and bread ($200).",
    "The formula for calculating the percentage is: (part/total) * 100%.",
    "In this case, the part is $200, and the total is $400.",
    "I substitute the values into the formula: (200/400) * 100%.",
    "Simplifying the fraction, 200 divided by 400 equals 0.5.",
    "Now, multiply 0.5 by 100 to get the percentage.",
    "0.5 times 100 is 50."

  "solution": "50"
