  "query": "Miranda wants to buy a pair of heels she saw online. She saved money for 3 months. Her sister heard that she was sad and gave her $50 for her to buy the heels. If she paid $260 in total for the heels, how much money did she save per month?",
  "steps": [
    "Miranda paid $260 in total for the heels.",
    "Her sister gave her $50 to help buy the heels.",
    "First, I need to find out how much money Miranda saved by herself.",
    "To do this, I subtract the $50 from the total amount she paid for the heels.",
    "$260 - $50 = $210",
    "Miranda saved $210 on her own.",
    "Miranda saved this amount over 3 months.",
    "To find out how much she saved per month, I divide the total amount she saved by the number of months.",
    "$210 \u00f7 3 = $70",
    "Therefore, Miranda saved $70 per month."
  ],
  "solution": "70"
