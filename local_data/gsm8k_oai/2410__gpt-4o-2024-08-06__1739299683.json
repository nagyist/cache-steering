  "query": "Freddy is 2 years younger than Stephanie. Stephanie is 4 times as old as Job. If Job is 5, how old is Freddy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Stephanie's age.",
    "I know that Stephanie is 4 times as old as Job.",
    "Job is 5 years old.",
    "So, Stephanie's age is 4 times 5.",
    "4 times 5 equals 20.",
    "Therefore, Stephanie is 20 years old.",
    "Now, I need to find out Freddy's age.",
    "I know that Freddy is 2 years younger than Stephanie.",
    "Since Stephanie is 20 years old, Freddy's age is 20 minus 2.",
    "20 minus 2 equals 18."
