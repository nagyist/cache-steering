  "query": "Daniel practices basketball for 15 minutes each day during the school week. He practices twice as long each day on the weekend. How many minutes does he practice during a whole week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the number of minutes Daniel practices during the school week.",
    "There are 5 school days in a week (Monday to Friday).",
    "Daniel practices 15 minutes each school day.",
    "To find the total minutes during the school week, I multiply 15 minutes by 5 days.",
    "15 minutes/day \u00d7 5 days = 75 minutes",
    "Next, I'll calculate the number of minutes Daniel practices on the weekend.",
    "There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).",
    "Daniel practices twice as long on each weekend day compared to a school day.",
    "Since he practices 15 minutes on a school day, he practices 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 minutes on each weekend day.",
    "To find the total minutes for the weekend, I multiply 30 minutes by 2 days.",
    "30 minutes/day \u00d7 2 days = 60 minutes",
    "Now, I'll add the minutes from the school week and the weekend to find the total practice time for the whole week.",
    "Total practice time = 75 minutes (school week) + 60 minutes (weekend)",
    "75 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes"

  "solution": "135"
