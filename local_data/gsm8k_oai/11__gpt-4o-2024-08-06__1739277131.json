  "query": "Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?",
  "steps": [
    "Tobias wants to buy shoes that cost $95 and still has $15 after the purchase.",
    "The total amount of money Tobias had before buying the shoes is $95 + $15 = $110.",
    "Tobias saves $5 each month for three months from his allowance. So he saves 3 x $5 = $15 from his allowance.",
    "The remaining money must come from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways.",
    "Tobias earns $15 for each lawn mowed. If he mows 4 lawns, he earns 4 x $15 = $60.",
    "The total money from mowing lawns and allowance together is $60 + $15 = $75.",
    "Tobias has a total of $110, so the remaining amount must come from shoveling driveways. Thus, the money from shoveling driveways is $110 - $75 = $35.",
    "Tobias charges $7 per driveway shovel. To find out how many driveways he shoveled, divide the total money from shoveling by the charge per driveway: $35 \u00f7 $7 = 5."
