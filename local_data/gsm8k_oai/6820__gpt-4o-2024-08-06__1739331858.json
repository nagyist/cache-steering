  "query": "Jade and Krista went on a road trip for 3 days. On each day Jade had to drive 8 hours and Krista had to drive 6 hours to arrive at the destination. How many hours did they drive altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Jade drove in total.",
    "Jade drove 8 hours each day for 3 days.",
    "So, I multiply 8 hours by 3 days to find the total hours Jade drove.",
    "8 hours/day * 3 days = 24 hours.",
    "Now I need to determine how many hours Krista drove in total.",
    "Krista drove 6 hours each day for 3 days.",
    "So, I multiply 6 hours by 3 days to find the total hours Krista drove.",
    "6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours.",
    "Now, I add Jade's total driving hours to Krista's total driving hours to find the total hours driven altogether.",
    "24 hours (Jade) + 18 hours (Krista) = 42 hours."

  "solution": "42"
