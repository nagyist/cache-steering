  "query": "Sally and Bob have made plans to go on a trip at the end of the year. They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days there are in a year. Assuming they babysit every day, there are 365 days in a year.",
    "Next, I'll calculate Sally's total earnings for a year. Sally earns $6 per day.",
    "Sally's total earnings in a year = $6/day \u00d7 365 days = $2190.",
    "Sally decides to save half of her earnings for the trip. I need to calculate half of $2190.",
    "Half of Sally's earnings = $2190 \u00f7 2 = $1095.",
    "Now I will calculate Bob's total earnings for a year. Bob earns $4 per day.",
    "Bob's total earnings in a year = $4/day \u00d7 365 days = $1460.",
    "Bob also saves half of his earnings for the trip. I need to calculate half of $1460.",
    "Half of Bob's earnings = $1460 \u00f7 2 = $730.",
    "To find the total amount saved by both Sally and Bob for their trip, I need to add the amounts they each saved.",
    "Total savings = Sally's savings + Bob's savings = $1095 + $730.",
    "Total savings for the trip = $1825."

  "solution": "1825"
