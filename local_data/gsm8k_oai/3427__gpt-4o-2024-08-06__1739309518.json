  "query": "In four years, Annika will be three times as old as Hans. If Hans is now 8 years old, how old is Annika now?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting the current age of Hans, which is 8 years old.",
    "I need to determine Hans's age in four years. To do this, I add 4 to his current age: 8 + 4 = 12.",
    "In four years, Annika will be three times Hans's age at that point. So, I will calculate three times Hans's age in four years: 3 * 12 = 36.",
    "In four years, Annika will be 36 years old. I need to find out how old Annika is now.",
    "I calculate Annika's current age by subtracting 4 years from her age in four years: 36 - 4 = 32."
