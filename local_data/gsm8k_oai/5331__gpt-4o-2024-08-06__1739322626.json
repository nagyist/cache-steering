    "First, I need to find the cost of the pen.",
    "I know that the pen costs $9 more than the pencil.",
    "The cost of the pencil is given as $2.",
    "So, to find the price of the pen, I add $9 to the cost of the pencil.",
    "Calculating, the cost of the pen is $2 + $9 = $11.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of both the pen and the pencil.",
    "I add the cost of the pencil ($2) and the cost of the pen ($11).",
    "So the total cost of both items is $2 + $11.",
    "Calculating, the total cost is $13."
