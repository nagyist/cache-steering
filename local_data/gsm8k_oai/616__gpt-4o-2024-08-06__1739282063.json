  "query": "Kris is blowing u balloons for her sister\u2019s party. She has 30 minutes to blow up as many balloons as possible and decides to enlist her brother\u2019s help to increase the number of balloons. Kris can blow up a total of 2 balloon per minute, and her brother works twice as fast. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed and works at this new speed for the remaining 15 minutes. After the 30 minutes, how many balloons, in total, did Kris and her brother blow up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many balloons Kris can blow up in 30 minutes.",
    "Kris blows up balloons at a rate of 2 balloons per minute.",
    "In 30 minutes, Kris will blow up 2 balloons/minute * 30 minutes = 60 balloons.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many balloons her brother can blow up in the first 15 minutes.",
    "Her brother blows balloons twice as fast as Kris, so he can blow up 4 balloons per minute.",
    "In the first 15 minutes, her brother will blow up 4 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 60 balloons.",
    "After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed.",
    "His new rate is 8 balloons per minute (which is double his previous rate of 4 balloons per minute).",
    "In the remaining 15 minutes, I need to calculate how many balloons her brother can blow up at this new speed.",
    "At 8 balloons per minute for 15 minutes, her brother will blow up 8 balloons/minute * 15 minutes = 120 balloons.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the balloons Kris and her brother blew up.",
    "Kris blew up 60 balloons.",
    "Her brother blew up a total of 60 + 120 = 180 balloons.",
    "Adding Kris's and her brother's totals together: 60 + 180 = 240 balloons."
