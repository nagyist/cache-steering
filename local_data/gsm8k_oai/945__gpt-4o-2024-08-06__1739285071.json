  "query": "Jon buys 2 coffees a day from his favorite coffee shop.  They cost $2 each.  How much does he spend in April?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many coffees Jon buys each day.",
    "He buys 2 coffees each day.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of the coffees per day.",
    "Each coffee costs $2, so 2 coffees cost Jon 2 * $2 = $4 per day.",
    "Now, I need to check how many days there are in April.",
    "April has 30 days.",
    "I need to calculate the total cost Jon spends on coffee in April.",
    "He spends $4 per day, so for 30 days, he spends 30 * $4.",
    "30 * $4 = $120."

  "solution": "120"
