  "query": "John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days John takes a shower over 4 weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days.",
    "John takes a shower every other day, which means he takes a shower one day, then skips a day, and then takes another shower, etc.",
    "To find the number of days he takes a shower, I divide the total number of days (28) by 2.",
    "28 / 2 = 14 days where John takes a shower.",
    "Next, I calculate how many gallons of water he uses per shower.",
    "John's shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute, and he showers for 10 minutes.",
    "So, the water used per shower is 2 gallons/minute x 10 minutes = 20 gallons per shower.",
    "Now, I multiply the number of showers (14) by the gallons per shower (20) to get the total water usage over 4 weeks.",
    "14 days x 20 gallons/day = 280 gallons."
  ],
  "solution": "280"
