  "query": "Brandon has a collection of 20 baseball cards.  Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.  However, then Malcom gives half of his cards to his friend Mark.  How many cards does Malcom have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many baseball cards Malcom has initially.",
    "I know that Malcom has 8 more cards than Brandon.",
    "Brandon has 20 baseball cards.",
    "So, Malcom has 20 + 8 cards.",
    "20 + 8 equals 28.",
    "Malcom initially has 28 baseball cards.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many cards Malcom gives to his friend Mark.",
    "Malcom gives half of his cards to Mark.",
    "Half of 28 is calculated by dividing 28 by 2.",
    "28 divided by 2 equals 14.",
    "Malcom gives 14 cards to Mark.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how many cards Malcom has left after giving some to Mark.",
    "Malcom initially had 28 cards and gave away 14.",
    "To find out how many cards he has left, I subtract 14 from 28.",
    "28 - 14 equals 14."
