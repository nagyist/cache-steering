  "query": "On their way driving to Los Angeles, Benjamin and James see lots of billboard ads. Curious, Benjamin starts to count how many they see. In the first hour once he starts counting he counts 17 billboards. In the second hour once he starts counting he sees 20 billboards. In the third hour he sees 23 billboards. James asks Benjamin the average number of billboards they've seen per hour. What should Benjamin tell him?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the average number of billboards seen per hour, I need to add up the total number of billboards seen and then divide by the number of hours.",
    "In the first hour, Benjamin saw 17 billboards.",
    "In the second hour, he saw 20 billboards.",
    "In the third hour, he saw 23 billboards.",
    "First, calculate the total number of billboards seen: 17 + 20 + 23.",
    "17 + 20 = 37.",
    "37 + 23 = 60.",
    "Benjamin saw a total of 60 billboards over 3 hours.",
    "Now, calculate the average number of billboards per hour by dividing the total by the number of hours: 60 / 3.",
    "60 divided by 3 equals 20."
