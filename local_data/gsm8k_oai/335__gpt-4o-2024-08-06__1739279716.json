  "query": "Eve wants to buy her 3 nieces cooking gear that's made for kids.  The hand mitts cost $14.00 and the apron is $16.00.  A set of 3 cooking utensils is $10.00 and a small knife is twice the amount of the utensils.  The store is offering a 25% off sale on all cooking gear.  How much will Eve spend on the gifts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of each item at full price.",
    "The hand mitts are $14.00 each.",
    "The apron is $16.00 each.",
    "A set of 3 cooking utensils costs $10.00.",
    "A small knife costs twice the amount of the utensils, so it's $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.",
    "Now, I calculate the total full price for one set of the complete cooking gear for one niece, which includes one hand mitt, one apron, one set of utensils, and one knife.",
    "The total full price for one niece is $14.00 (hand mitt) + $16.00 (apron) + $10.00 (utensils) + $20.00 (knife).",
    "Add these amounts: $14.00 + $16.00 + $10.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.",
    "Now find the 25% discount on $60.00.",
    "25% of $60.00 is $60.00 * 0.25 = $15.00.",
    "Subtract the discount from the full price for one niece: $60.00 - $15.00 = $45.00.",
    "Eve has 3 nieces, so I multiply the discounted price for one niece by 3.",
    "$45.00 * 3 = $135.00."
