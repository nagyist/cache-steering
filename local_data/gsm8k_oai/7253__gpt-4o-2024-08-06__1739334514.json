  "query": "In Rodrigo's classroom in the morning there are red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs. There are 4 red chairs. There are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs, and there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. In the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs.  How many chairs are left in Rodrigo's classroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many yellow chairs there are. It says there are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs.",
    "There are 4 red chairs.",
    "If there are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs, then the number of yellow chairs is 2 * 4.",
    "2 * 4 = 8, so there are 8 yellow chairs.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many blue chairs there are. It says there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs.",
    "Since there are 8 yellow chairs, the number of blue chairs is 8 - 2.",
    "8 - 2 = 6, so there are 6 blue chairs.",
    "Now, I have the total number of chairs in the morning: red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs.",
    "Red chairs: 4, Yellow chairs: 8, Blue chairs: 6",
    "The total number of chairs is 4 + 8 + 6.",
    "4 + 8 + 6 = 18, so there are 18 chairs in total in the morning.",
    "In the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs, so I need to subtract 3 from the total.",
    "18 - 3 = 15"
  ],
  "solution": "15"
