  "query": "Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?",
  "steps": [
    "Jed starts with 20 cards.",
    "Every week, Jed gets 6 cards. So, after one week, he would have 20 + 6 = 26 cards.",
    "However, every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards to his friends.",
    "When Jed gives away 2 cards at the end of the second week, he would have 26 + 6 - 2 = 30 cards.",
    "This means at the end of every two-week period, he effectively gains (6 + 6 - 2) = 10 cards.",
    "Jed wants to have a total of 40 cards.",
    "Starting at 20 cards, he needs an additional 20 cards to reach 40 cards.",
    "Since he gains 10 cards every two weeks, we can calculate the number of weeks needed by dividing the cards needed by the cards gained every two weeks: 20 / 10 = 2 two-week periods.",
    "Each two-week period is 2 weeks, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 weeks to gain 20 cards."
