  "query": "Steven is preparing a shipment of boxes to deliver to a customer for his chemical supply business. The products are very delicate and must be carefully packed, so partially filled boxes can\u2019t be shipped. Steven has three trucks that can be sent on each delivery. Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo. Some of the boxes weigh 10 pounds after being packed, and some of the boxes weigh 40 pounds when packed. Steven\u2019s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. How many boxes of products can Steven ship to his customer in each delivery?",
  "steps": [
    "Steven has three trucks, and each truck can carry up to 2,000 pounds.",
    "That means the total weight capacity for a single delivery using all trucks is 3 trucks x 2,000 pounds per truck = 6,000 pounds.",
    "The customer ordered equal quantities of both products, meaning if x is the number of 10-pound boxes, then there must also be x number of 40-pound boxes.",
    "The weight for the 10-pound boxes will be 10x, and the weight for the 40-pound boxes will be 40x.",
    "The total weight of both the 10-pound and 40-pound boxes is 10x + 40x = 50x.",
    "Since the total weight cannot exceed 6,000 pounds, the equation is 50x \u2264 6,000.",
    "To find the maximum number of boxes for each type, divide both sides by 50: x \u2264 6,000 / 50.",
    "Calculating this gives x \u2264 120.",
    "This means Steven can ship 120 boxes of the 10-pound type and 120 boxes of the 40-pound type."
