  "query": "A cafe has 9 indoor tables and 11 outdoor tables. Each indoor table has 10 chairs, and each outdoor table has 3 chairs. How many chairs are there in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of chairs for the indoor tables.",
    "There are 9 indoor tables.",
    "Each indoor table has 10 chairs.",
    "So, the total number of chairs for indoor tables is 9 tables * 10 chairs/table.",
    "Calculating this gives 90 chairs.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of chairs for the outdoor tables.",
    "There are 11 outdoor tables.",
    "Each outdoor table has 3 chairs.",
    "So, the total number of chairs for outdoor tables is 11 tables * 3 chairs/table.",
    "Calculating this gives 33 chairs.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of chairs by adding the indoor and outdoor chairs.",
    "I add the 90 indoor chairs to the 33 outdoor chairs.",
    "Calculating this gives 123 chairs in total."
