  "query": "Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many water bottles Lilith originally had. She had five dozen, which means 5 multiplied by 12.",
    "5 dozen is equal to 5 x 12 = 60 water bottles.",
    "Lilith planned to sell these water bottles at $2 each. So, to find out how much money she intended to collect, I will calculate 60 bottles multiplied by $2.",
    "60 x $2 = $120 is the amount Lilith originally planned to collect.",
    "Now, after realizing she can only sell at $1.85, I need to calculate the total amount she will actually collect from selling at the new price.",
    "60 water bottles multiplied by the new price of $1.85 equals the actual amount Lilith will collect.",
    "60 x $1.85 = $111 is the amount Lilith will actually collect.",
    "To find out how much additional money Lilith will need to buy the gift, I subtract the actual amount she collects from the amount she intended to collect.",
    "$120 (intended collection) - $111 (actual collection) = $9"
  ],
  "solution": "9"
