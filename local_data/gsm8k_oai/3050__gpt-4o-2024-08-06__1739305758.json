  "query": "Janet bought some muffins at the bakery. Each muffin is 75 cents. Janet paid $20 and got $11 in change back. How many muffins did Janet buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Janet paid with a $20 bill and got $11 in change.",
    "The amount Janet actually spent on muffins is $20 - $11 = $9.",
    "Each muffin costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.",
    "To find out how many muffins Janet bought, I need to divide the amount she spent by the cost of each muffin.",
    "The calculation is $9 \u00f7 $0.75.",
    "To make the division easier, I'll convert $9 to cents, so it is 900 cents.",
    "Now, I divide 900 cents by 75 cents to find the number of muffins.",
    "900 \u00f7 75 = 12.",
    "Janet bought 12 muffins."
