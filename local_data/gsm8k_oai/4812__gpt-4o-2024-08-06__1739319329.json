    "The restaurant sells 40 dinners on Monday.",

    "Monday's sales were 40 dinners, so Tuesday's sales are 40 + 40 = 80 dinners.",

    "Tuesday's sales were 80 dinners, so Wednesday's sales are 80 / 2 = 40 dinners.",
    "On Thursday, the restaurant sells 3 more dinners than it did on Wednesday.",
    "Wednesday's sales were 40 dinners, so Thursday's sales are 40 + 3 = 43 dinners.",
