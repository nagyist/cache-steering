  "query": "There are 15 girls and 10 boys in Ms. Smith's class. She divided 375 books equally among them. How many books did all the girls get combined?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many students there are in total in Ms. Smith's class.",
    "There are 15 girls and 10 boys.",
    "Add the number of girls and boys: 15 girls + 10 boys = 25 students.",
    "Ms. Smith divided 375 books equally among these 25 students.",
    "First, I need to calculate how many books each student receives.",
    "To find this, divide the total number of books by the total number of students: 375 books \u00f7 25 students.",
    "375 divided by 25 equals 15 books per student.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many books all the girls received combined.",
    "Each girl receives 15 books, and there are 15 girls.",
    "Multiply the number of books per girl by the number of girls: 15 books/girl \u00d7 15 girls.",
    "15 multiplied by 15 equals 225.",
    "Therefore, all the girls received 225 books in total."
