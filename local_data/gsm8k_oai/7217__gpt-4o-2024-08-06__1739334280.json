  "query": "The mayor commissioned two artists to paint 50 murals around the city. Once the work was completed, Celina was paid $1,000 more than 4 times the amount Diego got. If the mayor paid the two a total of $50,000, how much did Diego get?",
  "steps": [
    "Let \\( D \\) be the amount Diego got paid.",
    "According to the problem, Celina was paid $1,000 more than 4 times what Diego got.",
    "So, Celina's pay can be expressed as \\( 4D + 1000 \\).",
    "The total amount paid to both artists is $50,000.",
    "This can be set up as the equation: \\( D + (4D + 1000) = 50000 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( D + 4D + 1000 = 50000 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 5D + 1000 = 50000 \\).",
    "Subtract 1000 from both sides: \\( 5D = 49000 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 5: \\( D = 9800 \\).",
    "Therefore, Diego got paid $9,800."

  "solution": "9800"
