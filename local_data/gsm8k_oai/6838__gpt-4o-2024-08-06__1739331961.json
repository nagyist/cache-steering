  "query": "John went on a mission that was supposed to take 5 days.  Instead it took 60% longer.  He then had to go on a second mission which took 3 days.  How long was he on missions?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much longer the first mission took than originally planned.",
    "The first mission was supposed to take 5 days.",
    "It took 60% longer than 5 days.",
    "To find 60% of 5, I need to multiply 5 by 0.6.",
    "5 * 0.6 = 3",
    "So, the first mission took an additional 3 days.",
    "Now, I add these extra days to the original duration.",
    "5 + 3 = 8",
    "The first mission lasted 8 days in total.",
    "Next, the second mission took 3 days.",
    "Now, I add the durations of both missions together to get the total time John spent on missions.",
    "8 + 3 = 11"

  "solution": "11"
