  "query": "Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground. Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule. How deep is Northton's time capsule buried?",
  "steps": [
    "Determine the depth at which Southton buries their time capsule.",
    "Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground.",
    "Calculate 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule.",
    "Multiply 15 feet by 4.",
    "4 times 15 feet equals 60 feet.",
    "Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than this depth.",
    "Subtract 12 feet from 60 feet to account for the \"12 feet higher\" condition.",
    "60 feet minus 12 feet equals 48 feet."
