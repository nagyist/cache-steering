  "query": "Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost Ann spent on the shorts.",
    "Ann bought 5 pairs of shorts at $7 each.",
    "So, the total cost for the shorts is 5 pairs \u00d7 $7/pair = $35.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost for the shoes.",
    "Ann bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each.",
    "So, the total cost for the shoes is 2 pairs \u00d7 $10/pair = $20.",
    "Now, I'll find out how much money she spent on the tops.",
    "The total amount Ann spent was $75.",
    "I've already calculated the cost for shorts and shoes, which is $35 + $20 = $55.",
    "So, the amount spent on tops is the total ($75) minus the amount spent on shorts and shoes ($55).",
    "$75 - $55 = $20.",
    "Ann bought 4 tops, so now I need to find the cost per top.",
    "The cost for 4 tops is $20.",
    "To find the cost of each top, I divide the total cost for the tops by the number of tops: $20 \u00f7 4.",
    "$20 \u00f7 4 = $5."
  ],
  "solution": "5"
