  "query": "Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie and she put the rest on the fridge. If the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, how many grams did Sophia eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Sophia ate 1/6 of her pie.",
    "This means that 5/6 of the pie is left.",
    "The pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams, which represents 5/6 of the total pie.",
    "To find the weight of the entire pie, I need to determine the total weight (T) using the equation: 5/6 * T = 1200 grams.",
    "I can solve this equation for T by dividing both sides by 5/6. This can be done by multiplying 1200 by the reciprocal of 5/6.",
    "The reciprocal of 5/6 is 6/5.",
    "Multiplying 1200 by 6/5 gives: T = 1200 * (6/5).",
    "1200 * (6/5) = 1440 grams. So, the total weight of the pie is 1440 grams.",
    "Since Sophia ate 1/6 of the pie, to find out how much she ate, I must calculate 1/6 of the total weight, which is 1440 grams.",
    "1/6 of 1440 = 1440 / 6.",
    "1440 divided by 6 equals 240."

  "solution": "240"
