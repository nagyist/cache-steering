  "query": "Estevan has 24 blankets. One-third of the blankets have polka-dots. For his birthday, his mother gives him 2 more polka-dot print blankets. How many polka-dot blankets does Estevan have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Estevan initially has 24 blankets in total.",
    "One-third of these blankets have polka-dots.",
    "To find out how many of the initial blankets have polka-dots, I need to calculate one-third of 24.",
    "One-third of 24 is calculated by dividing 24 by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 is 8.",
    "So, initially, Estevan has 8 polka-dot blankets.",
    "For his birthday, Estevan receives 2 more polka-dot blankets from his mother.",
    "To find the total number of polka-dot blankets Estevan has now, add the 2 new polka-dot blankets to the initial 8 polka-dot blankets.",
    "8 + 2 equals 10."

  "solution": "10"
