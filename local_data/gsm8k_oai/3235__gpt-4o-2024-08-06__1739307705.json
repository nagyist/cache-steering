  "query": "Jerry has an interesting novel he borrowed from a friend to read over the weekend. The book has 93 pages. On Saturday, he reads 30 pages. On Sunday, he goes to church and comes back, sits down, and reads 20 pages of the book. How many pages are remaining before Jerry can finish the book?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pages Jerry read in total.",
    "Jerry reads 30 pages on Saturday.",
    "On Sunday, he reads 20 pages.",
    "To find the total pages read, I add the pages he read on Saturday and Sunday: 30 + 20.",
    "30 + 20 equals 50 pages.",
    "The book has a total of 93 pages.",
    "To find out how many pages are left to read, I subtract the pages Jerry has read from the total pages in the book: 93 - 50.",
    "93 - 50 equals 43 pages."
  ],
  "solution": "43"
