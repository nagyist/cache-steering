  "query": "A party hall has 3 decorative light bulbs; a red light bulb which comes on every 2 seconds, a green one every 3 seconds and a blue one every 4 seconds. If they are put on at the same time, what is the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the shortest time after which the three bulbs will be on at the same time, I need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the three intervals: 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and 4 seconds.",
    "First, I must understand what LCM is. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.",
    "I will start by finding the prime factorization of each number.",
    "2 is already a prime number, so its prime factorization is 2.",
    "3 is also a prime number, so its prime factorization is 3.",
    "4 is not a prime number. The prime factorization of 4 is 2^2.",
    "Now I will determine what the LCM should be by taking the highest power of all prime numbers that occur in the factorizations.",
    "For the number 2, the highest power that appears is 2^2.",
    "For the number 3, the highest power that appears is 3^1.",
    "There are no other prime factors.",
    "Therefore, the LCM is 2^2 * 3^1.",
    "Calculate 2^2, which is 4.",
    "Calculate 4 * 3, which is 12.",
    "The LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12.",
    "Thus, the shortest time after which the three bulbs will all be on at the same time is 12 seconds."
