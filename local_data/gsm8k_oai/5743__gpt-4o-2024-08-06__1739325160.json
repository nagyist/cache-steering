  "query": "Mark gets a new phone plan that is 30% more expensive than his old plan.  If his old plan was $150 a month how much does his new plan cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out what 30% of Mark's old plan cost is.",
    "His old plan costs $150 per month.",
    "30% of $150 means multiplying 150 by 0.3.",
    "150 multiplied by 0.3 equals 45.",
    "Now, I know that the new plan is $45 more expensive than the old plan.",
    "To find the cost of the new plan, I will add $45 to the old plan's cost.",
    "So, $150 plus $45 equals $195."

  "solution": "195"
