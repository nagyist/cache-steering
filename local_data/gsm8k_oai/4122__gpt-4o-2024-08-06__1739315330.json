  "query": "Alex is working on a science project and has taken pictures of all of the plants in a park near her home. She wants to find out how many of each plant she has pictures of, but she has 960 pictures, and counting them all will take her a long time. Her teacher suggested she use a program on the computer that can automatically tell her what plant is in each picture and count them for her. It will take the program 2 minutes to process each picture. How many hours will it take to process all of the pictures?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many pictures there are, which is given as 960.",
    "The program takes 2 minutes to process each picture.",
    "To find the total time in minutes, I will multiply the number of pictures by the minutes per picture: 960 pictures * 2 minutes per picture.",
    "960 * 2 = 1920 minutes.",
    "Now I need to convert minutes into hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "I will divide the total minutes by the number of minutes in an hour: 1920 / 60.",
    "1920 / 60 = 32 hours."
  ],
  "solution": "32"
