  "query": "The Dark Lord needs to transport 1200 pounds of swords to the Enchanted Forest for a battle with the elves. He has 10 squads of 8 orcs each. How many pounds of swords does each orc have to carry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of orcs available to carry the swords.",
    "There are 10 squads, and each squad has 8 orcs.",
    "To find the total number of orcs, I multiply the number of squads by the number of orcs in each squad: 10 squads * 8 orcs/squad = 80 orcs.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pounds each orc has to carry.",
    "The total weight of the swords is 1200 pounds.",
    "I will divide the total weight by the total number of orcs to find out how much each orc has to carry: 1200 pounds / 80 orcs = 15 pounds."
