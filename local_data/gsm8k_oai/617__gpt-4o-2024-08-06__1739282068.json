  "query": "Mark was caught speeding and the judge wants to make an example out of him. The base fine for speeding is $50 but additional penalties apply in this case.  The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. He was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone. Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work. How much does Mark owe for this speeding ticket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much over the speed limit Mark was going. The speed limit is 30 miles per hour, and Mark was going 75 miles per hour.",
    "To find out how much over the speed limit he was, I subtract the speed limit from the speed he was going: 75 - 30 = 45 miles per hour over the limit.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the additional penalty for speeding. The penalty is $2 for every mile per hour over the limit. Mark was going 45 miles per hour over the limit.",
    "I multiply the miles per hour over the limit by the penalty per mile: 45 * 2 = 90 dollars.",
    "The base fine for speeding is $50. I add the additional penalty to the base fine: 50 + 90 = 140 dollars.",
    "Since the speeding occurred in a school zone, the fine is doubled.",
    "I multiply the total fine by 2 to account for the school zone: 140 * 2 = 280 dollars.",
    "According to the problem, Mark has to pay an additional $300 in court costs.",
    "I add the court costs to the current total fine: 280 + 300 = 580 dollars.",
    "Mark also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work.",
    "I calculate the lawyer's fee: 80 * 3 = 240 dollars.",
    "Finally, I add the lawyer's fee to the current total: 580 + 240 = 820 dollars."

  "solution": "820"
