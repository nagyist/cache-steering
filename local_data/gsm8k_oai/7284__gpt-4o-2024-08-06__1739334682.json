  "query": "Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the route Talia takes. She starts at her house.",
    "Talia drives from her house to the park, which is 5 miles.",
    "Next, Talia drives from the park to the grocery store, which is 3 miles away from the park.",
    "Talia then drives from the grocery store back to her house, which is 8 miles from her home.",
    "Now, let's add up all the distances to find out the total miles Talia drives.",
    "From her house to the park is 5 miles.",
    "From the park to the grocery store is 3 miles.",
    "From the grocery store back to her house is 8 miles.",
    "Adding these together: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles."
