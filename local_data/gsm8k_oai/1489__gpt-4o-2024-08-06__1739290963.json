    "First, I need to determine how many pounds Jerome lost.",
    "Jerome lost three times as many pounds as Seth.",
    "Seth lost 17.5 pounds.",
    "To find Jerome's weight loss, I multiply 17.5 by 3.",
    "17.5 * 3 = 52.5 pounds.",
    "Jerome lost 52.5 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many pounds Veronica lost.",
    "Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth.",
    "Seth lost 17.5 pounds.",
    "To find Veronica's weight loss, I add 1.5 to 17.5.",
    "17.5 + 1.5 = 19 pounds.",
    "Veronica lost 19 pounds.",
    "Now, I add up the pounds lost by Seth, Jerome, and Veronica to get the total weight loss.",
    "Seth lost 17.5 pounds, Jerome lost 52.5 pounds, and Veronica lost 19 pounds.",
    "The total weight loss = 17.5 + 52.5 + 19.",
    "First, add 17.5 and 52.5.",
    "17.5 + 52.5 = 70.",
    "Next, add 70 and 19.",
    "70 + 19 = 89."
