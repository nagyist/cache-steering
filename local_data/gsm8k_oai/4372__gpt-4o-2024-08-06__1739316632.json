  "query": "Cory has $20.00 and she wants to buy two packs of candies that cost $49.00 each. How much money does Cory need so she will be able to buy the pack of candies?",
  "steps": [
    "Cory has $20.00 initially.",
    "Each pack of candies costs $49.00.",
    "Cory wants to buy two packs of candies.",
    "To calculate the cost of two packs, I need to multiply the cost of one pack by two.",
    "$49.00 multiplied by 2 is $98.00.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much more money Cory needs to reach this amount.",
    "Subtract the amount Cory already has, which is $20.00, from the total cost of the candies, which is $98.00.",
    "$98.00 - $20.00 equals $78.00."
