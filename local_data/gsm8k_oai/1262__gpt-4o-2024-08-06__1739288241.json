  "query": "4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the conversion factor involved. There are 8 pints in one gallon.",
    "Now, I calculate the total amount of coffee in pints. Since there are 4.5 gallons of coffee, I multiply 4.5 gallons by 8 pints per gallon.",
    "4.5 gallons \u00d7 8 pints/gallon = 36 pints.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pints are in each thermos. I know the total pints is 36 and they are divided among 18 thermoses.",
    "So, I divide 36 pints by 18 thermoses to find out how many pints are in each thermos.",
    "36 pints \u00f7 18 thermoses = 2 pints/thermos.",
    "Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. I need to calculate how many pints this amounts to.",
    "I multiply 3 thermoses by 2 pints/thermos.",
    "3 thermoses \u00d7 2 pints/thermos = 6 pints."
