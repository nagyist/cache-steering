  "query": "Nina made a two-layer cake and a dozen cupcakes for her friend\u2019s birthday party. Each layer of cake takes the same amount of sugar to make as a dozen cupcakes. Nina used 720 grams of sugar to bake everything. How many grams of sugar are in one cupcake?",
  "steps": [
    "Each layer of the cake takes the same amount of sugar as a dozen cupcakes.",
    "Nina made a two-layer cake, so she used sugar for two layers.",
    "Since each layer is equivalent to a dozen cupcakes in terms of sugar, the two layers combined require sugar equivalent to two dozens of cupcakes.",
    "Nina also made one dozen cupcakes separately.",
    "In total, the amount of sugar used is equivalent to three dozens of cupcakes (two dozen for the layers and one dozen for the cupcakes).",
    "Three dozens equal 36 cupcakes because 12 cupcakes make one dozen.",
    "Nina used 720 grams of sugar for a total of sugar equivalent to 36 cupcakes.",
    "To find the sugar per cupcake, we divide the total sugar used by the number of cupcake equivalents (36).",
    "720 grams of sugar divided by 36 cupcakes gives 20 grams of sugar per cupcake."
