  "query": "On a mall-wide sale, Andre bought a $1350 treadmill for a 30% discount and 2 pieces of 45-pound plates for $50 each. How much did Andre pay for the treadmill and plates?",
  "steps": [
    "The original price of the treadmill is $1350.",
    "The discount on the treadmill is 30%.",
    "To find the discount amount, I will multiply the original price of the treadmill by the discount percentage: $1350 * 0.30.",
    "Calculating the discount: $1350 * 0.30 = $405.",
    "To find the price Andre paid for the treadmill, I will subtract the discount from the original price: $1350 - $405.",
    "Calculating the price paid for the treadmill: $1350 - $405 = $945.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total price of the 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, with each costing $50.",
    "Each plate costs $50.",
    "The two plates will cost: 2 * $50 = $100.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount Andre paid for both the treadmill and plates.",
    "Adding together the cost of the treadmill and the plates: $945 + $100.",
    "Calculating the total payment: $945 + $100 = $1045."
