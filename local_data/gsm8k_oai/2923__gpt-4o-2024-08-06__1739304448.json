  "query": "Ruel has four books of 10 stamps and six books of 15 stamps. How many stamps does Ruel have?",
  "steps": [
    "Ruel has four books, each containing 10 stamps.",
    "To find the total number of stamps in these four books, I need to multiply the number of books by the number of stamps per book.",
    "4 books * 10 stamps/book = 40 stamps",
    "Next, Ruel has six books, each containing 15 stamps.",
    "To find the total number of stamps in these six books, I need to multiply the number of books by the number of stamps per book.",
    "6 books * 15 stamps/book = 90 stamps",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of stamps Ruel has. This means adding the stamps from the two sets of books together.",
    "40 stamps (from the four books) + 90 stamps (from the six books) = 130 stamps"

  "solution": "130"
