  "query": "You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris, and Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store. If your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to, how many hours will it take you to get there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between my walking speed and Mr. Harris's walking speed.",
    "I walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris.",
    "Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store.",
    "If Mr. Harris walks to the store in 2 hours, I would take half the time because I walk twice as fast.",
    "So, I would take 1 hour to walk the same distance as Mr. Harris to the store.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total distance to my destination.",
    "The destination is 3 times further away than the store.",
    "If the time it takes me to walk to the store is 1 hour, then to walk 3 times that distance would take 3 times the time.",
    "So, 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours to reach my destination."

  "solution": "3"
