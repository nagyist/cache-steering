  "query": "Ray has 95 cents in nickels. If Ray gives 25 cents to Peter, and twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter, how many nickels does Ray have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Ray initially has 95 cents in nickels.",
    "Each nickel is worth 5 cents.",
    "To find out how many nickels Ray initially has, divide 95 cents by 5 cents per nickel.",
    "95 divided by 5 equals 19.",
    "Ray initially has 19 nickels.",
    "Ray gives 25 cents to Peter.",
    "25 cents is 5 nickels (because 25 divided by 5 is 5).",
    "Ray gives twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter.",
    "Twice as many cents as 25 cents is 50 cents.",
    "50 cents is 10 nickels (because 50 divided by 5 is 10).",
    "In total, Ray gives 5 nickels to Peter and 10 nickels to Randi.",
    "So Ray gives away 5 + 10 = 15 nickels in total.",
    "Ray initially had 19 nickels.",
    "After giving away 15 nickels, Ray has 19 - 15 nickels left.",
    "19 minus 15 equals 4."
