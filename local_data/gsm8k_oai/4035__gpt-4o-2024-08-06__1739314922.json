  "query": "Randy feeds his pigs 10 pounds of feed per pig per day.  If Randy has 2 pigs, how many pounds of pig feed will Randy's pigs be fed per week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much feed each pig gets per day.",
    "According to the question, each pig gets 10 pounds of feed per day.",
    "Randy has 2 pigs, so I need to calculate the total amount of feed for all pigs per day.",
    "I calculate 10 pounds per pig multiplied by 2 pigs, which equals 20 pounds of feed per day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much feed the pigs receive over one week.",
    "Since there are 7 days in a week, I need to multiply the daily feed amount by 7.",
    "I calculate 20 pounds per day multiplied by 7 days, which equals 140 pounds of feed per week."

  "solution": "140"
