  "query": "Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year. How many pounds can Kyle lift in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much more Kyle can lift compared to last year. It's stated that he can lift 60 more pounds this year.",
    "Now I need to find out how much that increase of 60 pounds represents in terms of last year's capability.",
    "The problem states that 60 pounds is 3 times as much as he could lift last year.",
    "Let's denote the amount Kyle could lift last year as \\( x \\).",
    "Then according to the problem, 3 times last year's amount is equal to 60 pounds. So, I can set up an equation: 3x = 60.",
    "To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. So, x = 60 / 3.",
    "Calculating that, I get x = 20.",
    "This means last year Kyle could lift 20 pounds.",
    "To find out how much Kyle can lift this year, I need to add the 60-pound increase to last year's amount.",
    "So, the calculation for this year's lifting capacity is 20 pounds + 60 pounds.",
    "Performing the addition, I get 80 pounds."

  "solution": "80"
