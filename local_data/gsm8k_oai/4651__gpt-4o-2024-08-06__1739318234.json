  "query": "Heather is going to sew 150 aprons that are to be used for a kiddie crew program. She already was able to sew  13 aprons, and today, she sewed three times as many aprons. How many aprons should she sew tomorrow if she wants to sew half of the remaining number of aprons needed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many aprons Heather sewed today.",
    "She sewed 13 aprons previously, and then she sewed three times as many aprons today. So, she sewed \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\) aprons today.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of aprons Heather has sewn so far.",
    "She sewed 13 aprons initially and 39 aprons today. Therefore, Heather has sewn \\(13 + 39 = 52\\) aprons in total.",
    "Next, I will determine how many aprons Heather still needs to sew to reach her goal of 150 aprons.",
    "The total number of aprons needed is 150, and Heather has already sewn 52 aprons. So, she needs to sew \\(150 - 52 = 98\\) more aprons.",
    "Heather wants to sew half of the remaining number of aprons tomorrow.",
    "Half of the remaining 98 aprons is calculated as \\(98 \\div 2 = 49\\)."

  "solution": "49"
