  "query": "Cid owns a mechanic shop, he charges $20 for an oil change, $30 for a repair, and $5 for a car wash. How much money did he earn if he changed the oil of 5 cars, repaired 10 cars, and washed 15 cars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total earnings from oil changes.",
    "Cid charges $20 for each oil change.",
    "He changed the oil of 5 cars.",
    "I multiply the number of cars by the cost per oil change: 5 cars x $20 = $100.",
    "Now, I calculate the total earnings from repairs.",
    "Cid charges $30 for each repair.",
    "He repaired 10 cars.",
    "I multiply the number of cars by the cost per repair: 10 cars x $30 = $300.",
    "Next, I calculate the total earnings from car washes.",
    "Cid charges $5 for each car wash.",
    "He washed 15 cars.",
    "I multiply the number of cars by the cost per car wash: 15 cars x $5 = $75.",
    "Now, I add up all the earnings to find the total.",
    "I sum up $100 (oil changes) + $300 (repairs) + $75 (car washes).",
    "The total earnings are $100 + $300 + $75 = $475."

  "solution": "475"
