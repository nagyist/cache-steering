  "query": "George and Amelia are picking oranges and apples at an orchard. George picks 45 oranges and 5 more apples than Amelia. Amelia picks 18 fewer oranges than George and 15 apples. How many fruits do they pick altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "George picks 45 oranges.",
    "Amelia picks 18 fewer oranges than George.",
    "Since George picks 45 oranges, Amelia picks 45 - 18 oranges. Let's calculate this: 45 - 18 equals 27.",
    "So, Amelia picks 27 oranges.",
    "George picks 5 more apples than Amelia.",
    "Amelia picks 15 apples, so George picks 15 + 5 apples. Let's calculate this: 15 + 5 equals 20.",
    "Therefore, George picks 20 apples.",
    "Now calculate how many fruits George picks altogether, which is the sum of the oranges and apples he picks.",
    "George picks 45 oranges and 20 apples.",
    "45 + 20 equals 65.",
    "So, George picks a total of 65 fruits.",
    "Now calculate how many fruits Amelia picks altogether, which is the sum of the oranges and apples she picks.",
    "Amelia picks 27 oranges and 15 apples.",
    "27 + 15 equals 42.",
    "So, Amelia picks a total of 42 fruits.",
    "Finally, add the total fruits picked by George and Amelia together.",
    "65 (George's total fruits) + 42 (Amelia's total fruits) equals 107."

  "solution": "107"
