  "query": "Jon\u2019s textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon\u2019s textbooks. Jon has four textbooks that weigh two, eight, five and nine pounds respectively. How much do Brandon\u2019s textbooks weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total weight of Jon's textbooks.",
    "Jon's textbooks weigh: 2 + 8 + 5 + 9 pounds.",
    "2 + 8 = 10, then 10 + 5 = 15, and finally 15 + 9 = 24 pounds.",
    "Therefore, Jon's textbooks weigh a total of 24 pounds.",
    "According to the problem, Jon's textbooks weigh three times as much as Brandon's textbooks.",
    "So, I need to divide the total weight of Jon's textbooks by 3 to find the weight of Brandon's textbooks.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8."
