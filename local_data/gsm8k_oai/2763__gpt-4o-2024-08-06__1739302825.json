  "query": "On Friday, Markeesha sold 30 boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fundraiser. On Saturday, she sold twice as many as on Friday. On Sunday, she sold 15 fewer than Saturday. How many boxes did she sell over the three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will find out how many boxes Markeesha sold on Saturday.",
    "She sold twice as many on Saturday as she did on Friday, and on Friday she sold 30 boxes.",
    "Twice 30 is 30 * 2 = 60.",
    "So, on Saturday, Markeesha sold 60 boxes.",
    "Next, I will find out how many boxes Markeesha sold on Sunday.",
    "On Sunday, she sold 15 fewer boxes than she did on Saturday.",
    "She sold 60 boxes on Saturday, so 15 fewer is 60 - 15 = 45.",
    "So, on Sunday, Markeesha sold 45 boxes.",
    "Now I will add up the total number of boxes she sold over the three days.",
    "On Friday, she sold 30 boxes. On Saturday, she sold 60 boxes. On Sunday, she sold 45 boxes.",
    "The total number of boxes is 30 + 60 + 45.",
    "30 + 60 is 90.",
    "90 + 45 is 135."

  "solution": "135"
