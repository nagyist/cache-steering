  "query": "Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm given that Tyson is 20 years old.",
    "Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson.",
    "So, Frederick is 2 times 20 years old.",
    "2 times 20 equals 40.",
    "Therefore, Frederick is 40 years old.",
    "Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick.",
    "So, Julian is 40 minus 20 years old.",
    "40 minus 20 equals 20.",
    "Therefore, Julian is 20 years old.",
    "Kyle is 5 years older than Julian.",
    "So, Kyle is 20 plus 5 years old.",
    "20 plus 5 equals 25."
