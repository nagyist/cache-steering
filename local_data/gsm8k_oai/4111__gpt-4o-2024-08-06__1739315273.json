  "query": "Ali has a store that sells fruits and vegetables. He puts 23 kg of kidney apples, 37 kg of golden apples and 14 kg of Canada apples on the shelves. By noon, 36 kg of apples were sold. What is the mass of apples that he has left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total mass of apples initially available in the store.",
    "Ali has 23 kg of kidney apples, 37 kg of golden apples, and 14 kg of Canada apples.",
    "I will add these weights to get the total mass of apples.",
    "23 kg (kidney apples) + 37 kg (golden apples) = 60 kg",
    "60 kg + 14 kg (Canada apples) = 74 kg",
    "So, the total mass of apples initially is 74 kg.",
    "Next, I know that 36 kg of apples were sold by noon.",
    "I will subtract the sold mass from the initial mass to find out the remaining mass of apples.",
    "74 kg (initial mass) - 36 kg (sold mass) = 38 kg",
    "Therefore, the mass of apples that Ali has left is 38 kg."
