  "query": "The fisherman gets 8 Red snappers and 14 Tunas every day. If a Red snapper costs $3 and a Tuna costs $2, how much does he earn every day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much the fisherman earns from selling Red snappers each day.",
    "He catches 8 Red snappers per day and each one costs $3.",
    "I will multiply the number of Red snappers by the cost per Red snapper: 8 * $3.",
    "8 * 3 equals 24. So he earns $24 from Red snappers each day.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much he earns from Tunas each day.",
    "He catches 14 Tunas each day and each one costs $2.",
    "I will multiply the number of Tunas by the cost per Tuna: 14 * $2.",
    "14 * 2 equals 28. So he earns $28 from Tunas each day.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount he earns by adding the earnings from Red snappers and Tunas together.",
    "I will add $24 (from Red snappers) and $28 (from Tunas).",
    "24 + 28 equals 52."

  "solution": "52"
