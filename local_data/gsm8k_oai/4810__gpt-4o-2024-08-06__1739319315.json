  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Dawn's monthly salary.",
    "Dawn's annual salary is 48,000.",
    "Since she is paid in 12 equal monthly payments, I divide her annual salary by 12.",
    "48,000 divided by 12 equals 4,000.",
    "Dawn earns 4,000 each month.",
    "Next, I calculate how much Dawn saves each month.",

    "4,000 times 0.10 equals 400.",
    "Dawn saves 400 each month."
