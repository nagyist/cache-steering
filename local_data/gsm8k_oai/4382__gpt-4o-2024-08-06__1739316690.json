  "query": "At Mrs. Dawson's rose garden, there are 10 rows of roses. In each row, there are 20 roses where 1/2 of these roses are red, 3/5 of the remaining are white and the rest are pink. How many roses at Mrs. Dawson's rose garden are pink?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total number of roses in the rose garden. There are 10 rows with 20 roses in each row.",
    "Multiply the number of rows by the number of roses per row: 10 * 20 = 200 roses in total.",
    "Determine the number of red roses. Half of the roses in each row are red, so half of 200 roses are red.",
    "Calculate half of 200: 200 / 2 = 100 red roses.",
    "Subtract the number of red roses from the total number of roses to find the remaining number: 200 - 100 = 100 roses.",
    "Find the number of white roses. 3/5 of the remaining roses after the red ones are white.",
    "Calculate 3/5 of the remaining 100 roses: (3/5) * 100 = 60 white roses.",
    "Determine the number of pink roses by subtracting the number of white roses from the remaining roses: 100 - 60 = 40 pink roses."
