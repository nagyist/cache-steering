  "query": "Musa is the class teacher of a class of 45 students. He wants to split them into three groups by age. If a third of the class is under 11 years, and two-fifths are above 11 but under 13, how many students will be in the third group (13 years and above)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many students are under 11 years old.",
    "A third of the class is under 11 years, and there are 45 students in total.",
    "To find a third of the class: 45 students \u00f7 3 = 15 students.",
    "So, 15 students are under 11 years old.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many students are above 11 but under 13 years old.",
    "Two-fifths of the class are in this age range.",
    "To find two-fifths of the class: 45 students \u00d7 (2/5) = 18 students.",
    "So, 18 students are above 11 but under 13 years old.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how many students are in the third group (13 years and above).",
    "I know that the total number of students is 45.",
    "The number of students in the first two groups is 15 (under 11) + 18 (above 11 but under 13) = 33 students.",
    "To find the number of students in the third group, subtract the sum of the first two groups from the total number of students: 45 - 33 = 12 students."
