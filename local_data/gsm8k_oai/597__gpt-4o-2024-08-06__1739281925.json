  "query": "John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the composition of the half-full decks. Each half-full deck should contain approximately 52 / 2 = 26 cards.",
    "The problem mentions that John has 3 half-full decks. So, I will calculate the total number of cards from the half-full decks. This would be 3 half-full decks x 26 cards per half-full deck = 78 cards.",
    "Next, we look at the full decks that John has. He has 3 full decks and each full deck contains 52 cards.",
    "Calculating for the full decks, we have 3 full decks x 52 cards per full deck = 156 cards.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of cards John initially had before he discarded any. I will add together the cards from the half-full and the full decks. Thus, 78 cards (from half-full decks) + 156 cards (from full decks) = 234 cards.",
    "John then decides to throw away 34 cards from this total. So, I will subtract those from the total initial number of cards.",
    "Subtracting the discarded cards gives me 234 cards - 34 cards = 200 cards."

  "solution": "200"
