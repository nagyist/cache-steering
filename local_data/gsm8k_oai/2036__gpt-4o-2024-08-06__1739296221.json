  "query": "Mr. Johnson has a prescription with enough pills for 30 days. After four-fifths of the days, he has 12 pills left. How many pills is Mr. Johnson supposed to take a day if he takes the same dose daily?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many days four-fifths of the 30 days are.",
    "Four-fifths of 30 days is calculated as (4/5) * 30.",
    "(4/5) * 30 equals 24 days.",
    "Mr. Johnson has taken his pills for 24 days.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pills Mr. Johnson has used in these 24 days.",
    "He started with a certain number of pills and has 12 pills left after 24 days.",
    "Originally, he had enough pills for 30 days.",
    "To find out how many pills he had originally, I\u2019ll assume the daily dose is \"x\" pills.",
    "Then, the total number of pills he originally had is 30 days * x pills/day = 30x pills.",
    "After 24 days, he should have consumed 24x pills.",
    "According to the information given, he has 12 pills left.",
    "This means he originally had 24x pills consumed and 12 pills remaining from the 30x total pills.",
    "Therefore, 30x - 24x = 12",
    "Simplifying 30x - 24x gives me 6x.",
    "So, 6x = 12.",
    "Now I solve for x by dividing both sides by 6.",
    "12 / 6 equals 2.",
    "Therefore, x = 2."
