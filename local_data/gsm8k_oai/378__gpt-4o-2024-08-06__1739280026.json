  "query": "Uki owns a bakery. She sells cupcakes at $1.50 each, cookies at $2 per packet, and biscuits at $1 per packet. In a day, she can bake an average of twenty cupcakes, ten packets of cookies, and twenty packets of biscuits.  How much will be her total earnings for five days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total earnings from cupcakes in one day.",
    "Uki sells each cupcake for $1.50.",
    "She bakes an average of 20 cupcakes in a day.",
    "To find the daily earnings from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $1.50 per cupcake = $30.",
    "Next, I calculate the total earnings from cookies in one day.",
    "Uki sells each packet of cookies for $2.",
    "She makes an average of 10 packets of cookies in a day.",
    "To find the daily earnings from cookies: 10 packets * $2 per packet = $20.",
    "Now, I calculate the total earnings from biscuits in one day.",
    "Uki sells each packet of biscuits for $1.",
    "She makes an average of 20 packets of biscuits in a day.",
    "To find the daily earnings from biscuits: 20 packets * $1 per packet = $20.",
    "Next, I calculate the total earnings for one day by adding earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits.",
    "Total daily earnings = $30 (cupcakes) + $20 (cookies) + $20 (biscuits) = $70.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total earnings for five days.",
    "Total earnings for five days = $70 per day * 5 days = $350."
