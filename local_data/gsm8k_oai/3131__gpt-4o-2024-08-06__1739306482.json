  "query": "George went to a movie theater to see a movie. He paid $16 for the ticket and decided to buy some nachos. The nachos were half the price of the ticket. How much did George pay in total for the visit to the movie theater?",
  "steps": [
    "George paid $16 for the movie ticket.",
    "The price of the nachos is half the price of the ticket.",
    "The price of the nachos = $16 / 2.",
    "The price of the nachos is $8.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total amount George spent.",
    "Total amount spent = price of the ticket + price of the nachos.",
    "Total amount spent = $16 + $8.",
    "Total amount spent = $24."
