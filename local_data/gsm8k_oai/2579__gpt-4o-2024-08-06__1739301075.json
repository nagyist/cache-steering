  "query": "Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many crayons Nori originally had.",
    "I know that Nori had 4 boxes, and each box contained 8 crayons.",
    "To find the total number of crayons, I will multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box: 4 * 8 = 32 crayons.",
    "Nori started with 32 crayons in total.",
    "Next, I will determine how many crayons Nori gave away, given that she has 15 crayons left.",
    "If she started with 32 crayons and has 15 left, then she gave away 32 - 15 = 17 crayons.",
    "Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae.",
    "To find out how many crayons Nori gave to Lea, I need to subtract the 5 crayons she gave to Mae from the total crayons given away.",
    "So, Nori gave 17 - 5 = 12 crayons to Lea.",
    "Finally, I will find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than to Mae.",
    "Nori gave Lea 12 crayons and Mae 5 crayons. So, she gave Lea 12 - 5 = 7 more crayons than Mae."
