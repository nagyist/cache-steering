  "query": "There were 148 peanuts in a jar. Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts and Bonita ate 29 peanuts. How many peanuts remain in the jar?",
  "steps": [
    "There were initially 148 peanuts in the jar.",
    "Brock ate one-fourth of the peanuts, so I need to find out what one-fourth of 148 is.",
    "To find one-fourth, I divide 148 by 4.",
    "148 divided by 4 equals 37.",
    "So, Brock ate 37 peanuts.",
    "Next, Bonita ate 29 peanuts.",
    "I need to find out how many peanuts were eaten in total by adding the peanuts eaten by Brock and Bonita.",
    "Brock ate 37 peanuts and Bonita ate 29 peanuts, so I add 37 and 29 together.",
    "37 plus 29 equals 66.",
    "A total of 66 peanuts were eaten.",
    "To find out how many peanuts remain in the jar, I subtract the total number of peanuts eaten from the initial total.",
    "There were 148 peanuts initially and 66 were eaten, so I subtract 66 from 148.",
    "148 minus 66 equals 82."

  "solution": "82"
