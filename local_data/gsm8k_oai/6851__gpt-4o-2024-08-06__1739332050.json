  "query": "Peter is buying a set of glasses. They cost $3 for small glasses and $5 for large ones. He has $50.  If he buys 8 small ones and leaves with $1 in change, how many large ones did he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter has a total of $50.",
    "He buys 8 small glasses.",
    "Each small glass costs $3.",
    "The total cost for 8 small glasses is \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\) dollars.",
    "Peter leaves with $1 in change.",
    "This means he spent a total of \\( 50 - 1 = 49 \\) dollars.",
    "He spent $24 on small glasses.",
    "Therefore, the amount he spent on large glasses is \\( 49 - 24 = 25 \\) dollars.",
    "Each large glass costs $5.",
    "If \\( x \\) is the number of large glasses he bought, then \\( 5x = 25 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 5, so \\( x = 5 \\)."
