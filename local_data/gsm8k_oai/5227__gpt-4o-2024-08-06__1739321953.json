  "query": "Julian has 400 legos and wants to make lego models of two identical airplanes. If each airplane model requires 240 legos, how many more legos does Julian need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the total number of legos Julian needs to build two airplane models.",
    "Each airplane requires 240 legos, so for two airplanes, the total legos needed is 240 * 2.",
    "Calculating 240 * 2 gives me 480 legos.",
    "Now, I know Julian has 400 legos already.",
    "I need to find out how many more legos are necessary by subtracting the legos Julian has from the total legos needed.",
    "I subtract 400 from 480 to get the number of additional legos needed: 480 - 400.",
    "Calculating 480 - 400 gives me 80.",
    "So, Julian needs 80 more legos to complete the two airplane models."

  "solution": "80"
