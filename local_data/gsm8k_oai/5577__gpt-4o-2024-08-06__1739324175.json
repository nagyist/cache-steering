  "query": "How many cheese balls are in a 35oz barrel if the 24oz barrel has 60 servings and each serving has 12 cheese balls?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many cheese balls are in a 35oz barrel.",
    "First, I'll find out how many cheese balls are in a 24oz barrel.",
    "In the 24oz barrel, there are 60 servings.",
    "Each serving has 12 cheese balls.",
    "I need to multiply the number of servings by the number of cheese balls per serving to get the total number of cheese balls in the 24oz barrel.",
    "60 servings * 12 cheese balls per serving = 720 cheese balls in a 24oz barrel.",
    "Now, I will use this information to figure out how many cheese balls are in a 35oz barrel.",
    "I will assume the number of cheese balls scales proportionally with the barrel size.",
    "First, I calculate the ratio of the sizes of the barrels.",
    "35oz / 24oz = 1.4583 (rounded to four decimal places).",
    "Now, I multiply the total number of cheese balls in the 24oz barrel by this ratio to get the number of cheese balls in the 35oz barrel.",
    "720 cheese balls * 1.4583 = 1049.976 cheese balls.",
    "Since I cannot have a fraction of a cheese ball, I round 1049.976 to the nearest whole number.",
    "1050 cheese balls."
