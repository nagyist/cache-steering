  "query": "James buys 3 packs of candy.  He pays with a $20 bill and gets $11 change.  How much did each pack of candy cost?",
  "steps": [
    "James pays with a $20 bill and receives $11 in change.",
    "To find out how much he spent, subtract the change from the amount he paid: $20 - $11.",
    "$20 - $11 = $9. This means James spent $9 on the candy packs.",
    "James bought 3 packs of candy in total.",
    "To find the cost of each pack, divide the total amount spent by the number of packs: $9 / 3.",
    "$9 / 3 = $3."
