  "query": "Martha spends 10 minutes turning the router off and on again, six times that long on hold with Comcast, and half as much time as she spent on hold yelling at a customer service representative. How much time did Martha spend on these activities total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much time Martha spent turning the router off and on again.",
    "Martha spent 10 minutes turning the router off and on again.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long Martha spent on hold with Comcast.",
    "Martha spent six times as long on hold as she did turning the router off and on.",
    "Six times 10 minutes is calculated as follows: 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.",
    "Martha spent 60 minutes on hold with Comcast.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the time Martha spent yelling at a customer service representative.",
    "Martha spent half as much time yelling at the customer service representative as she did on hold.",
    "Half of 60 minutes is calculated as follows: 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.",
    "Martha spent 30 minutes yelling at a customer service representative.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total time Martha spent on these activities.",
    "I add the time spent on all activities together: 10 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes.",
    "10 + 60 + 30 = 100 minutes."

  "solution": "100"
