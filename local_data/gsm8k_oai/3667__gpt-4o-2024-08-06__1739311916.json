  "query": "Every bedtime, Juwella reads a book. Three nights ago, she read 15 pages. Two nights ago she read twice that many pages, while last night she read 5 pages more than the previous night. She promised to read the remaining pages of the book tonight. If the book has 100 pages, how many pages will she read tonight?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many pages Juwella read three nights ago. She read 15 pages.",
    "Next, calculate how many pages she read two nights ago. She read twice as many pages as three nights ago. That is 2 * 15 = 30 pages.",
    "Now, find out how many pages she read last night. She read 5 more pages than the night before (two nights ago). That is 30 + 5 = 35 pages.",
    "Add up the total number of pages Juwella has read so far. This is 15 + 30 + 35.",
    "Calculate the sum of pages read: 15 + 30 = 45.",
    "Add the last night\u2019s reading: 45 + 35 = 80 pages.",
    "Determine the total number of pages in the book, which is 100.",
    "To find out how many pages Juwella will read tonight, subtract the pages she has read from the total. That is 100 - 80 = 20 pages."
