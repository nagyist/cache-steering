  "query": "In a school garden, there are flowers in different colors. In total there are 96 flowers of four colors: green, red, blue, and yellow. There are 9 green flowers and three times more red flowers. Blue flowers make up to 50% of the total flower count. How many yellow flowers are there?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the total number of flowers is 96.",
    "The problem states there are 9 green flowers.",
    "There are three times more red flowers than green flowers.",
    "To find the number of red flowers, I will multiply the number of green flowers by 3. So, 9 green flowers * 3 = 27 red flowers.",
    "Blue flowers make up 50% of the total flower count.",
    "50% of 96 is calculated by multiplying 96 by 0.5. So, 96 * 0.5 = 48 blue flowers.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of yellow flowers.",
    "I will subtract the known quantities (green, red, and blue flowers) from the total to find the number of yellow flowers.",
    "The already counted flowers are 9 green + 27 red + 48 blue = 84 flowers.",
    "Therefore, the number of yellow flowers is the total flowers minus the counted ones: 96 - 84 = 12 yellow flowers."
