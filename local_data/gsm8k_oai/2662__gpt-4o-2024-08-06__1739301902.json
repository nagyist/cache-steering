  "query": "The students at Evelyn's school are keeping journals. They have 3 journal-writing sessions per week. Each student writes 4 pages in each session. How many journal pages will each student write in 6 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that each student has 3 journal-writing sessions per week.",
    "In each session, each student writes 4 pages.",
    "To find out how many pages a student writes in a week, I multiply the number of sessions per week (3) by the number of pages per session (4).",
    "3 sessions per week * 4 pages per session = 12 pages per week.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of pages each student writes in 6 weeks.",
    "I multiply the number of pages per week (12) by the number of weeks (6).",
    "12 pages per week * 6 weeks = 72 pages."
