  "query": "James goes to pet smart to adopt a puppy.  The adoption fee is $200 and his friend agrees to pay 25% of that.  How much does James have to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the amount James's friend will contribute.",
    "The friend agrees to pay 25% of the adoption fee.",
    "Calculate 25% of $200.",
    "25% is the same as 0.25 as a decimal.",
    "Multiply $200 by 0.25 to find the contribution amount.",
    "$200 * 0.25 = $50",
    "The friend's contribution is $50.",
    "Now, subtract the friend's contribution from the total adoption fee to find how much James has to pay.",
    "$200 - $50 = $150"
