  "query": "Jane purchased 15 ice cream cones and 5 cups of pudding. Each ice cream cone cost $5 and each cup of pudding cost $2. How much more did Jane spend on ice cream than on pudding, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total cost of the ice cream cones. Jane purchased 15 ice cream cones and each cone costs $5.",
    "Calculate the total cost for the ice cream cones: 15 cones * $5 per cone = $75.",
    "Next, determine the total cost for the cups of pudding. Jane purchased 5 cups of pudding and each cup costs $2.",
    "Calculate the total cost for the cups of pudding: 5 cups * $2 per cup = $10.",
    "Now, find the difference in cost between the ice cream and the pudding. Subtract the total cost of the pudding from the total cost of the ice cream.",
    "Calculate the difference: $75 (ice cream) - $10 (pudding) = $65."
