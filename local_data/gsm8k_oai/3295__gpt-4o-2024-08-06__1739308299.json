  "query": "Karen and Donald and their 6 children are sharing a beach house with Tom and Eva and their 4 children.  If there are 16 legs in the pool, how many people are not in the pool?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many total people are in both families.",
    "Karen and Donald have 6 children, making a total of 8 people in their family.",
    "Tom and Eva have 4 children, making a total of 6 people in their family.",
    "Adding the two families together, 8 people from Karen and Donald's family plus 6 people from Tom and Eva's family equals 14 people in total.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many people are in the pool.",
    "There are 16 legs in the pool. Each person has 2 legs.",
    "To find how many people are in the pool, I divide 16 legs by 2 legs per person, which equals 8 people in the pool.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many people are not in the pool.",
    "With 14 total people and 8 people in the pool, the number of people not in the pool is 14 minus 8.",
    "14 minus 8 equals 6."
