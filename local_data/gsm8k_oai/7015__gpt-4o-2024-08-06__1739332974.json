  "query": "Cassidy collects movie posters from newly released sci-fi movies. After this summer, she will have six more posters in her collection, making it double the size it was two years ago when she had 14 posters. How many posters does she have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Begin by determining how many posters Cassidy had two years ago, which is given as 14 posters.",
    "The problem states that her collection will double compared to two years ago. So, find the doubled amount: 14 posters * 2 = 28 posters.",
    "After this summer, Cassidy's collection will be 28 posters based on the doubled amount.",
    "This summer she will add 6 more posters to reach the doubled amount.",
    "To find out how many posters Cassidy currently has, subtract the 6 new posters from the doubled total: 28 posters - 6 posters = 22 posters."
