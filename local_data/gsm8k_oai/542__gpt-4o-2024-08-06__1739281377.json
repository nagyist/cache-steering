  "query": "Every day, Sara bakes 10 cakes and puts them in his refrigerator. He does this for 5 days. Carol then comes over and eats 12 of his cakes. If it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, how many cans of frosting does Bob need to frost the remaining cakes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cakes Sara bakes in total over the 5 days.",
    "Sara bakes 10 cakes each day.",
    "She bakes for 5 days.",
    "The total number of cakes baked is 10 cakes/day * 5 days = 50 cakes.",
    "Next, I need to account for the cakes that Carol eats.",
    "Carol eats 12 cakes.",
    "I subtract the 12 cakes that Carol eats from the total of 50 cakes Sara has.",
    "50 cakes - 12 cakes = 38 cakes remaining.",
    "Now I need to determine how many cans of frosting are needed for the remaining cakes.",
    "It takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake.",
    "Therefore, for 38 cakes, the number of frosting cans needed is 38 cakes * 2 cans/cake.",
    "38 * 2 = 76 cans of frosting."

  "solution": "76"
