    "Max has 8 children.",
    "All his children, except 2, have the same number of children as Max does.",
    "We need to determine how many each has that matches Max's total number of children.",
    "Identify how many children, excluding the two with 5 children each, have this number of children: 8 - 2 = 6 children.",
    "Determine the number of grandchildren from the 6 children who have the same number of children as Max: 6 children \u00d7 8 grandchildren each = 48 grandchildren.",
    "Add the grandchildren from the 2 children who have 5 children each: 2 children \u00d7 5 grandchildren each = 10 grandchildren.",
    "Combine the total number of grandchildren: 48 grandchildren + 10 grandchildren = 58 grandchildren."
