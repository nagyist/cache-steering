  "query": "Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud. Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud. If Masud has 60 siblings, how many more siblings does Janet have more than Carlos?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many siblings Masud has. The problem states that Masud has 60 siblings.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many siblings Janet has based on Masud's count. Janet has 60 less than four times Masud's siblings.",
    "To find four times the number of Masud's siblings, I multiply 60 by 4.",
    "4 times 60 equals 240.",
    "Janet has 60 less than 240 siblings, so I subtract 60 from 240.",
    "240 minus 60 equals 180. Therefore, Janet has 180 siblings.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many siblings Carlos has. Carlos has 3/4 times as many siblings as Masud.",
    "To find 3/4 of Masud's siblings, I multiply 60 by 3/4.",
    "First, calculate 60 divided by 4, which is 15.",
    "Next, multiply 15 by 3, which equals 45.",
    "Carlos has 45 siblings.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more siblings Janet has compared to Carlos.",
    "Subtract the number of Carlos's siblings from the number of Janet's siblings.",
    "180 minus 45 equals 135."
