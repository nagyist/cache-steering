  "query": "As firefighters, Doug, Kai, and Eli have been putting out a lot of fires over the week. Doug has put out 20 fires for the week and Kai has put out 3 times more than Doug. Meanwhile, Eli has put out half the number of fires Kai was able to. How many fires have they put out for the entire week?",
  "steps": [
    "Doug has put out 20 fires for the week.",
    "Kai has put out 3 times more fires than Doug.",
    "To find out how many fires Kai has put out, I need to multiply the number of fires Doug put out by 3.",
    "Kai's fires = 20 * 3 = 60",
    "Eli has put out half the number of fires that Kai has put out.",
    "To find out how many fires Eli has put out, I need to divide the number of fires Kai put out by 2.",
    "Eli's fires = 60 / 2 = 30",
    "Now, I need to add the number of fires Doug, Kai, and Eli put out to find the total number of fires for the entire week.",
    "Total fires = Doug's fires + Kai's fires + Eli's fires = 20 + 60 + 30",
    "Total fires = 110"
  ],
  "solution": "110"
