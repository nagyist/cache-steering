  "steps": [
    "Jennie can make 7 quilts with 21 yards of material.",
    "First, I need to determine how many yards of material are required for one quilt.",
    "If 7 quilts require 21 yards, then the material per quilt is calculated by dividing 21 yards by 7 quilts.",
    "21 yards \u00f7 7 quilts = 3 yards per quilt.",
    "Now, since I know each quilt requires 3 yards of material, I can find out how many yards are needed for 12 quilts.",
    "To find the total material required for 12 quilts, I need to multiply the yardage for one quilt by 12.",
    "3 yards/quilt \u00d7 12 quilts = 36 yards."
