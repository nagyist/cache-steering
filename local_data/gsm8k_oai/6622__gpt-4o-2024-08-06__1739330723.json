  "query": "Louis has 5 oranges and 3 apples. Samantha has 8 oranges and 7 apples. If Marley has twice as many oranges as Louis and three times as many apples as Samantha, how many fruits in total does Marley have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many oranges Louis has. Louis has 5 oranges.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many oranges Marley has, which is twice the number of Louis's oranges.",
    "Marley has 2 times 5 oranges, which is 10 oranges.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many apples Samantha has. Samantha has 7 apples.",
    "Next, I calculate how many apples Marley has, which is three times the number of Samantha's apples.",
    "Marley has 3 times 7 apples, which is 21 apples.",
    "I now have the total number of oranges and apples Marley has: 10 oranges and 21 apples.",
    "To find the total number of fruits Marley has, I add the number of oranges and apples together.",
    "10 oranges plus 21 apples equals 31 fruits in total."
