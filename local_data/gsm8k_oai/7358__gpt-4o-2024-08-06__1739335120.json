  "query": "Jack has been driving for the past 9 years. He drives 37,000 miles every four months. How many miles has Jack driven since he started driving?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many four-month periods are in 9 years.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "Therefore, in 9 years, there are 9 * 12 = 108 months.",
    "Now, I should find out how many four-month periods are in 108 months.",
    "I divide the total number of months, 108, by 4 to get the number of four-month periods.",
    "108 / 4 = 27 four-month periods.",
    "Jack drives 37,000 miles every four months.",
    "To find the total number of miles Jack has driven, I multiply the number of four-month periods by the miles he drives in each period.",
    "27 * 37,000 = 999,000 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "999,000"
