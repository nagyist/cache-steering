  "query": "Scott wants to buy a skateboard. To make money, Scott sold berry smoothies for $3 a cup and cakes for $2 each. He sold 40 cups of smoothies and 18 cakes. How much money did he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Scott made from selling smoothies.",
    "He sold 40 cups of smoothies at $3 each.",
    "I multiply the number of smoothies (40) by the price per smoothie ($3).",
    "40 cups * $3/cup = $120",
    "Scott made $120 from selling smoothies.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money Scott made from selling cakes.",
    "He sold 18 cakes at $2 each.",
    "I multiply the number of cakes (18) by the price per cake ($2).",
    "18 cakes * $2/cake = $36",
    "Scott made $36 from selling cakes.",
    "To find the total amount of money Scott made, I add the money from smoothies and the money from cakes together.",
    "$120 (from smoothies) + $36 (from cakes) = $156"
