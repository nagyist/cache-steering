  "query": "Joshua, Jose, and Albert are collecting rocks. Joshua collected 80 rocks while Jose collected 14 fewer rocks. Albert has collected 20 more rocks than Jose. How many more rocks did Albert collect than Joshua?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many rocks Jose collected.",
    "I know Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua, who collected 80 rocks.",
    "So, I subtract 14 from 80: \\(80 - 14 = 66\\).",
    "Jose collected 66 rocks.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many rocks Albert collected.",
    "Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose.",
    "So, I add 20 to the number of rocks Jose collected: \\(66 + 20 = 86\\).",
    "Albert collected 86 rocks.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua.",
    "Joshua collected 80 rocks.",
    "I subtract the number of rocks Joshua collected from the number of rocks Albert collected: \\(86 - 80 = 6\\)."
