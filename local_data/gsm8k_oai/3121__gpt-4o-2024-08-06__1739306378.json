  "query": "A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?",
  "steps": [
    "The pizza was cut into 8 slices in total.",
    "Angeli ate 3/2 slices.",
    "Marlon also ate 3/2 slices.",
    "First, I'll calculate the total number of slices the two of them ate together.",
    "3/2 slices eaten by Angeli plus 3/2 slices eaten by Marlon equals 3/2 + 3/2.",
    "3/2 + 3/2 equals 6/2.",
    "6/2 simplifies to 3.",
    "So, Angeli and Marlon together ate 3 slices of pizza.",
    "There were initially 8 slices of pizza.",
    "Now, I'll subtract the 3 slices they ate from the total 8 slices.",
    "8 - 3 equals 5."

  "solution": "5"
