  "query": "If two piles of toys added together make 120 toys in total, and the larger of the two piles is twice as big as the smaller one, how many toys are in the larger pile?",
  "steps": [
    "I will denote the number of toys in the smaller pile as \\( x \\).",
    "Since the larger pile is twice as big as the smaller pile, the number of toys in the larger pile can be represented as \\( 2x \\).",
    "According to the problem, the total number of toys in the two piles is 120.",
    "So I can write the equation for the total number of toys: \\( x + 2x = 120 \\).",
    "Combining the terms in the equation gives me \\( 3x = 120 \\).",
    "I will solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "Doing this calculation gives \\( x = \\frac{120}{3} \\).",
    "Calculating the division results in \\( x = 40 \\).",
    "Since \\( x \\) represents the number of toys in the smaller pile, and the larger pile has twice as many, I calculate the number of toys in the larger pile as \\( 2 \\times 40 \\).",
    "So the number of toys in the larger pile is 80."
