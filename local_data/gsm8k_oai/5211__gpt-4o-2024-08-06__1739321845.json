  "query": "Jake makes a drink that is 2 parts Coke, 1 part Sprite and 3 parts Mountain Dew.  If the drink contains 6 ounces of Coke, how many ounces is the drink?",
  "steps": [
    "Jake's drink recipe is 2 parts Coke, 1 part Sprite, and 3 parts Mountain Dew.",
    "The drink has 6 ounces of Coke, which represents 2 parts in the mixture.",
    "To find the number of ounces per part, divide the total ounces of Coke by the number of parts it represents: 6 ounces of Coke / 2 parts = 3 ounces per part.",
    "Now I know each part is 3 ounces.",
    "Jake's drink is 2 parts Coke, 1 part Sprite, and 3 parts Mountain Dew.",
    "The total number of parts in the drink is 2 (Coke) + 1 (Sprite) + 3 (Mountain Dew) = 6 parts.",
    "Multiply the number of parts by the ounces per part to find the total ounces in the drink: 6 parts \u00d7 3 ounces per part = 18 ounces."
