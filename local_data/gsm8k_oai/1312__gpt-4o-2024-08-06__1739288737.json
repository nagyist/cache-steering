  "query": "A merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050. If a keyboard costs $20, how much does a printer cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the keyboards.",
    "The merchant bought 15 keyboards.",
    "Each keyboard costs $20.",
    "To find the total cost of the keyboards, I multiply the number of keyboards by the cost per keyboard.",
    "15 keyboards * $20/keyboard = $300.",
    "Now, I know the total cost of the keyboards is $300.",
    "I need to find out how much was spent on the printers.",
    "The total cost for both the keyboards and printers is $2050.",
    "To find the cost spent on the printers, I subtract the cost of the keyboards from the total cost.",
    "$2050 total - $300 for keyboards = $1750 remaining for printers.",
    "Next, I need to find the cost of one printer.",
    "The merchant bought 25 printers.",
    "I need to divide the total cost of the printers by the number of printers to find the cost per printer.",
    "$1750 / 25 printers = $70 per printer."

  "solution": "70"
