  "query": "Emilia needs 42 cartons of berries to make a berry cobbler. She already has 2 cartons of strawberries and 7 cartons of blueberries in her cupboard. She decides to go to the supermarket to get more cartons. How many more cartons of berries should Emilia buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how many cartons of berries Emilia already has.",
    "Emilia has 2 cartons of strawberries.",
    "Emilia also has 7 cartons of blueberries.",
    "I will add these amounts together to find the total number of cartons Emilia currently has.",
    "2 cartons of strawberries + 7 cartons of blueberries = 9 cartons of berries.",
    "Next, I will determine how many cartons of berries Emilia needs in total.",
    "Emilia needs 42 cartons of berries to make the cobbler.",
    "I will now subtract the number of cartons Emilia already has from the total number she needs.",
    "42 cartons needed - 9 cartons already have = 33 cartons.",
    "Emilia needs to buy 33 more cartons of berries."
