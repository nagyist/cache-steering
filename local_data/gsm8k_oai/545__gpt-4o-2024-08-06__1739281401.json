  "query": "There are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants. One-third of them turn yellow and fall off on each of the tea leaf plants.  How many green leaves are left on the tea leaf plants?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of green leaves initially on each tea leaf plant.",
    "There are 18 green leaves on each of the 3 tea leaf plants.",
    "Multiply the number of leaves per plant by the number of plants: 18 leaves/plant * 3 plants = 54 leaves.",
    "Next, find out how many leaves turn yellow and fall off each plant.",
    "One-third of the leaves on each plant turn yellow and fall off.",
    "Calculate one-third of the leaves per plant: 18 leaves * (1/3) = 6 leaves.",
    "So, 6 leaves fell off per plant.",
    "Calculate the total number of yellow leaves that fell off by multiplying by the number of plants: 6 leaves/plant * 3 plants = 18 leaves.",
    "Next, subtract the total yellow leaves from the total initial green leaves to find the remaining green leaves.",
    "54 initial green leaves - 18 fallen yellow leaves = 36 remaining green leaves."
