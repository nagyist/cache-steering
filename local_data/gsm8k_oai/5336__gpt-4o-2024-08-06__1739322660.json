  "query": "Tammy wants to run 3500 meters per week. She knows her track at school is 50 meters around. If she wants to run the same amount each day, how many loops should she make per day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many meters Tammy wants to run each day.",
    "She wants to run 3500 meters per week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "I divide 3500 meters by 7 days to find out how many meters she should run per day.",
    "3500 meters \u00f7 7 days = 500 meters per day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many loops around the track Tammy needs to run each day.",
    "The track is 50 meters around.",
    "I divide the total meters she needs to run each day by the distance of one loop to find the number of loops.",
    "500 meters \u00f7 50 meters per loop = 10 loops per day."
