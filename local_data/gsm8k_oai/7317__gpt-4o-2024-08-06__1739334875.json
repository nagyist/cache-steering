  "query": "Mark has to wait 4 days for his first coronavirus vaccine appointment. Then he has to wait 20 days for his second vaccine appointment. Then he has to wait 2 weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective. How many days does Mark have to wait in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Mark has to wait 4 days for his first vaccine appointment.",
    "After his first appointment, he waits 20 days for his second vaccine appointment.",
    "Now, I add the 4 days and the 20 days together: 4 + 20 = 24 days.",
    "After the second vaccine appointment, Mark has to wait 2 weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective.",
    "I know that 1 week equals 7 days, so 2 weeks equals 14 days.",
    "Now I add the 14 days to the 24 days: 24 + 14 = 38 days.",
    "I recheck the calculations to make sure there's no error.",
    "All calculations seem correct."
