  "query": "Dale owns 4 sports cars. The red one can travel at twice the speed of the green one, but the green one can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one.  The yellow one is broken and cannot move at all.  If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?",
  "steps": [
    "I am given the speeds of four cars with Dale, and I need to find the speed of the red car.",
    "I know that the blue car can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour.",
    "According to the problem statement, the green one travels at 8 times the speed of the blue one.",
    "To find the speed of the green car, I multiply the speed of the blue car by 8.",
    "80 miles per hour (blue car) * 8 = 640 miles per hour.",
    "So, the green car travels at 640 miles per hour.",
    "The problem states that the red one can travel at twice the speed of the green one.",
    "To find the speed of the red car, I multiply the speed of the green car by 2.",
    "640 miles per hour (green car) * 2 = 1280 miles per hour.",
    "Therefore, the red car travels at 1280 miles per hour."

  "solution": "1280"
