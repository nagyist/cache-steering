  "query": "Two bowls are holding marbles, and the first bowl has a capacity equal to 3/4 the capacity of the second bowl. If the second bowl has 600 marbles, calculate the total number of marbles both bowls are holding together.",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the capacity of the first bowl is equal to 3/4 of the capacity of the second bowl.",
    "The second bowl has 600 marbles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many marbles the first bowl can hold.",
    "The capacity of the first bowl is 3/4 of the capacity of the second bowl, which means it's 3/4 of 600.",
    "To calculate 3/4 of 600, I multiply 600 by 3/4.",
    "600 multiplied by 3/4 is the same as 600 multiplied by 0.75.",
    "600 * 0.75 equals 450.",
    "The first bowl can hold 450 marbles.",
    "I now have the number of marbles each bowl can hold: the first bowl holds 450 marbles and the second bowl holds 600 marbles.",
    "To find the total number of marbles in both bowls, I add the number of marbles in the first and second bowls together.",
    "450 + 600 equals 1050."

  "solution": "1050"
