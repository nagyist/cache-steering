  "query": "Vermont opened up 4 web pages on his web browser and found 12 ads on the first web page and twice as many ads on the second web page as the first web page. When he opened the third web page, he found 24 more ads than the number of ads on the second web page. If the fourth web page had 3/4 times as many ads as the second web page, calculate the total number of ads Vermont clicked on if he clicked on 2/3 of them.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many ads were on each web page.",
    "The first web page had 12 ads.",
    "The second web page had twice as many ads as the first, so it had 12 * 2 = 24 ads.",
    "The third web page had 24 more ads than the second web page, so it had 24 + 24 = 48 ads.",
    "The fourth web page had 3/4 times as many ads as the second, so it had 24 * 3/4 = 18 ads.",
    "Next, I will add up all the ads from the four pages to find the total number of ads.",
    "Total ads = 12 (first page) + 24 (second page) + 48 (third page) + 18 (fourth page).",
    "Total ads = 12 + 24 + 48 + 18 = 102.",
    "Vermont clicked on 2/3 of these ads.",
    "Number of ads clicked = 2/3 * 102.",
    "Number of ads clicked = 68."
