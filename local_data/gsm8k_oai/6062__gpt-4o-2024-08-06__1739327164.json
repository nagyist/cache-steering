    "I know there are 30 red bowling balls.",
    "The problem states there are 6 more green bowling balls than red bowling balls.",
    "To find the number of green bowling balls, I need to add 6 to the number of red bowling balls.",
    "30 red bowling balls plus 6 gives me 36 green bowling balls.",

    "To find the total number of bowling balls, I will add the number of red and green bowling balls together.",
    "30 red bowling balls plus 36 green bowling balls equals 66 total bowling balls."
