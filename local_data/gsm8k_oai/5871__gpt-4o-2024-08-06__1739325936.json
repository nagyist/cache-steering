  "query": "Tayzia and her two young daughters get haircuts.  Women\u2019s haircuts are $48.  Children\u2019s haircuts are $36.  If Tayzia wants to give a 20% tip to the hair stylist, how much would it be?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the haircuts without the tip.",
    "Tayzia is getting one haircut herself, so that is $48.",
    "Each of Tayzia's two daughters is getting a haircut, and children's haircuts are $36 each.",
    "The total cost for the daughters' haircuts is 2 x $36 = $72.",
    "Now, add the cost of Tayzia's haircut and her daughters' haircuts together: $48 + $72 = $120.",
    "Next, calculate the 20% tip based on the total cost of $120.",
    "To find 20%, multiply $120 by 0.20 (20/100).",
    "$120 x 0.20 = $24.",
    "The amount Tayzia wants to give as a 20% tip is $24."
