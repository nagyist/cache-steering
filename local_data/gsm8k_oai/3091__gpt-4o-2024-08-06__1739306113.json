  "query": "Marcy had 22 sodas in her fridge for a party. Her friend Tina came over and gave her 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before. How many sodas will Marcy have for the party?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcy initially had 22 sodas in her fridge.",
    "Tina gave Marcy 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before.",
    "The number of sodas Marcy had before is 22.",
    "I need to calculate two times the number of sodas Marcy had before: 2 * 22 = 44.",
    "Tina gave Marcy 12 sodas plus 44 sodas: 12 + 44 = 56.",
    "So, Marcy received a total of 56 sodas from Tina.",
    "Now, I add the sodas given by Tina to the initial number of sodas Marcy had: 22 + 56 = 78."

  "solution": "78"
