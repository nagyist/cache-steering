  "query": "The teacher assigned a minimum of 25 pages of reading for homework.  Harrison read 10 more pages than assigned.  Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison and Sam read twice the amount of Pam.  How many pages did Sam read?",
  "steps": [
    "The teacher assigned a minimum of 25 pages.",
    "Harrison read 10 more pages than assigned, so Harrison read 25 + 10 = 35 pages.",
    "Pam read 15 more pages than Harrison, so Pam read 35 + 15 = 50 pages.",
    "Sam read twice the amount of Pam's pages, so Sam read 2 * 50 = 100 pages."

  "solution": "100"
