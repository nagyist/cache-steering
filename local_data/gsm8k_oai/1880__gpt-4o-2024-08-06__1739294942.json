  "query": "Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run.  And Milo's best friend, Cory, can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.  If Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, how many miles can Milo run in two hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the speed at which Cory drives his wheelchair.",
    "According to the problem, Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I need to find the speed at which Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.",
    "It is given that Cory's speed is twice the speed of Milo on his skateboard.",
    "Therefore, Milo's skateboarding speed is half of Cory's speed, which is 12 miles per hour divided by 2.",
    "12 divided by 2 equals 6, so Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at 6 miles per hour.",
    "Next, I need to find the speed at which Milo can run.",
    "The problem states that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run.",
    "Therefore, Milo's running speed is half of his skateboarding speed, which is 6 miles per hour divided by 2.",
    "6 divided by 2 equals 3, so Milo can run at 3 miles per hour.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how many miles Milo can run in two hours.",
    "Since Milo runs at 3 miles per hour, in two hours he would run 3 miles per hour times 2 hours.",
    "3 times 2 equals 6, so Milo can run 6 miles in two hours."

  "solution": "6"
