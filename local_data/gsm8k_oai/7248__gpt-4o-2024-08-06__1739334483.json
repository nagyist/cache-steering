  "query": "Mikail's birthday is tomorrow. He will be 3 times older than he was when he was three. On his birthday, his parents give him $5 for every year old he is. How much money will they give him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Mikail will be on his birthday.",
    "I know that he will be 3 times older than he was when he was three.",
    "When Mikail was three, he was 3 years old.",
    "If he is 3 times older than when he was three, I multiply 3 (his age then) by 3.",
    "3 times 3 is 9, so Mikail will be 9 years old on his birthday.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money his parents will give him.",
    "His parents give him $5 for every year of his age.",
    "Since he will be 9 years old, I multiply 9 by $5.",
    "9 times $5 is $45.",
    "Now I have the answer."
