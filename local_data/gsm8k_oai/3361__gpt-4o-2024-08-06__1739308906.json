  "query": "Agnes is 25 years old and her daughter, Jane is 6 years old. In how many years will Agnes be twice as old as Jane?",
  "steps": [
    "Agnes is currently 25 years old.",
    "Jane is currently 6 years old.",
    "We need to find the number of years, let's call it \"x,\" after which Agnes will be twice as old as Jane.",
    "In \"x\" years, Agnes will be 25 + x years old.",
    "In \"x\" years, Jane will be 6 + x years old.",
    "We need the equation 25 + x = 2 * (6 + x) to hold true, which represents Agnes being twice as old as Jane in \"x\" years.",
    "Expand and simplify the equation: 25 + x = 12 + 2x.",
    "Rearrange the equation to isolate \"x\": 25 - 12 = 2x - x.",
    "The equation simplifies to: 13 = x.",
    "So, in 13 years, Agnes will be twice as old as Jane."

  "solution": "13"
