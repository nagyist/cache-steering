  "query": "Julie, Letitia and Anton decided to have dinner together at a nearby restaurant.  Julie orders $10 worth of food, Letitia orders $20 worth of food, and Anton orders $30 worth of food.  How much should each pay in tips if they want to split a 20% tip for the whole meal evenly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total cost of the food.",
    "Julie orders $10, Letitia orders $20, and Anton orders $30.",
    "The total cost of the food is $10 + $20 + $30.",
    "The total cost of the food is $60.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the tip as 20% of the total cost.",
    "20% of $60 is calculated as 0.20 * $60.",
    "0.20 * $60 equals $12.",
    "The total tip amount is $12.",
    "Now, I need to split the tip evenly among Julie, Letitia, and Anton.",
    "There are 3 people sharing the tip.",
    "Divide the total tip of $12 by 3.",
    "$12 divided by 3 equals $4.",
    "Each person should pay $4 as their share of the tip."
