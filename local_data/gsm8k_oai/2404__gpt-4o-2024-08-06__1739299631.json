  "query": "Tommy has 3 toy cars. His neighbor, Jessie, has 3 cars too. Jessie's older brother has 5 more cars than Tommy and Jessie. How many cars do the three of them have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cars Tommy has.",
    "Tommy has 3 toy cars.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cars Jessie has.",
    "Jessie also has 3 toy cars.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cars Jessie's older brother has.",
    "Jessie's older brother has 5 more cars than Tommy and Jessie combined.",
    "First, I calculate the total number of cars Tommy and Jessie have together.",
    "Tommy's 3 cars + Jessie's 3 cars = 6 cars.",
    "Jessie's older brother has 5 more than these 6 cars.",
    "So, Jessie's older brother has 6 + 5 = 11 cars.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cars the three of them have altogether.",
    "I add up the cars of Tommy, Jessie, and Jessie's older brother.",
    "Total cars = Tommy's 3 cars + Jessie's 3 cars + Jessie's older brother's 11 cars.",
    "Total cars = 3 + 3 + 11",
    "Total = 17 cars."
