  "query": "Amara had 100 pieces of clothing but started donating her clothes to others. She donated 5 to one orphanage home and triple that to another orphanage home. If she decides to throw away 15 of her old clothes, how many pieces of clothing does she have remaining?",
  "steps": [
    "Amara originally has 100 pieces of clothing.",
    "She donated 5 pieces to one orphanage home.",
    "5 pieces donated means she has 100 - 5 = 95 pieces left.",
    "She then donates triple that amount (5 pieces) to another orphanage home.",
    "Triple 5 is 3 * 5 = 15 pieces.",
    "She donates 15 more pieces, so now she has 95 - 15 = 80 pieces left.",
    "Amara decides to throw away 15 of her old clothes.",
    "Throwing away 15 pieces means she has 80 - 15 = 65 pieces left."
