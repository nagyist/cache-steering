  "query": "Each turtle lays a clutch of 20 eggs. If 40% of the eggs successfully hatch, how many hatchlings do 6 turtles produce?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the number of hatchlings, I first need to calculate the total number of eggs laid by 6 turtles.",
    "Each turtle lays 20 eggs, so I multiply 20 eggs per turtle by 6 turtles.",
    "20 eggs/turtle \u00d7 6 turtles = 120 eggs",
    "40% of these eggs successfully hatch, so I need to calculate 40% of 120.",
    "To find 40% of 120, I multiply 120 by 0.40.",
    "120 \u00d7 0.40 = 48",
    "Therefore, 6 turtles produce 48 hatchlings."
