  "steps": [
    "Billy can spit a watermelon seed 30 inches.",
    "Madison can spit a watermelon seed 20% farther than Billy.",
    "To calculate how far Madison can spit, multiply Billy's distance by 20% and add that to Billy's distance.",
    "20% of 30 inches is 0.2 \u00d7 30 = 6 inches.",
    "Madison can spit a watermelon seed 30 + 6 = 36 inches.",
    "Ryan can spit a watermelon seed 50% shorter than Madison.",
    "To calculate how far Ryan can spit, find 50% of Madison's distance and subtract it from Madison's distance.",
    "50% of 36 inches is 0.5 \u00d7 36 = 18 inches.",
    "Ryan can spit a watermelon seed 36 - 18 = 18 inches."
