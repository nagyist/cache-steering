  "query": "Joshua and Justin shared $40. Joshua\u2019s share was thrice as much as Justin\u2019s. How much is Joshua's share?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to assign variables to represent the amounts of money Joshua and Justin have.",
    "Let's say Justin's share is \\( x \\).",
    "Joshua\u2019s share is thrice as much as Justin\u2019s, so Joshua\u2019s share is \\( 3x \\).",
    "Together, Joshua and Justin have $40. Therefore, the equation to represent this situation is \\( x + 3x = 40 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( 4x = 40 \\).",
    "Now, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4: \\( x = \\frac{40}{4} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( x \\): \\( x = 10 \\).",
    "Justin's share is \\( x \\), or $10.",
    "Joshua's share is \\( 3x \\), so I need to calculate \\( 3 \\times 10 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 3 \\times 10 \\), which equals 30.",
    "Therefore, Joshua's share is $30."

  "solution": "30"
