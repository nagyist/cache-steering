  "query": "Hannah brought $30 to the county fair. She spent half of it on rides and another $5 on dessert. How much, in dollars, is left?",
  "steps": [
    "Hannah brought $30 to the fair.",
    "She spent half of her $30 on rides.",
    "Half of $30 is calculated as $30 divided by 2.",
    "$30 divided by 2 equals $15.",
    "Therefore, Hannah spent $15 on rides.",
    "Hannah originally had $30, and after spending $15 on rides, she has $30 - $15 left.",
    "$30 - $15 equals $15.",
    "Next, Hannah spent $5 on dessert.",
    "I need to subtract the $5 expenditure on dessert from her remaining money.",
    "She had $15 left; subtracting $5 for dessert: $15 - $5.",
    "$15 - $5 equals $10.",
    "I checked my calculations: she spent $15 on rides and $5 on dessert, totaling $20.",
    "With an initial $30, and $20 spent, she should logically have $10 left."
