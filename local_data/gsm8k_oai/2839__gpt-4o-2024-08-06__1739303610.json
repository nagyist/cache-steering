  "query": "Jacob is making s'mores. Each s'more takes two graham crackers and one marshmallow. If Jacob has 48 graham crackers and 6 marshmallows, how many more marshmallows does he need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many s'mores Jacob can make with the graham crackers he has.",
    "Jacob has 48 graham crackers.",
    "Since each s'more requires 2 graham crackers, I divide the total number of graham crackers by 2 to find out how many s'mores he can make.",
    "48 graham crackers \u00f7 2 graham crackers per s'more = 24 s'mores.",
    "Next, I check how many marshmallows Jacob has.",
    "Jacob has 6 marshmallows.",
    "Each s'more requires 1 marshmallow, so Jacob can only make as many s'mores as he has marshmallows.",
    "With 6 marshmallows, Jacob can make 6 s'mores.",
    "To utilize all 24 s'mores worth of graham crackers, Jacob would need 24 marshmallows.",
    "I need to calculate how many more marshmallows Jacob needs to reach 24 marshmallows.",
    "24 marshmallows needed - 6 marshmallows Jacob has = 18 more marshmallows."

  "solution": "18"
