  "query": "To raise money, a school is selling ice-pops for $1.50. It costs 90 cents to make each pop, and the money from the pops will be used to buy pencils, which cost $1.80 each. How many pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the profit made from each ice-pop sold.",
    "The selling price of each ice-pop is $1.50.",
    "The cost to make each ice-pop is $0.90.",
    "Subtract the cost from the selling price to find the profit per ice-pop: $1.50 - $0.90 = $0.60.",
    "Next, calculate the total cost to buy 100 pencils.",
    "Each pencil costs $1.80.",
    "Multiply the cost per pencil by the number of pencils needed: $1.80 * 100 = $180.",
    "Now, determine how many ice-pops need to be sold to reach a profit of $180.",
    "Divide the total money needed by the profit per ice-pop: $180 / $0.60 = 300.",
    "Thus, 300 ice-pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils."

  "solution": "300"
