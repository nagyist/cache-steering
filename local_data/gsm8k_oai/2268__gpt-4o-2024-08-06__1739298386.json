  "query": "Kevin has a shoebox filled with toads.  Every day, Kevin feeds each toad 3 worms.  It takes Kevin 15 minutes to find each worm.  If it takes Kevin 6 hours to find enough worms to feed all of his toads, how many toads does Kevin have in his shoebox?",
  "steps": [
    "I first need to determine how many minutes Kevin spends searching for worms every day.",
    "Kevin spends 6 hours per day finding worms, and there are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "6 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour equals 360 minutes.",
    "Therefore, Kevin spends 360 minutes finding worms every day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many worms Kevin finds in 360 minutes.",
    "Since it takes Kevin 15 minutes to find one worm, I divide 360 minutes by 15 minutes per worm.",
    "360 divided by 15 equals 24 worms.",
    "Kevin finds 24 worms each day.",
    "Each toad requires 3 worms daily.",
    "To find out how many toads are present, I divide the total number of worms by the number of worms each toad requires.",
    "24 worms divided by 3 worms per toad equals 8 toads.",
    "Therefore, Kevin has 8 toads in the shoebox."
