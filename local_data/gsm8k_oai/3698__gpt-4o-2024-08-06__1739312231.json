  "query": "Kenia has three times as many rats as Hunter and Elodie has together. If Elodie has 30 rats, 10 rats more than Hunter, calculate the total number of pets the three have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many rats Hunter has.",
    "I know that Elodie has 10 more rats than Hunter.",
    "Since Elodie has 30 rats, I can calculate Hunter's number of rats by subtracting 10 from 30.",
    "Hunter has 30 - 10 = 20 rats.",
    "Now, I can find out how many rats Kenia has.",
    "Kenia has three times as many rats as Hunter and Elodie together.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of rats Hunter and Elodie have together.",
    "Hunter has 20 rats and Elodie has 30 rats.",
    "Hunter and Elodie together have 20 + 30 = 50 rats.",
    "Kenia has three times 50 rats.",
    "Kenia has 3 * 50 = 150 rats.",
    "Now, I'll add the number of rats Kenia, Hunter, and Elodie have together.",
    "Kenia has 150 rats, Hunter has 20 rats, and Elodie has 30 rats.",
    "The total number of pets is 150 + 20 + 30 = 200."

  "solution": "200"
