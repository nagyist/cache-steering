  "query": "During a day at the farm, Annie picked eight pints of blueberries. Kathryn picked two pints more than Annie, and Ben picked three pints fewer than Kathryn. How many pints, in total, did the three pick together?",
  "steps": [
    "Annie picked eight pints of blueberries.",
    "Kathryn picked two pints more than Annie. So, Kathryn picked 8 + 2 = 10 pints.",
    "Ben picked three pints fewer than Kathryn. So, Ben picked 10 - 3 = 7 pints.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pints picked by all three: Annie, Kathryn, and Ben.",
    "Add the pints picked by Annie, Kathryn, and Ben: 8 (Annie) + 10 (Kathryn) + 7 (Ben).",
    "The total number of pints picked is 8 + 10 + 7 = 25."
