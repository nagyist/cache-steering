  "query": "John plants a plot of 3 trees by 4 trees.  Each tree gives 5 apples.  He sells each apple for $.5.  How much money does he make, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of trees. The plot is arranged in 3 rows by 4 trees, so I need to multiply 3 by 4.",
    "3 multiplied by 4 is 12. So, there are 12 trees in total.",
    "Next, I know that each tree gives 5 apples. To find the total number of apples, I need to multiply the number of trees by the number of apples per tree.",
    "12 trees multiplied by 5 apples per tree equals 60 apples in total.",
    "Now, John sells each apple for $0.5. To find the total amount of money he makes, I need to multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.",
    "60 apples multiplied by $0.5 per apple equals $30."
  ],
  "solution": "30"
