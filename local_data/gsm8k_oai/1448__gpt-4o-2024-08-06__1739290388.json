  "query": "There are 28 students in a classroom. Half of them have 5 notebooks each and the other half have 3 notebooks each. How many notebooks in total are in the classroom?",
  "steps": [
    "There are 28 students in the classroom.",
    "Half of the students have 5 notebooks each.",
    "28 divided by 2 equals 14. Therefore, 14 students have 5 notebooks each.",
    "The other half of the students have 3 notebooks each.",
    "28 divided by 2 equals 14. Therefore, 14 students have 3 notebooks each.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of notebooks for the students with 5 notebooks each.",
    "14 students with 5 notebooks each result in 14 times 5.",
    "14 times 5 equals 70.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of notebooks for the students with 3 notebooks each.",
    "14 students with 3 notebooks each result in 14 times 3.",
    "14 times 3 equals 42.",
    "Now, I need to add the total number of notebooks from both groups.",
    "70 notebooks from the first group plus 42 notebooks from the second group.",
    "70 plus 42 equals 112."
