  "query": "On the first day of school, Mrs. McGillicuddy had 25 students registered for the morning session of kindergarten, but 3 students were absent; and she had 24 students registered for the afternoon session, but 4 students were absent. How many students did Mrs. McGillicuddy have over the two kindergarten sessions?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I start by considering the number of students who were present in the morning session.",
    "Mrs. McGillicuddy had 25 students registered for the morning session.",
    "3 students were absent in the morning session.",
    "To find the number of students present in the morning, I subtract the number of absent students from the registered students: 25 - 3.",
    "25 - 3 equals 22, so there were 22 students present in the morning session.",
    "Next, I consider the number of students who were present in the afternoon session.",
    "Mrs. McGillicuddy had 24 students registered for the afternoon session.",
    "4 students were absent in the afternoon session.",
    "To find the number of students present in the afternoon, I subtract the number of absent students from the registered students: 24 - 4.",
    "24 - 4 equals 20, so there were 20 students present in the afternoon session.",
    "Now, I add the number of students present in the morning and afternoon sessions to find the total number of students present over the two sessions.",
    "22 students (morning session) + 20 students (afternoon session).",
    "22 + 20 equals 42."

  "solution": "42"
