If the tank can hold up to 12 gallons of gas, how many gallons of gas will Winston need to refill the entire tank?",
  "steps": [
    "Winston starts with 10 gallons of gas in his tank.",
    "He drives to the store and uses 6 gallons of gas.",
    "After driving to the store, he has 10 - 6 = 4 gallons of gas left.",
    "He then drives to the doctor\u2019s office and uses 2 more gallons of gas.",
    "After driving to the doctor's office, he has 4 - 2 = 2 gallons of gas left.",
    "The gas tank can hold up to 12 gallons.",
    "To fill the tank to its full capacity, he needs 12 - 2 = 10 gallons of gas."
