  "query": "Carly is trying to get in shape to try out for the soccer team. She starts by running 2 miles a week. The second week, she runs twice as long plus 3 extra miles per week. The third week she runs 9/7 as much as she ran the second week. The week after that, she sprains her ankle and has to reduce her running time by 5 miles per week. How many miles did she run the week she was injured?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many miles Carly ran in the second week. She runs twice as long as the first week plus 3 extra miles.",
    "In the first week, Carly ran 2 miles. So in the second week, she runs 2 times 2 miles plus 3 more miles.",
    "2 times 2 equals 4.",
    "Adding 3 more miles gives us 4 + 3 = 7 miles for the second week.",
    "Now, let's calculate how many miles she ran in the third week.",
    "The third week, she runs 9/7 as much as she ran the second week, which was 7 miles.",
    "To find out how many miles she ran in the third week, we calculate (9/7) times 7 miles.",
    "(9/7) times 7 simplifies to 9.",
    "Carly ran 9 miles in the third week.",
    "Now, let's calculate how many miles she ran the week she was injured. She reduces her running time by 5 miles from the third week.",
    "She ran 9 miles in the third week, so the week she was injured she ran 9 minus 5 miles.",
    "9 minus 5 equals 4."

  "solution": "4"
