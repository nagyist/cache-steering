  "query": "A mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood every time it feeds on someone. If there are 5000 drops per liter and you have to lose 3 liters of blood to die, how many mosquitoes would have to feed on you to kill you?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many drops of blood are in 3 liters.",
    "There are 5000 drops in one liter.",
    "Therefore, in 3 liters, there will be \\(3 \\times 5000 = 15000\\) drops.",
    "Now, I know that a mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood per feeding.",
    "To find out how many mosquitoes it takes to suck 15000 drops, I will divide the total drops by the number of drops a mosquito takes.",
    "\\[ \\frac{15000 \\text{ drops}}{20 \\text{ drops/mosquito}} = 750 \\text{ mosquitoes} \\]",
    "Therefore, it would take 750 mosquitoes feeding at once to cause someone to lose 3 liters of blood."
  ],
  "solution": "750"
