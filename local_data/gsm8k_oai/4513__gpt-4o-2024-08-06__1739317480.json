  "query": "Bronson is an apple dealer.  He buys apples from farmers and then transports them to the grocery stores and sells them for profit.  He buys individual apples from farmers at a cost of $12 per bushel, and sells them to the stores at a price of $0.40 per apple.  If each bushel contains 48 apples, then how much profit, in dollars, does he make after selling 100 apples?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much Bronson pays for each apple.",
    "Bronson buys apples at $12 per bushel, and each bushel contains 48 apples.",
    "To find the cost per apple, I divide $12 by 48 apples.",
    "$12 \u00f7 48 = $0.25 per apple.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Bronson sells each apple for.",
    "Bronson sells each apple for $0.40.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the profit he makes per apple.",
    "The profit per apple is the selling price minus the cost price.",
    "Profit per apple = $0.40 - $0.25",
    "Profit per apple = $0.15",
    "Now, I need to find out the total profit Bronson makes after selling 100 apples.",
    "To do that, I multiply the profit per apple by the number of apples sold.",
    "Total profit = $0.15 \u00d7 100",
    "Total profit = $15.00"
  ],
  "solution": "15"
