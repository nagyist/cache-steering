  "query": "Simon is picking blueberries to make blueberry pies. He picks 100 blueberries from his own bushes and another 200 blueberries from blueberry bushes growing nearby. If each pie needs 100 blueberries, how many blueberry pies can Simon make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total blueberries Simon has.",
    "Simon picks 100 blueberries from his own bushes.",
    "He also picks 200 blueberries from nearby bushes.",
    "To find the total number of blueberries, I add 100 and 200.",
    "So, 100 + 200 = 300 blueberries in total.",
    "Next, I need to know how many blueberries are required for each pie.",
    "According to the problem, each pie requires 100 blueberries.",
    "To find out how many pies Simon can make, I divide the total number of blueberries by the number of blueberries needed per pie.",
    "Therefore, I calculate 300 divided by 100.",
    "300 \u00f7 100 = 3",
    "Simon can make 3 blueberry pies with the blueberries he has."
