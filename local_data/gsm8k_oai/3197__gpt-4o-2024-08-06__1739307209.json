  "query": "Anthony has 16 pets. This morning he forgot to lock the door and he lost 6 pets. After that 1/5 of his pets died from old age. How many pets does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Anthony initially has 16 pets.",
    "He loses 6 pets when he forgets to lock the door.",
    "16 - 6 equals 10.",
    "Now, Anthony has 10 pets left after losing 6.",
    "Next, 1/5 of these remaining 10 pets die from old age.",
    "To find 1/5 of 10, I calculate 10 divided by 5.",
    "10 divided by 5 equals 2.",
    "So, 2 pets die from old age.",
    "Anthony had 10 pets, and with 2 pets dying, we calculate 10 - 2.",
    "10 - 2 equals 8.",
    "Therefore, Anthony has 8 pets left."
