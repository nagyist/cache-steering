  "query": "There are two ponds side by side in a park. Pond A has twice as many frogs as Pond B. If there are 32 frogs in Pond A, how many frogs are there in both ponds combined?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Pond A has twice as many frogs as Pond B.",
    "Pond A has 32 frogs.",
    "Since Pond A has twice as many frogs as Pond B, I can find the number of frogs in Pond B by dividing the number of frogs in Pond A by 2.",
    "32 divided by 2 equals 16.",
    "So, there are 16 frogs in Pond B.",
    "To find the total number of frogs in both ponds, I need to add the number of frogs in Pond A and Pond B together.",
    "Pond A has 32 frogs, and Pond B has 16 frogs.",
    "32 plus 16 equals 48."
