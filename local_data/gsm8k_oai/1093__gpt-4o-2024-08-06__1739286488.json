  "query": "Lorenzo put three full cans of thumbtacks into his pocket and went off to work at the corkboard factory. It was Lorenzo's job, as head of quality control, to test every cork board for its ability to hold thumbtacks.  He placed one thumbtack from each of the three cans of thumbtacks into every board tested.  At the end of the day, he had tested 120 boards and had 30 tacks remaining in each of the three cans.  What was the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans?",
  "steps": [
    "Lorenzo started with three full cans of thumbtacks.",
    "He placed one thumbtack from each can into every board tested.",
    "He tested 120 boards in total.",
    "For each board, 3 thumbtacks were used (one from each can).",
    "Therefore, the total number of thumbtacks used is 120 boards * 3 thumbtacks per board = 360 thumbtacks.",
    "At the end of the day, he had 30 thumbtacks remaining in each can.",
    "The total remaining thumbtacks are 3 cans * 30 thumbtacks per can = 90 thumbtacks.",
    "The initial total number of thumbtacks in the cans would be the thumbtacks used plus the thumbtacks remaining.",
    "Thus, the original total number of thumbtacks is 360 thumbtacks used + 90 thumbtacks remaining = 450 thumbtacks."
