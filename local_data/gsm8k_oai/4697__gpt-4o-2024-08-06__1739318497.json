  "query": "Bobby has an aquarium with twice as many fish as Sarah's has.  Sarah has 5 more fish in her aquarium than Tony does.  Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does.  Billy has 10 fish.  How many fish do all 4 people have put together?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Billy has 10 fish.",
    "Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so I multiply 10 by 3 to find out how many fish Tony has.",
    "10 times 3 is 30, so Tony has 30 fish.",
    "Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so I add 5 to the number of fish Tony has.",
    "30 plus 5 is 35, so Sarah has 35 fish.",
    "Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah, so I multiply 35 by 2 to find out how many fish Bobby has.",
    "35 times 2 is 70, so Bobby has 70 fish.",
    "Finally, I add the number of fish Billy, Tony, Sarah, and Bobby each have to determine the total number of fish.",
    "10 (Billy) plus 30 (Tony) plus 35 (Sarah) plus 70 (Bobby) equals 145."

  "solution": "145"
