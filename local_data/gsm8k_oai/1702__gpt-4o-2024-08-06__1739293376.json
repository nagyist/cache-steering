  "query": "Princeton had a gender reveal party and invited all of his fellow employees to celebrate with him. If the total number of guests were 60, and 2/3 were male guests, how many female guests attended the party?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that the total number of guests is 60.",
    "I need to find the number of male guests to determine the number of female guests.",
    "The problem states that 2/3 of the guests were male.",
    "To find the number of male guests, I calculate 2/3 of 60.",
    "2/3 of 60 is calculated by multiplying 60 by 2/3, which is (60 * 2) / 3.",
    "Performing the calculation, I find (60 * 2) = 120.",
    "Now, I divide 120 by 3 to find the number of male guests.",
    "120 divided by 3 is 40.",
    "So, there are 40 male guests.",
    "To find the number of female guests, I subtract the number of male guests from the total number of guests.",
    "60 total guests minus 40 male guests equals 20 female guests."
