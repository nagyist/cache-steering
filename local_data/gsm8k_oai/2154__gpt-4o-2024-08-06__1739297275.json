  "query": "The spacecraft Gibraltar is a mountain-sized intergalactic vehicle for transporting equipment, building materials, and families to establish colonies on far-away planets.  At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family.  The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage.  Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity.  How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the maximum capacity of the spacecraft in terms of people.",
    "The spacecraft can carry 300 family units.",
    "Each family unit has 4 people.",
    "To find the maximum capacity of the spacecraft, I multiply the number of family units by the number of people per unit.",
    "300 family units * 4 people per unit = 1200 people.",
    "Now, I will calculate one-third of the ship's capacity.",
    "One-third of 1200 people is 1200 / 3 = 400 people.",
    "The problem states that the spacecraft, at the start of the journey, will carry 100 people less than one-third of its capacity.",
    "I subtract 100 people from one-third of the capacity.",
    "400 people - 100 people = 300 people."

  "solution": "300"
