  "query": "Carol fills up her gas tank as she is driving home for college, which is 220 miles away. She can get 20 miles to the gallon in her car, which has a 16-gallon gas tank. How many more miles will she be able to drive after she gets home and without filling her tank again?",
  "steps": [
    "Carol's car has a 16-gallon gas tank and can get 20 miles to the gallon.",
    "To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons.",
    "20 miles/gallon * 16 gallons = 320 miles",
    "Carol is driving 220 miles to get home.",
    "We need to calculate how many miles she can drive after reaching home.",
    "To find out how many miles she has left after driving 220 miles, subtract 220 from the total miles she can drive on a full tank.",
    "320 miles (total) - 220 miles (distance to home) = 100 miles"
  ],
  "solution": "100"
