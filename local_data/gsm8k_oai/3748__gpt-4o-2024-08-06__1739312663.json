  "query": "Lucy works in a pet shop. She can clean 2 aquariums in 3 hours. If Lucy is working 24 hours this week, how many aquariums could she clean?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many aquariums Lucy can clean in one hour.",
    "Lucy can clean 2 aquariums in 3 hours.",
    "To find out how many she can clean in one hour, I need to divide the number of aquariums by the number of hours.",
    "2 aquariums divided by 3 hours equals \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) aquariums per hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many aquariums Lucy can clean in 24 hours.",
    "I will multiply the number of aquariums Lucy cleans per hour (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) by the total hours she works (24).",
    "\\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = \\frac{48}{3}\\).",
    "Calculating \\(\\frac{48}{3}\\) gives me 16 aquariums."
