  "query": "Three years from now, Tully will be twice as old as Kate. How old was Tully a year ago if Kate is now 29 years old?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine Kate's age three years from now. Since she is currently 29 years old, in three years she will be 29 + 3 = 32 years old.",
    "According to the problem, three years from now, Tully will be twice as old as Kate. Therefore, Tully's age three years from now will be 2 * 32 = 64 years old.",
    "Now, I need to figure out Tully's current age. Since Tully will be 64 years old three years from now, I subtract 3 from 64 to find his current age: 64 - 3 = 61 years old.",
    "The question asks for Tully's age a year ago. So, I subtract 1 year from Tully's current age to find this: 61 - 1 = 60 years old."

  "solution": "60"
