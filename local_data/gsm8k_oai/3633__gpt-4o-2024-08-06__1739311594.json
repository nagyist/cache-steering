  "query": "Marcy keeps a 2-liter bottle of water by her desk. She takes a sip every five minutes, and each sip is 40 ml. How many minutes does it take her to drink the whole bottle of water?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total volume of the water in milliliters since Marcy drinks in milliliters.",
    "The bottle is 2 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 milliliters.",
    "So, 2 liters is 2 * 1000 milliliters.",
    "This equals 2000 milliliters.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many milliliters Marcy drinks every time she takes a sip.",
    "Each sip is 40 milliliters.",
    "To find out how many sips it takes to drink 2000 milliliters, I need to divide the total volume by the amount per sip.",
    "I divide 2000 by 40.",
    "2000 divided by 40 equals 50.",
    "This means Marcy takes 50 sips to drink the whole bottle.",
    "Next, I need to know how much time it takes per sip in order to find out the total time.",
    "Marcy takes a sip every 5 minutes.",
    "To find the total time, I multiply the number of sips by the time per sip.",
    "That means multiplying 50 by 5.",
    "50 times 5 equals 250.",
    "Therefore, it takes her 250 minutes to drink the entire bottle of water."

  "solution": "250"
