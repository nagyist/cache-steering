    "Perry made a recipe that serves four people.",
    "He added a half cup of cream at the end.",
    "Cream has 88 grams of fat per cup.",
    "Since he used half a cup of cream, we need to calculate the grams of fat in that amount.",
    "Half a cup of cream contains half of 88 grams of fat.",
    "Calculate half of 88 grams: 88 / 2 = 44 grams of fat.",
    "The total amount of fat in the half cup of cream is 44 grams.",
    "This amount of fat is distributed evenly among four servings.",
    "To find the fat per serving, divide the total fat by the number of servings: 44 grams / 4 servings.",
    "Calculate 44 grams divided by 4: 44 / 4 = 11 grams of fat per serving."
