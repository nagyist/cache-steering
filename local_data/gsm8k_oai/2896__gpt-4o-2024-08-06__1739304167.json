  "query": "John takes a 20-foot log and cuts it in half.  If each linear foot of the log weighs 150 pounds how much does each cut piece weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "John has a 20-foot log.",
    "He cuts the log in half.",
    "Dividing 20 by 2 gives 10.",
    "Each piece of the log is 10 feet long.",
    "Each linear foot of the log weighs 150 pounds.",
    "The length of each piece is 10 feet.",
    "Therefore, each 10-foot piece weighs 10 feet multiplied by 150 pounds per foot.",
    "Calculating 10 times 150 gives 1500."

  "solution": "1500"
