  "query": "James decides to start making his own coffee.  He buys a coffee machine for $200 and gets a $20 discount.  He figures it will cost him $3 a day to make his coffee.  He previously bought 2 coffees a day for $4 each.   How long until the machine pays for itself?",
  "steps": [
    "James buys a coffee machine for $200 and gets a $20 discount.",
    "The actual cost he pays for the coffee machine is $200 - $20 = $180.",
    "James previously spent $4 on each coffee, buying 2 coffees a day.",
    "So, James's daily cost on coffee before was 2 x $4 = $8 per day.",
    "Now, with the new coffee machine, it costs him $3 per day to make his own coffee.",
    "The savings per day is the difference between what he used to spend and what he now spends: $8 - $3 = $5 per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many days it takes for the savings to cover the cost of the coffee machine.",
    "We'll divide the cost of the coffee machine by the daily savings: $180 / $5 = 36 days."
