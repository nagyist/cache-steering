  "query": "Victoria was given a $50 bill by her mother to buy her friends snacks for their group meeting. She bought 2 boxes of pizza that costs $12 each and 2 packs of juice drinks that cost $2 each. How much money should Victoria return to her mother?",
  "steps": [
    "Victoria starts with a $50 bill.",
    "She buys 2 boxes of pizza, each costing $12.",
    "To find the total cost of the pizzas, multiply the cost per pizza by the number of pizzas: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).",
    "She also buys 2 packs of juice drinks, each costing $2.",
    "To find the total cost of the juice drinks, multiply the cost per juice drink by the number of drinks: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).",
    "Add the cost of the pizzas and the juice drinks to find the total spending: \\(24 + 4 = 28\\).",
    "To find out how much money Victoria should return, subtract the total spending from the original amount: \\(50 - 28 = 22\\)."
