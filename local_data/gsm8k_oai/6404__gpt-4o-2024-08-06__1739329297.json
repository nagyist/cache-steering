  "query": "Jimmy is at the candy store and buys 2 candy bars for $.75 each. He then buys 4 lollipops that cost $.25 each. He spent 1/6 of the money he earned from shoveling snow. If he charges $1.5 per driveway, how many driveways did he shovel?",
  "steps": [
    "Jimmy buys 2 candy bars for $0.75 each.",
    "The cost of the candy bars is 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.",
    "Jimmy also buys 4 lollipops at $0.25 each.",
    "The cost of the lollipops is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.",
    "The total amount Jimmy spent on candy bars and lollipops is $1.50 + $1.00.",
    "The total spent is $2.50.",
    "Jimmy spent 1/6 of the money he earned shoveling snow.",
    "Let the total amount he earned be x.",
    "Therefore, 1/6 of x equals $2.50.",
    "This means x / 6 = $2.50.",
    "To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6.",
    "x = $2.50 * 6",
    "x = $15.00",
    "Jimmy earns $1.50 per driveway shoveled.",
    "To find the number of driveways he shoveled, divide the total amount earned by the amount earned per driveway.",
    "Number of driveways = $15.00 / $1.50",
    "Number of driveways = 10"

  "solution": "10"
