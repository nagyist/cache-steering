  "query": "There are 28 students in a class. Two-sevenths of them were absent last Monday. How many students were present last Monday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students were absent.",
    "The total number of students in the class is 28.",
    "According to the problem, two-sevenths of the students were absent.",
    "To find two-sevenths of 28, I need to multiply 28 by the fraction 2/7.",
    "Calculate the multiplication: (2/7) * 28.",
    "Divide 28 by 7 to see how many groups of 7 are in 28. \n28 divided by 7 is 4.",
    "Now multiply the result by 2: 4 * 2 = 8.",
    "So, 8 students were absent last Monday.",
    "To find out how many students were present, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.",
    "28 total students minus 8 absent students equals 20 students."
