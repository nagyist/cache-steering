  "query": "Tom fills a 250 pound sandbag 80% full.  But the filling material he is using is 40% heavier than sand.  How much does the bag weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "The sandbag has a maximum capacity of 250 pounds when fully filled with sand.",
    "Tom fills the sandbag to 80% of its full capacity.",
    "To find out how much of the sandbag's capacity is used, I calculate 80% of 250 pounds.",
    "80% of 250 pounds is calculated as 0.80 * 250.",
    "0.80 * 250 = 200 pounds.",
    "Therefore, the volume of filling material used is equivalent to 200 pounds of sand.",
    "The fill material is 40% heavier than sand.",
    "If the fill material is 40% heavier, this means it is 140% the weight of the equivalent volume of sand.",
    "140% as a decimal is 1.40.",
    "To find the actual weight of the fill material, I multiply its weight as sand (200 pounds) by 1.40.",
    "1.40 * 200 = 280 pounds.",
    "Therefore, the weight of the filled sandbag is 280 pounds."
