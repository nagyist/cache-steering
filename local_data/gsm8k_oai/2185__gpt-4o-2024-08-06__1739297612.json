  "query": "At the Greene Nursery, there are 1491 red roses, 3025 yellow carnations, and 1768 white roses. How many flowers are at the Greene Nursery in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I notice that the problem asks for the total number of flowers at the Greene Nursery.",
    "I can see there are three types of flowers: red roses, yellow carnations, and white roses.",
    "The numbers given are 1491 red roses, 3025 yellow carnations, and 1768 white roses.",
    "To find the total number of flowers, I need to add these quantities together.",
    "First, I add the number of red roses and yellow carnations: 1491 + 3025 = 4516.",
    "Next, I add the number of white roses to this result: 4516 + 1768 = 6284.",
    "I should verify this addition to ensure accuracy.",
    "Rechecking the steps: Adding red roses and yellow carnations gives 1491 + 3025 = 4516, which is correct.",
    "Adding the result to white roses gives: 4516 + 1768 = 6284, which is also correct.",
    "The computation checks out."
