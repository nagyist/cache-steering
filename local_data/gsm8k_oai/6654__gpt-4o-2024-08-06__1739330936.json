  "query": "John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of students John has.",
    "He has 6 classes with 30 students in each class.",
    "To find the total number of students, I multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class: 6 classes * 30 students/class = 180 students.",
    "John buys 2 packs of index cards for each student.",
    "To find out how many packs John needs, I multiply the total number of students by the number of packs per student: 180 students * 2 packs/student.",
    "180 * 2 = 360"
