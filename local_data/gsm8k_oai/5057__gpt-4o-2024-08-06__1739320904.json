  "query": "There are 21 cherry tomatoes on the tomato plant.  2 birds eat one-third of the tomatoes.  How many are still left on the tomato plant?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many tomatoes are eaten by the birds. There are 21 cherry tomatoes originally on the plant.",
    "The problem states that 2 birds eat one-third of the tomatoes. So, I need to calculate one-third of 21.",
    "One-third of 21 is calculated by dividing 21 by 3.",
    "21 divided by 3 equals 7.",
    "So, the birds eat 7 tomatoes in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many tomatoes are left on the plant.",
    "I subtract the 7 eaten tomatoes from the original 21 tomatoes.",
    "21 minus 7 equals 14."
