  "steps": [
    "Ali starts with $480.",
    "He spends half of $480 on food.",
    "Half of 480 is calculated as 480 \u00f7 2.",
    "480 \u00f7 2 equals 240.",
    "So, Ali spent $240 on food.",
    "Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying food.",
    "He originally had $480, and he spent $240.",
    "Subtract 240 from 480 to find out how much is left: 480 - 240.",
    "480 - 240 equals 240.",
    "Ali has $240 left after buying food.",
    "Next, Ali spends a third of the remaining $240 on a pair of glasses.",
    "A third of 240 is calculated as 240 \u00f7 3.",
    "240 \u00f7 3 equals 80.",
    "Ali spent $80 on glasses.",
    "Finally, to find out how much money Ali has left, subtract the $80 spent on glasses from the remaining $240.",
    "240 - 80 equals 160."
