  "query": "Luke takes fifty more than five times as many grape jelly beans as vanilla jelly beans. If there are 120 vanilla jelly beans, how many jelly beans are there in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the number of vanilla jelly beans. The problem states there are 120 vanilla jelly beans.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of grape jelly beans. According to the problem, Luke takes fifty more than five times as many grape jelly beans as vanilla jelly beans.",
    "First, I find five times as many vanilla jelly beans: 5 times 120 is 600.",
    "Now, I add fifty more to this amount: 600 + 50 equals 650.",
    "Therefore, there are 650 grape jelly beans.",
    "To find the total number of jelly beans, I need to add the number of vanilla jelly beans and the number of grape jelly beans together.",
    "Adding 120 (vanilla) + 650 (grape) gives me a total of 770 jelly beans."
