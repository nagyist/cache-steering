  "query": "Donna made a cake to take to a party where the guests ate half the cake. The day after the party, she shared half the leftovers with her brothers. The following day, she ate one piece as a midnight snack. Twice as many pieces as her snack were left. How many pieces was the cake to begin with?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by identifying the sequence of events and how they impact the number of cake pieces. Donna makes a cake of unknown initial size.",
    "At the party, guests eat half the cake. Thus, half of the cake remains.",
    "The next day, Donna shares half of the remaining leftovers with her brothers. Now, only a quarter of the original cake is left.",
    "The final day, Donna eats one piece of the cake as a midnight snack. After eating, twice as many pieces as her snack were left. So, there were 2 pieces left after she ate 1 piece.",
    "If there were 2 pieces left after she ate 1 piece, that means there were originally 3 pieces just before she ate her midnight snack.",
    "These 3 pieces represent the quarter of the original cake that was left after sharing with her brothers.",
    "To find the total number of pieces initially, we multiply this quarter by 4, because the original whole cake is 4 times what was left after sharing with her brothers.",
    "3 pieces (a quarter of the cake) multiplied by 4 equals 12 pieces in the original cake."
