  "query": "It takes Nissa 10 seconds to clip each of her cats' nails. 90 seconds to clean each of her ears, and 5 minutes to shampoo her. If the cat has four claws on each foot, how many seconds does grooming her cat take total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to find out how much time it takes Nissa to clip the cat's nails.",
    "The cat has four claws on each foot.",
    "A cat typically has four feet.",
    "This means the cat has 4 claws per foot * 4 feet = 16 claws in total.",
    "It takes 10 seconds to clip each claw.",
    "So, for 16 claws, it takes 16 claws * 10 seconds per claw = 160 seconds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time it takes to clean each ear.",
    "The cat has two ears.",
    "It takes 90 seconds to clean each ear.",
    "So, for 2 ears, it takes 2 ears * 90 seconds per ear = 180 seconds.",
    "Next, I calculate the time needed for shampooing.",
    "It takes 5 minutes to shampoo the cat.",
    "1 minute = 60 seconds.",
    "So, 5 minutes = 5 * 60 seconds = 300 seconds.",
    "Now, I add the time for nails, ears, and shampoo together.",
    "160 seconds (for nails) + 180 seconds (for ears) + 300 seconds (for shampooing) = 640 seconds.",
    "I have calculated all components of the grooming time."

  "solution": "640"
