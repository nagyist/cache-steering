  "query": "Hana sold 4/7 of her stamp collection for $28. How much would she have earned from selling the entire collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Hana sold 4/7 of her stamp collection for $28.",
    "This means that the fraction of her collection she sold, which is 4/7, is worth $28.",
    "To find the value of the entire collection, I need to find the value of 1/7 of the collection first.",
    "If 4/7 of the collection is $28, then 1/7 would be $28 divided by 4.",
    "Divide $28 by 4 to find the value of 1/7 of the collection.",
    "28 divided by 4 equals 7.",
    "So, 1/7 of the collection is worth $7.",
    "To find the value of the whole collection, I multiply 1/7 of the collection by 7 because there are 7 equal parts that make up the whole.",
    "Multiply $7 by 7 to determine the total value of the collection.",
    "7 times 7 equals 49."

  "solution": "49"
