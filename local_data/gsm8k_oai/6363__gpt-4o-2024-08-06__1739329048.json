  "query": "The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?",
  "steps": [
    "The rim is 10 feet above the ground. I need to find how high the player needs to reach to dunk by reaching 6 inches above the rim.",
    "First, convert the rim height to inches because all other measurements are in inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the rim is 10 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 120 inches above the ground.",
    "A player needs to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk, so they need to reach 120 inches + 6 inches = 126 inches from the ground.",
    "Now calculate how high the player's standing reach is. The player is 6 feet tall, which is 6 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.",
    "The player can reach 22 inches above their head. So their standing reach is 72 inches + 22 inches = 94 inches.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how high the player should jump to reach a total of 126 inches from the ground.",
    "The difference between the required dunk reach (126 inches) and the player's standing reach (94 inches) will give the jump height required.",
    "126 inches - 94 inches = 32 inches."

  "solution": "32"
