  "query": "Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of sentences Janice typed today.",
    "Janice typed for 20 minutes initially, and she types at a rate of 6 sentences per minute.",
    "In 20 minutes, she typed 20 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 120 sentences.",
    "Then Janice typed for 15 minutes after her break.",
    "In those 15 minutes, she typed 15 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 90 sentences.",
    "Next, she had to erase 40 sentences due to errors.",
    "So far, she has typed a total of 120 + 90 = 210 sentences.",
    "After erasing, her net sentence count would be 210 - 40 = 170 sentences.",
    "She then attended a meeting and typed for an additional 18 minutes afterward.",
    "In 18 minutes, she typed 18 minutes * 6 sentences/minute = 108 sentences.",
    "Now, let\u2019s find the total sentences typed today after all sessions: 170 + 108 = 278 sentences.",
    "The final count of the paper is 536 sentences.",
    "To find how many sentences she started with today, subtract the sentences typed today from the final total.",
    "536 sentences - 278 sentences = 258 sentences."

  "solution": "258"
