  "query": "A fruit and vegetable merchant installed 15 kg of carrots, 13 kg of zucchini and 8 kg of broccoli. He sold only half of them. What mass of vegetables did he sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much of each type of vegetable was sold.",
    "The merchant installed 15 kg of carrots.",
    "He sold half of them, so he sold 15 kg / 2 = 7.5 kg of carrots.",
    "Next, the merchant installed 13 kg of zucchini.",
    "He sold half of them, so he sold 13 kg / 2 = 6.5 kg of zucchini.",
    "Then, the merchant installed 8 kg of broccoli.",
    "He sold half of them, so he sold 8 kg / 2 = 4 kg of broccoli.",
    "Now, I need to find the total mass of vegetables sold by adding each type sold.",
    "The mass of carrots sold is 7.5 kg, zucchini sold is 6.5 kg, and broccoli sold is 4 kg.",
    "Add these quantities: 7.5 kg + 6.5 kg + 4 kg = 18 kg."
