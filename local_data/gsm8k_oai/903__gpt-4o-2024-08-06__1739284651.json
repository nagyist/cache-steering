  "query": "Margaux owns a money lending company. Her friend pays her $5 per day, her brother $8 per day, and her cousin $4 per day. How much money will she collect after 7 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Margaux's friend pays her in total after 7 days.",
    "Her friend pays her $5 per day.",
    "For 7 days, the amount from her friend would be 5 * 7.",
    "5 * 7 equals 35.",
    "Next, I calculate how much her brother pays her in total after 7 days.",
    "Her brother pays her $8 per day.",
    "For 7 days, the amount from her brother would be 8 * 7.",
    "8 * 7 equals 56.",
    "Now, I calculate how much her cousin pays her in total after 7 days.",
    "Her cousin pays her $4 per day.",
    "For 7 days, the amount from her cousin would be 4 * 7.",
    "4 * 7 equals 28.",
    "Now I add up all the amounts: 35 from her friend, 56 from her brother, and 28 from her cousin.",
    "35 + 56 + 28 equals 119."
