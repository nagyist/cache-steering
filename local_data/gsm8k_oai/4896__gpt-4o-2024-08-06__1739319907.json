  "query": "Grover bought 3 boxes of face masks. He plans to sell them for $0.50 each. If each box has 20 face masks, and he bought the 3 boxes for $15, how much will be his total profit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of face masks Grover has.",
    "Each box contains 20 face masks. Grover bought 3 boxes.",
    "Therefore, Grover has 3 boxes * 20 face masks per box = 60 face masks.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total revenue if Grover sells each face mask for $0.50.",
    "If he sells each face mask for $0.50, the total revenue will be 60 face masks * $0.50 per face mask.",
    "So, the total revenue is $30.",
    "Grover bought the 3 boxes for $15.",
    "The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the revenue: Profit = Revenue - Cost.",
    "Substituting the values, Profit = $30 - $15 = $15."
