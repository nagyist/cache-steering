  "query": "A train travels 360 miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 240 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the speed of the train first.",
    "The train travels 360 miles in 3 hours.",
    "The speed of the train is distance divided by time.",
    "Speed = 360 miles / 3 hours = 120 miles per hour.",
    "Now I need to determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 240 miles at the same speed.",
    "At 120 miles per hour, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 240 miles.",
    "Time = Distance / Speed",
    "Time = 240 miles / 120 miles per hour",
    "Time = 2 hours"
  ],
  "solution": "2"
