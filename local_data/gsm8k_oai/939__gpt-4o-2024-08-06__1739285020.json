  "query": "There are 20 students in the class. Half of them play basketball. Two-fifths play volleyball and one-tenth play both basketball and volleyball.  How many students in this class do not play either game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will find out how many students play basketball.",
    "There are 20 students, and half of them play basketball.",
    "Half of 20 is 20/2 = 10.",
    "So, 10 students play basketball.",
    "Next, I will find out how many students play volleyball.",
    "Two-fifths of the students play volleyball.",
    "Two-fifths of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8.",
    "So, 8 students play volleyball.",
    "Now I will determine how many students play both basketball and volleyball.",
    "One-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball.",
    "One-tenth of 20 is 20/10 = 2.",
    "So, 2 students play both basketball and volleyball.",
    "I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find how many students play either basketball or volleyball, or both.",
    "Number of students playing either sport = (students who play basketball) + (students who play volleyball) - (students who play both).",
    "This can be calculated as 10 + 8 - 2 = 16.",
    "Now, I will find how many students do not play either basketball or volleyball.",
    "Total number of students in the class is 20.",
    "Number of students who play either sport is 16.",
    "Students who do not play either sport = Total students - Students who play either sport.",
    "So, the number of students who do not play either game = 20 - 16 = 4."
