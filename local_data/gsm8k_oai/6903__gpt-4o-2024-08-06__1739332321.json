  "query": "Hearty bought 3 packages of blue and 5 packages of red. If there are 40 beads in each package, how many beads does Hearty have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many packages were bought in total.",
    "Hearty bought 3 packages of blue and 5 packages of red.",
    "Adding these amounts gives \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) packages in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many beads are in all the packages.",
    "Each package contains 40 beads.",
    "So I need to multiply the total number of packages by the number of beads per package.",
    "This means calculating \\(8 \\times 40\\).",
    "Multiplying gives \\(8 \\times 40 = 320\\) beads in total."

  "solution": "320"
