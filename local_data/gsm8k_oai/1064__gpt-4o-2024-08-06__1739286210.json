  "query": "Harry owns 3 geckos, 2 iguanas, and 4 snakes. If he spends $10 to feed each snake, $5 to feed each iguana, and $15 to feed each gecko every month, how much does he spend every year to feed all his pets?",
  "steps": [
    "Harry owns 3 geckos, 2 iguanas, and 4 snakes.",
    "The monthly feeding cost for each pet is $15 for a gecko, $5 for an iguana, and $10 for a snake.",
    "First, I will calculate the monthly cost to feed the geckos: 3 geckos * $15 per gecko = $45.",
    "Next, I will calculate the monthly cost to feed the iguanas: 2 iguanas * $5 per iguana = $10.",
    "Then, I will calculate the monthly cost to feed the snakes: 4 snakes * $10 per snake = $40.",
    "Now, I will add the monthly costs to find the total monthly cost: $45 (geckos) + $10 (iguanas) + $40 (snakes) = $95.",
    "Since the question asks for the yearly cost, I will multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (months in a year): $95 * 12 = $1140."

  "solution": "1140"
