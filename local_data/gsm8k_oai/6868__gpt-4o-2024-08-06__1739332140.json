    "Tim spends 1 hour a day meditating.",
    "He spends twice as much time reading than he does meditating.",
    "Since he meditates for 1 hour a day, he reads for 2 x 1 = 2 hours a day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "To find how much time he spends reading in a week, multiply the daily reading time by the number of days in a week: 2 hours/day x 7 days/week.",
    "2 x 7 equals 14."
