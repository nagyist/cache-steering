  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the profit made per bag of popcorn.",
    "The cost price of each bag is $4, and the selling price is $8.",
    "To find the profit per bag, subtract the cost price from the selling price: $8 - $4 = $4.",
    "John makes a profit of $4 per bag.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total profit from selling 30 bags.",
    "Multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold: $4 * 30.",
    "Calculating that gives $4 * 30 = $120."
