  "query": "Mary is chopping up some old furniture to make firewood. Chairs make 6 sticks of wood, tables make 9 sticks of wood, and stools make 2 sticks of wood. Mary needs to burn 5 sticks of wood per hour to stay warm. If Mary chops up 18 chairs, 6 tables and 4 stools, how many hours can she keep warm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of sticks of wood Mary can make from the chairs.",
    "Each chair gives 6 sticks of wood. Mary has 18 chairs.",
    "So, I calculate: 18 chairs * 6 sticks/chair = 108 sticks of wood from chairs.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of sticks of wood from the tables.",
    "Each table gives 9 sticks of wood. Mary has 6 tables.",
    "So, I calculate: 6 tables * 9 sticks/table = 54 sticks of wood from tables.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of sticks of wood from the stools.",
    "Each stool gives 2 sticks of wood. Mary has 4 stools.",
    "So, I calculate: 4 stools * 2 sticks/stool = 8 sticks of wood from stools.",
    "I now add up the total number of sticks from all the furniture.",
    "Total sticks = 108 sticks (from chairs) + 54 sticks (from tables) + 8 sticks (from stools) = 170 sticks of wood.",
    "Mary needs 5 sticks of wood per hour to stay warm.",
    "I need to calculate how many hours she can stay warm with 170 sticks of wood.",
    "I calculate: 170 sticks / 5 sticks/hour = 34 hours."
