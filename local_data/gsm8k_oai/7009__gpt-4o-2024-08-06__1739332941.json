  "query": "Pablo\u2019s mother agrees to pay him one cent for every page he reads. He plans to save the money for some candy. Pablo always checks out books that are exactly 150 pages. After reading his books, he went to the store and bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover. How many books did Pablo read?",
  "steps": [
    "Pablo earns 1 cent for every page he reads.",
    "Each book Pablo checks out has 150 pages.",
    "Therefore, for every book Pablo reads, he earns 150 cents.",
    "150 cents are equivalent to $1.50 because 100 cents make up a dollar.",
    "Pablo spent $15 on candy and had $3 leftover.",
    "To find out how much money Pablo earned in total, we add the amount he spent on candy to the leftover amount: $15 + $3 = $18.",
    "Pablo earned $18 in total from reading books.",
    "Each book he reads gives him $1.50.",
    "To find the number of books, we divide the total amount Pablo earned by the amount he earns per book: $18 / $1.50.",
    "$18 divided by $1.50 equals 12."
