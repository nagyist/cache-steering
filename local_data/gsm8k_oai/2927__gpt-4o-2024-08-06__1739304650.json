  "query": "A shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month. If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much they currently make in a year. They sell $4000 worth of shoes each month.",
    "To find the annual amount, I multiply the monthly sales by the number of months in a year: $4000 \u00d7 12 months.",
    "$4000 \u00d7 12 = $48000. This is how much they make in a year currently.",
    "Their target is $60000 in a year. I need to find the difference between the target and their current annual sales.",
    "$60000 - $48000 = $12000. They need to make an additional $12000 in a year to reach their target.",
    "To find how much more they need to make each month, I divide the additional annual amount by the number of months: $12000 \u00f7 12 months.",
    "$12000 \u00f7 12 = $1000. They need to make an additional $1000 per month."
