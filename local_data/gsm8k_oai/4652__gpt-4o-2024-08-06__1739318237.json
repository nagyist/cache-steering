  "query": "Jamie knows that once she has any more than 32 ounces of liquid she has to use the bathroom, and her teacher said that no one can use the bathroom during the math test. She remembers that she had a cup of milk at lunch and a pint of grape juice at recess. How many ounces can she drink from her water bottle during the test before she'd have to go to the bathroom? (A cup equals 8 ounces and a pint equals 16 ounces.)",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how many ounces of liquid Jamie has already consumed.",
    "She drank a cup of milk, and a cup equals 8 ounces.",
    "She also drank a pint of grape juice, and a pint equals 16 ounces.",
    "I add the ounces: 8 ounces (milk) + 16 ounces (grape juice) = 24 ounces.",
    "Jamie can have up to 32 ounces before needing to use the bathroom.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many more ounces she can drink before reaching 32 ounces.",
    "I subtract the 24 ounces she has already consumed from the 32 ounces threshold: 32 - 24 = 8.",
    "Therefore, Jamie can drink 8 more ounces from her water bottle during the test."

  "solution": "8"
