  "query": "Ahmed and Emily are having a contest to see who can get the best grade in the class. There have been 9 assignments and Ahmed has a 91 in the class. Emily has a 92. The final assignment is worth the same amount as all the other assignments. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment. What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get to beat Emily if all grades are whole numbers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Ahmed's total grade points before the final assignment. Ahmed has a 91 average over 9 assignments.",
    "To find Ahmed's total grade points, I multiply 91 by 9.",
    "91 * 9 = 819. So, Ahmed has 819 grade points so far.",
    "Next, I need to calculate Emily's total grade points for all 10 assignments. She has a 92 average over 9 assignments and scored a 90 on the final assignment.",
    "First, calculate the grade points for the 9 assignments. Multiply 92 by 9.",
    "92 * 9 = 828. So, Emily has 828 grade points before the final.",
    "Add Emily's score for the final assignment to her total grade points: 828 + 90.",
    "828 + 90 = 918. Emily's total points are 918 after 10 assignments.",
    "Now, calculate the score Ahmed needs on the final assignment to finish with more total points than Emily.",
    "Set up the inequality for Ahmed to have more total points than Emily: 819 + final score > 918.",
    "Solve the inequality: 819 + final score > 918. Subtract 819 from both sides.",
    "final score > 918 - 819.",
    "918 - 819 = 99. So, Ahmed needs to score more than 99 to beat Emily.",
    "Since scores are in whole numbers, the minimum score Ahmed needs is 100."

  "solution": "100"
