  "query": "Verna weighs 17 pounds more than Haley, and Verna weighs half as much as Sherry. If Haley weighs 103 pounds, how many pounds do Verna and Sherry weigh together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Haley weighs 103 pounds.",
    "Verna weighs 17 pounds more than Haley.",
    "To find Verna's weight, I add 17 pounds to Haley's weight: \\( 103 + 17 \\).",
    "Calculating this gives me Verna's weight: \\( 120 \\) pounds.",
    "Verna weighs half as much as Sherry.",
    "To find Sherry's weight, I need to double Verna's weight: \\( 120 \\times 2 \\).",
    "Calculating this gives me Sherry's weight: \\( 240 \\) pounds.",
    "Now, I need to add Verna's and Sherry's weights together.",
    "I add \\( 120 \\) pounds (Verna's weight) and \\( 240 \\) pounds (Sherry's weight).",
    "Calculating this gives the total weight of Verna and Sherry: \\( 360 \\) pounds."
