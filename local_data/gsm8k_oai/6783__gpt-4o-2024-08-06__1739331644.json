  "query": "Lyle wants to buy himself and his friends a sandwich and a pack of juice. A sandwich costs $0.30 while a pack of juice costs $0.2. If Lyle has $2.50, how many of his friends can have a sandwich and a pack of juice?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total cost for one person (a sandwich and a pack of juice).",
    "The sandwich costs $0.30 and the pack of juice costs $0.20.",
    "Add these costs together: $0.30 + $0.20 = $0.50.",
    "Determine how many sets of sandwich and juice Lyle can buy with $2.50.",
    "Divide Lyle's total amount of money by the cost of one set: $2.50 \u00f7 $0.50 = 5.",
    "This means Lyle can buy sandwiches and packs of juice for 5 people, including himself.",
    "Since Lyle is included in the 5 people, he can buy for 4 of his friends."
