  "query": "Tony decided to rent a small cottage.  The master bedroom and bath totaled 500 sq ft.  The 2 guest bedrooms were 200 sq ft each.  And the kitchen, guest bath and living area totaled 600 sq ft.  If Tony spends $3,000 a month on rent, how much money is he spending per sq ft of house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total square footage of the cottage.",
    "The master bedroom and bath are 500 sq ft.",
    "The 2 guest bedrooms are 200 sq ft each. Therefore, the total for the guest bedrooms is 2 * 200 = 400 sq ft.",
    "The kitchen, guest bath, and living area total 600 sq ft.",
    "Now, I add these areas together to find the total square footage: 500 + 400 + 600 = 1500 sq ft.",
    "Tony spends $3,000 a month on rent.",
    "To find out how much Tony is spending per square foot, I divide the monthly rent by the total square footage.",
    "3000 / 1500 = 2"

  "solution": "2"
