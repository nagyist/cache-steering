  "query": "Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus. Madeline has 63 colored pencils and only half of what Cheryl has. How many colored pencils do the three of them have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many colored pencils Cheryl has.",
    "I know that Madeline has 63 colored pencils, which is half of what Cheryl has.",
    "To find out how many Cheryl has, I need to multiply the number of pencils Madeline has by 2.",
    "63 (Madeline's pencils) \u00d7 2 = 126",
    "Cheryl has 126 colored pencils.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many colored pencils Cyrus has.",
    "I know that Cheryl has thrice as many pencils as Cyrus.",
    "Therefore, to find out how many pencils Cyrus has, I need to divide Cheryl's pencils by 3.",
    "126 (Cheryl's pencils) \u00f7 3 = 42",
    "Cyrus has 42 colored pencils.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of colored pencils the three of them have altogether.",
    "This involves adding up all their pencils: Cheryl's, Madeline's, and Cyrus's.",
    "126 (Cheryl) + 63 (Madeline) + 42 (Cyrus) = 231"
  ],
  "solution": "231"
