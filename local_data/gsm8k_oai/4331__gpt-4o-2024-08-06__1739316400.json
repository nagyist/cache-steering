  "query": "Josh has a device that automatically records the temperature in his lab every 5 seconds. To perform an analysis of environmental conditions, Josh lets the device record data for one hour. How many instances of data will the device record?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that there are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "I need to find out how many seconds are in an hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I multiply 60 seconds by 60 minutes to get the total number of seconds in an hour.",
    "60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour.",
    "The device records data every 5 seconds.",
    "I need to calculate how many 5-second intervals are in 3600 seconds.",
    "I can find this by dividing the total number of seconds in an hour (3600) by the interval of data recording (5 seconds).",
    "3600 seconds / 5 seconds/record = 720 records."

  "solution": "720"
