  "steps": [
    "Susie has $200 in her piggy bank initially.",
    "She is going to add 20% more money to her piggy bank.",
    "To find 20% of $200, I calculate \\(20\\% \\times 200\\).",
    "I convert 20% to a decimal, which is 0.20.",
    "Now, I multiply 0.20 by 200 to find the additional amount.",
    "0.20 multiplied by 200 equals 40.",
    "She will add $40 more to the piggy bank.",
    "The total amount in the piggy bank will be the initial $200 plus the additional $40.",
    "Adding $200 and $40 gives $240."
