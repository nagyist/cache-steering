  "query": "Paolo has 14 coconuts, while Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo. If Dante sold 10 of his coconuts, how many coconuts did he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many coconuts Dante has initially.",
    "Dante has three times as many coconuts as Paolo.",
    "Paolo has 14 coconuts.",
    "Thrice as many coconuts as Paolo means 3 times 14.",
    "3 times 14 is equal to 42.",
    "So, Dante initially has 42 coconuts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many coconuts are left after Dante sells 10 of them.",
    "Dante has 42 coconuts and he sold 10.",
    "42 minus 10 is 32.",
    "Therefore, Dante has 32 coconuts left after selling 10."
