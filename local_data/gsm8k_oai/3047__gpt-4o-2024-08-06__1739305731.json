  "query": "A play was held in an auditorium and its ticket costs $10. An auditorium has 20 rows and each row has 10 seats. If only 3/4 of the seats were sold, how much was earned from the play?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of seats in the auditorium.",
    "The auditorium has 20 rows and each row contains 10 seats.",
    "I will multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row: 20 rows * 10 seats/row = 200 seats.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many of these seats were sold. According to the problem, only 3/4 of the seats were sold.",
    "I will multiply the total number of seats by the fraction that were sold: 200 seats * 3/4 = 150 seats.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the earnings from these sold seats. Each ticket costs $10.",
    "I will multiply the number of sold seats by the ticket price: 150 seats * $10/seat = $1500.",
    "I have now determined the total earnings from the play."

  "solution": "1500"
