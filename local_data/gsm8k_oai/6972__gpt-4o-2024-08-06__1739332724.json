  "query": "A bag of caramel cookies has 20 cookies inside and a box of cookies has 4 bags in total. How many calories are inside the box if each cookie is 20 calories?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cookies are in one bag.",
    "There are 20 cookies in one bag.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of bags in one box.",
    "A box contains 4 bags of cookies.",
    "I will now calculate the total number of cookies in one box.",
    "Since each bag has 20 cookies and there are 4 bags, I multiply 20 cookies per bag by 4 bags.",
    "20 multiplied by 4 equals 80. So, there are 80 cookies in one box.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total calories for all cookies in the box.",
    "Each cookie contains 20 calories.",
    "I multiply the number of cookies in the box (80) by the number of calories per cookie (20).",
    "80 multiplied by 20 equals 1600.",
    "Therefore, the total number of calories in the box is 1600."
