  "query": "Marnie opens a bag of chips and eats 5 of them to see if she likes them. She does, so she eats 5 more. The bag has 100 chips in it and starting on the second day she has them, Marnie eats 10 each day. How many days does it take for Marnie to eat the whole bag of chips?",
  "steps": [
    "Marnie starts with a bag of 100 chips.",
    "On the first day, Marnie eats 5 chips to see if she likes them.",
    "Since she likes them, she eats 5 more chips that day.",
    "On the first day, she eats a total of 5 + 5 = 10 chips.",
    "If Marnie eats 10 chips on the first day, she has 100 - 10 = 90 chips remaining.",
    "Starting on the second day, Marnie eats 10 chips each day.",
    "To find out how many days it takes to eat the remaining 90 chips at a rate of 10 chips per day, we can divide the remaining chips by the number of chips eaten per day: 90 / 10 = 9 days.",
    "Marnie eats 10 chips on the first day and completes eating the rest over the next 9 days.",
    "Therefore, the total number of days Marnie takes to finish the whole bag is 1 (first day) + 9 days = 10 days."
