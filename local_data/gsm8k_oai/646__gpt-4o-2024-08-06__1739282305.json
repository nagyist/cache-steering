  "query": "A bus has a capacity of 200 people. If it carried 3/4 of its capacity on its first trip from city A to city B and 4/5 of its capacity on its return trip, calculate the total number of people the bus carried on the two trips?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many people the bus carried on its first trip.",
    "The bus has a capacity of 200 people.",
    "On the first trip, it carried 3/4 of its capacity.",
    "To find out how many people 3/4 of the bus capacity is, I multiply 200 by 3/4.",
    "200 * (3/4) = 150",
    "So, the bus carried 150 people on its first trip.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many people the bus carried on its return trip.",
    "On the return trip, it carried 4/5 of its capacity.",
    "To find out how many people 4/5 of the bus capacity is, I multiply 200 by 4/5.",
    "200 * (4/5) = 160",
    "So, the bus carried 160 people on its return trip.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of people the bus carried on both trips.",
    "I add the number of people carried on the first trip to the number carried on the return trip.",
    "150 (first trip) + 160 (return trip) = 310"
  ],
  "solution": "310"
