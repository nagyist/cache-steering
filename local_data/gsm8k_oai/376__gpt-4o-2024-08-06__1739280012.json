  "query": "Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, and Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla. If Kayla picked 20 apples, how many more apples did Suraya pick than Kayla?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how many apples Caleb picked. The problem states that Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla.",
    "Kayla picked 20 apples.",
    "Caleb picked 5 less than 20, which is 20 - 5 = 15 apples.",
    "Next, determine how many apples Suraya picked. The problem states that Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb.",
    "Caleb picked 15 apples.",
    "Suraya picked 12 more than 15, which is 15 + 12 = 27 apples.",
    "Finally, calculate how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla.",
    "Suraya picked 27 apples and Kayla picked 20 apples.",
    "The difference is 27 - 20 = 7 apples."
