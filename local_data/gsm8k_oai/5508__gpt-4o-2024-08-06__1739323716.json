  "query": "Carly is making a beaded corset. She's going to add 50 rows of purple beads with 20 beads per row, 40 rows of blue beads with 18 beads per row, and 80 gold beads. If beads cost $1 per 10 beads, how much do all the beads she bought cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of purple beads. There are 50 rows of purple beads, with 20 beads per row.",
    "The total number of purple beads is 50 rows * 20 beads/row = 1000 beads.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of blue beads. There are 40 rows of blue beads, with 18 beads per row.",
    "The total number of blue beads is 40 rows * 18 beads/row = 720 beads.",
    "Add the total purple beads, total blue beads, and the 80 gold beads together to find the total number of beads.",
    "Total number of beads = 1000 purple beads + 720 blue beads + 80 gold beads = 1800 beads.",
    "Beads cost $1 per 10 beads. To find the total cost, first determine how many sets of 10 beads are in the total number of beads.",
    "1800 beads divided by 10 beads/set = 180 sets of beads.",
    "Each set costs $1, so the total cost is 180 sets * $1/set.",
    "The total cost of all the beads that Carly bought is $180."

  "solution": "180"
