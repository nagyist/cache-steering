  "query": "Mr. Johnson is organizing the school Christmas play and needs 50 volunteers to help with decorating the auditorium. 5 students from each of the school\u2019s 6 math classes have volunteered to help. 13 teachers have also volunteered to help. How many more volunteers will Mr. Johnson need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many student volunteers there are. I know that 5 students have volunteered from each of the 6 math classes.",
    "To find the total number of student volunteers, I multiply the number of students per class (5) by the number of classes (6).",
    "5 students/class * 6 classes = 30 student volunteers",
    "Next, I need to consider the number of teacher volunteers, which is 13.",
    "Now, I will add the number of student volunteers to the number of teacher volunteers to find the total number of volunteers Mr. Johnson currently has.",
    "30 student volunteers + 13 teacher volunteers = 43 total volunteers",
    "Mr. Johnson needs a total of 50 volunteers, so I need to find out how many more volunteers are needed by subtracting the current number from the required number.",
    "50 total required volunteers - 43 current volunteers = 7 more volunteers needed"

  "solution": "7"
