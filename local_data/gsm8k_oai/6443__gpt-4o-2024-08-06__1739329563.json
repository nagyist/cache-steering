  "query": "It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the rate at which Omar raises his kite. It takes him 12 minutes to raise it 240 feet.",
    "The rate is calculated by dividing the distance by the time: 240 feet / 12 minutes.",
    "240 feet / 12 minutes = 20 feet per minute. So, Omar raises his kite at a rate of 20 feet per minute.",
    "Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of Omar.",
    "To find Jasper's rate, I multiply Omar's rate by 3: 20 feet per minute * 3 = 60 feet per minute.",
    "Jasper wants to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet.",
    "To find the time it takes Jasper, I divide the total height by his rate: 600 feet / 60 feet per minute.",
    "600 feet / 60 feet per minute = 10 minutes."

  "solution": "10"
