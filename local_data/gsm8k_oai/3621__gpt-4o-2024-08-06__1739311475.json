  "query": "In a car dealership, Fiona worked for 40 hours a week, John for 30 hours, and Jeremy for 25 hours. If the employees are paid $20 per hour, how much money does their boss spend paying all of them every month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much Fiona earns in one week. Fiona worked 40 hours a week at a rate of $20 per hour.",
    "Calculate Fiona's weekly earnings: \\(40 \\text{ hours} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 800 \\text{ dollars/week}\\).",
    "Next, calculate John's weekly earnings. John worked 30 hours a week at the same rate of $20 per hour.",
    "Calculate John's weekly earnings: \\(30 \\text{ hours} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \\text{ dollars/week}\\).",
    "Now, calculate Jeremy's weekly earnings. Jeremy worked 25 hours a week at the rate of $20 per hour.",
    "Calculate Jeremy's weekly earnings: \\(25 \\text{ hours} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 500 \\text{ dollars/week}\\).",
    "Add the weekly earnings of all three employees to get the total weekly salary expenditure.",
    "Total weekly salary: \\(800 \\text{ dollars} (Fiona) + 600 \\text{ dollars} (John) + 500 \\text{ dollars} (Jeremy) = 1900 \\text{ dollars/week}\\).",
    "Calculate how much their boss spends on salaries every month. Typically, a month is considered to have 4 weeks.",
    "Monthly salary expenditure: \\(1900 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 7600 \\text{ dollars/month}\\)."
