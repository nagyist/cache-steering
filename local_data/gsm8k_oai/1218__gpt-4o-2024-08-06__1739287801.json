    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the shoes without tax.",
    "The pair of Nikes costs $150.",
    "The pair of work boots costs $120.",
    "I will add these two amounts together to find the subtotal.",
    "$150 + $120 = $270",

    "Now, I need to calculate the sales tax. The tax rate is 10%.",
    "To find 10% of $270, I multiply $270 by 0.10.",
    "$270 \u00d7 0.10 = $27",
    "The sales tax is $27.",
    "Next, I will add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total cost.",
