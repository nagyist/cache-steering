  "query": "Mary and her two friends agreed to evenly pay for the cost of 2 pounds of chicken. Mary's mother went to the grocery and bought the 2-pound chicken, 3 pounds of beef that cost $4 per pound, and a liter of oil that costs $1. If Mary's mother paid a total of $16 for the grocery, how much should Mary and her two friends pay each for the chicken?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the chicken.",
    "Mary's mother bought 3 pounds of beef at $4 per pound.",
    "The total cost of the beef is: 3 pounds * $4/pound = $12.",
    "Mary's mother also bought a liter of oil that costs $1.",
    "The total cost for the beef and the oil combined is: $12 + $1 = $13.",
    "Mary's mother paid a total of $16 for all the groceries.",
    "To find the cost of the chicken, I'll subtract the total cost of the beef and the oil from the total amount Mary's mother paid.",
    "The cost of the chicken is $16 - $13 = $3.",
    "Mary and her two friends agreed to evenly pay for the chicken.",
    "There are three people paying for the chicken: Mary and her two friends.",
    "Each person should pay the total cost of the chicken divided by the number of people: $3 / 3 = $1."
