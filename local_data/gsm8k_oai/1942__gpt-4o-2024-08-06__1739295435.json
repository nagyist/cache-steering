  "query": "Stacy went to a store to buy some pairs of shorts. Each pair normally cost $10, but there's a discount of 10% on the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs at once. How much can she save by buying 3 pairs at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the total cost if Stacy buys 3 pairs of shorts individually at different times, without any discount.",
    "Since each pair of shorts costs $10, for 3 pairs, the cost would be 3 times $10.",
    "3 times $10 equals $30.",
    "Next, let's calculate the total cost if Stacy buys the 3 pairs of shorts at once and gets the 10% discount.",
    "The original total cost of 3 pairs without a discount is still $30.",
    "A 10% discount on $30 means Stacy saves 10% of $30.",
    "To find 10% of $30, I calculate 0.10 times $30.",
    "0.10 times $30 equals $3.",
    "So, the discount saves Stacy $3 if she buys 3 pairs at once.",
    "The savings, therefore, amount to $3 by purchasing 3 pairs together rather than individually."

  "solution": "3"
