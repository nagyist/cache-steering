  "query": "In 7 years, Kaylee will be 3 times as old as Matt is now. If Matt is currently 5 years old, how old is Kaylee now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Matt is right now, which is given as 5 years old.",
    "In 7 years, Kaylee will be 3 times Matt's current age.",
    "Since Matt is currently 5 years old, 3 times Matt's age is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).",
    "Therefore, in 7 years, Kaylee will be 15 years old.",
    "Now to find out Kaylee\u2019s current age, I need to subtract 7 years from her age in 7 years.",
    "Kaylee's current age is \\(15 - 7 = 8\\)."

  "solution": "8"
