    "Nick needs to raise a total of $1000.",
    "He is selling chocolate oranges for $10 each.",
    "He sold out the 20 chocolate oranges he had.",
    "Calculate the total amount of money from chocolate oranges: 20 chocolate oranges \u00d7 $10 = $200.",

    "Nick needs to raise $800 from selling candy bars.",
    "Each candy bar sells for $5.",
    "Divide the remaining amount needed by the price of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars he needs to sell: $800 \u00f7 $5 = 160."
