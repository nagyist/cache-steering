  "query": "Erica sees 9 butterflies in the garden.  She sees one-third of them fly away.  How many butterflies are left in the garden?",
  "steps": [
    "Erica sees 9 butterflies in the garden initially.",
    "One-third of these butterflies fly away.",
    "To find out how many butterflies fly away, I need to calculate one-third of 9.",
    "One-third of 9 is calculated as 9 divided by 3.",
    "9 divided by 3 equals 3.",
    "Therefore, 3 butterflies fly away.",
    "To find out how many butterflies are left, I need to subtract the number of butterflies that flew away from the initial number.",
    "There were initially 9 butterflies, and 3 flew away.",
    "So, 9 minus 3 equals 6."

  "solution": "6"
