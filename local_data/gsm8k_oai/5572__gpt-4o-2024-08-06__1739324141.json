  "query": "Alicia had a wonderful birthday party where she got lots of presents. 10 of the presents were in small boxes. 12 of the presents were in medium boxes. A third of all the presents she is given are in large boxes. How many presents did Alicia get for her birthday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of presents in the small and medium boxes.",
    "Alicia got 10 presents in small boxes and 12 presents in medium boxes.",
    "Adding the small and medium box presents gives 10 + 12 = 22 presents.",
    "A third of all Alicia's presents are in large boxes.",
    "Let's call the total number of presents \"x\". According to the problem, (1/3) * x is in large boxes.",
    "The presents in small and medium boxes total 22, so the large boxes contain the rest of the presents.",
    "This means that 22 presents are (2/3) of the total number of presents, because the other (1/3) are in large boxes.",
    "Since 22 presents make up (2/3) of the total, I set up the equation: (2/3) * x = 22.",
    "Solving for x gives us x = 22 / (2/3).",
    "To divide by a fraction, I multiply by its reciprocal: x = 22 * (3/2).",
    "Calculating gives x = 22 * 1.5 = 33.",
    "So, Alicia received 33 presents in total for her birthday."
