  "query": "Rick can iron 4 dress shirts in an hour.  He can iron 3 dress pants in an hour.  If he spends 3 hours ironing dress shirts and 5 hours ironing dress pants, how many pieces of clothing has he ironed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many shirts Rick irons in one hour.",
    "Rick can iron 4 dress shirts in one hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many shirts he can iron in 3 hours.",
    "In 3 hours, Rick can iron 4 shirts per hour, which is 4 shirts/hour * 3 hours = 12 shirts.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pants Rick irons in one hour.",
    "Rick can iron 3 dress pants in one hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pants he can iron in 5 hours.",
    "In 5 hours, Rick can iron 3 pants per hour, which is 3 pants/hour * 5 hours = 15 pants.",
    "Finally, I need to add the number of shirts and pants to find the total number of pieces of clothing ironed.",
    "Rick ironed 12 shirts and 15 pants, so the total is 12 + 15.",
    "12 + 15 = 27 pieces of clothing."
