    "Stephen has 110 ants in total.",
    "Half of the ants are worker ants.",
    "To find the number of worker ants, divide 110 by 2.",
    "110 divided by 2 equals 55. So, there are 55 worker ants.",
    "20 percent of the worker ants are male.",
    "To calculate the number of male worker ants, find 20 percent of 55.",
    "20 percent of 55 is calculated as 0.20 multiplied by 55.",
    "0.20 times 55 equals 11. So, there are 11 male worker ants.",
    "To find the number of female worker ants, subtract the male worker ants from the total worker ants.",
    "55 worker ants minus 11 male worker ants equals 44."
