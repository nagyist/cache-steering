  "query": "Teairra has 5 shirts and 24 pairs of pants in her closet. If 3 of Teairra's shirts are plaid and 5 of Teairra's pants are purple, how many shirts and pants does Teairra has which are neither plaid nor purple?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many shirts Teairra has in total.",
    "Teairra has 5 shirts in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these shirts are neither plaid.",
    "Teairra has 3 plaid shirts.",
    "To find the number of shirts that are neither plaid, I will subtract the number of plaid shirts from the total number of shirts.",
    "5 total shirts - 3 plaid shirts = 2 shirts that are neither plaid.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many pants Teairra has in total.",
    "Teairra has 24 pairs of pants in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these pants are neither purple.",
    "Teairra has 5 purple pants.",
    "To find the number of pants that are neither purple, I will subtract the number of purple pants from the total number of pants.",
    "24 total pants - 5 purple pants = 19 pants that are neither purple.",
    "Finally, I need to add the number of shirts that are neither plaid nor purple pants to find the total number of shirts and pants that are neither plaid nor purple.",
    "2 shirts that are neither plaid + 19 pants that are neither purple = 21."
