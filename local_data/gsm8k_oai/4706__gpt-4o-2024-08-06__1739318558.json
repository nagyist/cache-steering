  "query": "Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of cookies that can be made from one whole bag of chocolate chips.",
    "I know that each cookie contains 9 chocolate chips.",
    "A bag contains 81 chocolate chips.",
    "To find out how many cookies can be made from 81 chocolate chips, I divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per cookie.",
    "Performing the division: 81 chips / 9 chips per cookie = 9 cookies.",
    "This means that a whole bag of chocolate chips can make a total of 9 cookies.",
    "The problem states that these 9 cookies are made from three batches of dough.",
    "I need to find out the number of cookies in one batch.",
    "Since 9 cookies are made from 3 batches, I can divide the total number of cookies by the number of batches to find out how many cookies are in one batch.",
    "Dividing the cookies by batches: 9 cookies / 3 batches = 3 cookies per batch."
