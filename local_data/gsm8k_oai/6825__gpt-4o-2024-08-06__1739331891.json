  "query": "Kayla and Theresa went to buy some chocolate bars and soda cans. Theresa bought twice the number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought. If Theresa bought 12 chocolate bars and 18 soda cans, how many chocolate bars and soda cans did Kayla buy in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of chocolate bars Kayla bought be \\( x \\).",
    "Let the number of soda cans Kayla bought be \\( y \\).",
    "Theresa bought twice the number of chocolate bars Kayla bought, so she bought \\( 2x \\) chocolate bars.",
    "Theresa bought 12 chocolate bars, which equals \\( 2x = 12 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 2: \\( x = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\).",
    "Theresa also bought twice the number of soda cans Kayla bought, so she bought \\( 2y \\) soda cans.",
    "Theresa bought 18 soda cans, which equals \\( 2y = 18 \\).",
    "To find \\( y \\), divide both sides of the equation by 2: \\( y = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\).",
    "Kayla bought 6 chocolate bars and 9 soda cans.",
    "The total number of items Kayla bought is \\( 6 + 9 \\).",
    "Calculate the total: \\( 6 + 9 = 15 \\)."
