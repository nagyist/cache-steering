  "query": "Janine read 5 books last month. This month, she read twice as many books. If each book has 10 pages, how many pages did Janine read in two months?",
  "steps": [
    "Last month, Janine read 5 books.",
    "This month, she read twice as many books as last month.",
    "To calculate the number of books she read this month, multiply 5 by 2.",
    "5 times 2 equals 10. So, Janine read 10 books this month.",
    "To find the total number of books Janine read in the two months, add the books from last month and this month.",
    "5 books from last month plus 10 books from this month equals 15 books.",
    "Each book has 10 pages.",
    "To find the total number of pages Janine read, multiply the total number of books by the number of pages per book.",
    "15 books times 10 pages per book equals 150 pages."
