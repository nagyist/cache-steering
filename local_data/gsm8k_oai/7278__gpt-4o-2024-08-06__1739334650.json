  "query": "Mrs. Garcia pays her insurance quarterly at $378. How much does she pay in a year for her insurance?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many quarters are in a year.",
    "A year has 12 months, and a quarter is 3 months.",
    "So, there are 12/3 = 4 quarters in a year.",
    "Mrs. Garcia pays $378 per quarter.",
    "To find the total yearly payment, I need to multiply the quarterly payment by the number of quarters in a year.",
    "That means I need to calculate 378 * 4.",
    "I will perform the multiplication: 378 * 4.",
    "378 * 4 = 1512.",
    "Therefore, Mrs. Garcia pays $1,512 in a year for her insurance."
  ],
  "solution": "1512"
