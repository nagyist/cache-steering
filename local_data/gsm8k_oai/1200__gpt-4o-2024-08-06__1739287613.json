  "query": "Once a week, it takes Kitty 5 minutes to pick up toys and straighten the living room.  It takes another 20 minutes to vacuum the living room floor, seating and drapes.  She spends 15 minutes cleaning the windows and 10 minutes dusting the furniture.  After 4 weeks, how long has Kitty spent cleaning just the living room?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total time Kitty spends cleaning the living room in one week.",
    "She spends 5 minutes picking up toys and straightening the living room.",
    "She spends 20 minutes vacuuming the living room floor, seating, and drapes.",
    "She spends 15 minutes cleaning the windows.",
    "She spends 10 minutes dusting the furniture.",
    "To find the total time for one week, I need to add all these times together: 5 minutes + 20 minutes + 15 minutes + 10 minutes.",
    "5 + 20 = 25; then 25 + 15 = 40; and finally, 40 + 10 = 50.",
    "Kitty spends 50 minutes cleaning the living room each week.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total time spent after 4 weeks.",
    "Since she spends 50 minutes every week, for 4 weeks, I multiply 50 minutes by 4.",
    "50 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 200 minutes.",
    "Kitty spends a total of 200 minutes cleaning the living room over 4 weeks."
