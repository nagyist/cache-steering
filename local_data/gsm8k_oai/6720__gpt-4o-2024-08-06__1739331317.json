  "query": "Janet likes collecting action figures in her spare time. She currently owns 10 action figures and sells 6 of them to get 4 that are in better condition. Her brother then gives her his collection which is twice the size of what Janet has at the time. How many action figures does she now have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Janet initially has 10 action figures.",
    "She sells 6 of them, so 10 - 6 = 4 action figures are left.",
    "She then acquires 4 new action figures, bringing her total back to 4 + 4 = 8 action figures.",
    "Her brother gives her a collection that is twice the size of her current collection, which is 2 * 8 = 16 action figures.",
    "Adding her brother's collection to her current collection, Janet now has 8 + 16 = 24 action figures."

  "solution": "24"
