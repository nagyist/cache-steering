  "query": "A fan can create an airflow of 10 liters per second. If the fan works for 10 minutes each day, calculate the amount of airflow it will create in one week.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total airflow produced in one day.",
    "The fan creates 10 liters of airflow per second.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "So, in one minute, the fan produces 10 liters/second * 60 seconds = 600 liters.",
    "The fan works for 10 minutes each day.",
    "In 10 minutes, the fan produces 600 liters/minute * 10 minutes = 6000 liters.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the airflow for one week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "The total weekly airflow is 6000 liters/day * 7 days = 42000 liters."
  ],
  "solution": "42000"
