    "The membership fee increases by $10 each year.",
    "In the first year, Aaron pays $80.",
    "To find the fee for subsequent years, I add $10 each year to the previous year's fee.",
    "In the second year, he pays $80 + $10 = $90.",
    "In the third year, he pays $90 + $10 = $100.",

    "In the fifth year, he pays $110 + $10 = $120.",
    "In the sixth year, he pays $120 + $10 = $130."
