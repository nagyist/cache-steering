  "query": "Preston has a sandwich shop. He charges $5 for each sandwich. He also charges $20 for a delivery fee. Abra Company orders 18 sandwiches from Preston and also tips him 10%. How much total, in dollars, did Preston receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of the sandwiches ordered. Each sandwich costs $5, and Abra Company orders 18 sandwiches.",
    "I multiply the number of sandwiches (18) by the cost per sandwich ($5): 18 * 5 = $90.",
    "Next, I need to consider the delivery fee, which is a fixed amount of $20.",
    "I add the cost of the sandwiches ($90) to the delivery fee ($20): 90 + 20 = $110.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the tip. Abra Company tips 10% of the total amount before the tip.",
    "I take 10% of $110 to find the tip: 0.10 * 110 = $11.",
    "Finally, I add the tip ($11) to the total amount before the tip ($110) to find the total amount Preston received.",
    "I calculate the final total: 110 + 11 = $121."

  "solution": "121"
