  "query": "Reagan's school has a fish tank with a total of 280 fish of two types, koi fish and goldfish. Over the next 3 weeks, the school added 2 koi fish and 5 goldfish per day. If the tank had 200 goldfish at the end of the three weeks, what's the total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "We start with the information that there are 280 fish in total in the tank initially, which consist of koi fish and goldfish.",
    "We are also told that by the end of the three-week period, there are 200 goldfish in the tank.",
    "We need to find out how many koi fish are there at the end of the three weeks.",
    "Let's determine how many goldfish are added over the three weeks. We know there are 5 goldfish added each day.",
    "The duration given is three weeks. Since each week has 7 days, that's \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) days in total.",
    "Thus, total goldfish added is \\(5 \\times 21 = 105\\).",
    "Let \\(x\\) be the number of goldfish initially in the tank. After adding 105 goldfish over three weeks, the number of goldfish becomes \\(x + 105 = 200\\).",
    "Solving for \\(x\\), we find \\(x = 200 - 105 = 95\\). So initially, there were 95 goldfish in the tank.",
    "Since there were 280 fish in total initially, the number of koi fish originally is \\(280 - 95 = 185\\).",
    "Similarly, we calculate how many koi fish were added over the three-week period. We know 2 koi fish are added each day.",
    "Thus, total koi fish added is \\(2 \\times 21 = 42\\) over the three weeks.",
    "Finally, the total number of koi fish after three weeks is the initial number of koi fish plus the number added, \\(185 + 42 = 227\\)."
