  "query": "On Friday, Addison sold 181 raffle tickets for a fundraiser. She sold twice as many on Saturday. On Sunday, she sold 78 raffle tickets. How many more raffle tickets were sold on Saturday than Sunday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many raffle tickets Addison sold on Saturday.",
    "The problem states that Addison sold twice as many tickets on Saturday as on Friday.",
    "Addison sold 181 tickets on Friday.",
    "So, on Saturday, she sold 2 times 181 tickets.",
    "Calculating the tickets sold on Saturday: 2 \u00d7 181 = 362 tickets.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more tickets were sold on Saturday than on Sunday.",
    "Addison sold 78 tickets on Sunday.",
    "To find how many more tickets were sold on Saturday than Sunday, I subtract the tickets sold on Sunday from the tickets sold on Saturday.",
    "That calculation is: 362 - 78.",
    "Performing the subtraction: 362 - 78 = 284."
  ],
  "solution": "284"
