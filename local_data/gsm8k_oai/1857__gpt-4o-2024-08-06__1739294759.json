  "query": "Alden's family invited their relatives for a family reunion on Christmas eve. There were 50 more female adults than male adults, and children were twice the total number of adults. If there were 100 male adults, how many people attended the family reunion?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that there are 100 male adults.",
    "According to the problem, there are 50 more female adults than male adults.",
    "So, I calculate the number of female adults by adding 50 to the number of male adults: 100 + 50 = 150.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of adults, which is the sum of male and female adults: 100 male adults + 150 female adults = 250 adults.",
    "The problem states that the number of children is twice the total number of adults.",
    "Therefore, I calculate the number of children as 2 times the total number of adults: 2 * 250 = 500 children.",
    "To find the total number of people at the reunion, I add the total number of adults and the number of children: 250 adults + 500 children = 750 people."
