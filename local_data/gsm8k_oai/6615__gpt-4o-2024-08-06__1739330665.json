  "query": "Pete and Raymond each receive $2.50 from their grandmother. Pete saves his money and only spends 4 nickels. Raymond spends his money at the arcade games but still has 7 dimes left. How much did Pete and Raymond spent altogether, in cents?",
  "steps": [
    "Pete receives $2.50 and spends 4 nickels.",
    "Each nickel is worth 5 cents.",
    "Pete spends 4 nickels \u00d7 5 cents/nickel = 20 cents.",
    "Raymond receives $2.50.",
    "1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, so $2.50 is 250 cents.",
    "Raymond has 7 dimes left.",
    "Each dime is worth 10 cents.",
    "Raymond's remaining dimes are worth 7 dimes \u00d7 10 cents/dime = 70 cents.",
    "Raymond initially had 250 cents and now has 70 cents left.",
    "Raymond spent 250 cents - 70 cents = 180 cents.",
    "To find how much Pete and Raymond spent altogether, we add the amount each spent.",
    "Pete spent 20 cents and Raymond spent 180 cents.",
    "The total spent is 20 cents + 180 cents = 200 cents."
