  "query": "One barnyard owl makes 5 hoot sounds per minute.  If 5 less than 20 hoots per minute are heard coming out of the barn, how many Barnyard owls would this noise be coming from?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hoots were heard per minute. The problem states that 5 less than 20 hoots per minute are heard.",
    "I subtract 5 from 20 to calculate the number of hoots: 20 - 5 = 15.",
    "So there are 15 hoots per minute being heard.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many owls it takes to produce 15 hoots per minute, given that one owl makes 5 hoots per minute.",
    "To determine the number of owls, I divide the total hoots by the hoots per owl: 15 hoots / 5 hoots per owl.",
    "15 divided by 5 equals 3.",
    "Therefore, the hoots are coming from 3 barnyard owls."

  "solution": "3"
