  "query": "Dr. Harry wants to know how many candies Susan consumed during the week. Susan tells him she bought 3 on Tuesday, 5 on Thursday, 2 on Friday. If she has only 4 of them left, how many did she eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of candies Susan bought.",
    "Susan bought 3 candies on Tuesday.",
    "She also bought 5 candies on Thursday.",
    "Additionally, she bought 2 candies on Friday.",
    "Now, I will add these numbers together: 3 + 5 + 2.",
    "3 + 5 = 8.",
    "8 + 2 = 10.",
    "So, Susan bought a total of 10 candies.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many candies Susan has consumed.",
    "She has 4 of them left.",
    "Therefore, the number of candies she consumed is the total candies she bought minus the candies she has left.",
    "This is calculated as: 10 - 4.",
    "10 - 4 = 6.",
    "So, Susan consumed 6 candies."
