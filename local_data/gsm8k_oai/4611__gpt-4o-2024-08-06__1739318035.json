  "query": "When the schools were opened for the new year, Hendrix's class had 20 new students. However, at the end of the school year, 1/3 of the students in Hendrix class had transferred to other schools. If the number of students that were in Hendrix's class before 20 new students joined was 160, calculate the number of students that were in the class at the end of the year.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total number of students in Hendrix's class at the beginning of the school year after 20 new students joined.",
    "The initial number of students was 160.",
    "20 new students joined, so I add 160 and 20.",
    "160 + 20 = 180 students at the beginning of the school year.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many students transferred to other schools by the end of the school year.",
    "According to the problem, 1/3 of the students transferred.",
    "1/3 of 180 is calculated as (1/3) * 180.",
    "(1/3) * 180 = 60 students transferred.",
    "Now, I'll subtract the number of students who transferred from the initial total to find the remaining number of students in the class.",
    "180 - 60 = 120 students remaining in Hendrix's class at the end of the year."
