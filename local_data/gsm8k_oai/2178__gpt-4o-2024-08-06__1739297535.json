  "query": "Ben bought a lawnmower for his garden. He paid $100 for it. After six months, the value of the mower dropped by about 25%. Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20% in value. How much is Ben's lawnmower worth after this time?",
  "steps": [
    "Ben initially bought the lawnmower for $100.",
    "The value of the mower dropped by 25% after six months.",
    "To calculate the decrease, I need to find 25% of $100.",
    "25% of $100 is \\(0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\).",
    "So, the value decreased by $25 in the first six months.",
    "The new value of the lawnmower after six months is \\(100 - 25 = 75\\).",
    "Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20%.",
    "To find the decrease, I need to calculate 20% of $75.",
    "20% of $75 is \\(0.20 \\times 75 = 15\\).",
    "So, the value decreased by $15 over the next year.",
    "The final value of the lawnmower is \\(75 - 15 = 60\\)."
