  "query": "Paul eats a lot when he studies. He loves sandwiches and eats them at the same rate every three days. He eats 2 sandwiches the first day, then doubles that number of sandwiches for the second day. On the third day, he doubles the number of sandwiches he ate on the second day. How many sandwiches would Paul eat if he studied 6 days in a row?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul eats 2 sandwiches on the first day.",
    "On the second day, Paul doubles the first day's amount. So, he eats 2 * 2 = 4 sandwiches.",
    "On the third day, Paul doubles the second day's amount. So, he eats 4 * 2 = 8 sandwiches.",
    "To find the total for the first three-day cycle, add the sandwiches: 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 sandwiches.",
    "Paul repeats this three-day cycle because he studies for 6 days.",
    "In the second cycle of three days, he eats the same number of sandwiches: 14 sandwiches.",
    "Add the sandwiches from both cycles to find the total for 6 days: 14 + 14 = 28 sandwiches."
