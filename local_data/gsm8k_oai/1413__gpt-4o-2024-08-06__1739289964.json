  "query": "Maria is a saleswoman at a flower shop. On the first day, she sold 30 tulips and 20 roses. The next day, she doubled the previous day's sales. On the third day, she sold only 10% of the tulips sold on the second day and 16 roses. The price of one tulip is $2 and one rose is $3. How much did Maria earn over these three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of tulips and roses sold on each day.",
    "On the first day, Maria sold 30 tulips and 20 roses.",
    "On the second day, she doubled her sales, so she sold \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) tulips and \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) roses.",
    "On the third day, she sold 10% of the tulips she sold on the second day, which is \\(0.1 \\times 60 = 6\\) tulips.",
    "She also sold 16 roses on the third day.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the earnings from tulips for each day.",
    "On the first day, her earnings from tulips were \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) dollars.",
    "On the second day, her earnings from tulips were \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\) dollars.",
    "On the third day, her earnings from tulips were \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) dollars.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the earnings from roses for each day.",
    "On the first day, her earnings from roses were \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\) dollars.",
    "On the second day, her earnings from roses were \\(40 \\times 3 = 120\\) dollars.",
    "On the third day, her earnings from roses were \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\) dollars.",
    "I'll now add up all the earnings to find the total amount earned over the three days.",
    "Total earnings from tulips are \\(60 + 120 + 12 = 192\\) dollars.",
    "Total earnings from roses are \\(60 + 120 + 48 = 228\\) dollars.",
    "Adding these together gives the total earnings: \\(192 + 228 = 420\\) dollars."
