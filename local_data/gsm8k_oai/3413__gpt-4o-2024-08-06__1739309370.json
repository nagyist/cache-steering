  "query": "Mike is feeding the birds at the park. He counts out the seeds as he throws them. He throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left. He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right. Some more birds flutter over to join the others for lunch and Mike throws 30 more seeds for them. If Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds, how many seeds did Mike start with?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the total number of seeds Mike started with.",
    "He throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left.",
    "He throws twice as much to the birds on the right. So, he throws 2 times 20 = 40 seeds to the right.",
    "Additionally, Mike throws 30 more seeds to a new group of birds.",
    "Mike still has 30 seeds left after throwing seeds to all the groups of birds.",
    "To find the total seeds Mike started with, I will sum up all the seeds he threw and the seeds he has left.",
    "The seeds he threw are 20 (left) + 40 (right) + 30 (new group) = 90 seeds.",
    "Including the seeds he has left (30 seeds), the total number of seeds he started with is 90 + 30."
