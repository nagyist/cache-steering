  "query": "Mabel has 5 daisies in her garden, and each daisy has 8 petals.  If she gives 2 daisies to her teacher, how many petals does she have on the remaining daisies in her garden?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many daisies Mabel remains with after giving away 2 daisies to her teacher. She initially has 5 daisies.",
    "Subtract the 2 daisies given to the teacher from the 5 daisies she initially had: 5 - 2 = 3 daisies remain.",
    "Each remaining daisy has 8 petals. Therefore, I need to calculate the total number of petals on the 3 remaining daisies.",
    "Multiply the number of remaining daisies (3) by the number of petals per daisy (8): 3 * 8 = 24 petals."
  ],
  "solution": "24"
