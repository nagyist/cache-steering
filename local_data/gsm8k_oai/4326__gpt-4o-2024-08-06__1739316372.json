  "query": "Liam and Claire picked and sold oranges to save for their mother's birthday gift. Liam picked 40 oranges and sold them at $2.50 for 2 while Claire picked 30 oranges and sold them at $1.20 each. If all of their oranges were sold, how much are they going to save for their mother's birthday gift?",
  "steps": [
    "Liam picked 40 oranges and sold them at $2.50 for 2 oranges.",
    "First, I'll calculate how many pairs of oranges Liam has. Since he picked 40 oranges, he has 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much money Liam made from selling his oranges. He made $2.50 for each pair, so: 20 pairs * $2.50 = $50.00.",
    "Claire picked 30 oranges and sold them at $1.20 each.",
    "To find out how much Claire made from selling all of her oranges, I will multiply the number of oranges by the price each was sold for: 30 * $1.20 = $36.00.",
    "Now, I'll add the amounts Liam and Claire earned to find out the total amount they saved: $50.00 + $36.00 = $86.00."

  "solution": "86"
