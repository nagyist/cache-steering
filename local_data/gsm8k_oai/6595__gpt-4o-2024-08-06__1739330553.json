  "query": "Drew is 5 years older than Maya. Peter is 4 years older than Drew. John is 30 and is twice as old as Maya. In 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter\u2019s age. How old is Jacob now?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by finding the age of Maya. We know that John is 30 years old and is twice as old as Maya.",
    "This means Maya is 30 / 2 = 15 years old.",
    "Next, we calculate Drew's age. Drew is 5 years older than Maya.",
    "So, Drew is 15 + 5 = 20 years old.",
    "Now, let's find Peter's age. Peter is 4 years older than Drew.",
    "Thus, Peter is 20 + 4 = 24 years old.",
    "We know that in 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter's age. In 2 years, Peter will be 24 + 2 = 26 years old.",
    "If Jacob will be half of Peter's age in 2 years, Jacob will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old at that time.",
    "To find Jacob's current age, we need to subtract 2 years from his age in 2 years.",
    "Therefore, Jacob is currently 13 - 2 = 11 years old."
