  "query": "Oliver is working out in a gym. On Monday he worked out for 4 hours, and the next day for 2 hours less. On Wednesday he decided to work out twice as much as on Monday. On Thursday the gym was closed, so Oliver needed to exercise at home which took twice as much time as on Tuesday. How many hours in total have Oliver worked out during these four days?",
  "steps": [
    "On Monday, Oliver worked out for 4 hours.",
    "On Tuesday, he worked out for 2 hours less than Monday, so 4 - 2 = 2 hours.",
    "On Wednesday, he decided to work out twice as much as on Monday, which is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.",
    "On Thursday, since the gym was closed, Oliver worked out at home for twice as much time as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.",
    "Now I add all the hours he worked out over these four days: 4 (Monday) + 2 (Tuesday) + 8 (Wednesday) + 4 (Thursday) = 18 hours."

  "solution": "18"
