  "query": "The owner of a small store divided the sugar into 12 packs. If each pack weighs 250 grams and has 20 grams of sugar left, how many grams of sugar did he start with?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the owner divided the sugar into 12 packs.",
    "Each pack weighs 250 grams.",
    "I need to calculate the total weight of all the packs together.",
    "I multiply the number of packs (12) by the weight of each pack (250 grams).",
    "12 packs * 250 grams/pack equals 3000 grams.",
    "The problem states that there are 20 grams of sugar left after dividing into packs.",
    "I need to add the leftover sugar to the total weight of the packed sugar.",
    "3000 grams (total packed sugar) + 20 grams (leftover sugar) = 3020 grams."
