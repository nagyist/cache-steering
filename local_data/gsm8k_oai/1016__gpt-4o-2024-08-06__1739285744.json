    "The total number of pieces of fruit is 78.",
    "One-third of the pieces are kiwi.",
    "To find the number of kiwi, divide 78 by 3.",
    "78 divided by 3 is 26.",
    "So, there are 26 kiwis.",
    "Subtract the number of kiwis from the total number of pieces of fruit to find the number of strawberries.",
