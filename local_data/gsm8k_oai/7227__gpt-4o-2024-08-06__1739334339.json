  "query": "Elizabeth has 20 dollars and wants to buy pens and pencils. Each pencil costs $1.60 and each pen cost 2 dollars. How many pencils can she buy with her 20 dollars if she wants 6 pens?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Elizabeth will spend on 6 pens.",
    "Each pen costs 2 dollars.",
    "So, 6 pens will cost 6 * 2 = 12 dollars.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money she will have left after buying the pens.",
    "Elizabeth starts with 20 dollars.",
    "She spends 12 dollars on pens.",
    "Therefore, she will have 20 - 12 = 8 dollars left.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many pencils she can buy with the remaining 8 dollars.",
    "Each pencil costs $1.60.",
    "To find out how many pencils she can buy, I divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one pencil.",
    "8 / 1.60 = 5",
    "So, Elizabeth can buy 5 pencils with the money she has left."
