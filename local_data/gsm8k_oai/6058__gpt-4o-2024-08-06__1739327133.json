  "query": "Troy bakes 2 pans of brownies, cut into 16 pieces per pan.  The guests eat all of 1 pan, and 75% of the 2nd pan.  One tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops.  If all but 4 of the guests eat the brownies ala mode (with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream), how many tubs of ice cream did the guests eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of brownie pieces Troy has. With 2 pans of brownies and 16 pieces per pan, it\u2019s simple multiplication: 2 pans * 16 pieces per pan = 32 pieces of brownies.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many brownie pieces were eaten by the guests. Guests ate all of 1 pan and 75% of the 2nd pan.",
    "All of the first pan means 16 pieces were eaten.",
    "To find 75% of the second pan, I multiply 16 pieces by 0.75: 16 * 0.75 = 12 pieces.",
    "Adding the pieces eaten from both pans gives 16 pieces (from the 1st pan) + 12 pieces (from the 2nd pan) = 28 pieces eaten in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many guests ate brownies with ice cream. Each guest who ate brownies ala mode had 2 scoops of ice cream.",
    "If all but 4 guests ate the brownies ala mode, I should first consider how many guests were there who ate the brownies. Since they ate 28 pieces, theoretically 28 guests could have eaten, assuming 1 piece per person.",
    "So, the number of guests who had brownies ala mode is 28 guests - 4 guests = 24 guests.",
    "Thus, 24 guests needed 2 scoops each, which means the total number of scoops needed is 24 guests * 2 scoops each = 48 scoops.",
    "Now, I know that each tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops. So, to find out how many tubs of ice cream were consumed, I divide the total number of scoops needed by the number of scoops per tub: 48 scoops / 8 scoops per tub = 6 tubs."
