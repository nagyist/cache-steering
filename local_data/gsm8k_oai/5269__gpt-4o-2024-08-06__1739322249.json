  "query": "Luke pays a school fee. His mother gave him one $50 bill, two $20 bills, and three $10 bills. His father gave him four $50 bills, one $20 bill, and one $10 bill. If his parents gave him the exact amount for the school fee, how much is the school fee?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Luke's mother gave him.",
    "Luke's mother gave him one $50 bill.",
    "One $50 bill is worth $50.",
    "Additionally, Luke's mother gave him two $20 bills.",
    "Two $20 bills are worth 2 x $20 = $40.",
    "Luke's mother also gave him three $10 bills.",
    "Three $10 bills are worth 3 x $10 = $30.",
    "Now, I add up all the money from Luke\u2019s mother: $50 + $40 + $30.",
    "The total amount from Luke's mother is $120.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total amount of money Luke's father gave him.",
    "Luke's father gave him four $50 bills.",
    "Four $50 bills are worth 4 x $50 = $200.",
    "Luke's father also gave him one $20 bill.",
    "One $20 bill is worth $20.",
    "Furthermore, Luke's father gave him one $10 bill.",
    "One $10 bill is worth $10.",
    "Now, I add up all the money from Luke\u2019s father: $200 + $20 + $10.",
    "The total amount from Luke's father is $230.",
    "Finally, I add together the amounts from Luke's mother and father to find the total school fee.",
    "The total amount of money given by both parents is $120 + $230.",
    "The sum is $350."
