  "query": "Jane is looking at a tree. At the same time, the tree and Jane are casting shadows - the tree of 10 meters and Jane of 0.5 meters. Jane is 1.5 meters tall. How tall is the tree?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I acknowledge that the problem involves similar triangles formed by Jane, her shadow, the tree, and its shadow.",
    "I know that the height of the object and the length of its shadow are proportional because the sun's rays are parallel.",
    "I set up a proportion using the known heights and shadow lengths. Specifically, I set up the ratio of Jane's height to her shadow length, which is 1.5 meters to 0.5 meters.",
    "Similarly, I set up the ratio for the tree's height to its shadow length, which is \\( h \\) (the unknown height of the tree) to 10 meters.",
    "Now I equate these two ratios: \\(\\frac{1.5}{0.5} = \\frac{h}{10}\\).",
    "Simplifying the left side ratio, I divide 1.5 by 0.5, which results in 3.",
    "I now have the equation \\(3 = \\frac{h}{10}\\).",
    "I solve for \\( h \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10, yielding \\( h = 30\\).\n\n<check>\nI double-check each calculation and reasoning step to ensure there are no mistakes.\n</check>"
