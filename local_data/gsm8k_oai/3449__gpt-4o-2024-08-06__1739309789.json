  "query": "An apple tree can fill 20 baskets. Each basket can be filled with 15 apples. How many apples can you get from 10 trees?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that one apple tree can fill 20 baskets.",
    "Each basket contains 15 apples.",
    "To find out how many apples one tree can produce, I multiply the number of baskets one tree can fill by the number of apples in each basket.",
    "I calculate that as 20 baskets * 15 apples per basket = 300 apples per tree.",
    "Now, I want to find out how many apples can be produced by 10 trees.",
    "I need to multiply the number of apples one tree can produce by the number of trees.",
    "So, I calculate 300 apples per tree * 10 trees.",
    "300 * 10 gives me 3000."
  ],
  "solution": "3000"
