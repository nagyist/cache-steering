  "query": "Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Katrina has. We know Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and Mabel has 85 marbles.",
    "So, Mabel's marbles are calculated by: Mabel's marbles = 5 * Katrina's marbles.",
    "We set up the equation: 85 = 5 * Katrina's marbles.",
    "To solve for Katrina's marbles, we divide both sides of the equation by 5, giving us Katrina's marbles = 85 / 5.",
    "Calculating that gives us Katrina's marbles = 17.",
    "Next, let's determine how many marbles Amanda has. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina.",
    "If Amanda had twice as many as Katrina, she would have 2 * 17 = 34 marbles.",
    "But Amanda needs 12 more marbles to reach twice as many as Katrina. So Amanda actually has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.",
    "Finally, we need to find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda.",
    "Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 22 marbles.",
    "The difference in the number of marbles is 85 - 22.",
    "Calculating that gives us 63."
