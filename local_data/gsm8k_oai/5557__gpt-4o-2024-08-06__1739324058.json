  "query": "Marcus has three times as many cheese crackers as Mona.  Nicholas has 6 more crackers than Mona.  If Marcus has 27 crackers, how many crackers does Nicholas have?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcus has three times as many cheese crackers as Mona.",
    "Let the number of crackers that Mona has be M.",
    "According to the problem, Marcus has three times what Mona has: 3 * M.",
    "We are given that Marcus has 27 crackers.",
    "Therefore, 3 * M = 27.",
    "To find M, we divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "M = 27 / 3.",
    "M = 9.",
    "Now we know that Mona has 9 crackers.",
    "Nicholas has 6 more crackers than Mona.",
    "Since Mona has 9 crackers, Nicholas has 9 + 6 crackers.",
    "9 + 6 = 15."

  "solution": "15"
