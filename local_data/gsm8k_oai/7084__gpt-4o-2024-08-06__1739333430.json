  "query": "Sally is selling boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fund-raiser. If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she'll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, on Sunday she sells 50% more boxes than on Saturday.",
    "50% more than Saturday's boxes would mean she sells \\( x + 0.5x \\) boxes on Sunday.",
    "This simplifies to \\( 1.5x \\) boxes on Sunday.",
    "The total number of boxes sold on both days is given as 150.",
    "We can express this as an equation: \\( x + 1.5x = 150 \\).",
    "Combine the terms on the left-hand side: \\( 2.5x = 150 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 2.5.",
    "So, \\( x = \\frac{150}{2.5} \\).",
    "Divide 150 by 2.5: \\( x = 60 \\)."

  "solution": "60"
