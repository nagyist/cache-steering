    "First, I'll calculate the total cost of the items Michael wants to buy.",
    "The cost of the cake is $20.",
    "The cost of the bouquet is $36.",
    "The cost of the balloons is $5.",
    "Now, I add up these costs: $20 + $36 + $5.",
    "$20 + $36 equals $56.",
    "$56 + $5 equals $61.",
    "The total cost for all the items is $61.",
    "Michael currently has $50.",
    "To find out how much more money he needs, I subtract his current amount from the total cost.",
    "$61 - $50 equals $11.",
    "Michael needs $11 more to buy all the items."
