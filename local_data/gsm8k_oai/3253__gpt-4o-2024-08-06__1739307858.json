  "query": "At the feline sanctuary, there were 12 lions, 14 tigers, and several cougars.  If there were half as many cougars as lions and tigers combined, then what was the total number of big cats at the feline sanctuary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate how many lions and tigers are at the sanctuary.",
    "There are 12 lions and 14 tigers.",
    "Adding the lions and tigers together gives 12 + 14.",
    "12 + 14 equals 26.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of cougars.",
    "According to the problem, there are half as many cougars as the total number of lions and tigers.",
    "Half of 26 is calculated as 26 / 2.",
    "26 / 2 equals 13. So, there are 13 cougars.",
    "Now, I will find the total number of big cats at the sanctuary by adding the numbers of lions, tigers, and cougars.",
    "The total number of big cats is 12 (lions) + 14 (tigers) + 13 (cougars).",
    "12 + 14 equals 26, and 26 + 13 equals 39."

  "solution": "39"
