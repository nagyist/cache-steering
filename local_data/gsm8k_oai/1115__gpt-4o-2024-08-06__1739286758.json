  "query": "8 jumbo scallops weigh one pound and cost $24.00 a pound.  Nate is pairing 2 scallops with a corn bisque as a light summer dinner.  He\u2019s cooking for 8 people.  How much will the scallops cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of scallops Nate must use for 8 people.",
    "Each person gets 2 scallops.",
    "Since there are 8 people, I multiply 8 by 2 to find the total number of scallops needed: 8 * 2 = 16 scallops.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much 16 scallops weigh in pounds.",
    "I know that 8 jumbo scallops weigh one pound.",
    "Therefore, 16 scallops will weigh 16 / 8 = 2 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much the scallops will cost per pound.",
    "The cost is $24.00 per pound.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total cost by multiplying the weight in pounds by the cost per pound: 2 pounds * $24.00/pound = $48.00."

  "solution": "48"
