  "query": "Leila and Mohamed decided to donate their old toys to a children\u2019s home. Leila gave 2 bags with 25 toys in each bag. Mohamed\u2019s donation was 3 bags with 19 toys in each bag. How many more toys did Mohamed donate?",
  "steps": [
    "To find how many toys Leila donated, I need to multiply the number of bags by the number of toys in each bag.",
    "Leila donated 2 bags, and each bag contains 25 toys.",
    "So, I calculate Leila's total donation as 2 bags * 25 toys/bag = 50 toys.",
    "Now, to find how many toys Mohamed donated, I also need to multiply the number of bags by the number of toys in each bag.",
    "Mohamed donated 3 bags, and each bag contains 19 toys.",
    "I calculate Mohamed's total donation as 3 bags * 19 toys/bag = 57 toys.",
    "Now, I find the difference between the number of toys Mohamed donated and the number of toys Leila donated.",
    "I subtract Leila's total from Mohamed's total: 57 toys - 50 toys = 7 toys."
