  "query": "Layla is training for a bicycle race. She rode her bicycle slowly to the high school, rode four miles around the running track at her faster, race pace, and then rode back home, slowly, on the same route. If her total mileage was 10 miles, how far is it, in miles, from Layla's house to the high school?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the distance from Layla's house to the high school.",
    "Let the distance from Layla's house to the high school be \\( x \\) miles.",
    "Layla rode from her house to the high school, then around the track for 4 miles, then back home.",
    "The total distance she rode is 10 miles.",
    "The distance to the high school and back home forms part of the total mileage.",
    "She rode \\( x \\) miles to the high school and \\( x \\) miles back home.",
    "This total distance is \\( x + x = 2x \\) miles.",
    "Additionally, she rode 4 miles around the track.",
    "So, the equation for the total distance is \\( 2x + 4 = 10 \\).",
    "I need to solve this equation for \\( x \\).",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides: \\( 2x = 6 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2: \\( x = 3 \\).",
    "The distance from Layla's house to the high school is 3 miles."
