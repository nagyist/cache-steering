  "query": "It is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the amount of added sugar Mark consumed from the soft drink.",
    "The soft drink had a total of 2500 calories.",
    "5% of these calories are from added sugar.",
    "To find the calories from added sugar in the soft drink, I calculate 5% of 2500.",
    "5% of 2500 is (5/100) * 2500 = 125 calories.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much added sugar he can consume without exceeding the recommended intake.",
    "The recommended intake is a maximum of 150 calories of added sugar per day.",
    "Mark exceeded the recommended intake by 100%.",
    "If the recommended intake is 150 calories, an excess of 100% means consuming 150 more calories, totaling 300 calories.",
    "Since he consumed 125 calories from the soft drink, I need to calculate how many additional calories he consumed to reach the total of 300 calories.",
    "So the additional calories needed to be 300 - 125 = 175 calories from added sugar.",
    "Each bar of candy contains 25 calories of added sugar.",
    "I need to find out how many bars of candy would give him the additional 175 calories.",
    "To find the number of bars, I divide the additional calories by calories per bar: 175 / 25 = 7 bars."
