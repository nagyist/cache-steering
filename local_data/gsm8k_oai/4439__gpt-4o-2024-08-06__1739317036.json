  "query": "Corna wants to buy a shirt. The store buys the shirt for $20, but charges 30% for profit. However, the shirt is on sale for 50% off the selling price. What is the price now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the store's selling price of the shirt before any discounts. The store buys the shirt for $20.",
    "The store adds a 30% profit on the cost. To find the selling price, we calculate 30% of $20.",
    "30% of $20 is calculated as 0.30 * $20 = $6.",
    "Add the $6 profit to the cost price of $20 to get the selling price. So, $20 + $6 = $26.",
    "Now, apply the 50% discount on the selling price of $26.",
    "50% off of $26 is calculated as 0.50 * $26 = $13.",
    "Subtract the discount from the selling price. So, $26 - $13 = $13."

  "solution": "13"
