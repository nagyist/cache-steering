  "query": "Before work, Hayden spends 5 minutes ironing his button-up shirt and 3 minutes ironing his pants.  He does this 5 days a week.  How many minutes does he iron over 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many minutes Hayden spends ironing one day.",
    "Hayden spends 5 minutes ironing his shirt.",
    "Hayden spends 3 minutes ironing his pants.",
    "Therefore, he spends 5 + 3 = 8 minutes ironing each day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many minutes he irons in one week.",
    "Since he irons 5 days a week, I multiply 8 minutes per day by 5 days.",
    "8 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 40 minutes/week.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many minutes he irons over 4 weeks.",
    "Multiply the weekly ironing time by 4 weeks: 40 minutes/week * 4 weeks.",
    "40 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 160 minutes."

  "solution": "160"
