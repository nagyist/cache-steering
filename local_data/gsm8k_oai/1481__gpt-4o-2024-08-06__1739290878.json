  "query": "Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day.  On the days he plays video games he plays for half as long as he watches TV.  If he plays video games 3 days a week how long does he spend watching TV and playing video games?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many hours Mike spends watching TV in one week. He watches TV for 4 hours every day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so I multiply 4 hours by 7 days to find the total hours of TV watching in a week.",
    "4 hours/day * 7 days = 28 hours spent watching TV in a week.",
    "Next, I find out how many hours he spends playing video games in a week.",
    "Mike plays video games for half as long as he watches TV on the days he plays. On these days, he plays for 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours.",
    "He plays video games 3 days a week, so I multiply the 2 hours by 3 days.",
    "2 hours/day * 3 days = 6 hours spent playing video games in a week.",
    "Finally, I add the total hours spent watching TV and playing video games to find the overall time spent on both activities.",
    "28 hours (TV) + 6 hours (video games) = 34 hours spent on both activities in a week."
