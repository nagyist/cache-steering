  "query": "Flora has been experiencing frequent fractures. Dr. Juan has asked her to strengthen her bones by drinking 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks. Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough, but her brother says she'll still need to drink more. To fulfill Dr. Juan\u2019s requirement, how many more gallons must Flora drink daily?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many gallons Flora needs to drink per day to consume 105 gallons in 3 weeks.",
    "Three weeks is equal to 21 days.",
    "I will divide the total number of gallons required (105 gallons) by the total number of days (21 days).",
    "105 gallons \u00f7 21 days = 5 gallons per day.",
    "Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons daily will be enough.",
    "To see if that's enough, I need to check the difference between what she thinks (3 gallons) and what is required (5 gallons).",
    "5 gallons (required) - 3 gallons (what Flora thinks) = 2 more gallons."

  "solution": "2"
