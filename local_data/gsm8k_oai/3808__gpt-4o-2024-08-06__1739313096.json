  "query": "Mary just held tryouts for the high school band. 80% of the 20 flutes got in, half the 30 clarinets got in, 1/3 of the 60 trumpets got in, and 1/10th of the 20 pianists got in. How many people are in the band total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flutes got in.",
    "There are 20 flutes, and 80% of them got in.",
    "80% of 20 is calculated by 0.80 * 20.",
    "0.80 * 20 equals 16.",
    "Therefore, 16 flutes got in.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many clarinets got in.",
    "There are 30 clarinets, and half of them got in.",
    "Half of 30 is calculated by 0.5 * 30.",
    "0.5 * 30 equals 15.",
    "Therefore, 15 clarinets got in.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many trumpets got in.",
    "There are 60 trumpets, and 1/3 of them got in.",
    "1/3 of 60 is calculated by 60 / 3.",
    "60 divided by 3 equals 20.",
    "Therefore, 20 trumpets got in.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pianists got in.",
    "There are 20 pianists, and 1/10th of them got in.",
    "1/10th of 20 is calculated by 20 / 10.",
    "20 divided by 10 equals 2.",
    "Therefore, 2 pianists got in.",
    "Finally, I need to add up all the musicians who got in to find the total in the band.",
    "I have 16 flutes, 15 clarinets, 20 trumpets, and 2 pianists.",
    "16 + 15 + 20 + 2 equals 53."
