  "query": "Jaron wants to raise enough money selling candy bars to win the Nintendo Switch prize. He needs 2000 points for the Nintendo Switch. He has already sold 8 chocolate bunnies that are worth 100 points each. Each Snickers bar he sells earns 25 points. How many Snickers bars does he need to sell the win the Nintendo Switch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many points Jaron has already earned from selling chocolate bunnies.",
    "Each chocolate bunny is worth 100 points, and he sold 8 of them.",
    "So, the total points from chocolate bunnies is 8 x 100 = 800 points.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many points Jaron still needs to reach 2000 points.",
    "Jaron needs a total of 2000 points, and he already has 800 points.",
    "The points he still needs are 2000 - 800 = 1200 points.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many Snickers bars he needs to sell to earn the remaining points.",
    "Each Snickers bar earns 25 points.",
    "To find out how many Snickers bars are needed, divide the remaining points needed by the points per Snickers bar.",
    "So, 1200 points / 25 points per Snickers bar = 48 Snickers bars."
