  "query": "Joan has 180 socks. Two thirds of the socks are white, and the rest of the socks are blue. How many blue socks does Joan have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many socks are white since two-thirds of the socks are white.",
    "Joan has 180 socks in total.",
    "To find the number of white socks, I'll calculate two-thirds of 180.",
    "Two-thirds of 180 means multiplying 180 by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).",
    "180 multiplied by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) equals 120.",
    "This means Joan has 120 white socks.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many socks are blue.",
    "The total number of socks is 180 and 120 of these are white.",
    "To find the number of blue socks, I subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks.",
    "180 minus 120 equals 60.",
    "Therefore, Joan has 60 blue socks."

  "solution": "60"
