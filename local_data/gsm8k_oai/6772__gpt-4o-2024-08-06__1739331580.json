  "query": "A group of friends walked into Juju\u2019s Juice Bar ordered a glass of fruit juice each. They spent a total of $94. Some of them ordered mango juice, which sells for $5 a glass, while others asked for pineapple juice, at $6 a glass. If $54 was spent on pineapple juice, how many people were in the group?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much was spent on mango juice.",
    "The total amount spent by the group was $94.",
    "Out of this, $54 was spent on pineapple juice.",
    "I subtract the amount spent on pineapple juice from the total to find the amount spent on mango juice: $94 - $54 = $40.",
    "Now I calculate the number of people who ordered pineapple juice.",
    "Each glass of pineapple juice costs $6.",
    "I divide the total amount spent on pineapple juice by the price per glass: $54 / $6 = 9.",
    "This means 9 people ordered pineapple juice.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of people who ordered mango juice.",
    "Each glass of mango juice costs $5.",
    "I divide the total amount spent on mango juice by the price per glass: $40 / $5 = 8.",
    "This means 8 people ordered mango juice.",
    "To find the total number of people in the group, I add the people who ordered mango juice to those who ordered pineapple juice: 9 + 8 = 17."

  "solution": "17"
