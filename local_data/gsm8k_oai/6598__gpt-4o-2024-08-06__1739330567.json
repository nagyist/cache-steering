  "query": "Ariel is collecting fish. She has 45 fish. 2/3 are male. How many female fish does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "Ariel has a total of 45 fish.",
    "We know that 2/3 of her fish are male.",
    "To find out how many fish are male, calculate 2/3 of 45.",
    "2/3 of 45 fish = (2/3) * 45 = 30 male fish.",
    "Subtracting the number of male fish from the total number gives us the number of female fish.",
    "Total fish (45) - Male fish (30) = Female fish.",
    "45 - 30 = 15.",
    "Thus, Ariel has 15 female fish."

  "solution": "15"
