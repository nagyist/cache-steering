  "query": "A blind cave scorpion survives by catching millipedes. It needs to eat lots of millipedes to survive: a total of 800 body segments every day. If it's already eaten one millipede with 60 segments and 2 millipedes that are twice as long, how many 50-segment millipedes does it need to eat to reach its daily total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of millipede segments the scorpion has already eaten.",
    "The scorpion has eaten one millipede that has 60 segments. That's 60 segments.",
    "It has also eaten 2 millipedes that are twice as long as the first. So, each of these millipedes has 60 * 2 = 120 segments.",
    "The total from these 2 millipedes is 2 * 120 = 240 segments.",
    "Now, I'll add the segments of the first millipede to the total from the 2 larger millipedes: 60 + 240 = 300 segments.",
    "The scorpion needs a total of 800 segments to satisfy its daily requirement.",
    "Currently, it has consumed 300 segments. I need to calculate the remaining number of segments it needs: 800 - 300 = 500 segments.",
    "I need to determine how many more millipedes with 50 segments each are required to reach the remaining 500 segments.",
    "If each remaining millipede has 50 segments, then the number of these millipedes needed is 500 \u00f7 50 = 10 millipedes."
