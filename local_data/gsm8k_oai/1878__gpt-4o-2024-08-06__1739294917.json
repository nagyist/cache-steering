    "Emma is 7 years old now.",
    "Her sister is 9 years older than Emma.",
    "So, her sister is currently 7 + 9 = 16 years old.",
    "We need to find out how many years from now her sister will be 56 years old.",
    "To calculate this, subtract the sister's current age from 56: 56 - 16 = 40.",
    "This means it will be 40 years from now when her sister is 56.",
    "Emma's current age is 7.",
    "In 40 years, Emma will be 7 + 40 = 47 years old."
