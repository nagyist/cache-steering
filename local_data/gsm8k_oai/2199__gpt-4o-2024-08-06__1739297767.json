  "query": "At a university there are 1800 students. 30% of all the students are from other countries. Starting next semester, 200 new foreign students will begin studying at this University. How many foreign students will then study at the University if all other students continue to study?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the current number of foreign students at the university.",
    "There are a total of 1800 students.",
    "30% of these 1800 students are from other countries.",
    "To find out how many students that is, I need to calculate 30% of 1800.",
    "30% of 1800 is (30/100) * 1800.",
    "(30/100) * 1800 = 0.3 * 1800.",
    "0.3 * 1800 equals 540.",
    "So, currently, there are 540 foreign students at the university.",
    "Next, I need to add the 200 new foreign students who will begin studying at the university.",
    "Adding 200 to the current number of foreign students (540) gives 540 + 200.",
    "540 + 200 equals 740.",
    "So, once the new students arrive, there will be 740 foreign students at the university."

  "solution": "740"
