  "query": "Jonny climbed 1269 stairs last week. Julia climbed 7 less than one-third of that amount. How many stairs did Julia and Jonny climb together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many stairs one-third of the amount Jonny climbed is.",
    "Jonny climbed 1269 stairs. To find one-third of that, I divide 1269 by 3.",
    "1269 divided by 3 equals 423. So, one-third of the stairs Jonny climbed is 423.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many stairs Julia climbed. It's mentioned that she climbed 7 less than one-third of the stairs Jonny climbed.",
    "Julia's number of stairs is 423 (one-third of Jonny's) minus 7.",
    "423 minus 7 equals 416. Therefore, Julia climbed 416 stairs.",
    "To find the total number of stairs Jonny and Julia climbed together, I add the stairs Jonny climbed to the stairs Julia climbed.",
    "Jonny climbed 1269 stairs and Julia climbed 416 stairs.",
    "1269 plus 416 equals 1685."

  "solution": "1685"
