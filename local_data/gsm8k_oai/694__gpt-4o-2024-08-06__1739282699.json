  "query": "If one fourth of the engines are defective, and there are 5 batches of 80 engines each. How many engines are not defective?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of engines.",
    "There are 5 batches of engines.",
    "Each batch contains 80 engines.",
    "To find the total number of engines, I multiply the number of batches by the number of engines per batch: 5 * 80.",
    "5 * 80 equals 400.",
    "Now, I have a total of 400 engines.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many engines are defective.",
    "I know that one fourth of the engines are defective.",
    "To find one fourth of 400, I divide 400 by 4.",
    "400 divided by 4 equals 100.",
    "Therefore, there are 100 defective engines.",
    "To find the number of engines that are not defective, I subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines: 400 - 100.",
    "400 - 100 equals 300.",
    "So, there are 300 engines that are not defective."

  "solution": "300"
