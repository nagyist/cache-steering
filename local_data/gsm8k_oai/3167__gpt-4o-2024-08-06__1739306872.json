  "query": "A soccer ball takes twenty minutes to inflate. Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. Calculate the total time in minutes they took to inflate all the soccer balls.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many balls Ermias inflates.",
    "Ermias inflates 5 more balls than Alexia.",
    "Alexia inflates 20 balls.",
    "Therefore, Ermias inflates 20 + 5 = 25 balls.",
    "Next, I will find the total number of balls both of them inflate together.",
    "Alexia inflates 20 balls and Ermias inflates 25 balls.",
    "So, the total number of balls inflated is 20 + 25 = 45 balls.",
    "Each ball takes 20 minutes to inflate.",
    "To get the total time, I multiply the total number of balls (45) by the time it takes to inflate one ball (20 minutes).",
    "45 balls \u00d7 20 minutes/ball = 900 minutes."
  ],
  "solution": "900"
