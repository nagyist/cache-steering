  "query": "Mary is trying to get Zoom set up for the first time. She spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version, only to realize she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download. During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time and the video glitched once for 6 minutes. She spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches. How much time did Mary spend downloading Zoom and talking total?",
  "steps": [
    "Mary spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version.",
    "Then, she realized she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download as the Mac version.",
    "So, the Windows version took 10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes to download.",
    "The total time spent downloading is 10 minutes (Mac) + 30 minutes (Windows) = 40 minutes.",
    "During her call, the audio glitched for 4 minutes each time, and it happened twice.",
    "So, the total audio glitch time is 4 minutes * 2 = 8 minutes.",
    "The video glitched once for 6 minutes.",
    "The total glitch time (audio + video) is 8 minutes (audio) + 6 minutes (video) = 14 minutes.",
    "Mary spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches.",
    "If the time with glitches is 14 minutes, then the time without glitches is 14 minutes * 2 = 28 minutes.",
    "The total talking time (with and without glitches) is 14 minutes (with glitches) + 28 minutes (without glitches) = 42 minutes.",
    "The total time spent downloading and talking is 40 minutes (downloading) + 42 minutes (talking) = 82 minutes."
