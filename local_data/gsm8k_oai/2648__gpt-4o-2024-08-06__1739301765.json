  "query": "The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the ratio of the ages given in the problem, which is 4:3:7 for Halima, Beckham, and Michelle.",
    "Next, I add up the parts of the ratio to find the total number of parts, which is 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts in total.",
    "The total age of the three siblings is given as 126 years. To find the value of one part, I need to divide the total age by the total number of parts: \\( 126 \\div 14 = 9 \\).",
    "Now, I calculate the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective parts by the value of one part.",
    "For Halima, the age is \\( 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\) years.",
    "For Beckham, the age is \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\) years.",
    "For Michelle, the age is \\( 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\) years.",
    "The problem asks for the age difference between Halima and Beckham. Therefore, I subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age: \\( 36 - 27 = 9 \\)."
