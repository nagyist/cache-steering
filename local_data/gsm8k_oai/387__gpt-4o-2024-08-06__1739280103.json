  "query": "Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying. Jacob can only manage half of that number of candies, and Lana can only do three fewer than Jacob. They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried. If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many candies Jacob can eat. Since he can eat half of what Nellie can, and Nellie eats 12, Jacob can eat 12 / 2 = 6 candies.",
    "Next, I calculate how many candies Lana can eat. She eats three fewer candies than Jacob, which is 6 - 3 = 3 candies.",
    "Now, I find out how many candies all of them eat together. Nellie eats 12 candies, Jacob eats 6, and Lana eats 3. Together, they eat 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 candies.",
    "I subtract the total number of candies eaten from the original number of candies in the bucket to find out how many are left. There were 30 candies initially, so 30 - 21 = 9 candies remain.",
    "They divide the remaining candies equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, I calculate how many candies each one gets by dividing the remaining candies by 3. So, 9 / 3 = 3 candies each."

  "solution": "3"
