  "query": "Lucille is wondering who has the tallest house between her and her neighbors. His family's house is 80 feet tall. One neighbor's house is 70 feet tall. Another neighbor's house is 99 feet tall. How much shorter is Lucille's house than the average height?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the average height of the houses.",
    "I will add the height of all the houses: 80 feet (Lucille's), 70 feet (first neighbor's), and 99 feet (second neighbor's).",
    "80 + 70 + 99 equals 249 feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate the average height by dividing the total height by the number of houses.",
    "There are 3 houses, so divide 249 by 3.",
    "249 divided by 3 equals 83 feet.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much shorter Lucille's house is than this average.",
    "The average height is 83 feet, and Lucille's house is 80 feet tall.",
    "Subtract Lucille's house height from the average height: 83 - 80.",
    "83 - 80 equals 3."

  "solution": "3"
