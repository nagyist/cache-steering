    "Ali makes circles using 8 boxes for each circle.",
    "Ali makes 5 circles.",
    "To find out how many boxes Ali uses, I multiply the number of circles Ali makes (5) by the number of boxes per circle (8).",
    "5 circles * 8 boxes per circle = 40 boxes used by Ali.",
    "They had 80 boxes to begin with.",
    "I subtract the number of boxes Ali used from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes Ernie has left.",
    "80 total boxes - 40 boxes used by Ali = 40 boxes left for Ernie.",
