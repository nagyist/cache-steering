  "query": "There were 50 fish in a pond and 3 times as many tadpoles. If Curtis catches 7 fish and half the tadpoles develop into frogs, how many more tadpoles than fish are there in the pond now?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining the initial number of tadpoles.",
    "There are 50 fish, and there are 3 times as many tadpoles as fish.",
    "So, 3 times 50 is 150. There are initially 150 tadpoles in the pond.",
    "Curtis catches 7 fish.",
    "Subtract 7 from the initial number of fish (50) to get the new total of fish.",
    "50 - 7 = 43. There are now 43 fish in the pond.",
    "Half of the tadpoles develop into frogs.",
    "Calculate half of 150.",
    "150 / 2 = 75. So, 75 tadpoles develop into frogs.",
    "Subtract these 75 from the initial number of tadpoles (150) to find how many tadpoles remain.",
    "150 - 75 = 75. There are now 75 tadpoles remaining in the pond.",
    "Determine the difference between the number of tadpoles and fish currently in the pond.",
    "There are 75 tadpoles and 43 fish.",
    "Subtract 43 from 75 to find the difference.",
    "75 - 43 = 32. There are 32 more tadpoles than fish in the pond now."
