  "query": "Katie has 13 pink marbles. She has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. How many marbles does Katie have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Katie has 13 pink marbles.",
    "Katie has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles.",
    "To find the number of orange marbles, I subtract 9 from the number of pink marbles: 13 - 9 = 4.",
    "Katie has 4 orange marbles.",
    "Katie has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles.",
    "To find the number of purple marbles, I multiply the number of orange marbles by 4: 4 * 4 = 16.",
    "Katie has 16 purple marbles.",
    "Now, I add up all the marbles: pink, orange, and purple.",
    "The total number of marbles is: 13 (pink) + 4 (orange) + 16 (purple) = 33."
