  "query": "Trey is raising money for a new bike that costs $112. He plans to spend the next two weeks selling bracelets for $1 each. On average, how many bracelets does he need to sell each day?",
  "steps": [
    "Trey needs to raise a total of $112.",
    "He plans to sell bracelets at $1 each, so each bracelet sold earns him $1.",
    "To earn $112, Trey needs to sell 112 bracelets in total.",
    "He has 2 weeks to sell these bracelets.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks will have 7 * 2 = 14 days.",
    "Trey needs to sell an average number of bracelets per day over these 14 days.",
    "To find the average number of bracelets needed per day, divide the total number of bracelets (112) by the total number of days (14).",
    "112 \u00f7 14 = 8."
