  "query": "Rudy runs 5 miles at a rate of 10 minutes per mile. Later he runs 4 miles at a rate of 9.5 minutes per mile. What is the total length of time that Rudy runs?",
  "steps": [
    "Rudy runs 5 miles at a pace of 10 minutes per mile.",
    "To find the time for the first part, multiply the distance by the pace: 5 miles * 10 minutes/mile.",
    "5 * 10 equals 50 minutes.",
    "Next, Rudy runs 4 miles at a pace of 9.5 minutes per mile.",
    "To find the time for the second part, multiply the distance by the pace: 4 miles * 9.5 minutes/mile.",
    "4 * 9.5 equals 38 minutes.",
    "Now, add the two times to get the total running time: 50 minutes + 38 minutes.",
    "50 + 38 equals 88 minutes."
  ],
  "solution": "88"
