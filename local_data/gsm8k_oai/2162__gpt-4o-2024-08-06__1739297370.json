  "query": "On a weekend road trip, the Jensen family drove 210 miles on highways, where their car gets 35 miles for each gallon of gas and 54 miles on city streets where their car gets 18 miles for each gallon. How many gallons of gas did they use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many gallons of gas were used on the highway.",
    "The Jensen family drove 210 miles on highways.",
    "Their car gets 35 miles per gallon on highways.",
    "To find the gallons used on the highway, divide 210 by 35.",
    "210 divided by 35 equals 6.",
    "So, they used 6 gallons of gas on the highway.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many gallons of gas were used on city streets.",
    "The Jensen family drove 54 miles on city streets.",
    "Their car gets 18 miles per gallon on city streets.",
    "To find the gallons used on city streets, divide 54 by 18.",
    "54 divided by 18 equals 3.",
    "So, they used 3 gallons of gas on city streets.",
    "Finally, add the gallons used on highways and city streets to find the total gallons used.",
    "6 gallons (highway) plus 3 gallons (city streets) equals 9 gallons."

  "solution": "9"
