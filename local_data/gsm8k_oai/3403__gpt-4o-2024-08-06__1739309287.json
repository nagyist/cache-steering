  "query": "Diane is twice as old as her brother, Will. If Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, what will the sum of their ages be in 5 years?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Will's current age.",
    "Will was 4 years old 3 years ago.",
    "Since he was 4 years old 3 years ago, his current age is 4 + 3 = 7 years old.",
    "Diane is twice as old as Will.",
    "Therefore, Diane's current age is 2 * 7 = 14 years old.",
    "Now, I need to determine their ages in 5 years.",
    "Will's age in 5 years will be 7 + 5 = 12 years old.",
    "Diane's age in 5 years will be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.",
    "Finally, I find the sum of their ages in 5 years.",
    "The sum of their ages in 5 years is 12 + 19 = 31."
