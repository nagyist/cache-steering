  "query": "A carton contains 12 boxes. If each box has 10 packs of cheese cookies, what's the price of a pack of cheese cookies if a dozen cartons cost $1440?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many packs of cheese cookies there are in one carton.",
    "There are 12 boxes in one carton, and each box contains 10 packs of cheese cookies.",
    "So, in one carton, there are 12 boxes * 10 packs per box = 120 packs of cheese cookies.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many packs there are in a dozen (12) cartons.",
    "A dozen cartons would have 12 cartons * 120 packs per carton = 1440 packs of cheese cookies.",
    "The price for a dozen cartons is $1440.",
    "To find the price of one pack of cheese cookies, I divide the total cost by the total number of packs.",
    "So, $1440 / 1440 packs = $1 per pack."
