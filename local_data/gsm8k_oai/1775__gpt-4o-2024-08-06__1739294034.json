  "query": "One student on a field trip counted 12 squirrels. Another counted a third more squirrels than the first student. How many squirrels did both students count combined?",
  "steps": [
    "The first student counted 12 squirrels.",
    "The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student.",
    "To find out how many squirrels the second student counted, calculate one-third of 12.",
    "One-third of 12 is 12 divided by 3, which is 4.",
    "Add the extra 4 squirrels to the 12 squirrels counted by the first student to find the number counted by the second student.",
    "The second student counted 12 + 4 = 16 squirrels.",
    "To find the total number of squirrels counted by both students, add the number counted by the first student and the number counted by the second student.",
    "Add 12 (first student) and 16 (second student).",
    "12 + 16 equals 28."
