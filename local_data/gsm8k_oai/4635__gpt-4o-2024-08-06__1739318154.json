  "query": "Johnny buys 15 packs of colored pencils for his class. Each pack has a red, yellow, and green pencil inside. When he gets home he notices that 3 of the packs have two extra red pencils inside. How many red colored pencils did Johnny buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Johnny initially buys 15 packs of colored pencils.",
    "Each pack contains one red pencil.",
    "Without considering any extras, Johnny would have 15 red pencils from the 15 packs.",
    "However, he notices 3 of the packs have two extra red pencils inside.",
    "This means each of these 3 packs has 1 (the normal red pencil) + 2 (extra red pencils) = 3 red pencils each.",
    "First, calculate the total number of red pencils in these 3 special packs.",
    "3 packs * 3 red pencils per pack = 9 red pencils",
    "For the other 12 packs (since 15 - 3 = 12), each contains only 1 red pencil.",
    "12 packs * 1 red pencil per pack = 12 red pencils",
    "Finally, add the red pencils from the special packs and the normal packs together.",
    "9 red pencils (from special packs) + 12 red pencils (from normal packs) = 21 red pencils"
  ],
  "solution": "21"
