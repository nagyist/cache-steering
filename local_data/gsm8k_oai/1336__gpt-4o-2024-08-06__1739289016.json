  "query": "It takes Jason 30 minutes to cut 1 lawn in his neighborhood.  If he cuts 8 yards on both Saturday and Sunday, how many hours does he spend cutting grass?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's begin by determining how many lawns Jason cuts in total over the weekend. \nHe cuts 8 lawns on Saturday and 8 lawns on Sunday.",
    "Add the number of lawns cut on Saturday and Sunday: 8 lawns on Saturday + 8 lawns on Sunday = 16 lawns in total.",
    "Next, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes to cut 16 lawns.\nEach lawn takes 30 minutes to cut.",
    "Multiply the number of lawns by the time it takes to cut each one: 16 lawns \u00d7 30 minutes per lawn = 480 minutes.",
    "Now, we need to convert the total number of minutes into hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "Divide the total minutes by the number of minutes in an hour: 480 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 8 hours."

  "solution": "8"
