  "query": "Tom wants to visit Barbados.  He needs to get 10 different vaccines to go and a doctor's visit.  They each cost $45 and the doctor's visit costs $250 but insurance will cover 80% of these medical bills.  The trip itself cost $1200.  How much will he have to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the vaccines. He needs 10 different vaccines.",
    "Each vaccine costs $45. So, the total cost for the vaccines will be 10 times $45.",
    "10 x $45 is $450.",
    "Now, I need to add the cost of the doctor's visit, which is $250.",
    "The total cost before insurance for the vaccines and the doctor's visit is $450 + $250.",
    "$450 + $250 is $700.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the amount insurance will cover. Insurance covers 80% of the medical bills.",
    "80% of $700 is (0.80 x $700).",
    "0.80 x $700 is $560.",
    "This means insurance covers $560, so Tom has to pay the remaining amount of the medical bills.",
    "The remaining amount that Tom has to pay is $700 - $560.",
    "$700 - $560 is $140.",
    "Now, I need to add the cost of the trip, which is $1200, to find the total amount Tom has to pay.",
    "Tom pays $140 for the medical costs and $1200 for the trip.",
    "The total amount Tom has to pay is $140 + $1200.",
    "$140 + $1200 is $1340."
