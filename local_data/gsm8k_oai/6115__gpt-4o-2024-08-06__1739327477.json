  "query": "Pauly is making ice cubes. He needs 10 pounds of cubes. He knows that 2 ounces of water make 1 cube and each cube weighs 1/16th of a pound. It takes him 1 hour to make 10 cubes. Every hour his ice maker run costs $1.50. Every ounce of water costs $0.10. How much will it cost to make all the ice?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cubes are needed to make 10 pounds of ice.",
    "Each cube weighs 1/16th of a pound.",
    "If 1 cube weighs 1/16th of a pound, then 10 pounds divided by 1/16 gives the total number of cubes needed.",
    "10 divided by (1/16) is equal to 10 times 16, which is 160 cubes needed.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the amount of water needed for 160 cubes.",
    "Each cube requires 2 ounces of water.",
    "160 cubes times 2 ounces per cube is 320 ounces of water needed.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost of the water. Each ounce costs $0.10.",
    "320 ounces times $0.10 per ounce equals $32 for the water.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the time it will take to produce 160 cubes.",
    "It takes 1 hour to make 10 cubes.",
    "160 cubes divided by 10 cubes per hour equals 16 hours needed.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost of running the ice maker for 16 hours.",
    "Each hour of operation costs $1.50.",
    "16 hours times $1.50 per hour equals $24 for running the ice maker.",
    "Finally, I add the cost of the water and the cost of running the ice maker.",
    "$32 (water cost) plus $24 (ice maker cost) equals $56 total cost."

  "solution": "56"
