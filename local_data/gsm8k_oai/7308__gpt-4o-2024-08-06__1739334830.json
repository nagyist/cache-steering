  "query": "Grant has four times as many vacations as Kelvin has classes. If Kelvin has 90 classes, how many vacations and classes do Grant and Kelvin have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many classes Kelvin has.",
    "Kelvin has 90 classes.",
    "Realize that Grant has four times as many vacations as Kelvin has classes.",
    "Calculate the number of vacations Grant has by multiplying the number of Kelvin's classes by four.",
    "Grant has 4 times 90 vacations, which equals 360 vacations.",
    "Now, add the number of Kelvin's classes to the number of Grant's vacations to find how many vacations and classes they have altogether.",
    "Kelvin's 90 classes plus Grant's 360 vacations equals 450 total vacations and classes."

  "solution": "450"
