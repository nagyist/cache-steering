  "query": "In a Volleyball competition, Lizzie was able to score 4 points. Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score and Aimee's score is twice the score of Lizzie and Nathalie combined. The rest of the points were made by their teammates. If the whole team was able to score 50 points, how many points did their teammates make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Lizzie's score, which is given as 4 points.",
    "Next, I calculate Nathalie's score, which is 3 more than Lizzie's score. Therefore, Nathalie scored 4 + 3 = 7 points.",
    "Now, I must find the combined score of Lizzie and Nathalie. This is Lizzie's score (4) plus Nathalie's score (7), which equals 4 + 7 = 11 points.",
    "Aimee's score is twice the combined score of Lizzie and Nathalie. So, I multiply the combined score by 2: 11 * 2 = 22 points.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total points scored by Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee. This is the sum of their individual scores: 4 + 7 + 22 = 33 points.",
    "The problem states the whole team scored 50 points in total. Therefore, to find how many points were made by their teammates, I subtract the total points scored by Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee from the overall team score: 50 - 33 = 17 points."
