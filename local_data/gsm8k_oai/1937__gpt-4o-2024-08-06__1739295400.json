  "query": "On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by calculating the number of bicycles sold over the three days. On Friday, Hank sold 10 bicycles.",
    "On Saturday, Hank sold 12 bicycles.",
    "On Sunday, Hank sold 9 bicycles.",
    "Adding these up gives 10 + 12 + 9 = 31 bicycles sold over the three days.",
    "Next, let's calculate the number of bicycles bought over the three days. On Friday, Hank bought 15 bicycles.",
    "On Saturday, Hank bought 8 bicycles.",
    "On Sunday, Hank bought 11 bicycles.",
    "Adding these up gives 15 + 8 + 11 = 34 bicycles bought over the three days.",
    "To find the net increase in the number of bicycles, we subtract the total number of bicycles sold from the total number bought.",
    "The calculation is 34 bicycles bought - 31 bicycles sold = 3 bicycles net increase."
