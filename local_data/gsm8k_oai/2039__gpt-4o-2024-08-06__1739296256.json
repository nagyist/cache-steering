  "query": "Leo had 400 marbles in a jar. He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack, and he gave some of them to his two friends,  Manny and Neil.   He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles, and he kept the rest. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many packs of marbles Leo has in total.",
    "Leo has 400 marbles, and he puts 10 marbles in each pack.",
    "To find the total number of packs, I divide the total number of marbles by the marbles per pack: 400 \u00f7 10 = 40 packs.",
    "Leo gave Manny 1/4 of the packs, so I need to calculate 1/4 of 40.",
    "1/4 of 40 packs is 40 \u00d7 1/4 = 10 packs given to Manny.",
    "Leo gave Neil 1/8 of the packs, so I need to calculate 1/8 of 40.",
    "1/8 of 40 packs is 40 \u00d7 1/8 = 5 packs given to Neil.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of packs given to both Manny and Neil.",
    "Total packs given = packs given to Manny + packs given to Neil = 10 + 5 = 15 packs.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many packs Leo kept by subtracting the packs given away from the total packs.",
    "Packs Leo kept = total packs - packs given away = 40 - 15 = 25 packs."
