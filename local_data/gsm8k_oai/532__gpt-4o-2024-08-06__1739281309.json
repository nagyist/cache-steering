  "query": "The batting cage sells golf balls by the dozen. They charge $30 for 3 dozen. Dan buys 5 dozen, Gus buys 2 dozen, and Chris buys 48 golf balls. How many golf balls do they purchase in total, assuming 12 golf balls are 1 dozen?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that 1 dozen is equal to 12 golf balls.",
    "Dan buys 5 dozen golf balls.",
    "5 dozen is calculated as 5 times 12 golf balls per dozen.",
    "5 times 12 equals 60. So, Dan buys 60 golf balls.",
    "Gus buys 2 dozen golf balls.",
    "2 dozen is calculated as 2 times 12 golf balls per dozen.",
    "2 times 12 equals 24. So, Gus buys 24 golf balls.",
    "Chris buys 48 golf balls directly, so I don't need to convert dozens for him.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris.",
    "I will add the number of golf balls bought by Dan, Gus, and Chris. That's 60 plus 24 plus 48.",
    "Adding 60 and 24 gives 84.",
    "Adding 84 and 48 gives 132."

  "solution": "132"
