  "query": "Sally had 14 fries at lunch. Her friend Mark gave her one-third of his 36 fries at lunch. How many fries did Sally have for lunch after that?",
  "steps": [
    "Sally initially had 14 fries.",
    "Mark gave one-third of his fries to Sally.",
    "Mark has 36 fries in total.",
    "Calculate one-third of 36 fries by dividing 36 by 3.",
    "36 divided by 3 is 12, so Mark gives Sally 12 fries.",
    "Add the 12 fries Sally received from Mark to the 14 fries she already had.",
