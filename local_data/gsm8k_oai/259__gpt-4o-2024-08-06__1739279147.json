  "query": "Adam goes to a small school, which teaches 80 students in three classes. 40% of the students are in class A, and class B has 21 students fewer than class A. The rest are in class C. How many students are in this class?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the number of students in class A, I need to calculate 40% of the total number of students.",
    "The total number of students is given as 80.",
    "40% of 80 can be calculated as (40/100) * 80.",
    "Performing the multiplication, (40/100) * 80 = 32.",
    "Class A has 32 students.",
    "Next, I need to find how many students are in class B.",
    "Class B has 21 students fewer than class A.",
    "If class A has 32 students, then class B has 32 - 21 students.",
    "32 - 21 = 11. So class B has 11 students.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many students are in class C.",
    "The total number of students is 80, and I need to subtract the number of students in class A and class B from this total to find the number in class C.",
    "Class A has 32 students and class B has 11 students, which adds up to 32 + 11 = 43 students.",
    "The remaining number of students in class C would be 80 - 43.",
    "80 - 43 = 37."

  "solution": "37"
