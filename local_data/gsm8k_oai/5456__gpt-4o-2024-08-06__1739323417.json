  "steps": [
    "I'm given that there are 100 students in total and the ratio of boys to girls is 3:2.",
    "The ratio 3:2 means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls.",
    "The combined parts of the ratio is 3 parts boys + 2 parts girls = 5 parts in total.",
    "I need to find out how many students each part represents by dividing the total number of students by the number of parts.",
    "100 students / 5 parts = 20 students per part.",
    "Since there are 3 parts boys, I calculate the number of boys: 3 parts \u00d7 20 students per part = 60 boys.",
    "Since there are 2 parts girls, I calculate the number of girls: 2 parts \u00d7 20 students per part = 40 girls.",
    "I need to find how many more boys there are than girls by subtracting the number of girls from the number of boys.",
    "60 boys - 40 girls = 20 more boys than girls."
