  "query": "Joan collects rocks. In her collection of rock samples, she had half as many gemstones as minerals yesterday. Today, she went on a rock collecting trip and found 6 more mineral samples. If she has 48 minerals now, how many gemstone samples does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by determining how many mineral samples Joan had yesterday.",
    "We know that today she has 48 mineral samples because she found 6 more minerals.",
    "To find out how many minerals she had yesterday, I need to subtract the 6 minerals she found today.",
    "48 minerals (today) - 6 minerals (found today) = 42 minerals yesterday.",
    "Now, I know she had 42 mineral samples yesterday.",
    "The problem states that yesterday she had half as many gemstones as minerals.",
    "Let's calculate half of the 42 mineral samples she had yesterday in order to find out how many gemstones she had.",
    "Half of 42 is 42 / 2 = 21.",
    "Therefore, Joan had 21 gemstone samples yesterday.",
    "The question asks for the number of gemstone samples she has, and since the problem doesn't mention any changes to the gemstones, she still has 21 today."

  "solution": "21"
