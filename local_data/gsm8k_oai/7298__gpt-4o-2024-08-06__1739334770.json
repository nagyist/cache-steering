  "query": "The tank of John's car is full: it contains 47 liters of gasoline. After a journey of 275 km, there are 14 liters left. What is the fuel consumption of this car per 100 km?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to find out how much fuel was used during the journey.",
    "The full tank was 47 liters, and there are 14 liters left. So, the fuel used is 47 - 14 = 33 liters.",
    "Next, I need to determine the fuel consumption per 100 km based on the distance traveled.",
    "The car traveled 275 km using 33 liters of fuel.",
    "To find out how much fuel is used per 100 km, I need to set up a proportion: 33 liters for 275 km is equivalent to x liters for 100 km.",
    "I set up the equation: (33 liters / 275 km) = (x liters / 100 km).",
    "Using cross multiplication to solve for x, I get: x = (33 * 100) / 275.",
    "Perform the multiplication: 33 * 100 = 3300.",
    "Now, divide 3300 by 275 to find x.",
    "3300 / 275 = 12.",
    "Therefore, the fuel consumption of John's car is 12 liters per 100 km."
