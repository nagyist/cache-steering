  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of exercises Emmett did.",
    "Emmett did 12 jumping jacks, 8 pushups, and 20 situps.",
    "I will add these numbers together: 12 + 8 + 20.",
    "12 + 8 = 20.",
    "20 + 20 = 40.",
    "So, the total number of exercises is 40.",
    "Next, I need to find what percentage of the total exercises were pushups.",
    "Emmett did 8 pushups.",
    "To find the percentage, I will divide the number of pushups by the total number of exercises and then multiply by 100.",
    "8 (pushups) \u00f7 40 (total exercises) = 0.2.",
    "0.2 \u00d7 100 = 20."
