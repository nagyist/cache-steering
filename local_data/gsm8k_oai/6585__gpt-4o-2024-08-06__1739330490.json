  "query": "A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people entered the bus at the first pickup point.",
    "The carrying capacity of the bus is 80 people.",
    "At the first pickup point, 3/5 of its carrying capacity entered the bus.",
    "To find 3/5 of the carrying capacity, I calculate (3/5) * 80.",
    "(3/5) * 80 equals 48.",
    "So, 48 people entered the bus at the first pickup point.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many people can still board the bus after the first pickup point.",
    "The carrying capacity of the bus is 80, and currently, there are 48 people on the bus.",
    "80 - 48 equals 32.",
    "This means there is room for 32 more people on the bus.",
    "At the next pickup point, there are 50 people waiting to board.",
    "I need to determine how many of the 50 people cannot take the bus due to its capacity being full.",
    "I subtract the number of available seats (32) from the 50 people at the second pickup point.",
    "50 - 32 equals 18.",
    "18 people could not take the bus because it was full."

  "solution": "18"
