  "query": "Roland needs a length of thread to complete an exercise. He has a 12cm long thread but his teacher says he needs an additional three-quarters of what he has. What is the total length required?",
  "steps": [
    "Roland currently has 12 cm of thread.",
    "He needs an additional three-quarters of what he already has.",
    "First, calculate three-quarters of 12 cm.",
    "Three-quarters is equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).",
    "Multiply 12 cm by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).",
    "\\( 12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 9 \\) cm.",
    "He needs an additional 9 cm of thread.",
    "Add this to the original length of thread he has.",
    "\\( 12 \\) cm + \\( 9 \\) cm = 21 cm.",
    "The total length of thread required is 21 cm."
