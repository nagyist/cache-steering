  "query": "John used to buy 4 coffees a day for $2 each.  They raised the price by 50% so he cut the number of coffees he drinks in half.  How much money does he save per day compared to what he used to spend?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, John bought 4 coffees a day, with each coffee costing $2.",
    "To find his original daily spending on coffee, I need to multiply the number of coffees by the price per coffee.",
    "Original daily spending = 4 coffees * $2/coffee = $8.",
    "The price of coffee increased by 50%.",
    "A 50% increase on $2 is calculated as follows: 50% of $2 is $1.",
    "Therefore, the new price of one coffee is $2 + $1 = $3.",
    "John reduced the number of coffees he drinks in half after the price increase.",
    "Originally, John drank 4 coffees, so half of 4 coffees is 2 coffees.",
    "Now, with the new price, John buys 2 coffees a day at $3 each.",
    "To find his new daily spending on coffee, I need to multiply the number of coffees by the new price per coffee.",
    "New daily spending = 2 coffees * $3/coffee = $6.",
    "To find out how much money John saves per day, I need to calculate the difference between his original daily spending and his new daily spending.",
    "Original daily spending was $8, and new daily spending is $6.",
    "Savings per day = Original spending - New spending = $8 - $6.",
    "Therefore, John saves $2 per day compared to what he used to spend."
