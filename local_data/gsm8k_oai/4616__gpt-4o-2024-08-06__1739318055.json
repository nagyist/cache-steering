  "query": "Antoine owns a strawberry farm that supplies strawberries to his local bakeries. The first bakery needs 2 sacks, the second bakery needs 4 sacks, and the third bakery needs 12 sacks of strawberries per week. How many sacks of strawberries does he need to supply all the bakeries in 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total number of sacks needed per week by all bakeries.",
    "The first bakery needs 2 sacks.",
    "The second bakery needs 4 sacks.",
    "The third bakery needs 12 sacks.",
    "By adding these together, 2 + 4 + 12, we get the total sacks needed per week.",
    "2 + 4 = 6",
    "6 + 12 = 18",
    "So, the total number of sacks needed per week is 18.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total needed for all weeks combined.",
    "They need 18 sacks per week for 4 weeks, so I'll multiply 18 by 4.",
    "18 * 4 = 72"
  ],
  "solution": "72"
