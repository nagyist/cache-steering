  "query": "Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students got a final grade below B.",
    "The problem states that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students received a grade below B.",
    "He has a total of 60 students.",
    "To find 40% of 60, I multiply 60 by 0.40.",
    "60 multiplied by 0.40 equals 24.",
    "So, 24 students got a final grade below B.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many students got a final grade of B and above.",
    "I subtract the number of students who got a grade below B from the total number of students.",
    "60 total students minus 24 students with grades below B equals 36 students.",
    "Therefore, 36 students received a final grade of B and above."

  "solution": "36"
