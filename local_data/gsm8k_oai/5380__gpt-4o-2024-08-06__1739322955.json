    "First, I will calculate the total amount of candy they have together.",
    "Hugh has 8 pounds of candy.",
    "Tommy has 6 pounds of candy.",
    "Melany has 7 pounds of candy.",
    "To find the total amount of candy, I will add their amounts together: 8 + 6 + 7.",
    "8 + 6 equals 14.",
    "14 + 7 equals 21.",
    "The total amount of candy is 21 pounds.",
    "There are three people: Hugh, Tommy, and Melany.",
    "To share the candy equally, I will divide the total amount of candy, 21 pounds, by the number of people, which is 3.",
    "21 divided by 3 equals 7.",
    "Each person will have 7 pounds of candy."
