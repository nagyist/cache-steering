  "query": "John buys 3 dress shirts.  They sell for $20 each.  He also has to pay 10% tax on everything.  How much did he pay in total?",
  "steps": [
    "John buys 3 dress shirts, and each shirt costs $20.",
    "To find the total cost of the shirts before tax, I'll multiply the number of shirts by the cost per shirt: 3 shirts * $20/shirt = $60.",
    "Now I need to calculate the tax on the $60 total cost.",
    "He has to pay 10% tax. To find the tax, I'll calculate 10% of $60.",
    "10% of $60 is calculated as (10/100) * $60 = $6.",
    "To find the total amount John paid, I add the cost of the shirts and the tax: $60 + $6 = $66."
