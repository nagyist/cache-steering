  "query": "Justin needs to read at least 100 pages or more of his book in one week to pass his class. He has read 10 pages already on the first day. Assuming he reads twice the amount of pages as the first day each day in the remaining 6 days, how many pages will he have read after the week is over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, Justin already read 10 pages on the first day.",
    "For the remaining 6 days, he reads twice the number of pages as the first day each day. So, the number of pages he reads each day for the remaining 6 days is 10 * 2 = 20 pages per day.",
    "He reads 20 pages per day for 6 days.",
    "Now, I calculate the total pages read over those 6 days: 20 pages/day * 6 days = 120 pages.",
    "Add the pages read on the first day to the total pages read in the remaining days: 10 + 120 = 130.",
    "Let's check our logic again: 10 on the first day and exactly twice that each subsequent day. Total is then calculated as 10 + (20*6).",
    "Everything checks out with 130 pages read at the week's end."

  "solution": "130"
