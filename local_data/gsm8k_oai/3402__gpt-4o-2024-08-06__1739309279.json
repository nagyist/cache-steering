  "query": "A movie theater company is advertising a deal of a movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, a drink, and a box of candy for $20. Normally, a movie ticket costs $8, a bucket of popcorn costs three dollars less, a drink costs a dollar more than popcorn, and a candy costs half as much as a drink. How many dollars does the deal save a customer who buys a ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy normally?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the normal price of each individual item.",
    "The cost of a movie ticket is given as $8.",
    "The problem states that a bucket of popcorn costs three dollars less than a ticket. So, Popcorn = $8 - $3 = $5.",
    "A drink costs a dollar more than popcorn, so Drink = $5 + $1 = $6.",
    "Candy costs half as much as a drink. Therefore, Candy = $6 / 2 = $3.",
    "Now, I need to find the total normal cost for buying these items separately.",
    "Normal cost is calculated by adding the cost of all items: Ticket = $8, Popcorn = $5, Drink = $6, Candy = $3.",
    "Total normal cost = $8 + $5 + $6 + $3 = $22.",
    "The deal price is given as $20.",
    "To find the savings, I subtract the deal price from the normal cost: $22 - $20 = $2."
