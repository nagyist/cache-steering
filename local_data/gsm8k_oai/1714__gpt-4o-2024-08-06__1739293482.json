  "query": "There are two warehouses. The first warehouse has twice as many boxes as the second warehouse. If the first warehouse has 400 boxes, how many boxes are there in both warehouses combined?",
  "steps": [
    "The first warehouse has twice as many boxes as the second warehouse.",
    "The first warehouse has 400 boxes.",
    "Let the number of boxes in the second warehouse be x.",
    "According to the problem, the first warehouse has twice the number of boxes as the second warehouse, which gives us the equation: 2x = 400.",
    "To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 400 / 2.",
    "Calculating gives x = 200.",
    "The second warehouse has 200 boxes.",
    "To find the total number of boxes in both warehouses, add the number of boxes in the first warehouse and the second warehouse: 400 + 200.",
    "Calculating gives 600 total boxes in both warehouses."
