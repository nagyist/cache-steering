  "query": "Martha receives a daily allowance of $12. She decides to save half of this amount every day. In the first week she kept her commitment with the exception of one day when she saved only a quarter of this amount. How much has she saved at the end of this week?",
  "steps": [
    "Martha's daily allowance is $12.",
    "She saves half of her allowance every day, which is $12 / 2 = $6.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "If she saved $6 each day for 7 days, she would have saved 7 * $6 = $42.",
    "However, she only saved a quarter of her allowance on one day.",
    "A quarter of $12 is $12 / 4 = $3.",
    "So on that day, she saved $3 instead of $6.",
    "The difference for that day is $6 - $3 = $3.",
    "Therefore, over the week, she saved $42 - $3 = $39."

  "solution": "39"
