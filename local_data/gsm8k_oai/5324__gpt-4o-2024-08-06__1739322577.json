  "query": "Parker and Richie split a sum of money in the ratio 2:3. If Parker got $50 (which is the smaller share), how much did they share?",
  "steps": [
    "Parker and Richie's parts are in the ratio 2:3. This means for every 2 parts Parker gets, Richie gets 3 parts.",
    "If Parker gets $50, this is equivalent to 2 parts in the ratio.",
    "We need to find the value of one part. Since Parker's 2 parts amount to $50, one part is $50 divided by 2.",
    "50 divided by 2 equals 25. So one part is worth $25.",
    "Richie's share is 3 parts. If one part is worth $25, then Richie's 3 parts equal 3 times $25.",
    "3 times $25 equals $75. Therefore, Richie gets $75.",
    "To find the total amount shared, we add Parker's share of $50 to Richie's share of $75.",
    "$50 plus $75 equals $125."

  "solution": "125"
