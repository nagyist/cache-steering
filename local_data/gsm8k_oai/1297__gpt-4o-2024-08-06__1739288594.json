  "query": "In Professor Plum's biology class there are 40 students. Of those students, 80 percent have puppies. Of those who have puppies, 25% also have parrots. How many students have both puppies and parrots?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students have puppies.",
    "80 percent of 40 students have puppies.",
    "To calculate 80 percent of 40, I multiply 40 by 0.8.",
    "40 times 0.8 equals 32.",
    "So, there are 32 students who have puppies.",
    "Next, I need to find how many of these students also have parrots.",
    "25 percent of the students with puppies also have parrots.",
    "25 percent of 32 is calculated by multiplying 32 by 0.25.",
    "32 times 0.25 equals 8.",
    "So, 8 students have both puppies and parrots."

  "solution": "8"
