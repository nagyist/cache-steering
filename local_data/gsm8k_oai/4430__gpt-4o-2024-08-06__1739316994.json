  "query": "Barbara wants to save up for a new wristwatch that costs $100. Her parents give her an allowance of $5 a week and she can either save it all up for the watch or spend it as she wishes. 10 weeks pass and due to spending some of her money on ice cream, Barbara currently only has $20. How many more weeks does she need to save for a watch if she stops spending on other things right now?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting that Barbara currently has $20.",
    "The wristwatch costs $100.",
    "Therefore, she needs $100 - $20 = $80 more to buy the wristwatch.",
    "Barbara receives an allowance of $5 each week.",
    "I need to determine how many weeks it will take for her to save up $80 with a $5 weekly allowance.",
    "To find the number of weeks required, I calculate $80 \u00f7 $5.",
    "Performing the division gives me 16 weeks."
