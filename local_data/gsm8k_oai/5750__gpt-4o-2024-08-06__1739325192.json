  "query": "Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Sophie receives 20 oranges each day.",
    "Sophie receives these 20 oranges every day for 30 days.",
    "To find the total number of oranges Sophie received, I will multiply 20 oranges by 30 days.",
    "20 oranges/day * 30 days = 600 oranges.",
    "Next, I know that Hannah receives 40 grapes each day.",
    "Like Sophie, Hannah receives these 40 grapes every day for 30 days.",
    "To find the total number of grapes Hannah received, I will multiply 40 grapes by 30 days.",
    "40 grapes/day * 30 days = 1200 grapes.",
    "Now, to find the total number of fruits that both Sophie and Hannah received, I need to add the total number of oranges and grapes together.",
    "600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits."
  ],
  "solution": "1800"
