  "query": "There were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant. A fourth of the kids went tubing, but only half of the tubers went rafting. How many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many kids went tubing.",
    "A fourth of 40 kids went tubing. So, I need to calculate 1/4 of 40.",
    "1/4 of 40 is 40 divided by 4, which equals 10 kids.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many of the tubers went rafting.",
    "Only half of the tubers went rafting. So, I need to calculate 1/2 of 10.",
    "1/2 of 10 is 10 divided by 2, which equals 5 kids.",
    "These 5 kids who went rafting also went tubing, as they were selected from the tubers."
