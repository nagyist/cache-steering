  "query": "A superhero can use superhuman speed to run 10 miles in 4 minutes. The supervillain has an Evil-Mobile that drives 100 miles per hour. How many miles farther can the superhero run in an hour than the supervillain can drive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how fast the superhero runs in miles per minute.",
    "The superhero runs 10 miles in 4 minutes.",
    "So, the superhero's speed is 10 miles / 4 minutes = 2.5 miles per minute.",
    "Next, I need to convert the superhero's speed from miles per minute to miles per hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I multiply the superhero's speed by 60.",
    "2.5 miles per minute * 60 minutes = 150 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I know the superhero runs at 150 miles per hour.",
    "The supervillain drives the Evil-Mobile at 100 miles per hour.",
    "To find out how many miles farther the superhero can run in an hour than the supervillain can drive, I subtract the supervillain's speed from the superhero's speed.",
    "150 miles per hour - 100 miles per hour = 50 miles."

  "solution": "50"
