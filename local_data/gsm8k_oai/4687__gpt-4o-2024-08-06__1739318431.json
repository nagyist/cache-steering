  "query": "Delaney has to catch a bus that leaves at 8:00. a.m to school every day. He always takes 30 minutes to reach the pick-up point from his home. One day he woke up late and left his home at 7:50. How much time did he miss the bus by when he reached the pick-up point?",
  "steps": [
    "The bus leaves the pick-up point at 8:00 a.m.",
    "Delaney needs 30 minutes to reach the pick-up point from his home.",
    "Delaney left his home at 7:50 a.m.",
    "To determine when Delaney reaches the pick-up point, add 30 minutes to his departure time of 7:50 a.m.",
    "7:50 a.m. plus 30 minutes is 8:20 a.m.",
    "Delaney reaches the pick-up point at 8:20 a.m.",
    "The bus left at 8:00 a.m.",
    "Delaney missed the bus by 20 minutes (8:20 a.m. minus 8:00 a.m.)."
