  "query": "Carl is hosting an open house for his new business.  He knows 50 people will show up and hopes that another 40 people will randomly show up.  He\u2019s created 10 extravagant gift bags for the first 10 people who visit his shop.  He\u2019s made average gift bags for 20 people but needs to make enough for everyone who visits to have one.  How many more bags does he need to make?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl knows 50 people will definitely show up.",
    "He hopes another 40 people will randomly show up.",
    "So the total number of people he expects is 50 + 40 = 90 people.",
    "He has already prepared 10 extravagant gift bags.",
    "He has also prepared 20 average gift bags.",
    "The total number of gift bags he currently has is 10 + 20 = 30 bags.",
    "To accommodate 90 people, he needs 90 - 30 = 60 more gift bags."
