  "query": "A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the rate of speed of the car in miles per hour.",
    "The car traveled 180 miles in 4 hours.",
    "To find the speed, I will divide the total distance by the total time: 180 miles / 4 hours.",
    "180 divided by 4 equals 45.",
    "So, the car is traveling at a rate of 45 miles per hour.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many miles the car will travel in 3 hours at this speed.",
    "I will multiply the rate of 45 miles per hour by 3 hours.",
    "45 multiplied by 3 equals 135.",
    "Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles in the next 3 hours."
  ],
  "solution": "135"
