  "query": "Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins. Each roll has 25 coins. How many coins do four bank tellers have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by determining how many coins one bank teller has.",
    "Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins.",
    "Each roll has 25 coins.",
    "To find out how many coins one bank teller has, I multiply the number of rolls by the number of coins per roll: 10 rolls x 25 coins.",
    "10 x 25 equals 250.",
    "So, each bank teller has 250 coins.",
    "There are 4 bank tellers.",
    "I multiply the number of coins one bank teller has by the number of tellers: 250 coins x 4 tellers.",
    "250 x 4 equals 1000."
