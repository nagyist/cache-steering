  "steps": [
    "Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.",
    "Since Tom turned 32 five years ago, it means he was 32 years old 5 years ago.",
    "To find Tom's current age, I have to add 5 years to 32.",
    "32 + 5 equals 37.",
    "So, Tom is currently 37 years old.",
    "According to the problem, 7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.",
    "First, I need to determine Tom's age 7 years ago.",
    "To find Tom's age 7 years ago, I subtract 7 years from his current age of 37.",
    "37 - 7 equals 30.",
    "So, 7 years ago, Tom was 30 years old.",
    "Next, I need to calculate half of Tom's age 7 years ago.",
    "Half of 30 is 15.",
    "7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age, which is 15.",
    "15 + 5 equals 20.",
    "So, 7 years ago, Jim was 20 years old.",
    "To find Jim's current age, I add 7 years to his age 7 years ago.",
    "20 + 7 equals 27.",
    "Jim is currently 27 years old.",
    "The question asks how old Jim will be in 2 years.",
    "Jim's age in 2 years will be his current age plus 2.",
    "27 + 2 equals 29."
