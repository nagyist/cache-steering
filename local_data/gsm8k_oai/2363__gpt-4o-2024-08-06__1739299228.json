  "query": "There are twice as many centipedes as humans on a certain island and half as many sheep as humans. How many sheep and humans in total are on the island if the number of centipedes is 100?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that there are twice as many centipedes as humans. Let's denote the number of humans as H.",
    "Since there are twice as many centipedes as humans and the number of centipedes is 100, we have the equation: 2H = 100.",
    "To find the number of humans, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: H = 100 / 2.",
    "Calculating H gives us H = 50.",
    "Next, the problem states there are half as many sheep as humans. Let's denote the number of sheep as S.",
    "Since there are half as many sheep as humans: S = 1/2 * H.",
    "Substituting the previously calculated number of humans (H = 50) into the equation gives us: S = 1/2 * 50.",
    "Calculating S gives us S = 25.",
    "Now we need to find the total number of sheep and humans. This is simply the sum of the number of humans (H) and the number of sheep (S).",
    "The total number of sheep and humans is: 50 (humans) + 25 (sheep) = 75."
