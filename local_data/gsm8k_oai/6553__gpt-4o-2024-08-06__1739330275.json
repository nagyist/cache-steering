  "query": "Elois needs 4 bananas to make 1 loaf of banana bread.  On Monday, she makes 3 loaves of banana bread.  On Tuesday, she makes twice as many loaves of banana bread as Monday.  How many bananas did she use to make all the banana bread?",
  "steps": [
    "Elois needs 4 bananas to make 1 loaf of banana bread.",
    "On Monday, she makes 3 loaves of banana bread.",
    "To find out how many bananas she uses on Monday, multiply the number of loaves by the number of bananas needed per loaf: 3 loaves * 4 bananas/loaf = 12 bananas.",
    "On Tuesday, she makes twice as many loaves of banana bread as she did on Monday.",
    "Twice as many loaves as Monday is 2 * 3 loaves = 6 loaves.",
    "To find out how many bananas she uses on Tuesday, multiply the number of loaves by the number of bananas needed per loaf: 6 loaves * 4 bananas/loaf = 24 bananas.",
    "Now, add the bananas used on Monday and Tuesday to find the total number of bananas used: 12 bananas (Monday) + 24 bananas (Tuesday) = 36 bananas."
