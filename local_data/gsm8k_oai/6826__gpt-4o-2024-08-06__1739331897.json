  "query": "Lindsay has 4 dolls with blonde hair; four times more dolls with brown than blonde hair; 2 fewer dolls with black than brown hair. How many more dolls with black and brown hair combined does Lindsay have than blonde-haired dolls?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Lindsay has 4 dolls with blonde hair.",
    "She has four times more dolls with brown hair than blonde hair.",
    "Since she has 4 dolls with blonde hair, the number of dolls with brown hair would be 4 times 4.",
    "4 times 4 is 16, so Lindsay has 16 dolls with brown hair.",
    "Lindsay has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than she has dolls with brown hair.",
    "She has 16 dolls with brown hair, so the number of dolls with black hair would be 16 minus 2.",
    "16 minus 2 is 14, so Lindsay has 14 dolls with black hair.",
    "I need to find the total number of dolls with black and brown hair combined.",
    "To find this, I'll add the number of dolls with brown hair and the number of dolls with black hair.",
    "16 (brown-haired dolls) plus 14 (black-haired dolls) equals 30.",
    "Now, I need to find how many more dolls with black and brown hair combined Lindsay has than those with blonde hair.",
    "She has 30 dolls with black and brown hair combined and 4 dolls with blonde hair.",
    "To find the difference, I subtract the number of blonde-haired dolls from the number of black and brown-haired dolls combined.",
    "30 minus 4 equals 26."
