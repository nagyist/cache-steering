  "steps": [
    "Mary uses plastic grocery bags that can hold a maximum of twenty pounds.",
    "She buys 4 pounds of green beans.",
    "She also buys 6 pounds of milk.",
    "Mary buys twice the amount of carrots as green beans. So, twice the amount of 4 pounds of green beans is 8 pounds of carrots.",
    "Now, I need to find the total weight of the groceries Mary has.",
    "The total weight is 4 pounds of green beans + 6 pounds of milk + 8 pounds of carrots.",
    "Calculating the total: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 pounds.",
    "Mary's grocery bag can hold a maximum of 20 pounds, and she currently has 18 pounds.",
    "To find out how many more pounds of groceries Mary can fit in the bag, subtract the total groceries' weight from the maximum capacity: 20 - 18 = 2 pounds."
