  "query": "Rachel drinks 2 glasses of water on Sunday and 4 glasses of water on Monday. Then she drinks 3 glasses of water every day for the next 4 days. One glass of water is 10 ounces of water. If Rachel wants to drink a total of 220 ounces of water in the week (Sunday to Saturday), how many glasses of water should she drink on Saturday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate how many glasses of water Rachel drinks from Sunday to Friday.",
    "On Sunday, Rachel drinks 2 glasses of water.",
    "On Monday, Rachel drinks 4 glasses of water.",
    "For the next 4 days (Tuesday to Friday), Rachel drinks 3 glasses of water each day.",
    "From Tuesday to Friday, that totals 3 glasses/day * 4 days = 12 glasses of water.",
    "Now I'll add the glasses from each day: 2 (Sunday) + 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday to Friday) = 18 glasses of water from Sunday to Friday.",
    "Now I will calculate how many ounces of water she has consumed from Sunday to Friday.",
    "Each glass is 10 ounces, so I multiply 18 glasses by 10 ounces/glass = 180 ounces.",
    "Rachel wants to drink a total of 220 ounces in the week.",
    "The remaining ounces of water she needs to drink is 220 ounces - 180 ounces = 40 ounces.",
    "To find how many glasses of water she needs to drink on Saturday, I will divide the remaining ounces by the ounces per glass.",
    "40 ounces \u00f7 10 ounces/glass = 4 glasses."
