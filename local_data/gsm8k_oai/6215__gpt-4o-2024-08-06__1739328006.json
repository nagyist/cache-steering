  "query": "Hattie and her friend Lorelei are doing a jumping contest using a jumping rope. Hattie does 180 jumps in the first round, while Lorelei jumps 3/4 as many times as Hattie jumped. In the second round, Lorelei does 50 more jumps than Hattie. If Hattie managed to jump 2/3 times the number of jumps she did in the first round, calculate the total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds.",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the number of jumps Lorelei did in the first round. She jumped 3/4 as many times as Hattie.",
    "Hattie did 180 jumps in the first round. Therefore, Lorelei did 3/4 x 180 = 135 jumps.",
    "Now calculate the number of jumps Hattie did in the second round. Hattie jumped 2/3 of the number of jumps she did in the first round.",
    "2/3 of 180 is 120. So, Hattie jumped 120 times in the second round.",
    "Lorelei did 50 more jumps than Hattie in the second round. So, calculate Lorelei's jumps in this round.",
    "Lorelei's second round jumps = Hattie's second round jumps + 50 = 120 + 50 = 170.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of jumps Hattie did in both rounds.",
    "Hattie's total jumps = First round jumps + Second round jumps = 180 + 120 = 300.",
    "Calculate the total number of jumps Lorelei did in both rounds.",
    "Lorelei's total jumps = First round jumps + Second round jumps = 135 + 170 = 305.",
    "Add up Hattie's and Lorelei's total jumps to get the total number of jumps in both rounds.",
    "Total jumps = Hattie's total jumps + Lorelei's total jumps = 300 + 305 = 605."
