  "query": "While buying DVDs at the store, Maria received a 25% discount. If the discount she received is $40, how much did she pay in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Maria received a 25% discount, which amounted to $40.",
    "To find the original price before the discount, let me determine what 25% represents.",
    "Let the original price be \\( x \\).",
    "25% of \\( x \\) is given as $40. So, I can set up the equation: \\( 0.25 \\times x = 40 \\).",
    "Now, solve the equation for \\( x \\): \n\nDivide both sides by 0.25 to isolate \\( x \\).\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{0.25}\n\\]",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{40}{0.25} \\).\n\nFirst, I can think of \\(\\frac{40}{0.25}\\) as multiplying 40 by the reciprocal of 0.25, which is 4. \n\nThus, \\( 40 \\times 4 = 160 \\).",
    "So, the original price of the DVDs was $160.",
    "Maria received a discount of $40, so she paid the original price minus the discount.",
    "Now calculate the total amount Maria paid: \n\n$160 (original price) - $40 (discount) = $120."
