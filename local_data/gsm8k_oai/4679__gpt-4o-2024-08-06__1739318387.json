  "query": "A total of 42 baby sea turtles hatched and are headed to the ocean. One-third of them got swept to the sea by a wave.  How many are still on the sand?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many of the 42 baby sea turtles got swept to sea by the wave.",
    "To do this, I calculate one-third of 42.",
    "One-third of 42 is calculated as 42 divided by 3.",
    "42 divided by 3 equals 14.",
    "So, 14 baby sea turtles got swept to the sea by the wave.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many baby sea turtles are still on the sand.",
    "I subtract the number of turtles that got swept to the sea from the total number of turtles.",
    "42 minus 14 equals 28.",
    "Thus, 28 baby sea turtles are still on the sand."

  "solution": "28"
