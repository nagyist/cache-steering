  "query": "The largest animal to have ever lived on earth is the blue whale.  The tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 6000 pounds.  If one ton is 2000 pounds, how many tons can the tongue of an adult blue whale weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between pounds and tons. I know that one ton is equal to 2000 pounds.",
    "The problem states that the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 6000 pounds.",
    "To find out how many tons the whale's tongue can weigh, I need to convert the weight from pounds to tons.",
    "To convert from pounds to tons, I will divide the weight in pounds by the number of pounds in one ton.",
    "So, I need to divide 6000 pounds by 2000 pounds per ton.",
    "6000 divided by 2000 equals 3.",
    "This means that the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 3 tons."
