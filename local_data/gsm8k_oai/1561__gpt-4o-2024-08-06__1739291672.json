  "query": "Marie has 4 notebooks with 20 stamps each. She also has two binders with 50 stamps each. If she decides to only keep 1/4 of the stamps, how many stamps can she give away?",
  "steps": [
    "Marie has 4 notebooks.",
    "Each notebook contains 20 stamps.",
    "To find the total number of stamps in all notebooks, multiply 4 notebooks by 20 stamps per notebook.",
    "4 notebooks * 20 stamps/notebook = 80 stamps.",
    "Marie also has 2 binders.",
    "Each binder contains 50 stamps.",
    "To find the total number of stamps in the binders, multiply 2 binders by 50 stamps per binder.",
    "2 binders * 50 stamps/binder = 100 stamps.",
    "Add the number of stamps in the notebooks to the number of stamps in the binders to find the total number of stamps Marie has.",
    "80 stamps from notebooks + 100 stamps from binders = 180 stamps.",
    "Marie decides to keep only 1/4 of the stamps.",
    "To find how many stamps she keeps, calculate 1/4 of 180 stamps.",
    "1/4 * 180 = 45 stamps.",
    "To determine how many stamps she gives away, subtract the number of stamps she keeps from the total number of stamps.",
    "180 total stamps - 45 stamps kept = 135 stamps."
