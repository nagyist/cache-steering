  "steps": [
    "Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students.",
    "To find out how many cards he gave out in total, I need to multiply the number of cards per student by the number of students.",
    "23 cards per student times 15 students equals 345 cards given out in total.",
    "Joseph had 12 cards left after giving out the cards.",
    "To find out how many cards Joseph had at first, I need to add the number of cards given out to the number of cards he has left.",
    "345 cards given out plus 12 cards left equals a total of 357 cards."
