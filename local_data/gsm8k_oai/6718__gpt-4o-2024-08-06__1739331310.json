  "query": "Janet has 1/3 of a bottle of rose shampoo and 1/4 of a bottle of jasmine shampoo. If she uses 1/12 of a bottle of shampoo per day, how many days will her shampoo last?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much shampoo Janet has in total.",
    "She has 1/3 of a bottle of rose shampoo.",
    "She also has 1/4 of a bottle of jasmine shampoo.",
    "To find the total amount of shampoo, I need a common denominator to add these fractions.",
    "The denominators are 3 and 4, and the least common multiple is 12.",
    "I will convert 1/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 12. To do this, I multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4.",
    "1/3 is equivalent to 4/12.",
    "Now I will convert 1/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 12. I multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3.",
    "1/4 is equivalent to 3/12.",
    "Now, I will add these two fractions: 4/12 + 3/12.",
    "4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. So Janet has 7/12 of a bottle of shampoo in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many days her shampoo will last if she uses 1/12 of a bottle per day.",
    "I need to divide the total shampoo 7/12 by the amount used per day 1/12.",
    "Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 7/12 divided by 1/12 is the same as 7/12 multiplied by 12/1.",
    "7/12 * 12/1 = 7 * 12 / 12 = 7.",
    "Therefore, Janet's shampoo will last for 7 days."
