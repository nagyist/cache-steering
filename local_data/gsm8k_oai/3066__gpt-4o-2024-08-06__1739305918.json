  "query": "After eating half of the number of fruits he had, Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes. If he has 50 oranges now, how many fruits did he initially have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by determining the relationship between the number of remaining oranges and limes. Martin has twice as many oranges as limes now.",
    "The problem states that Martin has 50 oranges now, which is twice as many as the number of limes. Therefore, let the number of limes be L.",
    "Given the relationship: 2L = 50, because he has twice as many oranges as limes.",
    "To find the number of limes, L, we solve the equation: 2L = 50.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for L: L = 50 / 2.",
    "L = 25, so Martin has 25 limes now.",
    "Martin ate half the number of fruits he initially had and ended up with 50 oranges and 25 limes, totaling 75 fruits now.",
    "If 75 is half the number of fruits he initially had, then he started with twice that number.",
    "Therefore, the initial number of fruits is 75 * 2.",
    "75 * 2 = 150. This is the total number of fruits Martin initially had."

  "solution": "150"
