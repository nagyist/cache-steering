  "query": "Holly gets 26 paychecks per year.  If she puts $100.00 from every paycheck into her 401K, her company will match that contribution by 6%.  How much money has she and her company contributed to her 401k after 1 year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine Holly's annual contribution to her 401K from her own paychecks.",
    "She puts $100.00 away per paycheck and receives 26 paychecks per year.",
    "Calculate Holly's total contribution in a year: $100.00 x 26 = $2600.",
    "Now calculate her company\u2019s matching contribution. The company matches 6% of her contributions.",
    "Calculate 6% of her total annual contributions: 0.06 x $2600 = $156.",
    "Add Holly's contributions and the company's contributions together to find the total amount in her 401K after 1 year.",
    "Holly's contribution is $2600 and the company's contribution is $156.",
    "Add these amounts: $2600 + $156 = $2756."
