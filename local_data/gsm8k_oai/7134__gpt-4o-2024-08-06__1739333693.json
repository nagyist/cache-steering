  "steps": [
    "Let the number of erasers that Gabriel collected be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel. So, Celine collected \\( 2x \\) erasers.",
    "Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine. Therefore, Julian collected \\( 2(2x) = 4x \\) erasers.",
    "According to the problem statement, the total number of erasers collected by all three is 35.",
    "Write the equation based on the total number of erasers: \n\\[ x + 2x + 4x = 35 \\]",
    "Simplify the equation: \n\\[ 7x = 35 \\]",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]",
    "Since \\( x \\) is the number of erasers Gabriel collected, Celine collected \\( 2x \\), which is \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)."
