  "query": "A class has 32 students and they all need to present their projects. Every period is 40 minutes long. How many periods will it take for every student to present their project if they have 5 minutes to do so?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long each student takes for their presentation.",
    "Each student takes 5 minutes for their presentation.",
    "Next, I calculate the total time needed for all students to present.",
    "There are 32 students, each taking 5 minutes.",
    "The total time required is 32 students multiplied by 5 minutes per student.",
    "32 times 5 equals 160 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many periods are needed if each period is 40 minutes long.",
    "I divide the total presentation time (160 minutes) by the period length (40 minutes).",
    "160 divided by 40 equals 4.",
    "Thus, 4 periods are required for all students to present their projects."

  "solution": "4"
