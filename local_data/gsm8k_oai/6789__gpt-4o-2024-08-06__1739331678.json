  "query": "It's payday but Jebb has to pay 10% for the tax. If his pay is $650, how much is his take-home pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate 10% of Jebb's pay, which is $650.",
    "To do this calculation, I multiply $650 by 0.10.",
    "$650 multiplied by 0.10 equals $65.",
    "Next, I subtract the tax amount ($65) from Jebb's total pay ($650) to find his take-home pay.",
    "So I calculate $650 minus $65.",
    "This gives me $585 as the take-home pay."
