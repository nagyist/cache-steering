  "query": "Karen wanted to go out to get some fast food. She pulls up to the drive-through and orders a 5-dollar burger. Her son then yelled out that he wanted a 4-dollar sandwich, so it was added to the order. Karen then decided to order some drinks and opted for two 4-dollar smoothies. What is the total cost of Karen's fast-food order?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the cost of each item in the order.",
    "Karen ordered a 5-dollar burger.",
    "Her son ordered a 4-dollar sandwich.",
    "Karen also ordered two 4-dollar smoothies.",
    "Now, I will add these up to find the total cost.",
    "The burger costs 5 dollars.",
    "The sandwich costs 4 dollars.",
    "Each smoothie costs 4 dollars, so two smoothies cost 2 * 4 = 8 dollars.",
    "Add the costs together: 5 + 4 + 8.",
    "5 + 4 is 9.",
    "9 + 8 is 17."
