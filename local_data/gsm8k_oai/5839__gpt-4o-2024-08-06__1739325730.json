  "query": "Katie's mother wants to get granola bars for all the kids to eat after Katie's soccer game. There will be 30 kids playing soccer, including Katie. Katie's mother wants to get 2 granola bars for each kid, since the bars are not that big and she figures the kids will be very hungry. Each box of granola bars has 12 bars in it. How many boxes should Katie's mother buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of granola bars needed.",
    "There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 2 granola bars.",
    "I multiply 30 kids by 2 granola bars per kid: 30 * 2 = 60 granola bars in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many boxes of granola bars are needed.",
    "Each box contains 12 granola bars.",
    "I divide the total number of granola bars needed, 60, by the number of bars per box, 12: 60 / 12 = 5.",
    "This calculation gives me the number of boxes needed."
