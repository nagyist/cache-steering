  "query": "Matilda has half as many jellybeans as Matt. Matt has ten times as many jellybeans as Steve. If Steve has 84 jellybeans, how many jellybeans does Matilda have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many jellybeans Matt has.",
    "I know that Matt has ten times as many jellybeans as Steve.",
    "Steve has 84 jellybeans.",
    "So, Matt has 10 times 84 jellybeans.",
    "Calculating that gives Matt 840 jellybeans.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many jellybeans Matilda has.",
    "Matilda has half as many jellybeans as Matt.",
    "Since Matt has 840 jellybeans, I find half of 840 to determine how many Matilda has.",
    "Half of 840 is 840 divided by 2.",
    "Calculating that gives Matilda 420 jellybeans."
