  "query": "The house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet. The porch measures 6 feet by 4.5 feet. The house and the porch need shingles. How many square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of the house's roof.",
    "The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.",
    "For the house, I need to multiply 20.5 feet by 10 feet.",
    "20.5 feet * 10 feet = 205 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the area of the porch's roof.",
    "The porch's measurement is 6 feet by 4.5 feet.",
    "Using the same formula, I multiply 6 feet by 4.5 feet.",
    "6 feet * 4.5 feet = 27 square feet.",
    "Now, I will add the areas of the house and the porch together to find the total area that requires shingles.",
    "205 square feet + 27 square feet = 232 square feet.",
    "I've calculated the total area that needs shingles, so now I have the answer."

  "solution": "232"
