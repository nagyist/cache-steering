  "query": "Every time she goes to the store, Felicity gets a lollipop. After she finishes them, she uses the sticks to build a fort. The fort needs 400 sticks to finish it. Her family goes to the store three times a week and she always goes. If the fort is 60% complete, how many weeks has Felicity been collecting lollipops for?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many lollipop sticks Felicity needs in total to complete the fort. The fort requires 400 sticks to be finished.",
    "Since the fort is 60% complete, Felicity has already collected 60% of the sticks needed.",
    "To find out how many sticks have been collected, I calculate 60% of 400.",
    "60% of 400 is given by (60/100) * 400 = 240 sticks.",
    "Felicity has already collected 240 sticks.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times Felicity has been to the store, as she gets one lollipop (and hence one stick) each time.",
    "Felicity goes to the store three times a week.",
    "To find how many weeks she has been collecting, I divide the number of sticks collected by the number of visits she makes per week.",
    "The number of weeks is calculated as the total sticks collected divided by sticks collected per week: 240 sticks / 3 sticks per week.",
    "Performing the division, 240 / 3 = 80 weeks."
