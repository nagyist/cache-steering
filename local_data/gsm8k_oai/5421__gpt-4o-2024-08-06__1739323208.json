  "query": "Hannah is at a restaurant. She spends $23 in total on an entree and a dessert. If the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, how much does the entree cost, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the cost of the dessert be \\( x \\) dollars.",
    "Since the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, the cost of the entree is \\( x + 5 \\) dollars.",
    "Together, the cost of the entree and dessert is given as $23.",
    "This forms the equation: \\( x + (x + 5) = 23 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation gives: \\( 2x + 5 = 23 \\).",
    "Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate terms with \\( x \\): \\( 2x = 18 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 9 \\).",
    "The cost of the dessert is \\( x = 9 \\) dollars.",
    "The cost of the entree is \\( x + 5 = 9 + 5 \\).",
    "Therefore, the cost of the entree is \\( 14 \\) dollars."

  "solution": "14"
