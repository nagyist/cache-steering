  "query": "Kekai is running a sundae booth at the carnival. On Monday, he makes a total of 40 sundaes, and he puts 6 m&ms on each sundae. On Tuesday, he makes a total of 20 sundaes, and he puts 10 m&ms on each sundae. If each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms, how many m&m packs does Kekai use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of m&ms Kekai uses on Monday.",
    "Kekai makes 40 sundaes on Monday.",
    "Each sundae gets 6 m&ms.",
    "The total number of m&ms used on Monday is 40 sundaes times 6 m&ms per sundae.",
    "40 sundaes * 6 m&ms/sundae = 240 m&ms.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of m&ms Kekai uses on Tuesday.",
    "Kekai makes 20 sundaes on Tuesday.",
    "Each sundae gets 10 m&ms.",
    "The total number of m&ms used on Tuesday is 20 sundaes times 10 m&ms per sundae.",
    "20 sundaes * 10 m&ms/sundae = 200 m&ms.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of m&ms used over both days.",
    "The total number of m&ms used is 240 m&ms (Monday) + 200 m&ms (Tuesday).",
    "240 m&ms + 200 m&ms = 440 m&ms.",
    "Each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms.",
    "I need to find out how many packs are needed for 440 m&ms.",
    "The number of packs needed is 440 m&ms divided by 40 m&ms per pack.",
    "440 m&ms / 40 m&ms/pack = 11 packs."
