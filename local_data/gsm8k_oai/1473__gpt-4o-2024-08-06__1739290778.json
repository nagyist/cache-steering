  "query": "A bookseller sells 15 books in January, 16 in February and a certain number of books in March. If the average number of books he sold per month across all three months is 16, how many books did he sell in March?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the average number of books sold per month is 16.",
    "The total number of books sold over the three months can be found by multiplying the average by 3 months.",
    "16 books/month * 3 months = 48 books in total.",
    "The bookseller sold 15 books in January and 16 books in February.",
    "I need to find the total number of books sold in January and February.",
    "15 books + 16 books = 31 books.",
    "I will subtract the number of books sold in January and February from the total number of books sold to find how many were sold in March.",
    "48 total books - 31 books (January and February) = 17 books."

  "solution": "17"
