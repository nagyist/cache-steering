  "steps": [
    "Edmund uses 18 inches of gift wrapper for each gift box.",
    "Every day, he has 90 inches of gift wrapper available.",
    "To find out how many gift boxes he can wrap in one day, we divide the total inches of gift wrapper per day by the inches needed per gift box.",
    "90 inches per day divided by 18 inches per gift box equals 5 gift boxes per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many gift boxes he can wrap in 3 days.",
    "If he wraps 5 gift boxes each day, then in 3 days he can wrap 5 gift boxes times 3 days.",
    "5 gift boxes per day times 3 days equals 15 gift boxes."
