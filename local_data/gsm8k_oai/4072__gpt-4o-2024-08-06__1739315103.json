  "query": "A cake has 8 slices and each slice contains 347 calories.  A pan of brownies has 6 brownies and each slice contains 375 calories.  How many more calories does the cake have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of calories in the cake.",
    "There are 8 slices of cake, each containing 347 calories.",
    "To calculate the total calories in the cake, I multiply 8 slices by 347 calories per slice.",
    "8 slices x 347 calories/slice = 2776 calories.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of calories in the pan of brownies.",
    "There are 6 brownies, each containing 375 calories.",
    "To calculate the total calories in the pan of brownies, I multiply 6 brownies by 375 calories per brownie.",
    "6 brownies x 375 calories/brownie = 2250 calories.",
    "Now, I need to find how many more calories the cake has compared to the brownies.",
    "I subtract the total calories of the brownies from the total calories of the cake.",
    "2776 calories (cake) - 2250 calories (brownies) = 526 calories."

  "solution": "526"
