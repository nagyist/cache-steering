  "query": "Emery looks through the drawer where her mom keeps the cookie cutters. There are 6 cookie cutters shaped like triangles, 4 square ones and 2 hexagons. How many sides are there on the cookie cutters in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the number of sides for each shape of cookie cutter and multiply by how many there are of each shape.",
    "First, consider the triangular cookie cutters. A triangle has 3 sides.",
    "Emery has 6 triangular cookie cutters.",
    "The total number of sides for the triangular cutters is 6 multiplied by 3.",
    "6 multiplied by 3 equals 18.",
    "Next, consider the square cookie cutters. A square has 4 sides.",
    "Emery has 4 square cookie cutters.",
    "The total number of sides for the square cutters is 4 multiplied by 4.",
    "4 multiplied by 4 equals 16.",
    "Next, consider the hexagonal cookie cutters. A hexagon has 6 sides.",
    "Emery has 2 hexagonal cookie cutters.",
    "The total number of sides for the hexagonal cutters is 2 multiplied by 6.",
    "2 multiplied by 6 equals 12.",
    "Now, I will add up all the sides from each type of cookie cutter.",
    "Adding 18 (triangles) plus 16 (squares) plus 12 (hexagons) gives the total number of sides.",
    "18 plus 16 equals 34.",
    "34 plus 12 equals 46."
