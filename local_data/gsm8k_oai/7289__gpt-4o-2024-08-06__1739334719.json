  "query": "Ursula bought five hot dogs at $1.50 each and three salads at $2.50 each. If she had two $10 bills, how much change did she get back?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the hot dogs.",
    "Each hot dog costs $1.50, and Ursula bought five hot dogs.",
    "The total cost for the hot dogs is 5 times $1.50.",
    "5 times $1.50 equals $7.50.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total cost of the salads.",
    "Each salad costs $2.50, and Ursula bought three salads.",
    "The total cost for the salads is 3 times $2.50.",
    "3 times $2.50 equals $7.50.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total cost of both the hot dogs and the salads.",
    "The total cost is $7.50 for the hot dogs plus $7.50 for the salads.",
    "$7.50 plus $7.50 equals $15.",
    "Ursula had two $10 bills, which means she had $20 in total.",
    "I need to determine how much change Ursula receives by subtracting the total cost from the amount she had.",
    "$20 minus $15 equals $5."
