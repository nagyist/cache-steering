  "query": "Brandon sold 86 geckos last year. He sold twice that many the year before. How many geckos has Brandon sold in the last two years?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by thinking about how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last year.",
    "Last year, Brandon sold 86 geckos.",
    "The problem states that he sold twice that many the year before last year.",
    "To find out how many geckos he sold the year before last year, I need to multiply the number sold last year, 86, by 2.",
    "86 times 2 equals 172.",
    "So, Brandon sold 172 geckos the year before last year.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of geckos sold over the last two years.",
    "The total number of geckos sold is the sum of the geckos sold last year and the year before last year.",
    "86 geckos last year plus 172 geckos the year before last year.",
    "86 plus 172 equals 258."

  "solution": "258"
