  "query": "Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has. James has 3 times the number of candies Adam has. If Adam has 6 candies, how many candies do the three of them have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many candies Adam has. The problem states Adam has 6 candies.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many candies James has. James has 3 times the number of candies Adam has, who has 6.",
    "I calculate James's candies by multiplying 6 by 3.",
    "6 times 3 equals 18. So, James has 18 candies.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many candies Rubert has. Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has, who has 18.",
    "I calculate Rubert's candies by multiplying 18 by 4.",
    "18 times 4 equals 72. So, Rubert has 72 candies.",
    "Now, I know the number of candies each person has: Adam has 6, James has 18, and Rubert has 72.",
    "I need to find the total number of candies all three of them have.",
    "I add Adam's, James's, and Rubert's candies together: 6 + 18 + 72.",
    "6 plus 18 equals 24.",
    "24 plus 72 equals 96."
