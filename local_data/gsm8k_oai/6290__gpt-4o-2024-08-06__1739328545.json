  "query": "There are three trees in the town square. The tallest tree is 150 feet tall. The middle height tree is 2/3 the height of the tallest tree. The shortest tree is half the size of the middle tree.  How tall is the shortest tree?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the height of the shortest tree, I first need to determine the height of the middle tree.",
    "The middle tree is 2/3 the height of the tallest tree, which is 150 feet tall.",
    "I calculate the height of the middle tree by multiplying 150 feet by 2/3.",
    "150 feet * 2/3 equals 100 feet.",
    "Now I know that the middle tree is 100 feet tall.",
    "The shortest tree is half the size of the middle tree.",
    "I calculate the height of the shortest tree by dividing the height of the middle tree, which is 100 feet, by 2.",
    "100 feet / 2 equals 50 feet."
