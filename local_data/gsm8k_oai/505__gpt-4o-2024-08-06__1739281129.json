  "query": "Carla's sheepdog rounded up 90% of her sheep, but the remaining 10% wandered off into the hills. If there are 81 sheep in the pen, how many are out in the wilderness?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the total number of sheep Carla has based on the fact that there are 81 sheep in the pen, which represents 90% of the total.",
    "Let x represent the total number of sheep. According to the problem, 90% of x is equal to 81.",
    "I can set up the equation: 0.90 * x = 81.",
    "To find x, I need to divide 81 by 0.90.",
    "Calculating 81 / 0.90 gives me 90.",
    "So, the total number of sheep Carla has is 90.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness.",
    "Since 10% of the sheep are not in the pen, I need to calculate 10% of the total number of sheep, which is 90.",
    "10% of 90 is calculated as 0.10 * 90.",
    "0.10 * 90 equals 9.",
    "Therefore, there are 9 sheep out in the wilderness."

  "solution": "9"
