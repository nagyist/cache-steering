  "query": "Ronald wants to make profits by re-selling some phones he bought a week ago. He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?",
  "steps": [
    "Ronald bought 200 phones for a total of $3000.",
    "To find the cost price per phone, divide the total cost by the number of phones: $3000 / 200 phones = $15 per phone.",
    "Ronald wants to make a profit that is a third of the initial investment, which is $3000.",
    "A third of $3000 is calculated as $3000 / 3 = $1000.",
    "The total amount Ronald wants to earn from selling all the phones is the initial $3000 plus the $1000 profit, which is $3000 + $1000 = $4000.",
    "To determine the selling price per phone, divide the total amount he wants to earn by the number of phones: $4000 / 200 phones = $20 per phone."
