  "query": "Alyssa and Chelsea jointly bought 40 candles to decorate their room. Alyssa used half of them, and Chelsea used 70% of the remaining candles. How many candles are there in the room now?",
  "steps": [
    "Alyssa and Chelsea jointly bought 40 candles.",
    "Alyssa used half of the candles.",
    "Half of 40 candles is 40 / 2 = 20 candles.",
    "So, Alyssa used 20 candles.",
    "Candles remaining after Alyssa used them: 40 - 20 = 20 candles.",
    "Chelsea used 70% of the remaining candles.",
    "70% of 20 candles is 0.7 * 20 = 14 candles.",
    "So, Chelsea used 14 candles.",
    "Total candles used by Alyssa and Chelsea: 20 + 14 = 34 candles.",
    "Therefore, the number of candles left in the room: 40 - 34 = 6 candles."
