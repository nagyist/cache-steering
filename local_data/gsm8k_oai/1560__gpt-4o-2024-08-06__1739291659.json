If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?",

    "Yvette's budget is $60.",
    "The frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget.",
    "To find the price of the frame she wanted, calculate 20% of $60.",
    "20% of $60 is $60 * 0.20 = $12.",
    "Add this 20% to her budget to find the price of the intended frame.",
    "$60 + $12 = $72.",
    "The intended frame costs $72.",
    "She paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the price of the intended frame.",
    "Calculate 3/4 of $72.",
    "3/4 of $72 is $72 * 0.75 = $54.",
    "She paid $54 for the smaller frame.",
    "Subtract the amount paid for the smaller frame from her budget to find how much money she remained with.",
    "$60 - $54 = $6."
