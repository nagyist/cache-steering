  "query": "Enid and Aaron are knitting clothes for their store. Aaron makes 10 scarves and 5 sweaters, and Enid makes 8 sweaters. If a scarf uses 3 balls of wool and a sweater uses 4 balls of wool, how many balls of wool did Enid and Aaron use in total?",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the total balls of wool used, I need to calculate the wool used for each type of clothing: scarves and sweaters.",
    "First, I'll calculate the wool used by Aaron for the scarves.",
    "Aaron makes 10 scarves, and each scarf uses 3 balls of wool.",
    "So, for the scarves, Aaron uses \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) balls of wool.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the wool used by Aaron for the sweaters.",
    "Aaron makes 5 sweaters, and each sweater uses 4 balls of wool.",
    "So, for the sweaters, Aaron uses \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) balls of wool.",
    "Now I'll calculate the total wool used by Aaron combining both scarves and sweaters.",
    "Aaron uses \\(30 + 20 = 50\\) balls of wool in total.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the wool used by Enid.",
    "Enid makes 8 sweaters, and each sweater uses 4 balls of wool.",
    "So, for the sweaters, Enid uses \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) balls of wool.",
    "Finally, I'll calculate the total wool used by both Aaron and Enid combined.",
    "In total, they use \\(50 + 32 = 82\\) balls of wool."
