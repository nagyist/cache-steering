  "query": "A bottle of wine costs $20.00 today.  When new tariffs are imposed in 2 months, the price of wine will increase by 25%.  How much more expensive will 5 bottles of wine be in 2 months?",
  "steps": [
    "The initial cost of one bottle of wine is $20.00.",
    "The tariff will cause the price to increase by 25%.",
    "To find the increase in price for one bottle, I need to calculate 25% of $20.00.",
    "I calculate 25% of $20.00 as 0.25 * 20.00 = $5.00.",
    "The price of one bottle after the increase will be $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much more expensive 5 bottles will be.",
    "First, I calculate the original cost of 5 bottles, which is 5 * $20.00 = $100.00.",
    "Next, I calculate the new cost of 5 bottles at the higher price, which is 5 * $25.00 = $125.00.",
    "The difference in cost for 5 bottles is $125.00 - $100.00.",
    "The additional amount spent for 5 bottles will be $125.00 - $100.00 = $25.00."
