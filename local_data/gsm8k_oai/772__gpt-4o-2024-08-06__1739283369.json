  "steps": [
    "Kylie picks apples for a total of 3 hours.",
    "In the first hour, she picks 66 apples.",
    "In the second hour, she doubles her apple picking rate from the first hour.",
    "Twice 66 apples is 66 x 2 = 132 apples.",
    "In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples she picked in the first hour.",
    "A third of 66 apples is 66 / 3 = 22 apples.",
    "Now, I will add the number of apples picked each hour to find the total.",
    "66 apples (first hour) + 132 apples (second hour) + 22 apples (third hour) = 220 apples."
