  "query": "Jessica is making an apple pie. She knows that each serving requires 1.5 apples and she has 12 quests. She plans to make 3 pies, which each contain 8 servings. If her guests finish all the pie, on average , how many apples does each guest eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of servings Jessica plans to make. She is making 3 pies, and each pie has 8 servings.",
    "Multiply the number of pies by the servings per pie: 3 pies \u00d7 8 servings per pie = 24 servings.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of apples needed for the 24 servings. Each serving requires 1.5 apples.",
    "Multiply the number of servings by the apples per serving: 24 servings \u00d7 1.5 apples per serving = 36 apples.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many apples each guest eats on average. Jessica has 12 guests.",
    "Divide the total number of apples by the number of guests to find out how many apples each guest eats on average: 36 apples \u00f7 12 guests = 3 apples per guest."
