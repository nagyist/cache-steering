  "query": "Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total capacity of the bookcase.",
    "Adam's bookcase has 4 shelves, and each shelf averages 20 books.",
    "Multiplying the number of shelves by the average number of books per shelf gives the total capacity of the bookcase: 4 shelves * 20 books/shelf = 80 books.",
    "Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books.",
    "After adding the books he bought, he completely fills the bookcase and has 2 books left over. This means he has 80 books in the bookcase and 2 additional books.",
    "Altogether, after the shopping trip, Adam has 80 + 2 = 82 books.",
    "To find out how many books he bought, I need to subtract the number of books he had before the shopping trip from the total number of books he has now.",
    "He started with 56 books, so he bought 82 - 56 books during his shopping trip.",
    "Calculating the difference gives 82 - 56 = 26."

  "solution": "26"
