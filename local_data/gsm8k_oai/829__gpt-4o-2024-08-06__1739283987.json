  "query": "Jeanne wants to ride the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and the bumper cars. The Ferris wheel costs 5 tickets, the roller coaster costs 4 tickets and the bumper cars cost 4 tickets. Jeanne has 5 tickets. How many more tickets should Jeanne buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of tickets required for all the rides.",
    "The Ferris wheel costs 5 tickets.",
    "The roller coaster costs 4 tickets.",
    "The bumper cars also cost 4 tickets.",
    "I need to add these ticket costs together to find the total number of tickets required.",
    "5 tickets (Ferris wheel) + 4 tickets (roller coaster) + 4 tickets (bumper cars) = 13 tickets.",
    "Jeanne has 5 tickets already.",
    "I need to find out how many more tickets Jeanne needs to buy.",
    "13 tickets needed - 5 tickets that Jeanne already has = 8 more tickets to buy."
