  "query": "A dog runs through a field and is joined by a group of 4 cats. 2 rabbits join each cat and 3 hares join each rabbit. How many animals are running through the field?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I start with the number of dogs running through the field. There is 1 dog.",
    "Next, I consider the group of cats that join the dog. There are 4 cats.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of rabbits. Since 2 rabbits join each cat and there are 4 cats, the total number of rabbits is 4 cats \u00d7 2 rabbits/cat = 8 rabbits.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of hares. Since 3 hares join each rabbit and there are 8 rabbits, the total number of hares is 8 rabbits \u00d7 3 hares/rabbit = 24 hares.",
    "Now, I sum up all the animals: 1 dog + 4 cats + 8 rabbits + 24 hares.",
    "1 + 4 + 8 + 24 = 37."

  "solution": "37"
