  "query": "Sara got her first paycheck of two weeks of work. She had worked 40 hours a week at $11.50 per hour. The first thing she did was buy a new set of tires for her car for $410. How much money was she left with?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Sara's total earnings for the two weeks.",
    "She worked 40 hours per week, and she worked for two weeks.",
    "40 hours/week * 2 weeks = 80 hours.",
    "Her hourly wage is $11.50.",
    "Now, I multiply the total hours worked by her hourly wage to find her total earnings.",
    "80 hours * $11.50/hour = $920.",
    "Sara spent $410 on a new set of tires.",
    "I need to subtract the cost of the tires from her total earnings to find out how much money she was left with.",
    "$920 (total earnings) - $410 (cost of tires) = $510."
  ],
  "solution": "510"
