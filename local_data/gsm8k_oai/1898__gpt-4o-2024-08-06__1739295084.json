  "query": "Walter wants to serve hushpuppies to his guests for his annual fish fry event.  He thinks each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies and he is having 20 guests.  He can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes.  How long will it take to cook all of the hushpuppies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of hushpuppies Walter needs to serve.",
    "Walter thinks each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies.",
    "Walter has 20 guests.",
    "I should multiply the number of hushpuppies per guest by the number of guests to find the total number of hushpuppies needed.",
    "5 hushpuppies per guest times 20 guests equals 100 hushpuppies.",
    "Now I need to determine how long it will take to cook 100 hushpuppies.",
    "Walter can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes.",
    "I need to figure out how many batches of 10 hushpuppies are in 100 hushpuppies.",
    "100 hushpuppies divided by 10 hushpuppies per batch equals 10 batches.",
    "Next, I must calculate the total time it will take to cook 10 batches.",
    "Each batch takes 8 minutes to cook.",
    "10 batches times 8 minutes per batch results in a total of 80 minutes."
