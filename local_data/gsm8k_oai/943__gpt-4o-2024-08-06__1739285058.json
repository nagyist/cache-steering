  "query": "Javier is selling donuts to raise money for a new game. He wants to raise $96. He buys each dozen donuts for $2.40 and then sells each donut for $1. How many dozen donuts does he need to buy and sell to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much profit Javier makes on selling one dozen donuts.",
    "He sells each donut for $1, and there are 12 donuts in a dozen.",
    "Therefore, each dozen donuts sells for 12 x $1 = $12.",
    "He buys each dozen for $2.40.",
    "The profit on each dozen is $12 - $2.40.",
    "Calculate the profit: $12 - $2.40 = $9.60.",
    "Javier's goal is to raise $96.",
    "I need to find out how many dozens he has to sell to make $96.",
    "If he makes $9.60 per dozen, I can divide his goal by the profit per dozen.",
    "Divide: $96 / $9.60.",
    "The result is 10."
