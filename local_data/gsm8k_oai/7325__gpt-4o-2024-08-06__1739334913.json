  "query": "John is 15 cm taller than Lena and 6 cm shorter than Rebeca. If John has a height of 152 cm, what is the height of Lena and Rebeca together?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by understanding the problem. John is 15 cm taller than Lena and 6 cm shorter than Rebeca.",
    "John's height is given as 152 cm.",
    "To find Lena's height, I need to subtract 15 cm from John's height because he is 15 cm taller than Lena.",
    "Lena's height = 152 cm - 15 cm = 137 cm.",
    "Next, I need to find Rebeca's height by adding 6 cm to John's height because John is 6 cm shorter than Rebeca.",
    "Rebeca's height = 152 cm + 6 cm = 158 cm.",
    "Now, I need to find the combined height of Lena and Rebeca.",
    "Combined height = Lena's height + Rebeca's height = 137 cm + 158 cm.",
    "Perform the addition: 137 cm + 158 cm = 295 cm."

  "solution": "295"
