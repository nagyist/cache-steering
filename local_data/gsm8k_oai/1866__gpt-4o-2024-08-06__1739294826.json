  "query": "Carolyn wants to embroider her new jeans. She can sew 4 stitches/minute. A flower takes 60 stitches to embroider, a unicorn takes 180 stitches, and Godzilla takes 800 stitches. If Carolyn wants to embroider Godzilla crushing 3 unicorns and 50 flowers, how many minutes does she need to spend embroidering?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many stitches are required to embroider one Godzilla.",
    "A Godzilla requires 800 stitches.",
    "Next, determine how many stitches are required for one unicorn.",
    "A unicorn requires 180 stitches.",
    "Calculate the total number of stitches for 3 unicorns.",
    "3 unicorns require 3 * 180 = 540 stitches.",
    "Next, determine how many stitches are required for one flower.",
    "A flower requires 60 stitches.",
    "Calculate the total number of stitches for 50 flowers.",
    "50 flowers require 50 * 60 = 3000 stitches.",
    "Now add up all the stitches Carolyn needs to embroider Godzilla crushing 3 unicorns and 50 flowers.",
    "Total stitches = 800 (for Godzilla) + 540 (for 3 unicorns) + 3000 (for 50 flowers)",
    "Add these numbers together: 800 + 540 + 3000",
    "The total number of stitches is 4340.",
    "Now, calculate the time Carolyn needs to sew 4340 stitches if she sews at a rate of 4 stitches per minute.",
    "Divide the total number of stitches by the stitches per minute rate: 4340 / 4",
    "4340 divided by 4 equals 1085."

  "solution": "1085"
