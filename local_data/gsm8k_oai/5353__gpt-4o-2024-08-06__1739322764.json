  "query": "A pet shop has 2 puppies and some kittens. A puppy costs $20, and a kitten costs $15. If the stock is worth $100, how many kittens does the pet shop have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine the total cost of the puppies.",
    "There are 2 puppies each costing $20.",
    "So, the total cost of the puppies is 2 * $20 = $40.",
    "Now, I'll find out how much the kittens contribute to the total stock value.",
    "The total stock value is $100.",
    "Subtracting the cost of the puppies, the remaining value for kittens is $100 - $40 = $60.",
    "Each kitten costs $15.",
    "I'll calculate how many kittens can be bought for $60.",
    "Number of kittens = $60 / $15 per kitten.",
    "$60 divided by $15 equals 4.",
    "Thus, there are 4 kittens in the shop."
