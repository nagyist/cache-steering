  "query": "In 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee. If Kilee is currently 20 years old, how old is Cornelia now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Kilee will be in 10 years.",
    "Kilee is currently 20 years old.",
    "In 10 years, Kilee will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old.",
    "According to the problem, in 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee.",
    "If Kilee will be 30 years old in 10 years, Cornelia will be 3 times 30 = 90 years old at that time.",
    "Now, I need to determine Cornelia's current age based on her age in 10 years.",
    "Cornelia's age in 10 years is 90 years old.",
    "Therefore, Cornelia's current age is 90 - 10 = 80 years old."
