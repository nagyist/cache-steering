  "steps": [
    "Will's breakfast supplied him with 900 calories.",
    "He jogged for half an hour, which is 30 minutes.",
    "He used up 10 calories per minute while jogging.",
    "To find out how many calories he used during jogging, I multiply the number of minutes jogged (30) by the calories used per minute (10).",
    "30 minutes x 10 calories/minute = 300 calories used.",
    "Now, I'll calculate Will's net calorie intake by subtracting the calories he used from the calories he consumed at breakfast.",
    "900 calories (breakfast) - 300 calories (jogging) = 600 calories."
