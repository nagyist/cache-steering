  "query": "Oliver has two bags of vegetables. Each bag weighs 1/6 as much as James\u2019s bag, which weighs 18kg. What is the combined weight of both Oliver\u2019s bags?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the weight of one of Oliver's bags.",
    "Each of Oliver\u2019s bags weighs 1/6 as much as James\u2019s bag.",
    "James's bag weighs 18 kg.",
    "To find the weight of one of Oliver's bags, I calculate 1/6 of 18 kg.",
    "1/6 of 18 kg is calculated as 18 kg divided by 6.",
    "18 kg divided by 6 equals 3 kg.",
    "So, one of Oliver's bags weighs 3 kg.",
    "Now I need to find the combined weight of both of Oliver's bags.",
    "Since each bag weighs 3 kg, two bags will weigh 3 kg + 3 kg.",
    "3 kg + 3 kg equals 6 kg."
