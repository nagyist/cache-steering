  "query": "In the Oprah Winfrey High School marching band, each trumpet and clarinet player carries 5 pounds of weight, each trombone player carries 10 pounds of weight, each tuba player carries 20 pounds of weight, and each drum player carries 15 pounds of weight. If there are 6 trumpets, 9 clarinets, 8 trombones, 3 tubas, and 2 drummers, how much weight does the total marching band carry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of players for each instrument: 6 trumpets, 9 clarinets, 8 trombones, 3 tubas, and 2 drummers.",
    "Calculate the total weight carried by the trumpet players: 6 trumpets each carrying 5 pounds.",
    "6 trumpets x 5 pounds per trumpet = 30 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total weight carried by the clarinet players: 9 clarinets each carrying 5 pounds.",
    "9 clarinets x 5 pounds per clarinet = 45 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total weight carried by the trombone players: 8 trombones each carrying 10 pounds.",
    "8 trombones x 10 pounds per trombone = 80 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total weight carried by the tuba players: 3 tubas each carrying 20 pounds.",
    "3 tubas x 20 pounds per tuba = 60 pounds.",
    "Calculate the total weight carried by the drum players: 2 drummers each carrying 15 pounds.",
    "2 drummers x 15 pounds per drummer = 30 pounds.",
    "Add all the weights together to find the total weight carried by the marching band.",
    "30 pounds (trumpets) + 45 pounds (clarinets) + 80 pounds (trombones) + 60 pounds (tubas) + 30 pounds (drummers).",
    "30 + 45 + 80 + 60 + 30 = 245 pounds."
