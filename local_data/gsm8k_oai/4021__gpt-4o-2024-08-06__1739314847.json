  "query": "Jake decides to go to the beach for a fun day.  It is a 2-hour drive each way.  He then spends 2.5 times at long at the beach as his total driving time.  How much time does the trip take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total driving time.",
    "The drive to the beach takes 2 hours each way.",
    "So, the round trip driving time is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.",
    "Next, I need to find how long Jake spends at the beach.",
    "Jake spends 2.5 times as long at the beach as his total driving time.",
    "His total driving time is 4 hours.",
    "Therefore, time spent at the beach is 2.5 times 4 hours.",
    "Calculating that, 2.5 * 4 = 10 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find the total time for the entire trip.",
    "The total trip time is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the beach.",
    "Total trip time = Driving time (4 hours) + Beach time (10 hours).",
    "Total trip time = 4 + 10 = 14 hours."

  "solution": "14"
