  "query": "Kendall is counting her change. She has a total of $4 in quarters, dimes, and nickels. If she has 10 quarters and 12 dimes, how many nickels does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total value of the quarters. Kendall has 10 quarters.",
    "Each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 10 quarters is 10 * $0.25.",
    "10 * $0.25 equals $2.50.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total value of the dimes. Kendall has 12 dimes.",
    "Each dime is worth $0.10. Therefore, the total value of 12 dimes is 12 * $0.10.",
    "12 * $0.10 equals $1.20.",
    "Now, I will add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the combined value.",
    "The value of the quarters is $2.50 and the value of the dimes is $1.20.",
    "$2.50 + $1.20 equals $3.70.",
    "Kendall has a total of $4.00. To find the value of the nickels, I will subtract the combined value of the quarters and dimes from $4.00.",
    "$4.00 - $3.70 equals $0.30.",
    "The total value of the nickels is $0.30. Each nickel is worth $0.05.",
    "To find out how many nickels Kendall has, I will divide $0.30 by $0.05.",
    "$0.30 \u00f7 $0.05 equals 6."

  "solution": "6"
