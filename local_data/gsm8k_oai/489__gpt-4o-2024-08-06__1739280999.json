  "query": "At a certain bookstore, the best-selling book, \"TOP,\" costs $8. The least-selling book, \"ABC,\" costs $23. Thirteen \"TOP\" books and four \"ABC\" books were sold last week. What is the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total earnings from the sale of the \"TOP\" books.",
    "The cost of one \"TOP\" book is $8.",
    "Thirteen \"TOP\" books were sold.",
    "The total earnings from \"TOP\" books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by their price: 13 * $8.",
    "13 * $8 equals $104.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total earnings from the sale of the \"ABC\" books.",
    "The cost of one \"ABC\" book is $23.",
    "Four \"ABC\" books were sold.",
    "The total earnings from \"ABC\" books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books sold by their price: 4 * $23.",
    "4 * $23 equals $92.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in earnings between \"TOP\" books and \"ABC\" books.",
    "The earnings from \"TOP\" books is $104 and the earnings from \"ABC\" books is $92.",
    "The difference in earnings is $104 - $92.",
    "$104 - $92 equals $12."
