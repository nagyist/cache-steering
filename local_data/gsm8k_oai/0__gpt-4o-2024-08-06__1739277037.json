    "First, I need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in April.",
    "According to the problem, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many clips she sold in May. The problem states that she sold half as many clips in May as in April.",
    "To find how many she sold in May, I take half of 48.",
    "Half of 48 is 48 divided by 2.",
    "48 divided by 2 equals 24.",
    "Natalia sold 24 clips in May.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of clips Natalia sold in both April and May.",
    "To find the total, I add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May.",
    "That is 48 (April) plus 24 (May).",
    "48 plus 24 equals 72."
