  "query": "John buys a gaming PC for $1200.  He decides to replace the video card in it. He sells the old card for $300 and buys a new one for $500.  How much money did he spend on his computer, counting the savings from selling the old card?",
  "steps": [
    "John buys the gaming PC initially for $1200.",
    "John decides to replace the video card in the PC.",
    "He sells the old video card for $300.",
    "He buys a new video card for $500.",
    "To calculate the total amount John spent on the computer, taking into account the savings by selling the old card, I need to consider both the initial purchase and the changes to the video card.",
    "The savings from selling the old video card is $300.",
    "So, the net cost for the new video card is $500 - $300 = $200.",
    "Adding this to the initial cost of the computer gives $1200 + $200.",
    "Calculating this gives $1400."

  "solution": "1400"
