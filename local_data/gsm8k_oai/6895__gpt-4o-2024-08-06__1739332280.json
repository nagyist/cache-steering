  "query": "John and James decided to have a dance-off.  John danced for 3 hours and then another 5 hours after taking a 1-hour break.  James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting, and then another 1/3 times more hours.  How long was their combined dancing time without including  John's break time?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how long John danced in total. He danced for 3 hours initially.",
    "Then, John danced for another 5 hours after the 1-hour break. So in total, John danced for 3 + 5 = 8 hours.",
    "James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting. John's total time including the break is 3 + 1 + 5 = 9 hours.",
    "James then danced for an additional 1/3 more hours than the 9 hours. To find this calculated time, calculate 1/3 of 9 which is 3. So, James danced for 9 + 3 = 12 hours in total.",
    "Now, find their combined dancing time without including John's break time. John's dancing time was 8 hours and James' was 12 hours.",
    "Add John's and James's dancing times: 8 hours + 12 hours = 20 hours."
