  "query": "In the baking contest, three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake, and the number of votes for the dragon cake was 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. If 7 people voted for the witch cake, how many votes were cast total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many votes were cast for each type of cake.",
    "The problem states that three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake compared to the witch cake.",
    "The number of votes for the witch cake is given as 7.",
    "Therefore, the number of votes for the unicorn cake is 3 times 7, which is 21.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of votes for the dragon cake.",
    "The problem states that the dragon cake received 25 more votes than the witch cake.",
    "Since there were 7 votes for the witch cake, the dragon cake received 7 + 25 = 32 votes.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of votes cast in the contest.",
    "I sum the votes for all three cakes: witch cake (7) + unicorn cake (21) + dragon cake (32).",
    "This gives me a total of 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 votes."

  "solution": "60"
