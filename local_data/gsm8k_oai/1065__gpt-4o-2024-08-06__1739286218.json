  "query": "John has a raw squat of 600 pounds without sleeves or wraps.  Sleeves add 30 pounds to his lift.  Wraps add 25% to his squat.  How much more pounds does he get out of wraps versus sleeves.",
  "steps": [
    "John's raw squat is 600 pounds.",
    "Sleeves add 30 pounds to his raw squat.",
    "With sleeves, John's squat becomes 600 + 30 = 630 pounds.",
    "Wraps add 25% to his raw squat.",
    "To calculate 25% of 600 pounds, I'll multiply 600 by 0.25.",
    "600 * 0.25 = 150",
    "With wraps, John's squat becomes 600 + 150 = 750 pounds.",
    "Now I need to find out how much more pounds John gets from wraps compared to sleeves.",
    "Wraps allow him to lift 750 pounds, while sleeves allow 630 pounds.",
    "The difference is 750 - 630.",
    "750 - 630 = 120"
