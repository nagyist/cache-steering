  "query": "A professional company is hiring for a new position. They have two qualified applicants. The first applicant will accept a salary of $42000 and make the company $93000 in the first year, but needs 3 months of additional training that costs $1200 a month. The second applicant does not need training and will make the company $92000 in the first year, but is requesting a salary of $45000 and a hiring bonus of 1% of his salary. Less the amount it will cost to pay for each candidate, how many more dollars will one candidate make the company than the other in the first year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the first applicant. Their salary is $42,000.",
    "The first applicant requires 3 months of training at $1,200 per month. I will calculate the training cost: 3 months * $1,200/month = $3,600.",
    "The total cost for the first applicant is their salary plus the training cost. Total cost = $42,000 + $3,600 = $45,600.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for the second applicant. Their salary is $45,000, and they request a hiring bonus of 1% of that salary.",
    "To find the hiring bonus, I calculate 1% of $45,000 = $450.",
    "The total cost for the second applicant is their salary plus the hiring bonus. Total cost = $45,000 + $450 = $45,450.",
    "The first applicant will make the company $93,000 in the first year. Therefore, I calculate the profit from the first applicant: $93,000 - $45,600 = $47,400.",
    "The second applicant will make the company $92,000 in the first year. Therefore, I calculate the profit from the second applicant: $92,000 - $45,450 = $46,550.",
    "I need to find out how many more dollars one candidate will make the company than the other by comparing the profits: $47,400 - $46,550.",
    "The first applicant makes the company $47,400 - $46,550 = $850 more than the second applicant in the first year."
