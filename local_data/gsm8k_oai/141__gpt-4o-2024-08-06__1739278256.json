  "query": "Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?",
  "steps": [
    "Larry walks and plays with his dog for half an hour each session.",
    "He does this twice a day.",
    "This means he spends \\(0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ hour}\\) walking and playing with his dog daily.",
    "Larry also spends a fifth of an hour feeding his dog daily.",
    "A fifth of an hour is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour} \\).",
    "Now, let's add up the total hours Larry spends on his dog each day: \\(1 \\text{ hour} + \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour} = \\frac{6}{5} \\text{ hours} \\).",
    "To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).",
    "\\(\\frac{6}{5} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 72 \\text{ minutes} \\)."
