  "query": "Nikola is saving up for a bag of ant food before he can start his ant farm. He wants 400 ants in his farm. Each ant needs 2 ounces of food. Every ounce of ant food costs $.1. Nikola is saving up by raking leaves. He charges $5 to start a job and then he charges by the leaf. Each leaf he rakes costs 1 penny. He finally saved up enough money after he raked 6,000 leaves. How many jobs did he complete?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of food needed for 400 ants.",
    "Each ant needs 2 ounces of food, so for 400 ants, Nikola needs 400 * 2 = 800 ounces of food.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of 800 ounces of food. Each ounce costs $0.1.",
    "The cost for 800 ounces is 800 * 0.1 = $80.",
    "Nikola rakes 6,000 leaves and charges 1 penny per leaf. Therefore, I need to find the total earnings from raking leaves.",
    "Raking 6,000 leaves at 1 penny each gives him 6,000 * 0.01 = $60 from leaves.",
    "Nikola's total earnings from raking leaves and starting charges must equal $80.",
    "He makes $60 from leaves, so he needs $80 - $60 = $20 more.",
    "Since he charges $5 to start a job, I need to determine how many jobs are needed for him to make $20 from starting charges.",
    "Each job gives him $5 from the starting charge. To make $20, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 jobs."
