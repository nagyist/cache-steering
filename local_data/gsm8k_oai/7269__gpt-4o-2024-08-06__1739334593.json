  "query": "Stan hires a magician for $60 an hour.  He works 3 hours every day for 2 weeks.  How much money does he pay the magician?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days Stan hires the magician for.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Stan hires the magician for 2 weeks.",
    "So, he hires the magician for 2 weeks x 7 days/week = 14 days.",
    "Next, I calculate how many hours the magician works in total.",
    "The magician works 3 hours each day.",
    "So, over 14 days, the magician works 14 days x 3 hours/day = 42 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.",
    "The magician charges $60 per hour.",
    "So, the total cost is 42 hours x $60/hour = $2520."
  ],
  "solution": "2520"
