  "query": "Tanya went to the grocery store to buy some fruit.  She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which were all placed in a single paper bag.  Unfortunately, the bag that the fruit had been placed in had developed a hole.  Therefore, as Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out of the bag.  When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will find the total number of fruits Tanya initially bought. She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a basket of plums.",
    "The total number of pears, apples, and pineapples is 6 (pears) + 4 (apples) + 2 (pineapples) = 12 fruits.",
    "Let's denote the unknown number of plums in the basket as \"p\".",
    "Therefore, the total initial number of fruits can be expressed as 12 + p.",
    "We know that half of these fruits fell out of the bag.",
    "That means the number of fruits that remained in the bag is half of the original amount, which we know to be 9 fruits.",
    "According to the problem, half of the fruits fell out, meaning the number of remaining fruits is half of the total initial number.",
    "So the equation would be (12 + p) / 2 = 9.",
    "To find \"p\", I will multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 12 + p = 18.",
    "Now, I will solve for \"p\" by subtracting 12 from both sides: p = 18 - 12.",
    "Therefore, p = 6."
