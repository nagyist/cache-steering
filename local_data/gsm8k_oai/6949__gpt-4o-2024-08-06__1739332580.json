  "query": "John eats 10 potato chips that have a total of 60 calories.  He then eats 6 cheezits that each have 1/3 more calories than a chip.  How many total calories did he eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that 10 potato chips have a total of 60 calories.",
    "To find out how many calories are in one potato chip, I divide 60 calories by 10 chips.",
    "60 divided by 10 equals 6. So, one potato chip has 6 calories.",
    "Next, John eats 6 cheezits, and each cheezit has 1/3 more calories than a chip.",
    "One third of a chip's calories is calculated by multiplying 1/3 by 6.",
    "1/3 of 6 is 2. So, each cheezit has 6 + 2 calories.",
    "6 + 2 equals 8. Thus, each cheezit has 8 calories.",
    "Now, John eats 6 cheezits, each with 8 calories, so I calculate the total calories consumed from cheezits.",
    "6 times 8 equals 48. Therefore, John eats 48 calories from cheezits.",
    "Finally, I add the calories from the potato chips to the calories from the cheezits to find the total.",
    "John ate 60 calories from chips and 48 calories from cheezits.",
    "60 plus 48 equals 108."

  "solution": "108"
