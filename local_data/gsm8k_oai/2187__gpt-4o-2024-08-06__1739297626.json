  "query": "There are 10 students in a class. The average age of 9 of them is 8 years. By how many years will this average increase if the tenth student is (quite strangely) 28 years old?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total age of the first 9 students. If their average age is 8 years, the total age can be found by multiplying the average by the number of students.",
    "Total age of first 9 students = 8 years/student * 9 students = 72 years.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total age of all 10 students, including the tenth student who is 28 years old.",
    "Adding the age of the tenth student, the total age of all 10 students = 72 years + 28 years = 100 years.",
    "Now, I calculate the new average age for all 10 students by dividing the total age by 10.",
    "New average age = 100 years / 10 students = 10 years.",
    "The average age of the first 9 students was 8 years. The new average age is 10 years. I need to find the difference.",
    "The increase in the average age = 10 years - 8 years = 2 years."
