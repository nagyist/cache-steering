  "query": "Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister while Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne. If Anne is 80cm tall, what is the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the height of Anne's sister. I know that Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister.",
    "I know Anne is 80 cm tall.",
    "If Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister, then her sister would be 80 cm divided by 2.",
    "80 divided by 2 equals 40. So, Anne's sister is 40 cm tall.",
    "Now, I need to find Bella's height. Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne.",
    "Anne is 80 cm tall, so I multiply 80 by 3 to find Bella's height.",
    "80 times 3 equals 240. So, Bella is 240 cm tall.",
    "Now, I need to find the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister.",
    "Bella is 240 cm tall, and Anne's sister is 40 cm tall.",
    "I subtract the height of Anne's sister from Bella's height: 240 minus 40.",
    "240 minus 40 equals 200."

  "solution": "200"
