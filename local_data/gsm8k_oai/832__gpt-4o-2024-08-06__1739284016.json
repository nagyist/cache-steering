  "query": "John buys 1000 balloons.  Each balloon holds 10 liters of air.  If he buys 500-liter tanks of gas, how many tanks does he need to buy to fill all the balloons?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total volume of air required to fill all the balloons.",
    "Each balloon holds 10 liters of air.",
    "John has 1000 balloons.",
    "To find the total volume, multiply the number of balloons by the volume one balloon holds: 1000 balloons * 10 liters/balloon.",
    "This results in a total of 10,000 liters of air needed.",
    "Next, I need to see how many tanks are required based on the total air volume needed.",
    "Each tank has a capacity of 500 liters.",
    "To find the number of tanks required, divide the total volume of air needed by the volume of one tank: 10,000 liters / 500 liters/tank.",
    "The division results in 20.",
    "Therefore, John needs to buy 20 tanks to fill all the balloons."
