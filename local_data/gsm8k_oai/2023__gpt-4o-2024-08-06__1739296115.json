  "query": "If Beth is 18 years old and her little sister is 5, in how many years would she be twice her sister's age?",
  "steps": [
    "Beth is currently 18 years old.",
    "Her little sister is currently 5 years old.",
    "I need to find in how many years Beth will be twice the age of her sister.",
    "Let's assume that the number of years from now when Beth will be twice the age of her sister is \"x\" years.",
    "In \"x\" years, Beth's age will be 18 + x.",
    "In \"x\" years, her sister's age will be 5 + x.",
    "I need the equation for when Beth's age is twice her sister's age: 18 + x = 2 * (5 + x).",
    "Simplifying the equation: 18 + x = 10 + 2x.",
    "Subtract x from both sides: 18 = 10 + x.",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides: 8 = x.",
    "In 8 years, Beth will be twice her sister's age."

  "solution": "8"
