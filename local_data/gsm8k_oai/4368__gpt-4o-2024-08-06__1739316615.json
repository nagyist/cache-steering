  "query": "Joy has 250 feet of tape. She wants to wrap the tape around a field that is 20 feet wide and 60 feet long. How much tape will Joy have left over after wrapping tape around the field once?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the field around which Joy wants to wrap the tape.",
    "The field is rectangular with a width of 20 feet and a length of 60 feet.",
    "The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of the length and the width.",
    "So, I add the width and the length: 20 feet + 60 feet = 80 feet.",
    "Next, I multiply the sum by 2 to get the perimeter: 2 * 80 feet = 160 feet.",
    "Now, I know that Joy will use 160 feet of tape to wrap around the field once.",
    "Joy originally has 250 feet of tape.",
    "To find how much tape is left over after wrapping, subtract the used tape from the original length: 250 feet - 160 feet.",
    "250 feet - 160 feet equals 90 feet."

  "solution": "90"
