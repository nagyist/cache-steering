  "query": "A bird watcher records the number of birds he sees each day.  One Monday he sees 70 birds.  On Tuesday he sees half as many birds as he did on Monday.  On Wednesday he sees 8 more birds than he did on Tuesday.  How many total birds did the bird watcher see from Monday to Wednesday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many birds the bird watcher saw on Tuesday. If he saw 70 birds on Monday, then on Tuesday he sees half as many.",
    "To find half of 70, I divide 70 by 2.",
    "70 divided by 2 is 35. Therefore, the bird watcher saw 35 birds on Tuesday.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many birds he saw on Wednesday. He sees 8 more birds on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday.",
    "I already know he saw 35 birds on Tuesday, so I need to add 8 to 35.",
    "35 plus 8 equals 43. So, the bird watcher saw 43 birds on Wednesday.",
    "Now, I have the number of birds seen on each day: 70 on Monday, 35 on Tuesday, and 43 on Wednesday.",
    "I need to find the total number of birds seen from Monday to Wednesday by adding these numbers together.",
    "The total is 70 (Monday) + 35 (Tuesday) + 43 (Wednesday).",
    "70 plus 35 is 105.",
    "105 plus 43 is 148."
  ],
  "solution": "148"
