  "query": "Federal guidelines recommend eating at least 2 cups of vegetables per day. From breakfast on Sunday to the end of the day on Thursday, Sarah has eaten 8 cups. How many cups per day does Sarah need to eat of her vegetables in order to meet her daily minimum requirement for the week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Sarah has eaten 8 cups of vegetables from Sunday morning to Thursday night.",
    "The week is from Sunday to Saturday, so I need to find out how many days are left in the week from Friday to Saturday.",
    "There are 5 days from Sunday to Thursday (inclusive).",
    "A week has 7 days, so there are 7 - 5 = 2 days left in the week: Friday and Saturday.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of cups of vegetables Sarah should eat in a week.",
    "The guidelines recommend 2 cups per day. For 7 days, that totals 7 * 2 = 14 cups of vegetables.",
    "Sarah has already eaten 8 cups, so we subtract the amount she has already eaten from what she needs in total: 14 - 8 = 6 cups.",
    "Sarah needs to eat these remaining 6 cups over the next 2 days (Friday and Saturday).",
    "To find out how many cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat per day on Friday and Saturday, divide the remaining cups by the number of days left: 6 cups \u00f7 2 days = 3 cups per day."
