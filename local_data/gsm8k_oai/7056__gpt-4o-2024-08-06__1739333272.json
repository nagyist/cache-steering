  "query": "There are 30 students in the general study hall and twice as many students in the biology hall as there are in the general study hall. If the number of students in the math hall is 3/5 times as many as the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall combined,  calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many students are in the biology hall. According to the problem, there are twice as many students in the biology hall as there are in the general study hall.",
    "There are 30 students in the general study hall.",
    "Twice as many as 30 is calculated by multiplying 30 by 2.",
    "30 * 2 = 60.",
    "So, there are 60 students in the biology hall.",
    "Next step is to calculate the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall.",
    "General study hall has 30 students and biology hall has 60 students.",
    "I add these numbers together to find the total: 30 + 60 = 90.",
    "Now, I calculate how many students are in the math hall. The math hall has 3/5 times as many students as the total from the general study hall and biology hall combined.",
    "First, I calculate 3/5 of 90.",
    "90 * (3/5) = 54.",
    "So, there are 54 students in the math hall.",
    "Now, I add the number of students in all the halls together to find the total number of students.",
    "The general study hall has 30 students, the biology hall has 60 students, and the math hall has 54 students.",
    "I add them all together: 30 + 60 + 54 = 144.",
    "Therefore, the total number of students in all the halls combined is 144."
