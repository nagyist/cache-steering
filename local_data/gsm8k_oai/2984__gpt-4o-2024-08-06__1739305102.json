  "query": "Joshua packs 12 bottles in each crate. He has a total of 130 bottles and 10 crates. How many bottles will not be placed in a crate?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bottles can be placed in the crates Joshua has.",
    "He has 10 crates and packs 12 bottles in each crate.",
    "To find out the total number of bottles that can be packed in the crates, I multiply 10 crates by 12 bottles per crate.",
    "10 crates * 12 bottles/crate = 120 bottles.",
    "Joshua has a total of 130 bottles.",
    "I need to determine the number of bottles that will not be packed in the crates.",
    "I subtract the number of bottles that can be packed (120) from the total number of bottles (130).",
    "130 total bottles - 120 bottles packed = 10 bottles not packed."
