  "query": "The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms across all three cylindrical structures.",
    "Each cylindrical structure has 12 bedrooms. With three structures, the total number of bedrooms is 12 * 3 = 36 bedrooms.",
    "Each cylindrical structure also has 7 bathrooms. With three structures, the total number of bathrooms is 7 * 3 = 21 bathrooms.",
    "Now, I add the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms together: 36 bedrooms + 21 bathrooms = 57 rooms.",
    "According to the problem, the entire space station has 72 rooms. I need to find out how many of these rooms are kitchens.",
    "Subtract the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms from the total number of rooms: 72 rooms - 57 rooms = 15 kitchens."

  "solution": "15"
