  "query": "The age of a lioness in a park is twice the age of a hyena in the same park. The lioness is 12 years old. If the babies of the two animals are half the age of their mothers, calculate the sum of the age of the babies in five years.",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the information given in the problem. The first piece of information is that the lioness is 12 years old.",
    "Next, the problem states that the lioness's age is twice the age of the hyena. I will use this to determine the hyena's current age.",
    "If the lioness's age (12 years) is twice the age of the hyena, then the hyena's age can be calculated as follows: hyena's age = 12 / 2.",
    "Calculating the above gives me the hyena's age as 6 years.",
    "The problem states that the babies of the two animals are half the age of their mothers. I will calculate the age of the lioness's baby.",
    "The lioness is 12 years old, so her baby's age is 12 / 2.",
    "The baby of the lioness is therefore 6 years old.",
    "Next, I calculate the age of the hyena's baby. The hyena is 6 years old, so her baby's age is 6 / 2.",
    "The baby of the hyena is therefore 3 years old.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the sum of the ages of both babies in five years.",
    "In five years, the lioness's baby will be 6 + 5 years old.",
    "Calculating, I find that the lioness's baby will be 11 years old in five years.",
    "Similarly, in five years, the hyena's baby will be 3 + 5 years old.",
    "Calculating, I find that the hyena's baby will be 8 years old in five years.",
    "Now, I add the ages of the two babies in five years: 11 + 8.",
    "Calculating the sum gives me 19."
