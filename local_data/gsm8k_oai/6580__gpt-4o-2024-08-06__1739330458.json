  "query": "Toby is filling his swimming pool for the summer. The pool normally takes 50 hours to fill. He knows his hose runs at 100 gallons per hour. Water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons. How many dollars does it cost to fill the pool?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of water required to fill the pool.",
    "The hose runs at 100 gallons per hour.",
    "The pool takes 50 hours to fill.",
    "To find the total gallons needed, I multiply the flow rate by the time: 100 gallons/hour * 50 hours.",
    "The total amount of water required is 100 * 50 = 5000 gallons.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of 5000 gallons of water.",
    "Water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons.",
    "To find out how many sets of 10 gallons are in 5000 gallons, I divide 5000 by 10.",
    "5000 / 10 = 500 sets of 10 gallons.",
    "Since it costs 1 cent for each 10 gallons, the total cost in cents is 500 sets * 1 cent.",
    "Thus, the total cost is 500 cents.",
    "Now, I need to convert the cost from cents to dollars.",
    "There are 100 cents in a dollar.",
    "So, I divide 500 cents by 100 to convert to dollars.",
    "500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars."
