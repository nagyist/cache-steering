  "query": "Billy is reducing raspberry juice down to make syrup. He reduces 6 quarts of juice to 1/12 of its original volume, then adds 1 cup of sugar. What is the final volume of the syrup in cups? (There are 4 cups in a quart)",
  "steps": [
    "Start by converting quarts to cups. There are 4 cups in a quart.",
    "Billy starts with 6 quarts of raspberry juice.",
    "Convert 6 quarts to cups by multiplying 6 by 4.",
    "6 quarts * 4 cups/quart = 24 cups of raspberry juice initially.",
    "He reduces the juice to 1/12 of its original volume.",
    "Calculate 1/12 of 24 cups.",
    "24 / 12 = 2 cups.",
    "The reduced raspberry juice is now 2 cups.",
    "Billy then adds 1 cup of sugar to the reduced juice.",
    "Add the 1 cup of sugar to the 2 cups of reduced raspberry juice.",
    "2 cups + 1 cup = 3 cups.",
    "The final volume of the syrup is 3 cups."
