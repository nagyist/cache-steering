  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the initial number of ants in the jar, which is 50.",
    "I note that the number of ants doubles each hour.",
    "I need to calculate the number of ants after 5 hours.",
    "For the first hour, if the ants double, the number of ants will be: 50 * 2 = 100.",
    "For the second hour, the number of ants will be: 100 * 2 = 200.",
    "For the third hour, the number of ants will be: 200 * 2 = 400.",
    "For the fourth hour, the number of ants will be: 400 * 2 = 800.",
    "For the fifth hour, the number of ants will be: 800 * 2 = 1600."
