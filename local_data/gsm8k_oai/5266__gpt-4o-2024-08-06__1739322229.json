  "query": "Kenny plans to mow lawns all summer, and then use the profits to buy video-games and books. He charges $15 per lawn. The video-games are $45 each. The books are $5 each. At the end of the summer he has mowed 35 lawns. There are 5 video-games he really wants, and then he will use the rest for books. How many books can he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Kenny earns by mowing 35 lawns.",
    "Kenny charges $15 per lawn.",
    "He mows 35 lawns.",
    "To find the total earnings, I multiply the number of lawns by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.",
    "35 * 15 = 525.",
    "So, Kenny earns $525 by mowing lawns.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much money Kenny will spend on video-games.",
    "Each video-game costs $45.",
    "There are 5 video-games he really wants.",
    "To calculate the total cost of the video-games, I multiply the number of video-games by the cost per video-game: 5 games * $45/game.",
    "5 * 45 = 225.",
    "Kenny will spend $225 on video-games.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much money Kenny will have left after buying the video-games.",
    "His total earnings are $525.",
    "He spends $225 on video-games.",
    "I subtract the cost of the video-games from his total earnings: $525 - $225.",
    "525 - 225 = 300.",
    "Kenny has $300 left after buying the video-games.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many books Kenny can buy.",
    "Each book costs $5.",
    "To find the number of books he can buy, I divide the remaining money by the cost per book: $300 / $5/book.",
    "300 / 5 = 60."
  ],
  "solution": "60"
