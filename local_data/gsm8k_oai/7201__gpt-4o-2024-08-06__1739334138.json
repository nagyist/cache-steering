  "query": "In one day, 200 people visit The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Half of the visitors are residents of New York City. Of the NYC residents, 30% are college students. If the cost of a college student ticket is $4, how much money does the museum get from college students that are residents of NYC?",
  "steps": [
    "The total number of visitors in one day is 200.",
    "Half of the visitors are residents of New York City.",
    "Half of 200 is 100. So, there are 100 NYC residents visiting.",
    "30% of the NYC residents are college students.",
    "30% of 100 is calculated as 100 * 0.30 = 30.",
    "There are 30 college students who are NYC residents.",
    "Each college student pays $4 for a ticket.",
    "The total revenue from these college students is 30 students * $4 per student.",
    "Calculating 30 * 4 gives us $120."
