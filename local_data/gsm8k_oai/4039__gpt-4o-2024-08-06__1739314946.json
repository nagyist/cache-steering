  "query": "Jenna is planning a road trip. She plans on driving the first 200 miles, and her friend will drive the last 100 miles. They plan on taking 2 30-minute breaks. If Jenna drives 50 miles per hour and her friend drives 20 miles per hour, how many hours will they spend on the road trip?",
  "steps": [
    "Jenna will drive 200 miles.",
    "Jenna's driving speed is 50 miles per hour.",
    "To calculate the time Jenna will spend driving, I divide the distance by her speed.",
    "200 miles \u00f7 50 miles per hour = 4 hours.",
    "Her friend will drive 100 miles.",
    "Her friend's driving speed is 20 miles per hour.",
    "To calculate the time her friend will spend driving, I divide the distance by his speed.",
    "100 miles \u00f7 20 miles per hour = 5 hours.",
    "Now, I need to add the driving times together: Jenna's 4 hours plus her friend's 5 hours.",
    "4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours of driving.",
    "They plan on taking 2 breaks, each lasting 30 minutes.",
    "Each break is 0.5 hours long (30 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour).",
    "Two breaks would total 1 hour (0.5 hours \u00d7 2).",
    "Add the break time to the total driving time: 9 hours of driving + 1 hour of break.",
    "9 hours + 1 hour = 10 hours."
