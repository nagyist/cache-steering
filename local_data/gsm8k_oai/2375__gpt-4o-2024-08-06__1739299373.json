  "query": "Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes.",
    "Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes.",
    "To find the number of yellow envelopes, subtract 4 from the number of blue envelopes: 10 - 4.",
    "10 - 4 = 6, so Wyatt has 6 yellow envelopes.",
    "Now, add the number of blue envelopes and yellow envelopes together to find the total number of envelopes.",
    "10 blue envelopes + 6 yellow envelopes = 16 envelopes."
