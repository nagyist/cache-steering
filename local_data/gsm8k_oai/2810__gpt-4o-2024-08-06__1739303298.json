  "query": "If there are four times as many red crayons as blue crayons in a box, and there are 3 blue crayons.  How many crayons total are in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many red crayons there are.",
    "I know that there are four times as many red crayons as blue crayons.",
    "There are 3 blue crayons.",
    "To find the number of red crayons, I multiply the number of blue crayons by 4.",
    "3 blue crayons times 4 is 12 red crayons.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of crayons in the box.",
    "I add the number of blue crayons to the number of red crayons.",
    "3 blue crayons plus 12 red crayons equals 15 crayons in total."
