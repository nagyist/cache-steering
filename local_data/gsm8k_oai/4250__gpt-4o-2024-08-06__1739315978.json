  "query": "Kingsley's teacher instructed her to find four friends to help her carry some chairs to the school hall to be used for an upcoming event. If each student carried 5 chairs per trip and made 10 trips in total, what's the total number of chairs taken to the hall?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students are involved in carrying the chairs.",
    "Kingsley herself is involved and she finds four friends to help.",
    "So the total number of students carrying chairs is Kingsley plus her four friends, which is 1 + 4 = 5 students.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many trips each student makes.",
    "Each student makes 10 trips carrying chairs.",
    "Next, I calculate how many chairs each student carries in total.",
    "Each student carries 5 chairs per trip.",
    "So, each student carries 5 chairs \u00d7 10 trips = 50 chairs in total.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of chairs carried by all students combined.",
    "There are 5 students, and each carries 50 chairs.",
    "Therefore, the total number of chairs carried is 5 students \u00d7 50 chairs each = 250 chairs."

  "solution": "250"
