  "query": "Remi prepared a tomato nursery and planted tomato seedlings. After 20 days, the seedlings were ready to be transferred. On the first day, he planted 200 seedlings on the farm. On the second day, while working alongside his father, he planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day. If the total number of seedlings transferred to the farm on these two days was 1200, how many seedlings did his father plant?",
  "steps": [
    "Remi planted 200 seedlings on the first day.",
    "On the second day, Remi planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day.",
    "Twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day is 2 * 200 = 400 seedlings.",
    "Thus, on the second day, Remi planted 400 seedlings.",
    "According to the question, the total number of seedlings transferred to the farm on the two days was 1200.",
    "On the first day, 200 seedlings were planted, and on the second day, Remi planted 400 seedlings.",
    "The total number of seedlings planted by Remi in two days is 200 + 400 = 600 seedlings.",
    "Since the total number of seedlings transferred is 1200, the seedlings planted by Remi and his father on the second day sum up to 1200.",
    "Thus, the seedlings planted by his father is the difference between the total seedlings and the seedlings planted by Remi in two days.",
    "The number of seedlings his father planted is 1200 - 600 = 600 seedlings."
