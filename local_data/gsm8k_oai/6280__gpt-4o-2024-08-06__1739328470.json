  "query": "Janet buys a multi-flavor pack of cheese sticks. 15 of the sticks are cheddar, 30 are mozzarella, and 45 are pepperjack. If Janet picks a cheese stick at random, what is the percentage chance it will be pepperjack?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of cheese sticks in the pack.",
    "There are 15 cheddar sticks, 30 mozzarella sticks, and 45 pepperjack sticks.",
    "I add these numbers together to find the total: 15 + 30 + 45.",
    "15 + 30 equals 45.",
    "45 + 45 equals 90.",
    "So, there are 90 cheese sticks in total.",
    "Now, I need to find the probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick.",
    "There are 45 pepperjack cheese sticks.",
    "The probability of picking a pepperjack cheese stick is the number of pepperjack sticks divided by the total number of sticks, which is 45/90.",
    "To convert this probability to a percentage, I multiply by 100.",
    "45 divided by 90 is 0.5.",
    "0.5 multiplied by 100 equals 50."

  "solution": "50"
