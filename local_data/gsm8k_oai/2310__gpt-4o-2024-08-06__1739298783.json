  "query": "Selena reads a book with 400 pages. Harry reads a book with 20 fewer than half the number of pages Selena's book has. How many pages are in the book of Harry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of pages in Selena's book. It is already stated that Selena's book has 400 pages.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pages Harry's book has. The problem states that Harry's book has 20 fewer than half the number of pages of Selena's book.",
    "First, let's calculate half of the number of pages in Selena's book, which is half of 400.",
    "Half of 400 is 200.",
    "Now, I need to adjust this number to be 20 pages fewer as specified in the problem.",
    "Subtract 20 from 200.",
    "200 - 20 equals 180.",
    "Therefore, Harry's book has 180 pages."

  "solution": "180"
