  "query": "Zach rented a car for $150 plus 50 cents for each mile. He drove 620 miles on Monday and another 744 miles on Thursday. How much did he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of miles Zach drove. He drove 620 miles on Monday.",
    "He also drove 744 miles on Thursday.",
    "To find the total miles, I add the miles driven on Monday and Thursday: 620 + 744.",
    "620 + 744 equals 1364 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of driving 1364 miles at 50 cents per mile.",
    "50 cents can be expressed as $0.50. Now, I'll multiply the total miles by the cost per mile: 1364 miles * $0.50.",
    "1364 * 0.50 equals $682.",
    "The rental cost of the car was $150.",
    "To find the total amount Zach spent, I add the rental cost to the mileage cost: $150 + $682.",
    "$150 + $682 equals $832."

  "solution": "832"
