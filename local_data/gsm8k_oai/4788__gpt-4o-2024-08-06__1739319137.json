  "query": "Fran's school just instituted a school uniform policy. Each student needs to buy five complete uniforms, each consisting of pants, shirt, tie and socks. The pants cost $20, the shirt costs twice as much as the pants, the tie costs 1/5 as much as the shirt and the socks cost $3/pair. How many dollars will each student need to spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the cost of each component of the uniform.",
    "The pants cost $20.",
    "The shirt costs twice as much as the pants, so the shirt costs 2 * $20 = $40.",
    "The tie costs 1/5 as much as the shirt, so the tie costs $40 / 5 = $8.",
    "The cost of the socks is $3 per pair.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total cost of one complete uniform by adding the cost of pants, shirt, tie, and socks.",
    "The total cost of one uniform is $20 (pants) + $40 (shirt) + $8 (tie) + $3 (socks) = $71.",
    "Fran needs to buy five complete uniforms.",
    "To find the total cost for five uniforms, I multiply the cost of one uniform by 5.",
    "The total cost for five uniforms is $71 * 5 = $355.",
    "I have gone through each step and all calculations are correct."

  "solution": "355"
