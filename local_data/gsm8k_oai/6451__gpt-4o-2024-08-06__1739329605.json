  "query": "John drives 1000 miles a month.  He needs to get an oil change every 3000 miles.  He gets 1 free oil change a year.  If an oil change costs $50, how much does he pay a year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many oil changes John needs per year.",
    "John drives 1000 miles a month.",
    "Therefore, in a year (12 months), he drives 1000 miles/month * 12 months = 12,000 miles.",
    "John needs an oil change every 3000 miles.",
    "I need to divide the total annual miles by the mileage between oil changes to find the total number of oil changes needed.",
    "12,000 miles / 3000 miles/oil change = 4 oil changes per year.",
    "John gets 1 free oil change per year.",
    "Subtracting the free oil change, he needs to pay for 4 - 1 = 3 oil changes.",
    "Each oil change costs $50.",
    "John pays for 3 oil changes at $50 each.",
    "3 oil changes * $50/oil change = $150."
  ],
  "solution": "150"
