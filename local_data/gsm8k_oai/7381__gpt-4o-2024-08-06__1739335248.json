  "query": "Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died. If her mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70. How old is Jessica currently?",
  "steps": [
    "Jessica's mother's current hypothetical age, if alive, is given as 70 years.",
    "It has been 10 years since Jessica's mother passed away.",
    "Therefore, 10 years ago, when her mother died, she would have been 70 - 10 = 60 years old.",
    "At the time of her mother's death, Jessica was half her mother's age.",
    "If her mother was 60 at that time, Jessica must have been 60 / 2 = 30 years old.",
    "10 years have passed since then, so we need to add 10 years to Jessica's age at that time.",
    "Jessica's current age is 30 + 10 = 40 years old."
