  "query": "Wendy's truck has a gas tank that can hold 20 gallons. She also has a car with a gas tank that holds 12 gallons. The truck's tank is half full. The car's tank is 1/3 full. If she fills them both up completely, how many gallons does she add?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much gas is in the truck's tank.",
    "The truck's tank can hold 20 gallons in total and it is half full.",
    "Half of 20 gallons is 20 * 0.5 = 10 gallons.",
    "So, the truck currently has 10 gallons of gas.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much gas is in the car's tank.",
    "The car's tank holds 12 gallons in total and it is 1/3 full.",
    "One third of 12 gallons is 12 * (1/3) = 4 gallons.",
    "So, the car currently has 4 gallons of gas.",
    "Now I will find out how many more gallons are needed to fill the truck's tank.",
    "The truck needs 20 gallons - 10 gallons = 10 more gallons.",
    "Next, I will find out how many more gallons are needed to fill the car's tank.",
    "The car needs 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 more gallons.",
    "Now, I will add the gallons needed for both vehicles to find the total.",
    "10 gallons for the truck + 8 gallons for the car = 18 gallons."
