  "query": "Randy walks his dog twice a day.  After each walk, he wipes his dog's paws off with a baby wipe.  The baby wipes come 120 wipes per pack.  How many packs will he need to make sure he has enough wipes for 360 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Randy wipes his dog's paws in one day.",
    "Randy wipes his dog's paws twice a day because he walks the dog twice.",
    "So in one day, Randy uses 2 wipes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of wipes Randy will use in 360 days.",
    "I multiply the number of wipes used per day (2) by the number of days (360).",
    "2 wipes/day * 360 days = 720 wipes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many packs of wipes Randy needs for 720 wipes.",
    "Each pack contains 120 wipes.",
    "I divide the total number of wipes needed (720) by the number of wipes per pack (120).",
    "720 wipes / 120 wipes/pack = 6 packs.",
    "I'll check my calculation to ensure accuracy.",
    "If 1 pack contains 120 wipes, then 6 packs would contain 120 * 6 = 720 wipes.",
    "This matches with the total number of wipes needed, confirming the calculation is correct."

  "solution": "6"
