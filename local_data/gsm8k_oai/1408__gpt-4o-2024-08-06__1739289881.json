  "query": "Nicki spent the last year running a lot. For the first half of the year, she ran a total of 20 miles per week. For the second half of the year, she increased the mileage to 30 miles per week. How many miles total did she run for the year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to remember that a year consists of 52 weeks.",
    "Nicki ran 20 miles per week for the first half of the year. Half of 52 weeks is 26 weeks.",
    "For the first 26 weeks, Nicki ran 20 miles per week.",
    "I will calculate the total miles run in the first 26 weeks: 20 miles/week * 26 weeks = 520 miles.",
    "For the second half of the year, Nicki ran 30 miles per week.",
    "For the second 26 weeks, she ran 30 miles per week.",
    "I will calculate the total miles run in the second 26 weeks: 30 miles/week * 26 weeks = 780 miles.",
    "To find the total miles run in the year, I add the miles from the first half and the second half: 520 miles + 780 miles.",
    "520 miles + 780 miles = 1300 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "1300"
