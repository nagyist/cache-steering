  "query": "Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the width, I first need to recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \\( P = 2L + 2W \\) where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( W \\) is the width.",
    "I know that the perimeter \\( P \\) is 30 feet. So, \\( 2L + 2W = 30 \\).",
    "I also know that the length is twice the width. Therefore, \\( L = 2W \\).",
    "Substituting \\( L = 2W \\) into the perimeter equation \\( 2L + 2W = 30 \\), I get \\( 2(2W) + 2W = 30 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, I have \\( 4W + 2W = 30 \\).",
    "Combining like terms gives me \\( 6W = 30 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( W \\), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 6. So, \\( W = \\frac{30}{6} \\).",
    "Calculating that division, I find \\( W = 5 \\)."
