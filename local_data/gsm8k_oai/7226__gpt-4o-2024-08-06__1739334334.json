  "query": "Carly is thinking about buying a wallet that costs $22 and a purse that costs $3 less than four times the cost of the wallet. What is the combined cost of both items?",
  "steps": [
    "I know the wallet costs $22.",
    "The problem states that the purse costs $3 less than four times the cost of the wallet.",
    "First, I need to calculate four times the cost of the wallet.",
    "Four times $22 is calculated by multiplying 4 by 22.",
    "4 times 22 equals 88.",
    "Now, the cost of the purse is $3 less than $88.",
    "I subtract $3 from $88 to find the cost of the purse.",
    "$88 minus $3 equals $85.",
    "The cost of the wallet is $22, and the cost of the purse is $85.",
    "I add the cost of the wallet and the cost of the purse together to find the combined cost.",
    "$22 plus $85 equals $107."
