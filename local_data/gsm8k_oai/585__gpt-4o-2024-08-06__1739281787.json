  "query": "Maddy's 4th grade class needs to make 1000 Valentine's Day cards to get a pizza party. There are 30 kids in the class. If everyone makes 8, how many more cards will they need to make to get a pizza party?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many cards all the kids in the class can make if each of them makes 8 cards.",
    "There are 30 kids in the class.",
    "Each kid makes 8 cards.",
    "I multiply the number of kids by the number of cards each kid makes: 30 * 8.",
    "Calculating 30 * 8 gives me 240.",
    "The class can make a total of 240 cards.",
    "The goal is 1000 cards for the pizza party.",
    "I need to find out how many more cards are needed by subtracting the number of cards they can make from the goal.",
    "I subtract 240 from 1000: 1000 - 240.",
    "Calculating 1000 - 240 gives me 760.",
    "They need to make 760 more cards to reach the goal."

  "solution": "760"
