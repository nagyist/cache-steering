  "query": "Audrey was asleep for 10 hours last night and dreamed for 2/5 of the time. How much of the night was she not dreaming?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long Audrey was dreaming.",
    "Audrey was asleep for a total of 10 hours.",
    "She dreamed for 2/5 of the time she was asleep.",
    "To find the time she spent dreaming, I multiply 10 hours by 2/5.",
    "10 hours times 2/5 is (10 * 2) / 5 hours.",
    "This simplifies to 20 / 5 hours.",
    "20 divided by 5 equals 4.",
    "So, Audrey was dreaming for 4 hours.",
    "Now, I subtract the time she was dreaming from the total time she was asleep to find out how much of the night she was not dreaming.",
    "She was asleep for 10 hours in total.",
    "I subtract the 4 hours spent dreaming from the total 10 hours.",
    "10 hours minus 4 hours equals 6 hours."

  "solution": "6"
