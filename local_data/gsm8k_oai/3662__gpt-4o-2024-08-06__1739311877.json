  "query": "For a school fundraiser, Tory needs to sell 50 packs of cookies. So far, he has sold 12 packs to his grandmother, 7 packs to his uncle, and 5 packs to a neighbor. How many more packs of cookies does Tory need to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many packs Tory has already sold.",
    "Tory sold 12 packs to his grandmother.",
    "He sold 7 packs to his uncle.",
    "He also sold 5 packs to a neighbor.",
    "Now, I will add up the packs he has sold to find the total number of packs already sold.",
    "12 packs (grandmother) + 7 packs (uncle) equals 19 packs.",
    "Now, adding the packs sold to the neighbor: 19 packs + 5 packs.",
    "19 + 5 equals 24 packs. Tory has sold 24 packs in total.",
    "Tory's goal is to sell 50 packs.",
    "To find out how many more packs he needs to sell, I will subtract the number of packs already sold from the total goal.",
    "50 packs (goal) - 24 packs (sold) equals 26 packs."
