  "query": "Andy can get 50 demerits in a month before getting fired. If he got 2 demerits per instance for showing up late 6 times and 15 demerits for making an inappropriate joke, how many more demerits can he get this month before getting fired?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total demerits Andy received for showing up late.",
    "He gets 2 demerits per instance of being late, and he was late 6 times.",
    "So, the total demerits for being late is 2 demerits per instance times 6 instances.",
    "2 times 6 equals 12. So Andy got 12 demerits for being late.",
    "Next, I need to add the demerits Andy received for making an inappropriate joke.",
    "Andy received 15 demerits for the inappropriate joke.",
    "I will add the demerits from being late and the demerits from the joke.",
    "12 demerits from being late plus 15 demerits for the joke equals 27 demerits.",
    "Andy has accumulated a total of 27 demerits so far.",
    "The limit before getting fired is 50 demerits.",
    "I will subtract the total demerits Andy has from the limit to find out how many more demerits he can receive before being fired.",
    "50 demerits limit minus 27 demerits he already has equals 23 demerits."

  "solution": "23"
