  "query": "Brittany got a 78 on her first test. After her second test, her average rose to an 81. What grade did she get on her second test?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that the average grade is the sum of all grades divided by the number of grades.",
    "Brittany has two grades, so the average of these two grades is 81.",
    "The current average after the second test is 81, and there were two tests taken.",
    "To find the sum of the two grades needed to get this average, multiply the average by the number of tests: 81 * 2.",
    "81 * 2 = 162.",
    "So the sum of the grades from the first and second test is 162.",
    "We know the first test grade is 78.",
    "Let's find the second test grade by subtracting the first test grade from the sum of both test grades.",
    "162 - 78 = 84.",
    "Brittany got an 84 on her second test."

  "solution": "84"
