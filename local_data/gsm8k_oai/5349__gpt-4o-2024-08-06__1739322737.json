  "query": "Samuel is driving to San Francisco\u2019s Comic-Con in his car and he needs to travel 600 miles to the hotel where he made a reservation. At first, he drives at 50 miles/hour for 3 hours straight, then he speeds up to 80 miles/hour for 4 hours. How far is he from the hotel?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the distance Samuel traveled during the first part of the trip, where he drove at 50 miles/hour for 3 hours.",
    "To calculate the distance, I use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "For the first part, distance = 50 miles/hour \u00d7 3 hours = 150 miles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the distance Samuel traveled during the second part of the trip, where he drove at 80 miles/hour for 4 hours.",
    "Again, I use the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "For the second part, distance = 80 miles/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 320 miles.",
    "Now, I add the distances from the two parts of the trip to get the total distance traveled by Samuel.",
    "Total distance traveled = 150 miles + 320 miles = 470 miles.",
    "Samuel needs to travel a total of 600 miles to reach his hotel.",
    "I subtract the total distance he has traveled so far from the total distance to find out how far he is from the hotel.",
    "Distance from the hotel = 600 miles - 470 miles = 130 miles."

  "solution": "130"
