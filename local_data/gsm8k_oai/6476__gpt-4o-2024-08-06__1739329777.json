  "query": "Today Geoff bought 2 pairs of sneakers and spent $60 equally between the two. Tomorrow, he's going to spend 4 times as much on sneakers than he did on Monday. Wednesday, he'll spend 5 times as much on sneakers than he did on Monday. How much will Geoff spend on sneakers over these three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Geoff spent on Monday. He bought 2 pairs of sneakers and spent $60 in total.",
    "Since it was spent equally, each pair cost him $30. Therefore, on Monday, he spent $60 in total.",
    "Tomorrow, or Tuesday, he plans to spend 4 times as much as he did on Monday.",
    "4 times the $60 he spent on Monday equals $240.",
    "On Wednesday, he plans to spend 5 times as much as he did on Monday.",
    "5 times the $60 he spent on Monday equals $300.",
    "Now, I need to total the amounts spent across the three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.",
    "On Monday, he spent $60. On Tuesday, he spent $240. On Wednesday, he spent $300.",
    "Adding these together gives me $60 + $240 + $300.",
    "$60 plus $240 equals $300.",
    "$300 plus another $300 equals $600."

  "solution": "600"
