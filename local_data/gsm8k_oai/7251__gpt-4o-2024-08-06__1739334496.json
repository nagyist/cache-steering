  "query": "Melissa sells a coupe for $30,000 and an SUV for twice as much. If her commission is 2%, how much money did she make from these sales?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Melissa sold the SUV for. It says the SUV sold for twice as much as the coupe.",
    "The coupe sold for $30,000. So, the SUV sells for 2 times $30,000.",
    "Calculating this gives me: 2 * $30,000 = $60,000 for the SUV.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total sales amount. This is the sum of the sale price of the coupe and the SUV.",
    "So, total sales = $30,000 (coupe) + $60,000 (SUV).",
    "Calculating this gives me a total sales amount of $90,000.",
    "Melissa earns a commission of 2% on the total sales amount.",
    "First, I'll convert the percentage into decimal form for calculation: 2% = 0.02.",
    "Next, I calculate the commission by multiplying the total sales by the commission rate.",
    "Commission = $90,000 * 0.02.",
    "Calculating this gives me a commission of $1,800."

  "solution": "1800"
