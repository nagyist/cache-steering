  "query": "One afternoon, Rachelle, Gretchen and Rocky threw pennies into the fountain and made wishes.  Rachelle threw 180 pennies into the fountain.  Gretchen threw half as many pennies into the fountain as Rachelle and Rocky threw in one-third as many pennies as Gretchen.  What was the total number of pennies thrown into the fountain by the three of them?",
  "steps": [
    "Rachelle threw 180 pennies.",
    "Gretchen threw half as many pennies as Rachelle.",
    "Half of 180 pennies is 180 / 2 = 90 pennies.",
    "Gretchen threw 90 pennies.",
    "Rocky threw one-third as many pennies as Gretchen.",
    "One-third of 90 pennies is 90 / 3 = 30 pennies.",
    "Rocky threw 30 pennies.",
    "To find the total number of pennies, add the pennies thrown by Rachelle, Gretchen, and Rocky.",
    "Total pennies = 180 (Rachelle) + 90 (Gretchen) + 30 (Rocky).",
    "180 + 90 + 30 = 300."
