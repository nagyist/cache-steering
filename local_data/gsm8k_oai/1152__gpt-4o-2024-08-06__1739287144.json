  "query": "Texas Integrated School has 15 classes and has 20 students per class.  They added five more classes, how many students will they have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of students in the original 15 classes.",
    "There are 20 students per class.",
    "Therefore, I multiply 15 classes by 20 students per class.",
    "15 * 20 = 300",
    "The original 15 classes have 300 students in total.",
    "Next, I consider the five additional classes.",
    "The problem states that these new classes also have 20 students each.",
    "Thus, the total number of students in these 5 new classes is 5 * 20.",
    "5 * 20 = 100",
    "The five new classes have 100 students in total.",
    "Now, I add the number of students from the original classes to the number of students from the new classes.",
    "300 (original classes) + 100 (new classes) = 400"
  ],
  "solution": "400"
