  "query": "Neil baked 20 cookies. He gave 2/5 of the cookies to his friend. How many cookies are left for Neil?",
  "steps": [
    "Neil baked a total of 20 cookies.",
    "He gave 2/5 of these cookies to his friend.",
    "First, I need to calculate how many cookies are represented by 2/5 of 20.",
    "To find this, I multiply 20 by 2/5.",
    "(20 * 2/5) equals 40/5.",
    "40 divided by 5 equals 8.",
    "So, Neil gave 8 cookies to his friend.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the 8 cookies given to his friend from the 20 cookies he originally had.",
    "20 - 8 equals 12.",
    "This means Neil has 12 cookies left."

  "solution": "12"
