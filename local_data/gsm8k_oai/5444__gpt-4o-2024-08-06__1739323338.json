  "query": "It rained twice as much on Tuesday as Monday.  On Monday it rained 3 inches more than Sunday.  It rained 4 inches on Sunday.  How much total rainfall was there over the 3 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know it rained 4 inches on Sunday.",
    "It rained 3 inches more on Monday than on Sunday.",
    "To find the rainfall on Monday, I add 3 inches to the rainfall on Sunday, which gives me 4 + 3 = 7 inches on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, it rained twice as much as on Monday.",
    "So, I need to calculate twice the rainfall of Monday, which is 2 times 7 = 14 inches for Tuesday.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total rainfall over the 3 days.",
    "I add the rainfall for each day: Sunday (4 inches) + Monday (7 inches) + Tuesday (14 inches).",
    "Adding these values together gives me 4 + 7 + 14 = 25 inches."

  "solution": "25"
