  "query": "Cape May and Daytona Beach have 40 shark sightings a year. If Cape May has 8 less than double the number of shark sightings of Daytona Beach, how many shark sightings does Cape May have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach be \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, Cape May has 8 less than double the number of shark sightings of Daytona Beach.",
    "The number of shark sightings in Cape May is therefore \\( 2x - 8 \\).",
    "Together, Cape May and Daytona Beach have a total of 40 shark sightings a year.",
    "The equation reflecting this situation is \\( x + (2x - 8) = 40 \\).",
    "Combine like terms in the equation: \\( 3x - 8 = 40 \\).",
    "Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with x: \\( 3x = 48 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 16 \\).",
    "Now that we know \\( x = 16 \\), we can find the number of shark sightings in Cape May.",
    "Substitute \\( x = 16 \\) into the expression for Cape May: \\( 2x - 8 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 2(16) - 8 = 32 - 8 = 24 \\)."
