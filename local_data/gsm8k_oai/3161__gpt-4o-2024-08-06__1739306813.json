  "query": "It was Trevor's job to collect fresh eggs from the family's 4 chickens every morning.   He got 4 eggs from Gertrude and 3 eggs from Blanche.  Nancy laid 2 eggs as did Martha.  On the way, he dropped 2 eggs.  How many eggs did Trevor have left?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by counting the number of eggs from each chicken.",
    "Gertrude laid 4 eggs.",
    "Blanche laid 3 eggs.",
    "Nancy laid 2 eggs.",
    "Martha laid 2 eggs.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of eggs collected.",
    "Gertrude's 4 eggs + Blanche's 3 eggs + Nancy's 2 eggs + Martha's 2 eggs = 11 eggs total.",
    "Trevor dropped 2 eggs on the way.",
    "I subtract the dropped eggs from the total number of eggs.",
    "11 eggs - 2 eggs = 9 eggs."
