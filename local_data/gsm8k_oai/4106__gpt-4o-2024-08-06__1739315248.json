  "query": "Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan. Levi collected half of what Juwan collected. Solomon collected 66 cans. How many cans did the boys collect in all?",
  "steps": [
    "We are given that Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan.",
    "Solomon collected 66 cans.",
    "Since Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan, we can set up the equation: 3 * Juwan's cans = 66.",
    "To find out how many cans Juwan collected, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: Juwan's cans = 66 / 3.",
    "Calculating this gives Juwan's cans = 22.",
    "We are also given that Levi collected half of what Juwan collected.",
    "Juwan collected 22 cans, so Levi collected 22 / 2 = 11 cans.",
    "Now, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Solomon, Juwan, and Levi.",
    "Solomon collected 66 cans, Juwan collected 22 cans, and Levi collected 11 cans.",
    "The total number of cans collected by all three is 66 + 22 + 11.",
    "Calculating this, 66 + 22 = 88 and then 88 + 11 = 99."
