  "query": "A train takes 2 hours longer to go an equal distance of a car. If the car and the train leave station A at the same time, and the car reaches station B 4.5 hours later, calculate the combined time the car and the train take to reach station B.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what is being asked. We need to calculate the combined time the car and train take to reach station B.",
    "The car takes 4.5 hours to reach station B.",
    "The problem states that the train takes 2 hours longer than the car to cover the same distance.",
    "Since the car takes 4.5 hours, the train takes 4.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours.",
    "Now, add the time taken by the car and the train to find their combined travel time to reach station B.",
    "The combined time is 4.5 hours + 6.5 hours for the train, which equals 11 hours."

  "solution": "11"
