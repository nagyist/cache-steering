  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total seating capacity for the 4 tables that seat 6 people each.",
    "4 tables * 6 people per table = 24 people.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total seating capacity for the 16 tables that seat 4 people each.",
    "16 tables * 4 people per table = 64 people.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total seating capacity for the 8 round tables that seat 10 people each.",
    "8 tables * 10 people per table = 80 people.",
    "Finally, I'll sum all the seating capacities to find the total capacity of the venue.",
    "24 people (from 4 tables) + 64 people (from 16 tables) + 80 people (from 8 tables) = 168 people."
