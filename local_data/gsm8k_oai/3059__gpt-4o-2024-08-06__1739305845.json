  "query": "Terry's mom brought home 4 different colored dogs from the shelter. The brown dog weighs 4 pounds. The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. The grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog. What's the average weight of all the dogs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note the weight of the brown dog, which is 4 pounds.",
    "Next, I calculate the weight of the black dog. It weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog: 4 pounds + 1 pound = 5 pounds.",
    "Now, I determine the weight of the white dog. It weighs twice as much as the brown dog: 4 pounds \u00d7 2 = 8 pounds.",
    "Next, I determine the weight of the grey dog. It weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog: 5 pounds - 2 pounds = 3 pounds.",
    "Now, I sum up the weights of all the dogs: 4 pounds (brown) + 5 pounds (black) + 8 pounds (white) + 3 pounds (grey) = 20 pounds.",
    "To find the average weight, I divide the total weight by the number of dogs: 20 pounds \u00f7 4 dogs = 5 pounds."
