  "query": "Anne is drawing pictures. She has 12 markers and she notices that each one lasts for about 1.5 drawings. If she has already made 8 drawings, how many more can she make before she runs out of markers?",
  "steps": [
    "Anne has 12 markers, and each marker lasts for 1.5 drawings.",
    "To find out how many drawings she can initially make with all 12 markers, I multiply the number of markers by the number of drawings each one can produce.",
    "12 markers * 1.5 drawings per marker = 18 drawings.",
    "Anne has already made 8 drawings.",
    "To find out how many more drawings she can make, I subtract the number of drawings she has already made from the total possible drawings.",
    "18 total possible drawings - 8 drawings already made = 10 more drawings."

  "solution": "10"
