  "query": "A group of six friends planned to buy a car. The cost of the car is $1700 and they plan to share the cost equally. They had a car wash to help raise funds, which would be taken out of the total cost. The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount needed to be paid after considering the earnings from the car wash. The car's cost is $1700, and they earned $500 from the car wash.",
    "To find out the remaining cost after earnings from the car wash, I subtract $500 from $1700.",
    "$1700 - $500 = $1200.",
    "Now, the remaining cost to be paid for the car is $1200.",
    "Originally, six friends were supposed to split this cost equally, so I will divide $1200 by 6.",
    "$1200 / 6 = $200.",
    "Each friend originally had to pay $200.",
    "However, Brad decided not to join, leaving only five friends to share the cost.",
    "Now, I will divide $1200 by 5 to find out how much each of the remaining friends has to pay.",
    "$1200 / 5 = $240.",
    "Each remaining friend now has to pay $240.",
    "To find out how much more each friend has to pay now, I subtract the original payment per friend from the new payment amount.",
    "$240 - $200 = $40."
