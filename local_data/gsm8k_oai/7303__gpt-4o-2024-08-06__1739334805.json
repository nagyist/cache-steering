  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much rice Mr. Llesis kept in storage.",
    "Mr. Llesis kept 7/10 of the 50 kilograms of rice in storage.",
    "I calculate 7/10 of 50 kilograms by multiplying 50 by 0.7.",
    "50 * 0.7 equals 35 kilograms.",
    "So, Mr. Llesis kept 35 kilograms of rice in storage.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much rice Mr. Everest received.",
    "To find out how much rice Mr. Everest received, I subtract the amount Mr. Llesis kept from the total rice.",
    "50 kilograms - 35 kilograms equals 15 kilograms.",
    "Mr. Everest received 15 kilograms of rice.",
    "The final step is to determine how much more rice Mr. Llesis kept compared to Mr. Everest.",
    "Mr. Llesis kept 35 kilograms, and Mr. Everest got 15 kilograms.",
    "To find how many more kilograms Mr. Llesis kept than Mr. Everest, I subtract the amount Mr. Everest received from the amount Mr. Llesis kept: 35 kilograms - 15 kilograms.",
    "35 - 15 equals 20 kilograms."
