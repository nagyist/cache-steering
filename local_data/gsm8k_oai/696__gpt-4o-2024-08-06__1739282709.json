  "query": "Every morning, Carla puts 79 apples in her backpack to eat for lunch. Unfortunately, Buffy stole some of Carla's apples on the school bus, and 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. So at lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining. How many apples did Buffy steal from Carla?",
  "steps": [
    "Carla starts with 79 apples.",
    "26 apples fall out of the hole in the backpack.",
    "Subtract the 26 apples that fell out from the 79 apples Carla had initially: 79 - 26 = 53.",
    "Carla had 8 apples remaining at lunchtime.",
    "Subtract the 8 remaining apples from the 53 apples after accounting for the ones that fell out: 53 - 8 = 45."

  "solution": "45"
