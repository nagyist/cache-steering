  "query": "Martha has 18 crayons. She lost half of them, so she bought a new set of 20 crayons. How many crayons in total does Martha have after the purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "Martha initially has 18 crayons.",
    "She lost half of her crayons.",
    "Half of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 crayons.",
    "After losing half, Martha has 18 - 9 = 9 crayons remaining.",
    "Martha then buys a new set of 20 crayons.",
    "To find the total number of crayons Martha has after the purchase, add the remaining crayons to the new set.",
    "9 (remaining crayons) + 20 (new crayons) = 29 crayons."
