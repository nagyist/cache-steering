  "query": "It takes Derek 9 minutes to walk a mile if he doesn't have to walk with his brother. If he has to take his brother it takes 12 minutes to walk a mile. How many minutes longer would it take him to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how long it takes Derek to walk 20 miles by himself.",
    "Derek takes 9 minutes to walk one mile by himself.",
    "To find the time to walk 20 miles, I multiply 9 minutes per mile by 20 miles.",
    "9 minutes/mile * 20 miles = 180 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it takes Derek to walk 20 miles with his brother.",
    "Derek takes 12 minutes to walk one mile with his brother.",
    "To find the time to walk 20 miles with his brother, I multiply 12 minutes per mile by 20 miles.",
    "12 minutes/mile * 20 miles = 240 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many minutes longer it takes with his brother compared to himself alone.",
    "I subtract the time by himself from the time with his brother: 240 minutes - 180 minutes = 60 minutes."

  "solution": "60"
