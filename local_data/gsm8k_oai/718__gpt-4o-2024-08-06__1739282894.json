  "query": "Jake and Penny are hunting snakes. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define Jenny's snake's length as \\( x \\) inches.",
    "Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's, so Jake's snake length is \\( x + 12 \\) inches.",
    "The combined length of Jake's and Jenny's snakes is 70 inches.",
    "We can write the equation for the total length: \\( x + (x + 12) = 70 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( 2x + 12 = 70 \\).",
    "Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\( x \\): \\( 2x = 58 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 29 \\).",
    "Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. Jake\u2019s snake is 12 inches longer, so add 12 to 29.",
    "Calculate Jake's snake's length: \\( 29 + 12 = 41 \\) inches."
