  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the discount amount applied to the lamp's original price.",
    "The original price of the lamp is $120.",
    "The discount rate offered by the store is 20%.",
    "To find the discount amount, I will calculate 20% of $120.",
    "I convert 20% into a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, resulting in 0.20.",
    "Next, I multiply $120 by 0.20 to find the discount amount.",
    "$120 multiplied by 0.20 equals $24.",
    "The discount amount off the original price is $24.",
    "To find the new price, I subtract the discount amount from the original price.",
    "$120 minus $24 equals $96."
