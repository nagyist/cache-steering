  "query": "Haley is making cider. It takes 20 golden delicious apples and 40 pink lady apples to make one pint of cider. Each of her 6 farmhands can pick 240 apples per hour and will work 5 hours today. How many pints of cider can Haley make with the apples gathered today, provided that the ratio of golden delicious apples to pink lady apples gathered is 1:2?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of apples that can be picked by one farmhand in a day.",
    "One farmhand can pick 240 apples in one hour.",
    "Since each farmhand works 5 hours today, one farmhand can pick 240 apples/hour * 5 hours = 1200 apples in a day.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of apples that all 6 farmhands can pick in one day.",
    "All 6 farmhands together can pick 6 * 1200 apples = 7200 apples in a day.",
    "The problem states that the ratio of golden delicious apples to pink lady apples gathered is 1:2.",
    "Let\u2019s set the number of golden delicious apples as x and the number of pink lady apples as 2x.",
    "The equation representing the total number of apples is x + 2x = 7200.",
    "This simplifies to 3x = 7200.",
    "Therefore, x = 7200 / 3 = 2400.",
    "So, the number of golden delicious apples picked is 2400, and the number of pink lady apples is 2 * 2400 = 4800.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pints of cider can be made from these apples.",
    "To make one pint of cider, 20 golden delicious apples and 40 pink lady apples are needed.",
    "I will calculate the number of pints based on the amount of golden delicious apples first: 2400 golden delicious apples / 20 apples per pint = 120 pints.",
    "Then, I will calculate the number of pints based on the amount of pink lady apples: 4800 pink lady apples / 40 apples per pint = 120 pints.",
    "The limiting factor here seems to be the pink lady apples as we cannot make more pints than what the limits of our ingredients allow.",
    "Both calculations give 120, so Haley can make 120 pints of cider with the apples gathered."
