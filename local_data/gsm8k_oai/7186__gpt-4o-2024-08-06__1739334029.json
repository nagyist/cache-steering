  "query": "During a commercial break in the Super Bowl, there were three 5-minute commercials and eleven 2-minute commercials. How many minutes was the commercial break?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total duration of the three 5-minute commercials.",
    "Three 5-minute commercials result in a total duration of 3 * 5 minutes.",
    "3 * 5 = 15 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total duration of the eleven 2-minute commercials.",
    "Eleven 2-minute commercials result in a total duration of 11 * 2 minutes.",
    "11 * 2 = 22 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to add the durations of the 5-minute and 2-minute commercials together to find the total duration of the commercial break.",
    "15 + 22 = 37 minutes."
