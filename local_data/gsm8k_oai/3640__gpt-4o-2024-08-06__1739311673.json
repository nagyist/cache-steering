  "query": "Arthur wants to sell his basketball card collection and use the money to buy comic books. The store owner tells him that each card is worth 5 cents and comic books cost $6 each. If Arthur sells all 2,000 cards of his and buys as many comic books as he can, how much money does he have leftover?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Arthur will get from selling all 2,000 cards.",
    "Each card is worth 5 cents. Therefore, Arthur will get 5 cents for each of his 2,000 cards.",
    "To calculate the total amount from selling the cards, I multiply the number of cards by the value per card: 2,000 cards * $0.05 per card.",
    "$0.05 is the same as 5 cents. So, 2,000 * 0.05 = $100.",
    "Now, Arthur has $100 from selling his cards.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many comic books he can buy with $100.",
    "Each comic book costs $6.",
    "To find out how many comic books Arthur can buy, I divide the total money he has by the price per comic book: $100 / $6.",
    "100 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 16 with a remainder.",
    "Arthur can buy 16 comic books.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much money is left after buying 16 comic books.",
    "First, I calculate the total cost for 16 comic books: 16 * $6 = $96.",
    "Arthur spent $96 on comic books.",
    "To find the leftover money, I subtract the amount spent from the total money he had: $100 - $96.",
    "$100 - $96 equals $4."
