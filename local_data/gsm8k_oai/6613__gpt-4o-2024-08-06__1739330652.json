  "query": "Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of hens on the farm.",
    "There are 325 chickens in total and 28 of them are roosters.",
    "To find the number of hens, I subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens: 325 - 28.",
    "Calculating gives 325 - 28 = 297 hens.",
    "I now need to determine how many of these hens lay eggs.",
    "It is given that 20 hens do not lay eggs.",
    "To find the egg-laying hens, I subtract the non-egg-laying hens from the total number of hens: 297 - 20.",
    "Performing the subtraction gives 297 - 20 = 277 egg-laying hens."

  "solution": "277"
