  "query": "Joyce moved to the countryside because she needed more farmland to grow her vegetables.  Her new property is 10 times larger than her previous property, but her new land has a 1-acre pond on it where she cannot grow vegetables.  If her previous property was 2 acres, how many acres of land does she now own that are suitable for growing vegetables?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the size of Joyce's new property.",
    "Her previous property was 2 acres.",
    "Her new property is 10 times larger than her previous property.",
    "So, I multiply the size of the previous property by 10: 2 acres * 10 = 20 acres.",
    "Now, I know her new property is 20 acres.",
    "However, there is a 1-acre pond on her new property where she cannot grow vegetables.",
    "To find the area suitable for growing vegetables, I need to subtract the pond area from the total new property area.",
    "So, I subtract 1 acre (pond) from 20 acres (total new property): 20 acres - 1 acre = 19 acres."

  "solution": "19"
