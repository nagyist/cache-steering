  "steps": [
    "James buys 10 boxes of Capri-sun.",
    "Each box has 6 pouches in it.",
    "First, I need to find the total number of pouches James bought.",
    "To do that, I multiply the number of boxes by the number of pouches per box: 10 boxes * 6 pouches/box.",
    "10 * 6 = 60 pouches.",
    "James paid $12 for these pouches.",
    "I need to find out how many cents $12 is.",
    "Since $1 is 100 cents, $12 is 12 * 100 cents.",
    "12 * 100 = 1200 cents.",
    "I now have 60 pouches and 1200 cents.",
    "To find out how many cents each pouch costs, I divide the total cents by the total number of pouches: 1200 cents / 60 pouches.",
    "1200 / 60 = 20.",
    "Each pouch costs 20 cents."
