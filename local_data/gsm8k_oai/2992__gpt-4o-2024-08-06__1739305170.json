  "query": "Wade has called into a rest stop and decides to get food for the road. He buys a sandwich to eat now, one for the road, and one for in the evening. He also buys 2 drinks. If the drinks cost $4 each and Wade spends a total of $26 then how much, in dollars, did the sandwiches each cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the drinks.",
    "The cost of one drink is $4, and Wade buys 2 drinks.",
    "Total cost of the drinks = 2 drinks \u00d7 $4 per drink = $8.",
    "Next, I subtract the total cost of the drinks from the total amount Wade spent.",
    "Wade spends a total of $26. I subtract $8 (the cost of the drinks) from $26.",
    "The remaining amount after subtracting the cost of drinks is $26 - $8 = $18.",
    "The $18 is the total cost of the sandwiches.",
    "Wade buys 3 sandwiches.",
    "I need to divide the total cost of the sandwiches ($18) by the number of sandwiches (3) to find the cost per sandwich.",
    "Cost per sandwich = $18 \u00f7 3 sandwiches = $6."

  "solution": "6"
