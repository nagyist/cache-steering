  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much John back squats currently.",
    "John used to back squat 200 kg and he increased that by 50 kg.",
    "200 kg + 50 kg = 250 kg",
    "John's current back squat is 250 kg.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much John front squats.",
    "John front squats 80% as much as he back squats.",
    "80% of 250 kg is calculated as 0.8 * 250 kg = 200 kg.",
    "John can front squat 200 kg.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much weight he lifts in a triple, which is 90% of his front squat.",
    "90% of 200 kg is calculated as 0.9 * 200 kg = 180 kg.",
    "John can lift 180 kg in one set of three (a triple).",
    "Finally, I need to calculate how much weight he will move if he does three triples.",
    "Each triple he lifts 180 kg, and he does three triples.",
    "180 kg per triple * 3 triples = 540 kg in total."
