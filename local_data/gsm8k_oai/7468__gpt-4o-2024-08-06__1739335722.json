  "query": "Very early this morning, Elise left home in a cab headed for the hospital. Fortunately, the roads were clear, and the cab company only charged her a base price of $3, and $4 for every mile she traveled. If Elise paid a total of $23, how far is the hospital from her house?",
  "steps": [
    "Elise paid a total of $23 for the cab ride.",
    "The base price of the cab ride was $3.",
    "Let's subtract the base price from the total cost to find out how much was paid for the distance traveled: $23 - $3 = $20.",
    "The cab company charged $4 per mile traveled.",
    "To find the number of miles traveled, divide the amount paid for distance by the cost per mile: $20 \u00f7 $4.",
    "$20 \u00f7 $4 = 5 miles."

  "solution": "5"
