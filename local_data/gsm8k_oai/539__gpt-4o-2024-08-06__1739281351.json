  "query": "A paper company decides to operate their business more sustainably. They decide that for every tree they chop down, they want to plant three more. If the company chops down 200 trees in the first half of the year and 300 more trees in the second half of the year, how many more trees does the company need to plant?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the total number of trees chopped down over the whole year.",
    "The company chopped down 200 trees in the first half of the year.",
    "The company chopped down 300 trees in the second half of the year.",
    "Add the number of trees chopped down in both halves of the year: 200 + 300.",
    "200 + 300 = 500, so the company chopped down a total of 500 trees in the entire year.",
    "Next, for every tree they chop down, they want to plant three more trees.",
    "Since they chopped down 500 trees, we need to calculate the number of trees to plant by multiplying 500 by 3.",
    "500 * 3 = 1500.",
    "Thus, the company needs to plant 1500 trees in total."

  "solution": "1500"
