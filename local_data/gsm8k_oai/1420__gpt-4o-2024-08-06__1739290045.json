  "query": "Compared to the amount of water she drank, Carla drank three times as much soda minus 6 ounces. If she drank 54 ounces of liquid total, how much water did she drink?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the amount of water Carla drank be denoted as \\( w \\).",
    "According to the problem, the amount of soda Carla drank is \\( 3w - 6 \\).",
    "The total amount of liquid Carla drank is the sum of the water and soda: \\( w + (3w - 6) \\).",
    "Set up the equation for the total amount of liquid: \\( w + 3w - 6 = 54 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 4w - 6 = 54 \\).",
    "Add 6 to both sides to solve for \\( w \\): \\( 4w = 60 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 4 to isolate \\( w \\): \\( w = 15 \\).",
    "Carla drank 15 ounces of water."

  "solution": "15"
