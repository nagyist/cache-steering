  "query": "Blake bought 4  lollipops and 6 packs of chocolate. If each lollipop costs $2 and a pack of chocolate costs the same as four lollipops, how much change will Blake get back if he gave the cashier 6 $10 bills?",
  "steps": [
    "Blake bought 4 lollipops.",
    "Each lollipop costs $2.",
    "The total cost for the lollipops is 4 lollipops * $2 = $8.",
    "Blake also bought 6 packs of chocolate.",
    "The cost of each pack of chocolate is the same as four lollipops.",
    "Four lollipops cost 4 * $2 = $8.",
    "Therefore, each pack of chocolate costs $8.",
    "The total cost for the packs of chocolate is 6 packs * $8 = $48.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost of all the items Blake bought.",
    "The total cost for the lollipops and chocolate is $8 (lollipops) + $48 (chocolate) = $56.",
    "Blake gave the cashier 6 $10 bills.",
    "6 $10 bills is equal to 6 * $10 = $60.",
    "To find out how much change Blake will get back, I subtract the total cost from the amount he paid.",
    "The change is $60 - $56 = $4."
