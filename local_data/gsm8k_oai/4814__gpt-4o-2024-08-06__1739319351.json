  "query": "Mindy has 7 less than 9 times as many emails waiting for her as phone messages. If she has a total of 93 emails and phone messages combined, how many emails does she have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of phone messages be \\( x \\).",
    "The number of emails is 9 times the number of phone messages minus 7, which can be written as \\( 9x - 7 \\).",
    "According to the problem, the total number of emails and phone messages is 93. Therefore, we can write the equation: \\( x + (9x - 7) = 93 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( x + 9x - 7 = 93 \\).",
    "This simplifies further to: \\( 10x - 7 = 93 \\).",
    "Add 7 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\): \\( 10x = 100 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 10 to find \\( x \\): \\( x = 10 \\).",
    "This means Mindy has 10 phone messages.",
    "The number of emails is \\( 9 \\times 10 - 7 \\).",
    "Calculate the number of emails: \\( 90 - 7 = 83 \\)."

  "solution": "83"
