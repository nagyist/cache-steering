  "query": "Jerry was contracted to work on a house by his neighbor Miss Stevie. The time it took him to fix the broken kitchen counter was three times longer than the time he took painting the house. He took 8 hours painting the house and then helped mow Miss Stevie's lawn, taking 6 hours. If he charged Miss Stevie $15 per hour of work, calculate the amount of money that Miss Stevie paid him.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the duration of each task Jerry completed.",
    "He took 8 hours painting the house.",
    "He took three times longer to fix the kitchen counter than painting. Since painting took 8 hours, fixing the counter took 3 * 8 = 24 hours.",
    "Mowing the lawn took him 6 hours.",
    "Now, I add up all the hours Jerry worked.",
    "The total number of hours is 8 (painting) + 24 (fixing counter) + 6 (mowing lawn) = 38 hours.",
    "Next, I calculate the total amount Miss Stevie paid Jerry.",
    "Jerry charges $15 per hour, so the total charge is 38 hours * $15 per hour.",
    "38 * 15 = 570. I can double-check this calculation: 30 * 15 = 450; 8 * 15 = 120; 450 + 120 = 570."

  "solution": "570"
