  "query": "A movie ticket costs $5. The cost of the popcorn is 80% of the cost of the ticket and a can of soda costs 50% of the cost of the popcorn. A family bought 4 tickets, 2 sets of popcorn, and 4 cans of soda. How much did they spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the cost of one movie ticket. It is given as $5.",
    "Next, I find out the cost of popcorn. It is 80% of the cost of a ticket.",
    "80% of $5 is 0.8 * 5 = $4.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost of a can of soda. It is 50% of the cost of the popcorn.",
    "50% of $4 is 0.5 * 4 = $2.",
    "The family bought 4 movie tickets. So, I calculate the total cost for tickets: 4 * $5 = $20.",
    "They also bought 2 sets of popcorn. I calculate the total cost for popcorn: 2 * $4 = $8.",
    "They bought 4 cans of soda, so I calculate the total cost for soda: 4 * $2 = $8.",
    "I add all the costs together to get the total spending: $20 (tickets) + $8 (popcorn) + $8 (soda).",
    "The total spent is $20 + $8 + $8 = $36."

  "solution": "36"
