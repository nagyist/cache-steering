  "query": "If eight liters is 20% the capacity of a container filled with water, calculate the total capacity of 40 such containers filled with water.",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the total capacity of one container. I know that eight liters is 20% of this capacity.",
    "To find the full capacity (100%), I use the relationship: 8 liters / 0.20 = total capacity in liters.",
    "Calculating the capacity, 8 / 0.20 equals 40 liters.",
    "Now that I know each container holds 40 liters, I need to calculate the total capacity for 40 containers.",
    "Multiplying the capacity of one container (40 liters) by the number of containers (40 containers) gives me the total capacity.",
    "40 liters * 40 containers equals 1600 liters."
  ],
  "solution": "1600"
