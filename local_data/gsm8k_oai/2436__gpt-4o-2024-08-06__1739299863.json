  "query": "A Printing shop needs to ship 5000 brochures to an advertising company. Each box can only contain one-fifth of the brochures. How many boxes are needed to ship those brochures?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many brochures each box can contain.",
    "Since each box can contain one-fifth of the brochures, I will calculate 1/5 of 5000.",
    "1/5 of 5000 is calculated as 5000 divided by 5.",
    "Let's divide 5000 by 5.",
    "5000 divided by 5 is equal to 1000.",
    "This means each box can contain 1000 brochures.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many boxes are required to contain all 5000 brochures.",
    "Since each box contains 1000 brochures, I will divide the total brochures, 5000, by the number of brochures each box can contain, which is 1000.",
    "5000 divided by 1000 equals 5.",
    "Therefore, 5 boxes are needed to ship 5000 brochures."
