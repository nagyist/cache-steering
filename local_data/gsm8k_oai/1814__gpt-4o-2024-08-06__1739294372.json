  "query": "6 kids in Carolyn's daycare prefer peas, 9 prefer carrots, and 5 prefer corn. What percentage of the children prefer corn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of children in Carolyn's daycare.",
    "The problem states that 6 kids prefer peas, 9 prefer carrots, and 5 prefer corn.",
    "To find the total number of children, I need to add the number of kids that prefer each type of vegetable.",
    "6 (peas) + 9 (carrots) + 5 (corn) = 20 kids.",
    "Next, I need to find out what percentage of the total number of kids prefer corn.",
    "5 kids prefer corn.",
    "To calculate the percentage, I use the formula: (number of kids who prefer corn / total number of kids) * 100.",
    "(5/20) * 100 = 25%."
  ],
  "solution": "25"
