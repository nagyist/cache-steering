  "query": "Alexa and Emily open up a lemonade stand in the front yard. They spent $10 for lemons, $5 for sugar and $3 for cups.  The lemonade is $4 a cup.  They sell a total of 21 cups.  How much profit did Alexa and Emily make after paying off expenses?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total expenses that Alexa and Emily incurred to set up the lemonade stand.",
    "They spent $10 on lemons, $5 on sugar, and $3 on cups.",
    "To find the total expenses, I add these costs together: $10 + $5 + $3.",
    "$10 + $5 = $15.",
    "$15 + $3 = $18.",
    "The total expenses for the lemonade stand are $18.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade.",
    "They sell lemonade for $4 per cup and sold 21 cups.",
    "To find the total revenue, I multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup: 21 cups * $4 per cup.",
    "21 * 4 = $84.",
    "The total revenue from selling lemonade is $84.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the total expenses from the total revenue.",
    "$84 (revenue) - $18 (expenses) = $66.",
    "So, the profit that Alexa and Emily made after paying off expenses is $66."

  "solution": "66"
