  "query": "In a dye-making process, a young lady mixes 3/5th of 20 liters of water with 5/6th of 18 liters of vinegar. How many liters of the mixture are obtained?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much water is being used in the mixture.",
    "The lady is using 3/5 of 20 liters of water.",
    "To find out how many liters of water are used, I multiply \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) by 20.",
    "\\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\) liters of water are used.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much vinegar is being used in the mixture.",
    "The lady is using 5/6 of 18 liters of vinegar.",
    "To find out how many liters of vinegar are used, I multiply \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) by 18.",
    "\\( \\frac{5}{6} \\times 18 = 15 \\) liters of vinegar are used.",
    "Next, I add the amount of water to the amount of vinegar to find the total volume of the mixture.",
    "The total mixture is 12 liters of water plus 15 liters of vinegar.",
    "12 + 15 equals 27."
