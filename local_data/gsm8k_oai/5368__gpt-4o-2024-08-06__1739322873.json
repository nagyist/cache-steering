  "query": "Lisa is making a pizza. She uses 30 pieces of pepperoni for a pizza, twice as many pieces of ham, and 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. If there are 6 slices of pizza, and everything was distributed evenly, how many pieces of meat altogether are on each slice?",
  "steps": [
    "Lisa uses 30 pieces of pepperoni on the pizza.",
    "Lisa uses twice as many pieces of ham as pepperoni. Since she uses 30 pieces of pepperoni, she uses 2 \u00d7 30 = 60 pieces of ham.",
    "Lisa uses 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. Since she uses 30 pieces of pepperoni, she uses 30 + 12 = 42 pieces of sausage.",
    "To find the total number of pieces of meat on the whole pizza, I add the number of pieces of pepperoni, ham, and sausage. That's 30 + 60 + 42 = 132 pieces of meat.",
    "The pizza is divided into 6 slices. To find out how many pieces of meat are on each slice, I divide the total number of pieces of meat by 6. So, 132 \u00f7 6 = 22 pieces of meat per slice."

  "solution": "22"
