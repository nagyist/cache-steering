  "query": "Coleen loved sprinkles.  At the beginning of the day, she had twelve cans of sprinkles.  After applying sprinkles to her hair, her clothing and her pets, she had 3 less than half as many cans of sprinkles as she started out with.  How many cans of sprinkles remained?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm trying to find out how many cans of sprinkles Coleen had left after using some.",
    "The problem states that after using the sprinkles, Coleen had 3 less than half as many cans as she started with.",
    "Coleen started with 12 cans of sprinkles.",
    "First, I need to find out what half of 12 is.",
    "Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6.",
    "Then, I subtract 3 from this half, as she had 3 less than half left.",
    "6 - 3 = 3.",
    "Therefore, Coleen had 3 cans of sprinkles remaining."
