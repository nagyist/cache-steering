  "query": "Bob has planted corn in his garden, and it has just started to sprout. A week after planting it, it had grown 2 inches. The next week, its height increased by twice as much as it had the first week. In the third week, it grew 4 times as much as it did the week before. How tall are the corn plants now?",
  "steps": [
    "Bob's corn plants grew 2 inches in the first week.",
    "In the second week, the plants grew twice as much as they did the first week.",
    "So, during the second week, they grew 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.",
    "In the third week, the plants grew 4 times as much as they did in the second week.",
    "So, during the third week, they grew 4 inches * 4 = 16 inches.",
    "Now, I need to add up the growth from all three weeks to find the total height.",
    "In the first week, the growth was 2 inches.",
    "In the second week, the growth was 4 inches.",
    "In the third week, the growth was 16 inches.",
    "The total height of the corn plants is 2 + 4 + 16 inches.",
    "The total is 22 inches."

  "solution": "22"
