  "query": "A baseball cap factory made 320 caps the first week, 400 the second week, and 300 the third week.  If the company makes their average number of caps from the first 3 weeks during the fourth week, how many total caps will they make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of caps made in each of the first three weeks.",
    "The first week, 320 caps were made.",
    "The second week, 400 caps were made.",
    "The third week, 300 caps were made.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of caps made in the first three weeks.",
    "I add the caps from the first week: 320",
    "I add the caps from the second week: 320 + 400 = 720",
    "I add the caps from the third week: 720 + 300 = 1020",
    "Now that I have the total number of caps for the first three weeks, I need to find the average number of caps made per week.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of caps by the number of weeks: 1020 / 3",
    "1020 divided by 3 is 340.",
    "The average number of caps made each week is 340.",
    "If the company makes the average number of caps during the fourth week, they would make 340 caps that week.",
    "Now, I add the caps from the fourth week to the total from the first three weeks.",
    "The total for the first three weeks is 1020.",
    "I add 340 caps for the fourth week: 1020 + 340",
    "1020 + 340 equals 1360.",
    "Thus, the total number of caps made in the four weeks is 1360."

  "solution": "1360"
