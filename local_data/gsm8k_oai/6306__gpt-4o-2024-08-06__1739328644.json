  "query": "Marta is weighing fruit at the grocery store. The apples weigh four ounces each and the oranges weight 3 ounces. Each plastic bag in the grocery store can hold 49 ounces of fruit before it splits. If Martha wants to put an equal number of apples and oranges in each bag, and she wants to buy 3 full bags of fruit, how many ounces of apples should she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of bags Martha wants to fill. She wants to buy 3 full bags.",
    "Each bag can hold 49 ounces before splitting.",
    "Martha wants to have an equal number of apples and oranges in each bag. Let's call the number of apples (and also oranges) per bag \"x\".",
    "The weight of the apples in one bag would be 4 ounces times the number of apples, which is 4x ounces.",
    "The weight of the oranges in one bag would be 3 ounces times the number of oranges, which is 3x ounces.",
    "The total weight of fruit in one bag is the sum of the weight of the apples and the weight of the oranges: 4x + 3x = 7x ounces.",
    "This total should be 49 ounces, as that's the capacity of each bag.",
    "Set up the equation: 7x = 49.",
    "Solve for x by dividing both sides by 7: x = 49 \u00f7 7 = 7.",
    "Each bag contains 7 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples for 3 bags is 3 times 7 apples.",
    "Calculate the total number of apples: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 apples.",
    "Each apple weighs 4 ounces, so calculate the total weight in ounces by multiplying the number of apples by the weight per apple: 21 apples \u00d7 4 ounces/apple = 84 ounces of apples."

  "solution": "84"
