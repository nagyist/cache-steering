  "query": "Steve has decided to become a baker. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he bakes apple pies. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he bakes cherry pies. If he bakes 12 pies per day, how many more apple pies does he bake than cherry pies in one week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days Steve bakes apple pies in one week.",
    "According to the information given, Steve bakes apple pies on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.",
    "There are 3 days in a week when he bakes apple pies: Monday, Wednesday, Friday.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many days Steve bakes cherry pies in one week.",
    "Steve bakes cherry pies on Tuesdays and Thursdays.",
    "There are 2 days in a week when he bakes cherry pies: Tuesday, Thursday.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many apple pies Steve bakes in one week.",
    "Steve bakes 12 pies per day. If he bakes apple pies for 3 days, he bakes 12 x 3 = 36 apple pies.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many cherry pies Steve bakes in one week.",
    "If he bakes cherry pies for 2 days, he bakes 12 x 2 = 24 cherry pies.",
    "Now I need to find out how many more apple pies Steve bakes than cherry pies in one week.",
    "To find this, I subtract the number of cherry pies from the number of apple pies: 36 - 24.",
    "36 - 24 equals 12."
