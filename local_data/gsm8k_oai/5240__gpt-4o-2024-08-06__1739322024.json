  "query": "Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory. If Tory has 6 video games, how many video games does Theresa have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many video games Julia has. We are given that Julia has a third as many video games as Tory.",
    "Tory has 6 video games.",
    "Since Julia has a third as many as Tory, Julia has 6 / 3 = 2 video games.",
    "Now, we need to calculate how many video games Theresa has. We know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia.",
    "Julia has 2 video games. Thrice of Julia's video games is 3 * 2 = 6.",
    "Theresa has 5 more than this amount, so she has 6 + 5 = 11 video games."

  "solution": "11"
