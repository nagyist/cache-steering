  "query": "The school band is having a car wash to raise money. Their goal is to collect $150. So far they have earned $10 each from three families and $5 each from 15 families. How much more money do they have to earn to reach their goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much money they have earned from the three families who paid $10 each.",
    "Multiply 3 families by $10 per family: 3 * 10 = $30.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money they have earned from the 15 families who paid $5 each.",
    "Multiply 15 families by $5 per family: 15 * 5 = $75.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of money they have earned so far.",
    "Add the earnings from both groups of families: $30 + $75 = $105.",
    "Their goal is $150, so I need to calculate how much more money is needed to reach this goal.",
    "Subtract the amount they have earned from their goal: $150 - $105 = $45."
