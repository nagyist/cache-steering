  "query": "At peak hours, 11 am - 1 pm and 5 pm - 6 pm, the local fast-food restaurant serves 12 cars every 15 minutes.  Off-peak times, they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes.  From 4 pm - 6 pm, how many customers do they serve?",
  "steps": [
    "Determine the hours from 4 pm to 6 pm.",
    "From 4 pm to 6 pm consists of two hours.",
    "Convert the hours into minutes for finer calculation: 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes.",
    "Divide the 120 minutes into 15-minute intervals: 120 / 15 = 8 intervals.",
    "Identify peak hours within this timeframe: 5 pm - 6 pm is a peak hour.",
    "Determine the number of customers served during peak hours.",
    "From 5 pm to 6 pm, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes.",
    "Each interval during peak hours serves 12 cars.",
    "Calculate the total number of customers served during peak hours: 4 intervals x 12 cars = 48 cars.",
    "Determine the number of customers served during off-peak hours.",
    "From 4 pm to 5 pm, which is off-peak, there are 4 intervals.",
    "Each interval during off-peak hours serves 8 cars.",
    "Calculate the total number of customers served during off-peak hours: 4 intervals x 8 cars = 32 cars.",
    "Calculate the total number of customers served from 4 pm to 6 pm by adding the customers from peak and off-peak hours: 48 cars + 32 cars = 80 cars."
