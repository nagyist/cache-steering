  "query": "Liz bought a recipe book that cost $6, a baking dish that cost twice as much, five ingredients that cost $3 each, and an apron that cost a dollar more than the recipe book. Collectively, how much in dollars did Liz spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the cost of each item mentioned in the problem.",
    "The recipe book costs $6.",
    "The baking dish costs twice as much as the recipe book, so it is 2 * $6 = $12.",
    "Liz bought five ingredients, each costing $3. So, the total cost for the ingredients is 5 * $3 = $15.",
    "The apron costs a dollar more than the recipe book, so it is $6 + $1 = $7.",
    "Now, sum up all the costs to find the total amount Liz spent.",
    "The total cost of the items is $6 (recipe book) + $12 (baking dish) + $15 (ingredients) + $7 (apron).",
    "Add these amounts: $6 + $12 = $18.",
    "Add $18 + $15 = $33.",
    "Add $33 + $7 = $40."

  "solution": "40"
