    "James spends 10 minutes downloading the game.",
    "He spends half as long installing it, which is 10 minutes / 2 = 5 minutes.",
    "The combined time for downloading and installing is 10 minutes + 5 minutes = 15 minutes.",
    "He spends triple that combined time going through the tutorial, which is 15 minutes * 3 = 45 minutes.",

    "The total time is 10 minutes (downloading) + 5 minutes (installing) + 45 minutes (tutorial).",
    "Calculating this gives 10 + 5 + 45 = 60 minutes."
