  "query": "Jack is trying to stack cans in his emergency bunker. If he can fit 12 cans in one row, 4 rows on one shelf, and 10 shelves in one closet, how many cans can he store in each closet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cans fit on one shelf.",
    "There are 12 cans in one row and 4 rows on one shelf.",
    "I multiply the number of cans per row by the number of rows: 12 cans/row * 4 rows = 48 cans.",
    "So, 48 cans fit on one shelf.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cans fit in the entire closet.",
    "There are 10 shelves in one closet.",
    "I multiply the number of cans per shelf by the number of shelves: 48 cans/shelf * 10 shelves = 480 cans."

  "solution": "480"
