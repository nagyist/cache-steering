  "query": "Bennett sells window screens. He sold twice as many window screens in February as he sold last month. In February, Bennett sold a fourth of what he sold in March. If Bennet sold 8800 window screens in March, how many screens did Bennett sell from January to March?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by understanding the relationships between the months. We know that what Bennett sold in February is twice what he sold in January.",
    "We also know that the amount sold in February is a fourth of what he sold in March.",
    "We are given that Bennett sold 8800 window screens in March.",
    "Using the information that February's sales are a fourth of March's sales, we calculate February's sales as 8800 divided by 4.",
    "When we divide 8800 by 4, we get 2200 screens.",
    "Now that we know Bennett sold 2200 screens in February, we also know this amount is twice what he sold in January.",
    "We can find January's sales by dividing February's sales by 2.",
    "Dividing 2200 by 2 gives us 1100 screens sold in January.",
    "Now we know the number of screens sold in each month: 1100 in January, 2200 in February, and 8800 in March.",
    "To find the total number of screens sold from January to March, we add up the screens sold in each month.",
    "1100 (January) + 2200 (February) + 8800 (March) equals a total of 12100 screens."

  "solution": "12100"
