  "query": "There are 6 people going on an airplane trip.  They each have 5 bags of luggage.  Each of their bags weighs the maximum weight allowed, 50 pounds.  The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.  How many more bags at maximum weight can the plane hold?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many bags are there in total for the 6 people.",
    "Each of the 6 people has 5 bags.",
    "So, I calculate the total number of bags by multiplying 6 people by 5 bags each.",
    "6 * 5 = 30 bags in total.",
    "Next, I determine the total weight of these 30 bags.",
    "Each bag weighs 50 pounds.",
    "So, I multiply the total number of bags (30) by the weight of each bag (50 pounds).",
    "30 * 50 = 1500 pounds",
    "Now, I determine how much total luggage weight the airplane can hold.",
    "The airplane can hold up to 6000 pounds of luggage.",
    "I need to find out how much remaining capacity the airplane has for more luggage.",
    "I subtract the total weight of the existing luggage (1500 pounds) from the airplane's total capacity (6000 pounds).",
    "6000 - 1500 = 4500 pounds",
    "I need to find out how many additional bags of the maximum weight can fit into the remaining capacity.",
    "Each additional bag also weighs 50 pounds.",
    "I divide the remaining capacity (4500 pounds) by the weight of one bag (50 pounds) to find out how many more bags can be added.",
    "4500 / 50 = 90"
  ],
  "solution": "90"
