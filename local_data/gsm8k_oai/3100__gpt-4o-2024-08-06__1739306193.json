  "query": "There are three dogs in the backyard. They like apples, blueberries, and bonnies. The first dog, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog that likes blueberries. The dog that likes blueberries eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog. If the dog that likes bonnies ate 60 of them, calculate the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what each dog likes: apples, blueberries, and bonnies. I will label them as Dog A, Dog B, and Dog C respectively.",
    "Dog A likes apples. Dog B likes blueberries. Dog C likes bonnies.",
    "Dog C, which likes bonnies, ate 60 bonnies.",
    "Dog B, which likes blueberries, eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by Dog C.",
    "Dog B eats (3/4) * 60 bonnies = 45 blueberries.",
    "Dog A, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by Dog B.",
    "Dog A eats 3 * 45 blueberries = 135 apples.",
    "Now I can calculate the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs.",
    "Dog A eats 135 apples. Dog B eats 45 blueberries. Dog C eats 60 bonnies.",
    "Total fruits eaten = 135 apples + 45 blueberries + 60 bonnies = 240 fruits."
