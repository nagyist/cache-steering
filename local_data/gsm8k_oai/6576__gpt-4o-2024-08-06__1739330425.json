  "query": "Aaron is gathering can lids to take to the recycling center. He uses 3 equal-sized boxes of canned tomatoes and adds the lids he gets to the 14 can lids he already has. He is now taking 53 can lids to the recycling center. How many cans lids did he get from each box?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Aaron already had 14 can lids before adding more from the boxes.",
    "He is now taking 53 can lids to the recycling center.",
    "The additional lids come from 3 equal-sized boxes.",
    "I can calculate the total number of lids that came from the boxes by subtracting the lids he initially had from the current total.",
    "53 lids (total) - 14 lids (initial) = 39 lids (from the boxes).",
    "I need to determine how many lids came from each of the 3 boxes.",
    "Since the 39 lids came equally from 3 boxes, I will divide 39 by 3.",
    "39 \u00f7 3 = 13 lids per box."

  "solution": "13"
