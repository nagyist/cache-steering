  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the number of voters in District 3. District 3 has twice as many voters as District 1.",
    "District 1 has 322 voters. So, District 3 has 2 times 322 voters.",
    "Calculating the number of voters in District 3: 2 * 322 = 644.",
    "Now, I know that District 2 has 19 less voters than District 3.",
    "District 3 has 644 voters, so District 2 has 644 - 19 voters.",
    "Calculating the number of voters in District 2: 644 - 19 = 625.",
    "Now I have the number of voters in each district. District 1 has 322 voters, District 2 has 625 voters, and District 3 has 644 voters.",
    "To find the total number of voters in Districts 1, 2, and 3, I need to add up the number of voters in each district.",
    "Calculating the total voters: 322 + 625 + 644.",
    "322 + 625 = 947.",
    "947 + 644 = 1591."
