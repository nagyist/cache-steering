  "query": "Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total cost of the two pairs of socks.",
    "Each pair of socks costs $9.50.",
    "The total cost for two pairs of socks would be $9.50 multiplied by 2.",
    "$9.50 times 2 equals $19.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total cost of the soccer shoes.",
    "The shoes cost $92.",
    "Next, I'll add the cost of the shoes and the total cost of the socks together to get the total amount Jack needs to spend.",
    "$19 for the socks plus $92 for the shoes equals a total of $111.",
    "Jack currently has $40.",
    "I'll subtract the $40 Jack has from the total amount he needs, which is $111.",
    "$111 minus $40 equals $71.",
    "So, Jack needs $71 more to buy the two pairs of socks and the soccer shoes."
