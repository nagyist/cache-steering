  "query": "Johann had 60 oranges. He decided to eat 10. Once he ate them, half were stolen by Carson. Carson returned exactly 5. How many oranges does Johann have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Johann started with 60 oranges.",
    "He ate 10 oranges, so we subtract 10 from 60.",
    "60 - 10 = 50 oranges remain after Johann ate 10.",
    "Half of these 50 oranges were stolen by Carson.",
    "To find half of 50, we divide 50 by 2.",
    "50 / 2 = 25 oranges were stolen.",
    "The remaining oranges are 50 - 25.",
    "50 - 25 = 25 oranges remain after the theft.",
    "Carson returned 5 oranges.",
    "Add these 5 returned oranges to the remaining 25.",
    "25 + 5 = 30 oranges."
