  "query": "In mid-May, the river flowing through Moreland is five feet deep. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. How many feet deep is the river by mid-July?",
  "steps": [
    "In mid-May, the river is five feet deep.",
    "By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May.",
    "This means that by mid-June, the river is 5 feet + 10 feet = 15 feet deep.",
    "By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June.",
    "So, the depth of the river by mid-July is 3 times 15 feet.",
    "Calculate 3 times 15 to find the depth in mid-July.",
    "3 times 15 is 45."
