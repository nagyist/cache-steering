  "query": "Braelynn has 24 knives in her kitchen and twice as many teaspoons as knives. If she bought 1/3 as many additional knives and 2/3 as many additional teaspoons, what would be the total number of cutlery pieces she has in her kitchen?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many teaspoons Braelynn initially has. She has twice as many teaspoons as knives.",
    "Braelynn has 24 knives. Therefore, the number of teaspoons is 2 times 24.",
    "2 times 24 equals 48. So, Braelynn initially has 48 teaspoons.",
    "Next, calculate how many additional knives she buys. She buys 1/3 as many additional knives.",
    "1/3 of 24 knives is 24 divided by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8. So, she buys 8 additional knives.",
    "Now, calculate how many additional teaspoons she buys. She buys 2/3 as many additional teaspoons.",
    "2/3 of 48 teaspoons is 48 times 2 divided by 3.",
    "48 times 2 equals 96. Then 96 divided by 3 equals 32. So, she buys 32 additional teaspoons.",
    "Add up all the cutlery after the additional purchases. Start with the knives: 24 original knives plus 8 additional knives.",
    "24 plus 8 equals 32 knives in total.",
    "Now, add up the teaspoons: 48 original teaspoons plus 32 additional teaspoons.",
    "48 plus 32 equals 80 teaspoons in total.",
    "To find the total number of cutlery pieces, sum the total knives and teaspoons.",
    "32 knives plus 80 teaspoons equals 112 cutlery pieces in total."
