  "query": "John decides to replace all his hats.  He has enough hats to wear a different one every day for 2 weeks.  If each hat costs $50 how much do his hats cost?",
  "steps": [
    "John can wear a different hat every day for 2 weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "So, 2 weeks means 2 x 7 days.",
    "2 weeks = 14 days.",
    "This means John has 14 different hats.",
    "Each hat costs $50.",
    "To find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of hats by the cost of each hat.",
    "14 hats x $50 per hat = $700."
