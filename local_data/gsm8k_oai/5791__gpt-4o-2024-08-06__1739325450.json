  "query": "Elroy decides to enter a walk-a-thon and wants to make sure he ties last year's winner's cash collection. Last year, walkers earned $4 a mile. This year walkers earn $2.75 a mile. If last year's winner collected $44, how many more miles will Elroy walk than last year's winner to collect the same amount of money?",
  "steps": [
    "Last year's winner collected $44.",
    "The cash earned last year was $4 per mile.",
    "I need to find out how many miles last year's winner walked.",
    "To find the miles walked, I will divide the total amount earned by the rate per mile: $44 / $4 per mile.",
    "$44 divided by $4 is 11. So, last year's winner walked 11 miles.",
    "This year walkers earn $2.75 per mile.",
    "Elroy needs to collect $44 to tie last year's winner.",
    "To find out how many miles Elroy needs to walk, I will divide the total amount Elroy needs to collect by this year's rate per mile: $44 / $2.75 per mile.",
    "$44 divided by $2.75 is 16.",
    "Elroy needs to walk 16 miles.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many more miles Elroy will walk compared to last year's winner.",
    "Elroy needs to walk 16 miles and last year\u2019s winner walked 11 miles.",
    "The difference in miles walked is 16 - 11.",
    "That is 5 miles."
