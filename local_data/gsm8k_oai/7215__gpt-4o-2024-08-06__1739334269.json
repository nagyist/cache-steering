  "query": "A baker is comparing the day\u2019s sales to his daily average. He usually sells 20 pastries and 10 loaves of bread. Today, he sells 14 pastries and 25 loaves of bread. If pastries are sold for $2 and loaves of bread are sold for $4, what is the difference, in dollars, between the baker\u2019s daily average and total for today?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the baker's daily average sales in terms of dollars.",
    "The average sales from pastries are 20 pastries at $2 each.",
    "20 pastries * $2 = $40 from pastries.",
    "The average sales from loaves of bread are 10 loaves at $4 each.",
    "10 loaves * $4 = $40 from loaves of bread.",
    "The total average sales in dollars is $40 (pastries) + $40 (bread).",
    "The daily average in dollars is $80.",
    "Next, I calculate today's sales.",
    "Today he sells 14 pastries at $2 each.",
    "14 pastries * $2 = $28 from pastries.",
    "Today he sells 25 loaves of bread at $4 each.",
    "25 loaves * $4 = $100 from loaves of bread.",
    "Today's total sales in dollars are $28 (pastries) + $100 (bread).",
    "Today's total sales are $128.",
    "Now I find the difference between today's sales and the daily average.",
    "Today's sales ($128) minus the daily average sales ($80) gives the difference.",
    "$128 - $80 = $48."

  "solution": "48"
