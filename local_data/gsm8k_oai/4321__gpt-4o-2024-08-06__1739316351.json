  "query": "Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee. Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee. If Arnold has 5 jellybeans, how many jellybeans does Tino have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first find out how many jellybeans Lee has. We know that Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee.",
    "Arnold has 5 jellybeans.",
    "Since Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee, Lee must have twice the number of jellybeans as Arnold.",
    "Lee has 5 jellybeans * 2 = 10 jellybeans.",
    "Now, we need to find out how many jellybeans Tino has. We know that Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee.",
    "Lee has 10 jellybeans. Therefore, Tino has 10 + 24 jellybeans.",
    "10 + 24 equals 34.",
    "So, Tino has 34 jellybeans."

  "solution": "34"
