    "I need to find out how many miles per gallon Martha's car gets.",
    "Darlene's car gets 20 miles per gallon.",
    "Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon as Darlene's car.",
    "Half of 20 miles per gallon is 20 / 2 = 10 miles per gallon.",
    "I now need to find out how many gallons Martha's car requires to make a 300-mile trip.",
    "To do this, I'll divide the total miles by her car's miles per gallon.",
    "300 miles \u00f7 10 miles per gallon = 30 gallons."
