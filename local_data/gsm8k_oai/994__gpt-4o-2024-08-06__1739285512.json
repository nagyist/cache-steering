  "query": "Dean ordered 2 large pizzas that were each cut into 12 slices.  His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie.  Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza.  Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza.  How many total slices were left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many slices were there in total initially from both pizzas.",
    "Each large pizza is cut into 12 slices.",
    "Dean ordered 2 pizzas, so 2 pizzas \u00d7 12 slices per pizza = 24 slices in total.",
    "Next, I'll follow up on how many slices were eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy from each pizza.",
    "Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Half of 12 slices is 12/2 = 6 slices.",
    "Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.",
    "Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. A third of 12 slices is 12/3 = 4 slices.",
    "Now I will add up all the slices that were eaten.",
    "Dean ate 6, Frank ate 3, and Sammy ate 4.",
    "Total slices eaten = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 slices.",
    "Finally, I will subtract the total slices eaten from the initial total number of slices to find how many slices are left.",
    "24 total slices - 13 eaten slices = 11 slices left over."

  "solution": "11"
