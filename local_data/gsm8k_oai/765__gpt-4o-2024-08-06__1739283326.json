  "query": "Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?",

    "Brenda initially has 250 peaches.",
    "Out of these 250 peaches, only 60% are fresh.",
    "To find the number of fresh peaches, I calculate 60% of 250.",
    "60% of 250 is calculated as (60/100) * 250.",
    "(60/100) * 250 equals 150.",
    "This means Brenda has 150 fresh peaches initially.",
    "Brenda needs to throw away 15 peaches for being too small.",
    "I subtract 15 from the 150 fresh peaches.",
    "150 - 15 equals 135.",
    "Brenda has 135 peaches left after removing the too small ones."
