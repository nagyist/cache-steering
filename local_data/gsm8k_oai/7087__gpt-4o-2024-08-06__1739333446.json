  "query": "To earn an airplane pilot certificate, Sangita is required to fly 1,500 hours. She has already completed 50 hours of day flying, 9 hours of night flying, and 121 hours flying cross-country. To meet her goal in exactly 6 months, how many hours per month must Sangita fly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the total number of hours Sangita has already flown.",
    "She has flown 50 hours of day flying, 9 hours of night flying, and 121 hours of cross-country flying.",
    "Add these hours together: 50 + 9 + 121 = 180 hours.",
    "Sangita needs a total of 1,500 hours to earn her certificate.",
    "Subtract the hours she has already completed from the total required: 1,500 - 180 = 1,320 hours.",
    "She has 6 months to complete the remaining hours.",
    "To find out how many hours per month she needs to fly, divide the remaining hours by the number of months: 1,320 hours \u00f7 6 months = 220 hours per month."

  "solution": "220"
