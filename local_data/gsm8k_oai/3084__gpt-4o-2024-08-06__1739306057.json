  "query": "Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Susan wants to fill a basket that holds 60 strawberries.",
    "She picks 5 strawberries in a handful but eats 1 from each handful.",
    "This means that for every 5 strawberries she picks, 4 strawberries go into her basket because she eats 1.",
    "To solve the problem, I need to find out how many complete handfuls it takes to fill her basket with 60 strawberries.",
    "Let me calculate the number of handfuls needed to accumulate 60 strawberries in the basket.",
    "For each handful, 4 strawberries are added to the basket.",
    "If I divide 60 strawberries by 4 strawberries per handful, I get the number of handfuls needed: 60 / 4 = 15.",
    "Susan needs 15 handfuls to fill her basket with 60 strawberries (4 strawberries per handful).",
    "Since she picks 5 strawberries per handful, let's calculate how many strawberries she picks in total.",
    "She picks 5 strawberries for each of the 15 handfuls.",
    "So, she picks a total of 5 * 15 = 75 strawberries."

  "solution": "75"
