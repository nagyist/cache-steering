  "query": "On a highway, the total number of vehicles passing is 300. If the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks, find out the total number of trucks on the highway?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of trucks be denoted by \\( t \\).",
    "According to the problem, the number of cars is twice the number of trucks, so the number of cars is \\( 2t \\).",
    "The total number of vehicles is the sum of trucks and cars.",
    "Thus, we can write the equation: \\( t + 2t = 300 \\).",
    "Combining like terms, we have \\( 3t = 300 \\).",
    "To find the number of trucks, divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "So, \\( t = \\frac{300}{3} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{300}{3} \\) to find \\( t \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{300}{3} = 100 \\)."
