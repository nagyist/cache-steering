  "query": "Sarah is in charge of making 2 copies of a contract for 9 people that will be in a meeting.  The contract is 20 pages long.  How many pages will Sarah copy?",
  "steps": [
    "Sarah needs to make 2 copies of the contract for each person attending the meeting.",
    "There are 9 people attending the meeting.",
    "Each contract is 20 pages long.",
    "First, I will calculate the total number of contracts that need to be copied.",
    "Since 2 copies are needed for each of 9 people, that means 2 * 9 = 18 copies are needed in total.",
    "Now I will calculate the total number of pages Sarah needs to copy for these contracts.",
    "Each contract is 20 pages, so Sarah will copy 18 contracts, each consisting of 20 pages.",
    "The total number of pages to copy is 18 contracts * 20 pages each = 360 pages."

  "solution": "360"
