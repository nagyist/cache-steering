  "query": "There are 66 goats at a farm and twice as many chickens. If the number of ducks is half of the total of the goats and chickens, and the number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks, how many more goats are there than pigs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of chickens. Since there are twice as many chickens as goats, and there are 66 goats, the number of chickens is 2 * 66.",
    "Calculating the number of chickens: 2 * 66 = 132.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of goats and chickens combined. This is 66 (goats) + 132 (chickens).",
    "Calculating the total number of goats and chickens: 66 + 132 = 198.",
    "The number of ducks is half the total of the goats and chickens, which is 198/2.",
    "Calculating the number of ducks: 198 / 2 = 99.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of pigs. The number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks, which is 99/3.",
    "Calculating the number of pigs: 99 / 3 = 33.",
    "Finally, I need to find out how many more goats there are than pigs. The number of goats is 66 and the number of pigs is 33.",
    "Calculating the difference in the number of goats and pigs: 66 - 33 = 33."
