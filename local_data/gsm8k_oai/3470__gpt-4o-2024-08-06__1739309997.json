  "query": "John's car needs a new engine.  The labor costs $75 an hour for 16 hours.  The part itself cost $1200.  How much did the repairs cost in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total labor cost.",
    "The labor cost is $75 per hour.",
    "The labor is expected to take 16 hours.",
    "I multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: \\(75 \\times 16\\).",
    "Calculating \\(75 \\times 16\\) gives me \\(1200\\).",
    "Now, I add the cost of the part to the labor cost.",
    "The cost of the part is $1200.",
    "So, the total cost is the labor cost ($1200) plus the cost of the part ($1200).",
    "I add these together: \\(1200 + 1200\\).",
    "Calculating \\(1200 + 1200\\) gives \\(2400\\)."

  "solution": "2400"
