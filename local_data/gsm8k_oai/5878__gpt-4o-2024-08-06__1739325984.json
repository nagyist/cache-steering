  "query": "TreQuan is throwing rocks in the river and he notices that the bigger the rock, the wider the splash. Pebbles make a splash that is a 1/4 meter wide. Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by calculating the total splash width from the pebbles. Each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide.",
    "He tosses 6 pebbles, so I multiply the splash width of one pebble by 6: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\).",
    "\\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).",
    "Now I calculate the total splash width from the rocks. Each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide.",
    "He tosses 3 rocks, so I multiply the splash width of one rock by 3: \\( 3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).",
    "\\( 3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).",
    "Next, I calculate the total splash width from the boulders. Each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide.",
    "He tosses 2 boulders, so I multiply the splash width of one boulder by 2: \\( 2 \\times 2 \\).",
    "\\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).",
    "I add up all the separate splash widths to get the total splash width.",
    "I add the splash widths of pebbles, rocks, and boulders: \\( \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 4 \\).",
    "First, I add the fractions: \\( \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\).",
    "Then I add this result to the splash width from the boulders: \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\)."
