Finally on the fourth week, she walks 4 miles a day, 6 days a week.  How many miles has she walked in 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "In the first week, Jodi walks 1 mile a day for 6 days.",
    "1 mile/day * 6 days/week = 6 miles in the first week.",
    "In the second week, Jodi walks 2 miles a day for 6 days.",
    "2 miles/day * 6 days/week = 12 miles in the second week.",
    "In the third week, Jodi walks 3 miles a day for 6 days.",
    "3 miles/day * 6 days/week = 18 miles in the third week.",
    "In the fourth week, Jodi walks 4 miles a day for 6 days.",
    "4 miles/day * 6 days/week = 24 miles in the fourth week.",
