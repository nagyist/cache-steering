  "query": "Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Zach will earn from his weekly allowance. His allowance is $5 each week.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the amount Zach will earn from mowing the lawn. He will earn $10 for this task.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much Zach will earn from babysitting for 2 hours. His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour, so for 2 hours he will earn 2 * $7 = $14.",
    "I need to sum up all of Zach\u2019s earnings this week. That includes his allowance ($5), mowing the lawn ($10), and babysitting ($14).",
    "Zach\u2019s total earnings for the week would be $5 + $10 + $14 = $29.",
    "Next, I need to add his earnings for the week to the amount he has already saved up. He has already saved $65.",
    "The total amount Zach will have saved after adding his earnings to his current savings is $65 + $29 = $94.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much Zach still needs to reach the $100 required to buy the bike.",
    "Subtract the amount Zach will have saved ($94) from the cost of the bike ($100) to find out how much more he needs.",
    "The amount Zach still needs to earn is $100 - $94 = $6."
