  "query": "Tom Brady is shy of the passing yards record in a season. The current record is 5999 yards. He currently has 4200 yards with 6 games left in the season. How many passing yards per game does he need to average to beat the record?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many more yards Tom Brady needs to surpass the passing yards record.",
    "The current record is 5999 yards, and Tom currently has 4200 yards.",
    "I subtract Tom's current yards from the record: 5999 - 4200 = 1799 yards.",
    "This means Tom needs 1799 more yards to surpass the record.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many games he has left to achieve this.",
    "According to the information, he has 6 games left in the season.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the average number of yards per game he needs over these 6 games.",
    "I divide the total yards needed by the number of games remaining: 1799 yards \u00f7 6 games.",
    "Performing the division: 1799 \u00f7 6 = 299.8333...",
    "Since yards can't be in decimals, I round up to ensure he beats the record.",
    "Thus, Tom needs to average 300 yards per game to surpass the record."
