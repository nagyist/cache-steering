  "steps": [
    "Alan is counting the chairs in the office canteen.",
    "There are 2 round tables, and each round table has 6 chairs.",
    "To find the total number of chairs at the round tables, I should multiply the number of round tables by the number of chairs each has.",
    "2 round tables times 6 chairs per table equals 12 chairs.",
    "Now I need to count the chairs at the rectangular tables.",
    "There are 2 rectangular tables, and each rectangular table has 7 chairs.",
    "I will multiply the number of rectangular tables by the number of chairs each has to find the total here too.",
    "2 rectangular tables times 7 chairs per table equals 14 chairs.",
    "Now I need to add the number of chairs from the round tables and the rectangular tables.",
    "There are 12 chairs from the round tables and 14 chairs from the rectangular tables.",
    "Adding 12 and 14 gives me the total number of chairs.",
    "12 plus 14 is equal to 26."
