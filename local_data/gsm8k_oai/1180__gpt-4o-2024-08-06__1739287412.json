  "query": "A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many servings one 8 piece fried chicken bucket with 2 sides provides. According to the question, it feeds 6 people.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many servings are required for 36 family members. Since each bucket feeds 6 people, I will divide 36 by 6 to find the number of buckets needed.",
    "36 divided by 6 is 6. This means Monty will need 6 buckets to feed all 36 people.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost for 6 buckets. I know each bucket costs $12.00, so I'll multiply 6 by 12 to find the total cost.",
    "6 times 12 is 72. So, the total cost for 6 buckets to feed all 36 family members will be $72.00."
  ],
  "solution": "72"
