  "query": "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's assign variables to each person's age. Let Leah's age be L.",
    "According to the problem, Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. So Rachel's age can be expressed as L + 4.",
    "We are given that the sum of their ages is 34. Therefore, we can create the equation: L + (L + 4) = 34.",
    "Let's simplify the equation: L + L + 4 = 34.",
    "Combine like terms: 2L + 4 = 34.",
    "To isolate 2L, subtract 4 from both sides: 2L = 34 - 4.",
    "Calculate the right side of the equation: 2L = 30.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for L: L = 30 / 2.",
    "Calculate the value of L: L = 15.",
    "Now, we've found Leah's age, which is 15.",
    "Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, so Rachel's age is L + 4.",
    "Substitute Leah\u2019s age into the expression for Rachel\u2019s age: Rachel's age = 15 + 4.",
    "Calculate Rachel's age: Rachel's age = 19."
