  "query": "James drives 30 mph for half an hour and then twice as long for twice the speed.  How far did he drive in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the first part of the trip.",
    "James drives for 30 minutes at 30 mph.",
    "30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours.",
    "Distance is calculated as speed multiplied by time.",
    "So, the distance for the first part is 30 mph * 0.5 hours.",
    "This is equal to 15 miles.",
    "Now, let's consider the second part of the trip.",
    "The second part of the trip is twice as long as the first part, so it is 1 hour.",
    "James drives at twice the speed during the second part of the trip.",
    "Twice the speed of 30 mph is 60 mph.",
    "So, the distance for the second part is 60 mph * 1 hour.",
    "This is equal to 60 miles.",
    "Now, let's find the total distance driven.",
    "The total distance is the sum of both parts: 15 miles + 60 miles.",
    "This is equal to 75 miles."

  "solution": "75"
