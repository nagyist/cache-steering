  "query": "Joe likes to play video games and he normally spends $50 a month on video games.  Joe also sells his games for $30 each once he is done playing them. If he starts with $240, how many months can he buy games at $50 and sell them at $30 before he is out of money?",
  "steps": [
    "Joe starts with $240.",
    "Joe buys video games at $50 each month.",
    "After buying a game, he can sell it for $30.",
    "In one month, Joe spends $50 on a game.",
    "He then sells the game for $30, getting back $30.",
    "The net cost per month is $50 - $30 = $20.",
    "I need to calculate how many months Joe can sustain this before running out of money.",
    "Joe's initial amount of money is $240.",
    "Joe's monthly net expense is $20.",
    "To find out how many months he can continue, I divide his total money by the monthly net expense.",
    "240 \u00f7 20 = 12."
