  "query": "There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total consumption of bread slices per day for all four members.",
    "Each member consumes 3 slices for breakfast and 2 for snacks. That\u2019s 3 + 2 = 5 slices per member per day.",
    "Since there are 4 members, the household consumes 4 x 5 = 20 slices of bread per day.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of slices in five loaves of bread.",
    "Each loaf contains 12 slices, so 5 loaves contain 5 x 12 = 60 slices of bread.",
    "I need to determine how many days 60 slices will last if the household consumes 20 slices per day.",
    "Dividing the total slices by the daily consumption gives 60 slices \u00f7 20 slices per day = 3 days."
