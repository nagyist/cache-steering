  "query": "The post office receives 60 letters and 20 packages per day. How many pieces of mail does it handle in six months if all the months have 30 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many pieces of mail are received in a single day.",
    "The post office receives 60 letters and 20 packages per day.",
    "Add the number of letters and packages: 60 letters + 20 packages = 80 pieces of mail per day.",
    "Next, determine how many pieces of mail are handled in a month.",
    "Each month has 30 days.",
    "Multiply the daily mail by the number of days in a month: 80 pieces of mail/day * 30 days/month = 2400 pieces of mail/month.",
    "Now, calculate the number of pieces of mail handled in six months.",
    "Multiply the monthly mail count by six: 2400 pieces of mail/month * 6 months = 14400 pieces of mail."

  "solution": "14400"
