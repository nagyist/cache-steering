  "query": "Lillian is making chocolate cupcakes to sell at a fundraiser. She only has 3 cups of sugar at home. She goes to the store and buys 2 bags of sugar. Each bag of sugar contains 6 cups. The batter uses 1 cup of sugar per 12 cupcakes. She needs 2 cups of sugar to make enough frosting for a dozen cupcakes. How many dozen cupcakes can she bake and ice with the sugar she has?",
  "steps": [
    "Lillian has 3 cups of sugar at home initially.",
    "She buys 2 bags of sugar, each containing 6 cups.",
    "2 bags times 6 cups per bag equals 12 cups of sugar purchased.",
    "Adding the 12 cups she bought to the 3 cups she had gives her a total of 15 cups of sugar.",
    "The problem states that 1 cup of sugar is needed for the batter of 12 cupcakes.",
    "Additionally, 2 cups of sugar are needed for the frosting for those 12 cupcakes.",
    "So in total, 3 cups of sugar are needed per dozen (12) cupcakes (1 cup for batter + 2 cups for frosting).",
    "Divide the total amount of sugar Lillian has (15 cups) by the 3 cups needed per dozen cupcakes.",
    "15 cups of sugar divided by 3 cups per dozen equals 5."
