  "query": "The running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command is 10 minutes longer than that of Alpha Epsilon, which is 30 minutes shorter than that of Millennium. If Millennium runs for 2 hours, what is the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command in minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command in minutes.",
    "First, let's establish the running time of Millennium.",
    "Millennium runs for 2 hours.",
    "Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Millennium runs for 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find the running time of Alpha Epsilon.",
    "Alpha Epsilon runs 30 minutes shorter than Millennium.",
    "So, Alpha Epsilon runs for 120 minutes - 30 minutes = 90 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to find the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command.",
    "Beast of War: Armoured Command runs 10 minutes longer than Alpha Epsilon.",
    "Therefore, Beast of War: Armoured Command runs for 90 minutes + 10 minutes = 100 minutes."
