  "query": "Jack and Jill shared the cost of renting a cottage that costs $5 an hour. If they rented it for eight hours, how much did each friend pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of renting the cottage.",
    "The cost of renting the cottage is $5 per hour.",
    "They rented the cottage for 8 hours.",
    "I multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $5/hour * 8 hours.",
    "This gives a total cost of $40 for renting the cottage.",
    "Jack and Jill shared the total cost equally.",
    "To find out how much each paid, I need to divide the total cost by the number of people, which is 2.",
    "$40 \u00f7 2 equals $20."

  "solution": "20"
