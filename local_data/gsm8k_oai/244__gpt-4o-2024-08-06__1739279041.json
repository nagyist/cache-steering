  "query": "A fox can run at the maximum speed of 50 kilometers per hour. Considering the fox would run at a constant speed, what distance would he make during 120 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that speed is measured in kilometers per hour in this problem.",
    "The fox can run at a maximum speed of 50 kilometers per hour.",
    "Time is given in minutes in the problem, specifically 120 minutes.",
    "120 minutes need to be converted to hours because the speed is in kilometers per hour.",
    "I know that 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, so 120 minutes is equivalent to 120 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour.",
    "Calculating that, 120 \u00f7 60 = 2 hours.",
    "I now have the time in hours, which is 2 hours.",
    "To find the distance, I can use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "Substituting the known values into the formula gives: distance = 50 km/h \u00d7 2 hours.",
    "Calculating that, distance = 100 km.",
    "Thus, the distance the fox would run in 120 minutes at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour is 100 kilometers."
