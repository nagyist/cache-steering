  "query": "Joy has 30 pencils, and Colleen has 50 pencils. If they bought the pencils at $4 each at the store, how much more money did Colleen pay than Joy for her pencils?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many pencils each person has.",
    "Joy has 30 pencils.",
    "Colleen has 50 pencils.",
    "I need to calculate the total cost of the pencils for both Joy and Colleen.",
    "Each pencil costs $4.",
    "First, I'll calculate the total cost of the pencils for Joy.",
    "Joy bought 30 pencils, and each costs $4.",
    "So, the cost for Joy is 30 pencils * $4 per pencil = $120.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total cost of the pencils for Colleen.",
    "Colleen bought 50 pencils, and each costs $4.",
    "So, the cost for Colleen is 50 pencils * $4 per pencil = $200.",
    "I need to find out how much more money Colleen paid than Joy.",
    "To find that, I'll subtract the cost of Joy's pencils from the cost of Colleen's pencils.",
    "Colleen paid $200, and Joy paid $120.",
    "The difference is $200 - $120 = $80."
