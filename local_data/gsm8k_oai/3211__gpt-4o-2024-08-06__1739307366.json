  "query": "Coral reads 30 pages of a book on night 1, and 2 less than twice that on night 2.  Night 3 Coral reads 3 more pages than the sum of the first two nights.  How many total pages did Coral read in the 3 nights?",
  "steps": [
    "Coral reads 30 pages on night 1.",
    "On night 2, Coral reads 2 less than twice the pages she read on night 1.",
    "Twice the pages read on night 1 is 2 * 30 = 60.",
    "2 less than 60 is 60 - 2 = 58.",
    "So, Coral reads 58 pages on night 2.",
    "On night 3, Coral reads 3 more pages than the sum of the pages read on the first two nights.",
    "The sum of the pages read on night 1 and night 2 is 30 + 58 = 88.",
    "3 more than 88 is 88 + 3 = 91.",
    "So, Coral reads 91 pages on night 3.",
    "The total pages read over the 3 nights is the sum of pages read on each night.",
    "This total is 30 + 58 + 91.",
    "30 + 58 = 88.",
    "88 + 91 = 179."

  "solution": "179"
