  "query": "It takes John 13 seconds to run 100 meters.  He only goes 4 meters in the first second.  He then maintains the same speed for the rest of the race.  James is 2 m/s faster at the top speed and he can run the first 10 meters in 2 seconds.  How long does it take James to run 100 meters?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate John's speed after the first second.",
    "John runs 4 meters in the first second, so he covers the remaining 96 meters in 12 seconds (since the total time is 13 seconds).",
    "John's speed after the first second is 96 meters / 12 seconds = 8 meters/second.",
    "Now, I'll calculate James's speed.",
    "James is 2 meters/second faster than John, so his speed after the first segment is 8 + 2 = 10 meters/second.",
    "Now, determine how long it takes James to finish the first 10 meters.",
    "According to the problem, James runs the first 10 meters in 2 seconds.",
    "James has 90 meters left to run after the first 10 meters.",
    "Since his speed after the first segment is 10 meters/second, he will run the remaining 90 meters in 90 meters / 10 meters/second = 9 seconds.",
    "Now, I will add the time James took to run the first 10 meters with the time to run the next 90 meters.",
    "James takes 2 seconds for the first 10 meters and 9 seconds for the remaining 90 meters.",
    "Therefore, the total time James takes to run 100 meters is 2 + 9 = 11 seconds."
