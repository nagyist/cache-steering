  "query": "My mother celebrated her birthday with a total of 60 guests. Half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many women were at the celebration. Since half of the guests are women, I calculate half of 60.",
    "60 divided by 2 equals 30. So, there are 30 women at the celebration.",
    "It is stated that there are 15 men at the celebration.",
    "I need to determine how many children were there initially. I start by adding the number of women (30) and men (15) together to know how many of these adults are present at the celebration.",
    "30 plus 15 equals 45. So, there are 45 adults at the celebration.",
    "To find out how many children there are, I subtract the number of adults (45) from the total number of guests (60).",
    "60 minus 45 equals 15. So, there are 15 children at the celebration initially.",
    "Next, I find out how many men left the celebration. It is given that 1/3 of the men left.",
    "1/3 of 15 men equals 5. So, 5 men left the celebration.",
    "In addition, 5 children left the celebration.",
    "I calculate the total number of guests who left by adding the 5 men and the 5 children who left.",
    "5 plus 5 equals 10. So, 10 guests left the celebration.",
    "Finally, I calculate how many people remained at the celebration. I subtract the number of people who left (10) from the initial total number of guests (60).",
    "60 minus 10 equals 50. So, 50 people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration."
