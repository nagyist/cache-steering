  "query": "The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds.  Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds.  Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm going to start by finding the weight of Jessica's pumpkin. It says Jessica's pumpkin was half the weight of Brad's.",
    "Brad's pumpkin weighs 54 pounds.",
    "Half of Brad's pumpkin weight would be 54 pounds divided by 2.",
    "So, Jessica's pumpkin weighs 27 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find the weight of Betty's pumpkin. Betty's pumpkin weighed 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.",
    "Jessica's pumpkin weighs 27 pounds, so Betty's pumpkin would be 4 times 27.",
    "4 times 27 is 108.",
    "Now, Betty's pumpkin weighs 108 pounds.",
    "I'm supposed to find the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin.",
    "The heaviest pumpkin is Betty's at 108 pounds.",
    "The lightest pumpkin is Jessica's at 27 pounds.",
    "To find the difference, I'll subtract the weight of the lightest pumpkin from the heaviest pumpkin weight: 108 minus 27.",
    "108 minus 27 is 81."

  "solution": "81"
