    "First, I need to find how many movies Johnny TV produces in one year.",
    "L&J Productions produces 220 movies per year.",
    "Johnny TV produces 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions.",
    "To find 25 percent of 220, I calculate 0.25 * 220.",
    "0.25 * 220 equals 55.",
    "Johnny TV produces 220 + 55 movies per year.",
