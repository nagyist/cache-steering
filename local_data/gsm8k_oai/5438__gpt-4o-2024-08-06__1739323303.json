  "query": "Elena has 8 lilies and 5 tulips in her garden. Each lily has 6 petals. Each tulip has 3 petals. How many flower petals are in Elena\u2019s garden?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of petals from the lilies.",
    "There are 8 lilies and each lily has 6 petals.",
    "I multiply 8 lilies by 6 petals per lily: \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\) petals from the lilies.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of petals from the tulips.",
    "There are 5 tulips and each tulip has 3 petals.",
    "I multiply 5 tulips by 3 petals per tulip: \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) petals from the tulips.",
    "Now, I add the total number of petals from the lilies and the tulips.",
    "The total number of petals is \\(48 \\text{ (from lilies)} + 15 \\text{ (from tulips)}\\).",
    "I calculate the total: \\(48 + 15 = 63\\)."

  "solution": "63"
