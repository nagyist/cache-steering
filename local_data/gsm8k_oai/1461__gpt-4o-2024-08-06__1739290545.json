  "query": "Mark made a chalkboard that is 3 feet wide. It is 2 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the chalkboard?",
  "steps": [
    "The chalkboard is 3 feet wide.",
    "The length of the chalkboard is 2 times its width.",
    "The length can be calculated as: length = 2 * width.",
    "Substitute the width with 3 feet: length = 2 * 3.",
    "Calculate the length: length = 6 feet.",
    "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.",
    "Substitute the length and the width into the area formula: area = length * width.",
    "Calculate the area: area = 6 feet * 3 feet.",
    "Calculate: area = 18 square feet."
