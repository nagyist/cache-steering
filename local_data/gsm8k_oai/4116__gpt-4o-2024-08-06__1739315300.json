  "query": "Pierre decides to bring his mother out for ice cream. His treat. Each scoop is $2. If he gets 3 scoops and his mom gets 4, what is the total bill?",
  "steps": [
    "First I need to calculate the cost of Pierre's ice cream. Pierre gets 3 scoops, and each scoop costs $2.",
    "To find the total cost for Pierre, I multiply 3 scoops by $2 per scoop.",
    "3 scoops * $2 per scoop = $6. So Pierre's ice cream costs $6.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of his mom's ice cream. She gets 4 scoops, and each scoop also costs $2.",
    "To find the total cost for his mom, I multiply 4 scoops by $2 per scoop.",
    "4 scoops * $2 per scoop = $8. So his mom's ice cream costs $8.",
    "To find the total bill, I need to add the cost of Pierre's ice cream and his mom's ice cream together.",
    "$6 (Pierre's ice cream) + $8 (mom's ice cream) = $14.",
    "Checking my addition, 6 + 8 does equal 14."
