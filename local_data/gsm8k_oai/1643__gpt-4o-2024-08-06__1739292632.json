  "query": "There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost for the 3 small light bulbs. Each small light bulb costs $8.",
    "The cost for 3 small light bulbs is 3 multiplied by $8.",
    "3 x $8 equals $24.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost for the 1 large light bulb. The large light bulb costs $12.",
    "Since Valerie needs 1 large light bulb, the cost is just $12.",
    "Now, I will add the total cost of the small light bulbs and the large light bulb to get the overall cost.",
    "$24 (for small bulbs) plus $12 (for large bulb) equals $36.",
    "Valerie has $60 to spend. I need to subtract the total cost of $36 from her available budget.",
    "$60 minus $36 equals $24.",
    "Therefore, the amount of money Valerie will have left over is $24."

  "solution": "24"
