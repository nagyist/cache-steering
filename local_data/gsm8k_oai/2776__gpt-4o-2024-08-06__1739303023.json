  "query": "Last night, Jim bought a $7 lamp and a bulb which cost $4 less. If he bought 2 lamps and 6 bulbs, how much did Jim pay in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of one bulb.",
    "Jim bought a bulb which cost $4 less than the $7 lamp.",
    "That makes the cost of one bulb $7 - $4, which equals $3.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total cost for the two lamps.",
    "Each lamp costs $7, and he bought 2 lamps.",
    "The total cost for the lamps is 2 * $7, which equals $14.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total cost for the six bulbs.",
    "Each bulb costs $3, and he bought 6 bulbs.",
    "The total cost for the bulbs is 6 * $3, which equals $18.",
    "Now, I must add the total costs for the lamps and the bulbs.",
    "Total cost for lamps is $14, and total cost for bulbs is $18.",
    "Adding these together, I get $14 + $18 = $32."

  "solution": "32"
