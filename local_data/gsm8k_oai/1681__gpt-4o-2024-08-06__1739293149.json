  "steps": [
    "Jake washes his car once a week for 20 weeks.",
    "Since he can wash his car 4 times with 1 bottle of car wash soap, he needs 1 bottle for every 4 washes.",
    "To find out how many bottles he needs, I will divide the total number of washes by the number of washes per bottle. There are 20 washes needed, so 20 \u00f7 4 = 5 bottles.",
    "Each bottle costs $4.00.",
    "To find the total cost, I will multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 5 bottles \u00d7 $4.00 = $20.00."
