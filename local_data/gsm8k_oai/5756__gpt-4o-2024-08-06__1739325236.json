  "query": "Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan. Nathan wrote 25 letters in one hour. How many letters can the two write in 10 hours together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many letters Jacob can write in one hour.",
    "Jacob writes twice as fast as Nathan. Nathan writes 25 letters in one hour.",
    "So, Jacob can write 25 letters * 2 = 50 letters in one hour.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many letters Nathan can write in 10 hours.",
    "Nathan writes 25 letters per hour, so in 10 hours, Nathan writes 25 letters/hour * 10 hours = 250 letters.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many letters Jacob can write in 10 hours.",
    "Jacob writes 50 letters per hour, so in 10 hours, Jacob writes 50 letters/hour * 10 hours = 500 letters.",
    "Finally, I will add the letters written by Nathan and Jacob to find out how many letters they wrote together in 10 hours.",
    "Together, they wrote 250 letters + 500 letters = 750 letters."

  "solution": "750"
