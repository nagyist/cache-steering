  "query": "Ashton had two boxes of pencils with fourteen pencils in each box. He gave six pencils to his brother. How many pencils did Ashton have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pencils Ashton initially had in total.",
    "Ashton had two boxes, and each box contains fourteen pencils.",
    "To find the total number of pencils, I'll multiply the number of pencils per box by the number of boxes.",
    "14 pencils/box * 2 boxes = 28 pencils",
    "Now, Ashton gave six pencils to his brother.",
    "To find out how many pencils Ashton has left, I will subtract the number of pencils he gave away from the total number he initially had.",
    "28 pencils - 6 pencils = 22 pencils"
