  "query": "Oranges have 80 calories and cost $1.20 each. If Timmy has $10 and needs to make sure he gets 400 calories, how much money will he have left after he buys the oranges he needs?",
  "steps": [
    "Each orange has 80 calories.",
    "Timmy needs 400 calories.",
    "To find out how many oranges Timmy needs, I divide 400 by 80.",
    "400 divided by 80 equals 5.",
    "So, Timmy needs 5 oranges to get 400 calories.",
    "Each orange costs $1.20.",
    "To find the total cost for 5 oranges, I multiply 5 by $1.20.",
    "5 times 1.20 equals 6.",
    "Timmy has $10 initially.",
    "I subtract the $6 he spends on oranges from his initial $10.",
    "$10 minus $6 equals $4."
