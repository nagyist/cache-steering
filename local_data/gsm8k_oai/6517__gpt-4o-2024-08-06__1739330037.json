  "query": "Mabel lives 4500 steps directly east of Lake High school. Helen lives 3/4 the number of steps that Mabel lives, directly west of the school. What's the total number of steps Mabel will walk to visit Helen so that they can do their assignments together?",
  "steps": [
    "Mabel lives 4500 steps east of Lake High School.",
    "Helen lives 3/4 the number of steps that Mabel lives from the school.",
    "3/4 of 4500 steps is calculated as (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 steps.",
    "Helen lives 3375 steps west of the school.",
    "To find the total number of steps Mabel will walk to visit Helen, we first calculate the distance from Mabel's house to the school.",
    "Mabel will walk 4500 steps to reach Lake High School from her house.",
    "Next, Mabel will need to walk another 3375 steps from the school to reach Helen's house.",
    "Adding together these distances, the total number of steps Mabel will walk is 4500 (to the school) + 3375 (to Helen's house).",
    "4500 + 3375 steps equals 7875 steps."

  "solution": "7875"
