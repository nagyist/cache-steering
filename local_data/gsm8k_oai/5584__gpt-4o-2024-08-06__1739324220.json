  "query": "Marty and Biff were both running for student council president. A poll was taken to see how the candidate\u2019s campaigns were going. 45% of the people polled said they were voting for Biff and 8% were undecided. The rest said they are voting for Marty. If 200 people were polled, how many said they are voting for Marty?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that 45% of the people polled were voting for Biff.",
    "Then, I see that 8% of the people polled were undecided.",
    "Together, the portion of people either voting for Biff or undecided is 45% + 8% = 53%.",
    "Since these two categories account for 53% of the votes, the remainder must be voting for Marty.",
    "I calculate the percentage of people voting for Marty as 100% - 53% = 47%.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many people this percentage corresponds to in concrete numbers.",
    "47% of the 200 people polled are voting for Marty. Thus, I calculate 47% of 200.",
    "To find this, I multiply 200 by 47%, or 0.47 (in decimal form).",
    "200 \u00d7 0.47 = 94.",
    "Thus, 94 people said they are voting for Marty."
