  "query": "Tina decides to fill a jar with coins. In the first hour she puts in 20 coins. During the next two hours she puts in 30 coins each time. During the fourth hour she puts in 40 coins. During the fifth hour her mother asks to borrow some money so she takes 20 coins out. How many coins are left after the fifth hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify how many coins Tina adds in the first hour. She puts in 20 coins.",
    "In the next two hours, she adds 30 coins each hour.",
    "So, in the second hour, she adds 30 coins. By the end of the second hour, the total is 20 + 30 = 50 coins.",
    "In the third hour, she adds another 30 coins. By the end of the third hour, the total is 50 + 30 = 80 coins.",
    "In the fourth hour, she adds 40 coins. By the end of the fourth hour, the total is 80 + 40 = 120 coins.",
    "In the fifth hour, Tina takes out 20 coins because her mother asks to borrow some money. So, the total is 120 - 20 = 100 coins."
