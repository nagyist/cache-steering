  "query": "Lynne bought 7 books about cats and 2 books about the solar system. She also bought 3 magazines. Each book cost 7$ and each magazine cost $4. How much did Lynne spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the books Lynne bought.",
    "Lynne bought 7 books about cats.",
    "She also bought 2 books about the solar system.",
    "In total, she bought 7 + 2 = 9 books.",
    "Each book costs $7.",
    "To find the total cost of the books, I multiply the number of books by the cost per book.",
    "9 books \u00d7 $7 per book = $63.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the magazines.",
    "Lynne bought 3 magazines.",
    "Each magazine costs $4.",
    "To find the total cost of the magazines, I multiply the number of magazines by the cost per magazine.",
    "3 magazines \u00d7 $4 per magazine = $12.",
    "Now, I add the total cost of the books to the total cost of the magazines to find the total amount Lynne spent.",
    "$63 (books) + $12 (magazines) = $75."
