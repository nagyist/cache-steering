  "query": "A passenger train transports passengers between two stations located in two separate cities. On a particular day, the train carried 100 passengers from one station to the other one way, and on the return trip carried 60 passengers. If the train made three more round trips that day, taking the same number of people as the first trip in each trip, calculate the total number of passengers transported between both stations?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of passengers transported on the initial one-way trip.",
    "The train initially carried 100 passengers from one station to the other.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of passengers for the return trip.",
    "The train carried 60 passengers on its way back to the original station.",
    "Now, combining both the onward and return trips, I calculate the total number of passengers for the first round trip.",
    "For the first round trip, the total number of passengers is 100 (one way) + 60 (return), which equals 160 passengers.",
    "Then, I need to consider the subsequent three identical round trips the train made.",
    "Each of these additional round trips also carried 160 passengers.",
    "So, for three round trips, the total number of passengers is 3 times 160.",
    "3 times 160 equals 480 passengers.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of passengers from the initial round trip to the total from these additional trips.",
    "The initial round trip carried 160 passengers, and the three additional trips carried 480 passengers collectively.",
    "Summing these, I get 160 + 480, which equals 640 passengers in total."

  "solution": "640"
