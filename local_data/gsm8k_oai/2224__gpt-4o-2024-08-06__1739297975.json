  "query": "Samuel is arranging his grandma\u2019s teacups. They are stored in boxes and inside the boxes, they are stacked 5 rows high with 4 cups in each row. Of the 26 boxes in her attic, 6 of the boxes contain pans, half of the remaining boxes contain decorations, and the rest of the boxes contain her teacups. Samuel breaks 2 of the cups every time he picks up one of the boxes. By the time Samuel has taken all of the teacups out of the boxes, how many teacups are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how many boxes in total contain teacups.",
    "There are a total of 26 boxes.",
    "6 of these boxes contain pans.",
    "So, the remaining boxes are 26 - 6 = 20 boxes.",
    "Half of these remaining boxes contain decorations.",
    "Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 boxes.",
    "Therefore, the number of boxes containing teacups is 20 - 10 = 10 boxes.",
    "Each box has teacups arranged, stacked 5 rows high with 4 cups in each row.",
    "The number of teacups in each box is 5 rows * 4 cups/row = 20 cups.",
    "So, total number of teacups is 10 boxes * 20 cups/box = 200 teacups.",
    "Samuel breaks 2 teacups each time he picks up one box.",
    "Since there are 10 boxes of teacups, he will break 2 * 10 = 20 teacups in total.",
    "After breaking the teacups, the number of remaining teacups is 200 - 20 = 180 teacups."

  "solution": "180"
