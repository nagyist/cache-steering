  "query": "On Miss Lawrence's math exam, 80% of the 50 questions are problem-solving while the rest are multiple-choice questions. How many multiple-choice questions are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of problem-solving questions on the exam.",
    "The exam has 50 questions in total, and 80% of these questions are problem-solving questions.",
    "To find 80% of 50, I will multiply 50 by 0.8 (since 80% = 0.8).",
    "Calculating 50 * 0.8 to find the number of problem-solving questions: 50 * 0.8 = 40.",
    "There are 40 problem-solving questions on the exam.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of multiple-choice questions.",
    "The total number of questions on the exam is 50.",
    "Since there are 40 problem-solving questions, the remaining questions must be multiple-choice questions.",
    "Subtract 40 problem-solving questions from the total of 50 questions: 50 - 40 = 10.",
    "Thus, there are 10 multiple-choice questions on the exam."
