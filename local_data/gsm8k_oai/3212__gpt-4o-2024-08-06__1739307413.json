  "query": "A new condo development has 23 floors. Regular floors have 12 units, whereas penthouse floors have only 2 units. If the top 2 floors are assigned for penthouse units, how many units does this condo have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many regular floors there are. Since the top 2 floors are for penthouse units, I subtract 2 from the total number of floors.",
    "23 floors total minus 2 penthouse floors equals 21 regular floors.",
    "Now, I calculate the number of units on the regular floors. Each regular floor has 12 units.",
    "21 regular floors multiplied by 12 units per regular floor equals 252 units in regular floors.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of units on the penthouse floors. Each penthouse floor has 2 units.",
    "2 penthouse floors multiplied by 2 units per penthouse floor equals 4 units in penthouse floors.",
    "Now, I add the number of units from the regular floors and the penthouse floors to find the total number of units.",
    "252 units from regular floors plus 4 units from penthouse floors equals 256 total units."

  "solution": "256"
