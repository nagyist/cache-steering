  "query": "There are many fish in the tank. One third of them are blue, and half of the blue fish have spots. If there are 10 blue, spotted fish, how many fish are there in the tank?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's determine how many blue fish there are in total.",
    "The problem states that half of the blue fish have spots and that there are 10 blue, spotted fish.",
    "Since 10 blue fish have spots and this represents half of the blue fish, we can set up the equation: (1/2) * total blue fish = 10.",
    "Solving for the total number of blue fish, we multiply both sides by 2 to get total blue fish = 20.",
    "Based on the problem, one third of the total number of fish in the tank are blue.",
    "We establish that (1/3) * total fish = 20 since the total number of blue fish is 20.",
    "To find the total number of fish, multiply both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in total fish = 60."
