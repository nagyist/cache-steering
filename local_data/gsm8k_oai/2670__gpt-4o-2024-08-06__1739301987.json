  "query": "At a people counting station, the number of people counted on the first day was twice the total number counted on the second day. If 500 people were counted on the second day, how many people were counted on the two days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the number of people counted on the second day, which is given as 500.",
    "The number of people counted on the first day is twice the number counted on the second day.",
    "To find the number of people counted on the first day, I need to multiply the second day's count by 2.",
    "500 people were counted on the second day, so \\( 500 \\times 2 = 1000 \\) people were counted on the first day.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of people counted over the two days.",
    "I will add the number of people counted on the first day and the second day together: \\( 1000 + 500 \\).",
    "Calculating the total, I have \\( 1000 + 500 = 1500 \\)."
