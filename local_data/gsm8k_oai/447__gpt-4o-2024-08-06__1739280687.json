  "query": "Megan has read 32 books this year.  Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.  Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.  How many books total have Megan, Kelcie, and Greg read?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Megan has read 32 books this year.",
    "Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.",
    "I need to calculate 1/4 of 32 to determine how many books Kelcie has read.",
    "1/4 of 32 is calculated as 32 divided by 4.",
    "32 divided by 4 is 8. Therefore, Kelcie has read 8 books.",
    "Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.",
    "First, I need to calculate twice the number of books Kelcie has read, which is 2 times 8.",
    "2 times 8 equals 16.",
    "Greg has read 9 more than 16 books. So I add 9 to 16.",
    "16 plus 9 equals 25. Therefore, Greg has read 25 books.",
    "Now I add the number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg to find the total.",
    "Megan has read 32 books, Kelcie has read 8 books, and Greg has read 25 books.",
    "I add 32, 8, and 25 together.",
    "32 plus 8 is 40.",
    "40 plus 25 is 65."

  "solution": "65"
