  "query": "Susan, Arthur, Tom and, Bob are siblings. Arthur is 2 years older than Susan, and Tom is 3 years younger than Bob. If Bob is 11 years old, and Susan is 15 years old, how old are all four family members in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll identify the ages of Susan and Bob. Susan is 15 years old, and Bob is 11 years old.",
    "Next, I'll determine Arthur's age. Since Arthur is 2 years older than Susan, I'll add 2 years to Susan's age.",
    "So, Arthur's age is 15 + 2 = 17 years old.",
    "Now, I'll determine Tom's age. Tom is 3 years younger than Bob, so I'll subtract 3 years from Bob's age.",
    "Tom's age is 11 - 3 = 8 years old.",
    "Now, I have all their ages: Susan is 15, Arthur is 17, Tom is 8, and Bob is 11.",
    "I will add all these ages together to find the total age of the four siblings.",
    "15 + 17 + 8 + 11 = 51"

  "solution": "51"
