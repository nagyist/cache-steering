  "query": "Carol gets a fixed $20 allowance each week. She can also earn $1.5 more dollars each week if she does extra chores. At the end of 10 weeks, she has 425 dollars. How many extra chores did she average each week?",
  "steps": [
    "Carol receives a fixed $20 allowance each week.",
    "In 10 weeks, her total fixed allowance would be 10 weeks \u00d7 $20/week.",
    "Calculating 10 \u00d7 $20 gives $200.",
    "Carol has $425 at the end of 10 weeks.",
    "The difference between what she has ($425) and her total fixed allowance ($200) will be her earnings from extra chores.",
    "Calculating the difference, $425 - $200 equals $225.",
    "Extra earnings from chores amount to $225 over 10 weeks.",
    "For each extra chore, Carol earns $1.5.",
    "To find the total number of extra chores done in 10 weeks, divide extra earnings by earnings per chore. This is $225 \u00f7 $1.5.",
    "Calculating $225 \u00f7 $1.5 equals 150.",
    "Total extra chores over 10 weeks is 150.",
    "To find the average number of extra chores per week, divide the total number of extra chores by the number of weeks, which is 150 \u00f7 10.",
    "Calculating 150 \u00f7 10 gives 15."
