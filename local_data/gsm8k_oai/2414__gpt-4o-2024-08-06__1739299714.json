  "query": "If Amanda can run the length of a football field 2000 meters in length in 2 hours, how long would it take her to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine Amanda's running speed in meters per hour.",
    "The football field is 2000 meters long, and Amanda runs it in 2 hours.",
    "Divide the distance by time to find speed: 2000 meters / 2 hours = 1000 meters per hour.",
    "Now calculate how long it would take Amanda to run 10000 meters at this speed.",
    "The distance of the track is 10000 meters.",
    "Divide the track length by Amanda's speed: 10000 meters / 1000 meters per hour.",
    "10000 / 1000 equals 10 hours."

  "solution": "10"
