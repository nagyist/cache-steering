  "query": "An elevator is on the 9th floor. It goes down 7 floors, then up 3  floors, then up 8 floors. If the elevator is on the top floor, how many floors are there in the building?",
  "steps": [
    "The elevator starts on the 9th floor.",
    "It goes down 7 floors. To find the new floor, subtract 7 from 9.",
    "9 - 7 equals 2. The elevator is now on the 2nd floor.",
    "Next, the elevator goes up 3 floors. Add 3 to the current floor, 2.",
    "2 + 3 equals 5. The elevator is now on the 5th floor.",
    "Then, the elevator goes up 8 floors. Add 8 to the current floor, 5.",
    "5 + 8 equals 13. The elevator is now on the 13th floor.",
    "The problem states the elevator is on the top floor after these movements.",
    "Therefore, there are 13 floors in the building."
