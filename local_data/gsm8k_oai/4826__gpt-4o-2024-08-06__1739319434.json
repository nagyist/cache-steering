  "query": "Tyson played basketball on the schoolyard. He scored three points fifteen times, and two points twelve times. He also scored one point some number of times. How many times did he score one point, if in total he scored 75 points?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total points scored from three-point shots.",
    "Tyson scored three points fifteen times.",
    "To find the total points from three-point shots, multiply 3 by 15.",
    "3 * 15 = 45 points from three-point shots.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total points scored from two-point shots.",
    "Tyson scored two points twelve times.",
    "To find the total points from two-point shots, multiply 2 by 12.",
    "2 * 12 = 24 points from two-point shots.",
    "I have the total points from three-point and two-point shots. Now, I need to find the remaining points which come from one-point shots.",
    "First, calculate the combined points from three-point and two-point shots: 45 + 24.",
    "45 + 24 = 69 points from three-point and two-point shots.",
    "Tyson scored a total of 75 points.",
    "To find the points scored from one-point shots, subtract the total points from three-point and two-point shots from the total points scored.",
    "75 - 69 = 6 points from one-point shots.",
    "Each one-point shot scores one point, so the number of one-point shots is equal to the number of points scored from one-point shots."
