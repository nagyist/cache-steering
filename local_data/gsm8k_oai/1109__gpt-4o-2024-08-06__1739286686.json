  "query": "Annie is a mother of 3 children: Mark, Matt, and Mike. She decided to give them some fruits. Mike received 3 oranges. Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Mike received 3 oranges.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many apples Matt received. It says Matt got twice as many apples as Mike received oranges. So, Matt received 2 times 3 apples, which is 6 apples.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many bananas Mark received. It says Mark got as many bananas as the total number of fruits that Mike and Matt received.",
    "Mike received 3 oranges, and Matt received 6 apples. The total number of fruits they received is 3 + 6, which equals 9 fruits.",
    "Therefore, Mark received 9 bananas.",
    "Finally, I will add up all the fruits the three children received: Mike's 3 oranges + Matt's 6 apples + Mark's 9 bananas.",
    "This total equals 3 + 6 + 9, which is 18."

  "solution": "18"
