  "query": "Genevieve picked some cherries from the supermarket shelves that cost $8 per kilogram. When Genevieve reached the checkout counter, she realized she was $400 short of the total price and her friend Clarice chipped in. If Genevieve had $1600 on her, how many kilograms of cherries did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Genevieve had $1600 with her.",
    "She was $400 short of the total price.",
    "This means the total price of the cherries was $1600 + $400 = $2000.",
    "The cherries cost $8 per kilogram.",
    "To find out how many kilograms of cherries she bought, we need to divide the total price by the price per kilogram.",
    "$2000 \u00f7 $8 per kilogram = 250 kilograms."

  "solution": "250"
