  "query": "John earned $18 on Saturday but he only managed to earn half that amount on Sunday. He earned $20 the previous weekend. How much more money does he need to earn to give him the $60 he needs to buy a new pogo stick?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much John earned on Sunday. It was half of what he earned on Saturday.",
    "John earned $18 on Saturday. Half of $18 is $9.",
    "So, John earned $9 on Sunday.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much he earned during this weekend altogether.",
    "He earned $18 on Saturday and $9 on Sunday.",
    "Adding those together gives $18 + $9 = $27 for this weekend.",
    "Next, I need to add last weekend\u2019s earnings to this total.",
    "John earned $20 the previous weekend.",
    "So far, John has earned $27 + $20 = $47.",
    "John needs $60 to buy a new pogo stick.",
    "To find out how much more he needs, I subtract his total earnings from the required amount.",
    "$60 - $47 = $13."

  "solution": "13"
