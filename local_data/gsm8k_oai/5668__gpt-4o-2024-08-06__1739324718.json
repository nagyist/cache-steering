  "steps": [
    "Stacy bought two packs of printer paper.",
    "Each pack contains 240 sheets of paper.",
    "To find the total number of sheets, I multiply the number of packs by the number of sheets per pack.",
    "Total sheets of paper = 2 packs * 240 sheets/pack = 480 sheets.",
    "Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day.",
    "I need to determine how many days the total sheets will last given the printing rate per day.",
    "To find the number of days the paper will last, I divide the total sheets by the number of sheets used per day.",
    "Number of days = 480 sheets / 80 sheets/day = 6 days."
