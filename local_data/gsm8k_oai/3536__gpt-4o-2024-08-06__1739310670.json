  "query": "Katya sold 8 glasses of lemonade and Ricky sold 9 glasses of lemonade. If Tina sold twice as many as Katya and Ricky's combined sales, how many more glasses of lemonade than Katya did Tina sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Katya and Ricky sold in total.",
    "Katya sold 8 glasses, and Ricky sold 9 glasses.",
    "Adding their sales together: 8 glasses + 9 glasses = 17 glasses.",
    "Now I know their combined sales total is 17 glasses.",
    "Next, I calculate how many glasses Tina sold.",
    "Tina sold twice as many as Katya and Ricky's combined sales.",
    "So, Tina sold 2 times 17 glasses = 34 glasses.",
    "Now I need to find out how many more glasses Tina sold compared to Katya.",
    "Katya sold 8 glasses.",
    "We find the difference: 34 glasses (Tina) - 8 glasses (Katya) = 26 glasses.",
    "Tina sold 26 more glasses than Katya."

  "solution": "26"
