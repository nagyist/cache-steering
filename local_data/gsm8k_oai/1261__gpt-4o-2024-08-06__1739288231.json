  "query": "Chastity made 12 angel food cakes to give to friends.  She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car.  But she had forgotten her keys.  So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?",
  "steps": [
    "Chastity made a total of 12 angel food cakes.",
    "She placed all 12 cakes in one stack on the hood of her car.",
    "A black crow came and knocked over half of the stack of cakes.",
    "Half of 12 cakes is 6 cakes, so the crow knocked over 6 cakes.",
    "When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes that were not damaged.",
    "Half of the 6 fallen cakes is 3 cakes, meaning 3 cakes were picked up undamaged.",
    "The remaining 3 cakes were damaged and thus destroyed."
