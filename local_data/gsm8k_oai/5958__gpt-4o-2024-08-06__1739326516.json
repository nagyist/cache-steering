  "query": "Tony lifts weights as a form of exercise.  He can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the exercise known as \"the curl.\"  In an exercise known as \"the military press,\" he can lift over his head twice the weight that he can curl.  His favorite exercise is known as \"the squat\" and he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press.  How much weight, in pounds, can Tony lift in the squat exercise?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much weight Tony can lift in the military press.",
    "He can lift twice the weight he can curl in the military press.",
    "Since Tony can curl 90 pounds, I need to multiply that by 2.",
    "90 pounds (curl) * 2 = 180 pounds in the military press.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much weight he can lift in the squat exercise.",
    "Tony can squat 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press.",
    "So, I need to multiply 180 pounds by 5.",
    "180 pounds * 5 = 900 pounds."

  "solution": "900"
