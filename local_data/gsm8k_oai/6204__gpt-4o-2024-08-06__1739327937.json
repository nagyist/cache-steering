  "query": "The Tigers played 56 home games this year. They had 12 losses and half as many ties. How many games did they win?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many ties they had. It's given that they had half as many ties as losses.",
    "The number of losses is 12.",
    "Half of 12 is calculated as 12 / 2.",
    "12 / 2 equals 6.",
    "So, the Tigers had 6 ties.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total number of games that were either losses or ties.",
    "Total losses and ties would be 12 (losses) + 6 (ties).",
    "12 + 6 equals 18.",
    "The Tigers played 56 home games in total.",
    "To find out how many games they won, I subtract the total number of losses and ties from 56.",
    "56 - 18 equals 38.",
    "Therefore, the Tigers won 38 home games."
