  "query": "In a certain country store, there are three kinds of bottled drinks. A cola, which costs $3, a juice for $1.5, and water for $1 per bottle. One day the store was able to sell 15 bottles of cola, 25 bottles of water, and 12 bottles of juice. How much did the shop earn?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how much the store earned, I need to calculate the revenue from each type of bottled drink.",
    "First, I'll calculate the revenue from the colas.",
    "The store sold 15 bottles of cola, and each one costs $3.",
    "15 bottles of cola * $3 per bottle = $45 from colas.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the revenue from the waters.",
    "The store sold 25 bottles of water, and each one costs $1.",
    "25 bottles of water * $1 per bottle = $25 from waters.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the revenue from the juices.",
    "The store sold 12 bottles of juice, and each one costs $1.5.",
    "12 bottles of juice * $1.5 per bottle = $18 from juices.",
    "I will now add up all the revenues from the three kinds of drinks to find the total earnings.",
    "Total earnings = $45 (colas) + $25 (water) + $18 (juice).",
    "$45 + $25 = $70.",
    "$70 + $18 = $88."

  "solution": "88"
