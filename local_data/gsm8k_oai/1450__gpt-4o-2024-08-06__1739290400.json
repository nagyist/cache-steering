  "query": "Caroline has 40 pairs of socks. She loses 4 pairs of socks at the laundromat. Of the remaining pairs of socks, she donates two-thirds to the thrift store. Then she purchases 10 new pairs of socks, and she receives 3 new pairs of socks as a gift from her dad. How many pairs of socks does Caroline have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Caroline starts with 40 pairs of socks.",
    "She loses 4 pairs of socks at the laundromat.",
    "40 pairs - 4 pairs = 36 pairs left.",
    "Caroline donates two-thirds of the remaining pairs to the thrift store.",
    "To find two-thirds of 36, I calculate (36 pairs * 2/3) = 24 pairs donated.",
    "After donating, she has 36 pairs - 24 pairs = 12 pairs left.",
    "Caroline then purchases 10 new pairs of socks.",
    "12 pairs + 10 pairs = 22 pairs.",
    "She also receives 3 new pairs of socks as a gift from her dad.",
    "22 pairs + 3 pairs = 25 pairs."
