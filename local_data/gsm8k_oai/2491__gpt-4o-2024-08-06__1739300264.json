  "query": "A candy store sold 20 pounds of fudge for $2.50/pound, 5 dozen chocolate truffles for $1.50 each and 3 dozen chocolate-covered pretzels at $2.00 each.  How much money did the candy store make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the revenue from the sale of fudge.",
    "The store sold 20 pounds of fudge at a price of $2.50 per pound.",
    "To find the total from fudge, I multiply 20 pounds by $2.50 per pound.",
    "20 * 2.50 equals $50.00.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the revenue from the sale of chocolate truffles.",
    "The store sold 5 dozen chocolate truffles.",
    "Since a dozen equals 12, 5 dozen is 5 * 12 or 60 truffles.",
    "Each truffle is priced at $1.50.",
    "To find the total from truffles, I multiply 60 truffles by $1.50 each.",
    "60 * 1.50 equals $90.00.",
    "Now, I calculate the revenue from the sale of chocolate-covered pretzels.",
    "The store sold 3 dozen chocolate-covered pretzels.",
    "Again, a dozen equals 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12, which equals 36 pretzels.",
    "Each pretzel is priced at $2.00.",
    "To find the total from pretzels, I multiply 36 pretzels by $2.00 each.",
    "36 * 2.00 equals $72.00.",
    "Now, I add up the revenues from all three products to find the total revenue.",
    "The total revenue equals the sum of $50.00 (fudge) + $90.00 (truffles) + $72.00 (pretzels).",
    "50.00 + 90.00 + 72.00 equals $212.00."
