  "query": "After a visit to the newly opened aquarium, 40 percent of the aquarium visitors fell ill from a mysterious disease. If there were 500 visitors, how many of them did not fall ill?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many visitors fell ill.",
    "The problem states that 40 percent of the visitors fell ill.",
    "I will calculate 40 percent of the total number of visitors, which is 500.",
    "To find 40 percent of 500, I multiply 500 by 0.40.",
    "500 multiplied by 0.40 equals 200.",
    "So, 200 visitors fell ill.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many visitors did not fall ill.",
    "To do this, I subtract the number of visitors who fell ill from the total number of visitors.",
    "I subtract 200 from 500.",
    "500 minus 200 equals 300.",
    "Therefore, 300 visitors did not fall ill."

  "solution": "300"
