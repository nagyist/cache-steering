  "query": "This morning, farmer Rita's workers collected 30,000 gallons of milk and chilled it in a storage tank. They then spent the next 4 hours pumping milk at a rate of 2,880 gallons/hour from the storage tank into a milk tanker. For the next 7 hours, the workers added more milk into the storage tank, at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour. How many gallons of milk were left in the storage tank?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, there are 30,000 gallons of milk in the storage tank.",
    "The workers pump milk out of the storage tank at a rate of 2,880 gallons/hour for 4 hours.",
    "I need to calculate how much milk is pumped out in 4 hours.",
    "Multiply the rate (2,880 gallons/hour) by the number of hours (4): 2,880 * 4 = 11,520 gallons.",
    "11,520 gallons of milk are pumped out of the storage tank.",
    "Subtract the pumped-out milk from the initial amount: 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 gallons.",
    "After pumping, 18,480 gallons are left in the storage tank.",
    "Now, more milk is added to the storage tank for 7 hours at a rate of 1,500 gallons/hour.",
    "I need to calculate how much milk is added in 7 hours.",
    "Multiply the rate (1,500 gallons/hour) by the number of hours (7): 1,500 * 7 = 10,500 gallons.",
    "10,500 gallons of milk are added to the storage tank.",
    "Add the added milk to the remaining amount after pumping: 18,480 + 10,500 = 28,980 gallons."
  ],
  "solution": "28,980"
