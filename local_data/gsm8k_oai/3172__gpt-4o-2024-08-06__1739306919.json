  "query": "Three friends agreed to pay an equal amount of money for buying 5 bags of chips. If they each pay $5, how much does each bag of chips cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money paid by the three friends.",
    "Each friend pays $5, and there are three friends.",
    "So, the total amount of money is 3 friends * $5 = $15.",
    "They spent this $15 on 5 bags of chips.",
    "To find the cost per bag, I need to divide the total amount paid by the total number of bags.",
    "So, I divide $15 by 5 bags.",
    "15 \u00f7 5 equals 3.",
    "Thus, each bag of chips costs $3."

  "solution": "3"
