  "query": "Annie went to a liquidation sale and bought 5 televisions that each cost $50. She also purchased 10 figurines. If Annie spent $260 in total, how much did a single figurine cost in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Annie bought 5 televisions.",
    "Each television cost $50.",
    "The total cost for the televisions is 5 televisions times $50 each.",
    "5 times 50 equals 250.",
    "Annie spent $250 on the televisions.",
    "Annie spent $260 in total.",
    "To find out how much she spent on the figurines, subtract the cost of the televisions from the total amount spent.",
    "260 minus 250 equals 10.",
    "Annie spent $10 on the figurines.",
    "She bought 10 figurines.",
    "The cost of one figurine would be the total spent on figurines divided by the number of figurines.",
    "10 divided by 10 equals 1."
