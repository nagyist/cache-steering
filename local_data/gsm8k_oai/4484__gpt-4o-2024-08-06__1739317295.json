  "query": "Each month, Diego deposits his $5,000 paycheck into a bank account, which he then uses for all of his expenses, which amount to $4,600 per month. How much, in dollars, does Diego save over the course of a year?",
  "steps": [
    "Each month, Diego receives a $5,000 paycheck.",
    "He spends $4,600 each month on expenses.",
    "To find out how much Diego saves each month, we subtract his monthly expenses from his paycheck: $5,000 - $4,600.",
    "Doing the subtraction gives us $400 saved per month.",
    "Diego saves $400 each month.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "To find out how much he saves over a year, we multiply his monthly savings by the number of months: $400 * 12.",
    "Calculating the multiplication gives us $4,800 saved over the course of a year."
