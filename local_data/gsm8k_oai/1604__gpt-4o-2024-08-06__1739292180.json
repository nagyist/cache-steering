  "query": "Mary and Mike are sharing a jar of paint. Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet worth of paint. Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more paint than Mary used on her dragon. They both then work together to paint the biggest sun possible. If there was originally enough paint in the jar to cover 13 square feet, how many square feet of paint can be used to paint the sun?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much paint Mary used.",
    "Mary used 3 square feet of paint to paint her dragon.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much paint Mike used.",
    "Mike used 2 square feet more paint than Mary.",
    "Mike's paint usage is 3 + 2 = 5 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total amount of paint used by both Mary and Mike.",
    "The total paint used is Mary\u2019s usage (3 square feet) plus Mike\u2019s usage (5 square feet).",
    "Total paint used by Mary and Mike is 3 + 5 = 8 square feet.",
    "I need to determine the total amount of paint originally in the jar.",
    "There was originally enough paint to cover 13 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much paint is left after Mary and Mike painted.",
    "Remaining paint is total original paint (13 square feet) minus total paint used (8 square feet).",
    "Remaining paint is 13 - 8 = 5 square feet.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many square feet of paint can be used to paint the sun.",
    "The remaining 5 square feet can be used to paint the sun."
