  "query": "Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many laps Yvonne swims in 5 minutes. According to the problem, Yvonne swims 10 laps in this time.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister swims. The problem states she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.",
    "Half of 10 laps is 5 laps. So Yvonne's younger sister swims 5 laps.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many laps Joel can swim. The problem states Joel can swim three times the number of laps as Yvonne's younger sister.",
    "Three times 5 laps (the number of laps Yvonne's younger sister swims) equals 15 laps."
