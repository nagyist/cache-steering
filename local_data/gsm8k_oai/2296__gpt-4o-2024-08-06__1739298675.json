  "query": "Mancino is tending 3 gardens that each measure 16 feet by 5 feet. His sister, Marquita, is tilling the soil for two gardens that each measure 8 feet by 4 feet. How many square feet combined are in all their gardens?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the area of Mancino's gardens first.",
    "Each of Mancino's gardens measures 16 feet by 5 feet.",
    "The area of one of Mancino's gardens is 16 feet \u00d7 5 feet.",
    "Calculating 16 \u00d7 5 gives me 80 square feet.",
    "Mancino has 3 gardens.",
    "The total area of Mancino's gardens is 3 \u00d7 80 square feet.",
    "Calculating 3 \u00d7 80 gives me 240 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to find the area of Marquita's gardens.",
    "Each of Marquita's gardens measures 8 feet by 4 feet.",
    "The area of one of Marquita's gardens is 8 feet \u00d7 4 feet.",
    "Calculating 8 \u00d7 4 gives me 32 square feet.",
    "Marquita has 2 gardens.",
    "The total area of Marquita's gardens is 2 \u00d7 32 square feet.",
    "Calculating 2 \u00d7 32 gives me 64 square feet.",
    "Now I need to find the combined area of all their gardens.",
    "The combined area is 240 square feet (Mancino) + 64 square feet (Marquita).",
    "Calculating 240 + 64 gives me 304 square feet."
