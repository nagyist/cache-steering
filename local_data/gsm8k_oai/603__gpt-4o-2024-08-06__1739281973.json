  "query": "Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 100 empty cans for their Science project. As of today, Alyssa collected 30 while Abigail collected 43 empty cans. How many more empty cans should they collect?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many empty cans Alyssa and Abigail have collected in total.",
    "Alyssa collected 30 cans.",
    "Abigail collected 43 cans.",
    "I will add the number of cans Alyssa collected to the number of cans Abigail collected: 30 + 43.",
    "30 + 43 equals 73, so together they have 73 empty cans.",
    "They need a total of 100 empty cans for their project.",
    "To find out how many more cans they need, I will subtract the number of cans they already collected from the total number required: 100 - 73.",
    "100 - 73 equals 27."
  ],
  "solution": "27"
