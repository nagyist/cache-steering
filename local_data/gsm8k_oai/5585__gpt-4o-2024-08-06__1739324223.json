    "Calculate the number of times animals are seen in February: 26 * 3 = 78 times.",
    "In March, families see animals half as many times as in February.",
    "Calculate the number of times animals are seen in March: 78 / 2 = 39 times.",
    "Add the number of times animals were seen in January, February, and March to get the total: 26 + 78 + 39.",
    "Calculate the total: 26 + 78 + 39 = 143."
