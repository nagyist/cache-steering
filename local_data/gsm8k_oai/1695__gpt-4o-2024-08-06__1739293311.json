  "query": "During her first year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 90% of the games she played.  In her second year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year.  If Tara played 20 games each year, how many games did Tara's dad attend in her second year playing soccer?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many games Tara's dad attended in her first year.",
    "Tara's dad attended 90% of the games in the first year.",
    "Tara played 20 games in her first year.",
    "To find 90% of 20 games, I calculate 0.9 * 20.",
    "0.9 * 20 = 18.",
    "Tara's dad attended 18 games in her first year.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many games Tara's dad attended in the second year.",
    "In the second year, Tara's dad attended 4 fewer games than in the first year.",
    "He attended 18 games in the first year.",
    "To find the number of games attended in the second year, I subtract 4 from 18.",
    "18 - 4 = 14.",
    "Tara's dad attended 14 games in her second year."

  "solution": "14"
