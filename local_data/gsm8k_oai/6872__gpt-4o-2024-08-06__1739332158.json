  "query": "To improve her health, Mary decides to drink 1.5 liters of water a day as recommended by her doctor. Mary's glasses hold 250 mL of water. How many glasses of water should Mary drink per day to reach her goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert Mary's daily water goal from liters to milliliters because Mary's glasses are measured in milliliters.",
    "There are 1000 milliliters in a liter. So, 1.5 liters is equivalent to 1.5 x 1000 milliliters.",
    "Calculating that, 1.5 x 1000 equals 1500 milliliters.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many glasses of water, each holding 250 milliliters, Mary needs to drink to reach 1500 milliliters.",
    "To find the number of glasses, I divide the total amount of water in milliliters by the volume of one glass. That is, 1500 milliliters divided by 250 milliliters per glass.",
    "Calculating the division, 1500 divided by 250 equals 6.",
    "Thus, Mary needs to drink 6 glasses of water per day to meet her goal."
