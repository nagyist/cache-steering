  "query": "Greta, George and Gloria entered their turtles in the Key West Turtle Race.  Greta\u2019s turtle finished the race in 6 minutes.  George\u2019s turtle finished 2 minutes quicker than Greta\u2019s.  Gloria\u2019s turtle took twice as long as George\u2019s turtle.  How long did it take Gloria\u2019s turtle to finish the race?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting Greta's turtle's time, which is 6 minutes.",
    "George's turtle finished 2 minutes quicker than Greta's, so I subtract 2 from 6.",
    "6 - 2 = 4, so George's turtle finished the race in 4 minutes.",
    "Gloria's turtle took twice as long as George's turtle. I need to calculate twice 4 minutes.",
    "4 * 2 = 8, so Gloria's turtle took 8 minutes to finish the race."
