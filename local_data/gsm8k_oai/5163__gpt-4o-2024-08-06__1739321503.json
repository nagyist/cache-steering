  "query": "Rollo has 3 guinea pigs, the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food, the second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, and the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one. How many cups of food does Rollo need to feed all his Guinea pigs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much food the first guinea pig eats. It eats 2 cups.",
    "Next, calculate how much food the second guinea pig eats. It eats twice as much as the first guinea pig.",
    "Twice 2 cups is 2 * 2 = 4 cups. So, the second guinea pig eats 4 cups.",
    "Now, determine how much food the third guinea pig eats. It eats 3 cups more than the second guinea pig.",
    "The second guinea pig eats 4 cups, so the third guinea pig eats 4 + 3 = 7 cups.",
    "Add up the total food needed for all three guinea pigs: 2 cups (first guinea pig) + 4 cups (second guinea pig) + 7 cups (third guinea pig).",
    "The total is 2 + 4 + 7 = 13 cups."

  "solution": "13"
