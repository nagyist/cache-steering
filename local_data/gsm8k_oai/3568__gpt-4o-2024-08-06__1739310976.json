  "query": "Marcel bought a pen for $4, and a briefcase for five times the price. How much did Marcel pay for both items?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the cost of the pen which is $4.",
    "Next, calculate the cost of the briefcase. Since the briefcase costs five times the price of the pen, multiply $4 by 5.",
    "$4 multiplied by 5 equals $20.",
    "Now, add the cost of the pen and the cost of the briefcase to find the total amount Marcel paid for both items.",
    "The cost of the pen is $4 and the cost of the briefcase is $20. Add $4 and $20 together.",
    "$4 plus $20 equals $24."
