  "query": "A school cafeteria uses ground mince to cook lasagnas and cottage pies. They make 100 lasagnas, which use 2 pounds of ground mince each, and cottage pies, which use 3 pounds of ground mince each. If the cafeteria has used 500 pounds of ground mince in total, how many cottage pies did they make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that each lasagna uses 2 pounds of ground mince.",
    "The school makes 100 lasagnas.",
    "To find out how much ground mince is used for the lasagnas, I multiply the number of lasagnas by the amount of mince each one uses: 100 lasagnas * 2 pounds per lasagna = 200 pounds of ground mince.",
    "I know the total amount of ground mince used is 500 pounds.",
    "Now, I subtract the amount used for lasagnas from the total amount: 500 pounds - 200 pounds = 300 pounds of ground mince.",
    "This 300 pounds of ground mince is used for the cottage pies.",
    "Each cottage pie uses 3 pounds of ground mince.",
    "To find out how many cottage pies were made, I divide the total amount of mince used for the cottage pies by the amount each one uses: 300 pounds \u00f7 3 pounds per pie = 100 cottage pies."
