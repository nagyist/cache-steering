  "query": "Jim is wondering how many miles each gallon of gas gets him. His gas tank is 12 gallons. He has 2/3 of a tank left after he drives to and from work, which is 10 miles away from his house. How many miles per gallon does he get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much gas Jim used for the trip to and from work.",
    "Jim's gas tank is 12 gallons, and he has 2/3 of a tank left. So, he used 1/3 of the tank for the trip.",
    "To find out how many gallons are in 1/3 of the tank, I multiply 1/3 by 12 gallons.",
    "1/3 of 12 gallons is calculated as (1/3) * 12 = 4 gallons.",
    "Jim used 4 gallons of gas for his round trip commute.",
    "Next, I calculate the total distance Jim traveled. He travels 10 miles to work and 10 miles back, so it's a 20 mile trip in total.",
    "Jim drove 20 miles with 4 gallons of gas.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the miles per gallon by dividing the total miles driven by the number of gallons used.",
    "So, 20 miles / 4 gallons = 5 miles per gallon."
