  "steps": [
    "I am asked to find the percentage of mornings Jake does not drop his coffee.",
    "First, I need to determine how often Jake drops his coffee.",
    "I know that Jake trips over his dog 40% of mornings.",
    "When he trips, 25% of the time, he drops his coffee.",
    "I will calculate the percentage of mornings Jake drops his coffee by multiplying the probability of tripping by the probability of dropping the coffee when he trips.",
    "0.40 (probability of tripping) * 0.25 (probability of dropping coffee when tripping) = 0.10",
    "This means Jake drops his coffee on 10% of mornings.",
    "Now, I need to find the percentage of mornings Jake does not drop his coffee.",
    "If Jake drops his coffee on 10% of mornings, he does not drop it on 100% - 10% of mornings.",
    "100% - 10% = 90%"

  "solution": "90"
