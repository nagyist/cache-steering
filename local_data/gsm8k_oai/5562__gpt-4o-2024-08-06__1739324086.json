  "query": "Marcel goes to the store with Dale to buy groceries for cooking dinner. Marcel buys 10 ears of corn, and Dale buys half that amount. Dale buys 8 potatoes and Marcel buys some, too. If they check out together and end up buying 27 vegetables, how many potatoes did Marcel buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcel buys 10 ears of corn.",
    "Dale buys half the amount of corn Marcel buys.",
    "Half of 10 ears of corn is 5 ears.",
    "Dale buys 5 ears of corn.",
    "Total corn purchased by Marcel and Dale is 10 + 5 = 15 ears of corn.",
    "Together, Marcel and Dale buy a total of 27 vegetables.",
    "The remaining vegetables are potatoes, since they only buy corn and potatoes.",
    "Total vegetables are 27, and they bought 15 ears of corn.",
    "Remaining vegetables, which are potatoes, are 27 - 15 = 12 potatoes.",
    "Dale buys 8 potatoes.",
    "So, the number of potatoes Marcel buys is the total potatoes minus the potatoes Dale buys.",
    "Marcel buys 12 - 8 = 4 potatoes."
