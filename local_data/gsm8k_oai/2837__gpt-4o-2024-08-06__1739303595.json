  "query": "Ali is a baker. Leila ordered 3 chocolate cakes for $12 each and 6 strawberry cakes for $22 each.  How much should Leila pay Ali?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total cost of the chocolate cakes first.",
    "Leila ordered 3 chocolate cakes.",
    "Each chocolate cake costs $12.",
    "To find the total cost for chocolate cakes, I multiply the number of chocolate cakes by the cost of each chocolate cake: 3 * $12.",
    "3 * $12 equals $36.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the strawberry cakes.",
    "Leila ordered 6 strawberry cakes.",
    "Each strawberry cake costs $22.",
    "To find the total cost for strawberry cakes, I multiply the number of strawberry cakes by the cost of each strawberry cake: 6 * $22.",
    "6 * $22 equals $132.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount Leila should pay Ali by adding the total cost of chocolate cakes and the total cost of strawberry cakes together.",
    "The total cost of chocolate cakes is $36.",
    "The total cost of strawberry cakes is $132.",
    "I add the two totals: $36 + $132.",
