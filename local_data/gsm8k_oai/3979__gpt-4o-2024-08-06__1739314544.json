  "steps": [
    "Mr. Alvarez spends $36 on diesel fuel each week.",
    "The cost of diesel fuel is $3 per gallon.",
    "To find out how many gallons he uses in one week, I need to divide the total money he spends per week by the cost per gallon.",
    "$36 divided by $3 per gallon gives 12 gallons per week.",
    "Mr. Alvarez uses 12 gallons of diesel fuel each week.",
    "The question asks how many gallons he uses in two weeks.",
    "To find the total gallons used in two weeks, I need to multiply the gallons used in one week by 2.",
    "12 gallons per week times 2 weeks equals 24 gallons."
