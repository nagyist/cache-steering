    "The cookfire starts with six logs.",
    "It burns three logs every hour.",
    "At the end of the first hour, three logs are burned, leaving 6 - 3 = 3 logs.",
    "Two logs are added at the end of the first hour, resulting in 3 + 2 = 5 logs.",

    "Two more logs are added at the end of the second hour, resulting in 2 + 2 = 4 logs.",
