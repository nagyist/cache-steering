  "query": "Kevin is taking a 600-mile trip, traveling at a rate of 50 miles per hour. How much faster must he travel to decrease his travel time by 4 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the original time it takes for Kevin to complete the 600-mile trip traveling at 50 miles per hour.",
    "Time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. So, the original time is 600 miles / 50 miles per hour.",
    "Doing the division, 600 / 50 equals 12. So, the original time is 12 hours.",
    "Next, I need to find the new travel time if Kevin decreases the original time by 4 hours.",
    "The new travel time is 12 hours - 4 hours.",
    "Calculating this, 12 - 4 equals 8. So, the new travel time is 8 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find the speed at which Kevin must travel to complete the trip in 8 hours.",
    "The new speed can be calculated by dividing the distance (600 miles) by the new time (8 hours).",
    "Performing the division, 600 miles / 8 hours equals 75 miles per hour. So, the new speed is 75 miles per hour.",
    "Finally, I find the difference between the new speed and the original speed to determine how much faster Kevin needs to travel.",
    "The difference is 75 miles per hour - 50 miles per hour.",
    "Calculating this, 75 - 50 equals 25. So, Kevin must travel 25 miles per hour faster."

  "solution": "25"
