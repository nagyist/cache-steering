  "query": "Carla adds a can of chilis, two cans of beans, and 50% more tomatoes than beans to a normal batch of chili. If she makes a quadruple batch, how many cans of food does she need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the ingredients Carla puts in a normal batch of chili.",
    "She uses 1 can of chilis and 2 cans of beans in a normal batch.",
    "For the tomatoes, she uses 50% more tomatoes than beans.",
    "Since she uses 2 cans of beans, 50% more is half of 2, which is 1.",
    "So, she uses 2 + 1 = 3 cans of tomatoes.",
    "In a normal batch, she uses 1 can of chilis + 2 cans of beans + 3 cans of tomatoes.",
    "This totals to 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cans for one normal batch.",
    "Now, she makes a quadruple batch.",
    "For a quadruple batch, I need to multiply the number of cans used in a normal batch by 4.",
    "6 cans \u00d7 4 = 24 cans."

  "solution": "24"
