  "query": "Miss Aisha's legs are 1/3 of her total height. If her head is also 1/4 of her total height, and she is 60 inches tall, calculate the length of the rest of her body.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Miss Aisha's total height is given as 60 inches.",
    "I need to determine the length of her legs. Her legs are 1/3 of her total height.",
    "To find the length of her legs, I will calculate 1/3 of 60 inches.",
    "Performing the calculation: (1/3) * 60 = 20 inches.",
    "So, her legs are 20 inches long.",
    "Next, I need to determine the length of her head. Her head is 1/4 of her total height.",
    "To find the length of her head, I will calculate 1/4 of 60 inches.",
    "Performing the calculation: (1/4) * 60 = 15 inches.",
    "So, her head is 15 inches long.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the length of the rest of her body.",
    "The rest of her body would be her total height minus the lengths of her legs and head.",
    "So, the rest of her body = Total height - (Length of legs + Length of head).",
    "Substituting the values: 60 inches - (20 inches + 15 inches).",
    "First, add the lengths of the legs and head: 20 inches + 15 inches = 35 inches.",
    "Then subtract from the total height: 60 inches - 35 inches = 25 inches.",
    "Therefore, the length of the rest of her body is 25 inches."
