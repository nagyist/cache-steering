  "query": "Police officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours. His colleague, officer B, patrols 55 streets in 5 hours. How many streets will both officers patrol in one hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of streets officer A patrols in one hour.",
    "Officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours.",
    "To find the number of streets officer A patrols in one hour, I divide 36 streets by 4 hours.",
    "36 streets \u00f7 4 hours = 9 streets per hour.",
    "Now, I will calculate the number of streets officer B patrols in one hour.",
    "Officer B patrols 55 streets in 5 hours.",
    "To find the number of streets officer B patrols in one hour, I divide 55 streets by 5 hours.",
    "55 streets \u00f7 5 hours = 11 streets per hour.",
    "With both officers, I need to sum up the number of streets they patrol together in one hour.",
    "Officer A patrols 9 streets per hour, and officer B patrols 11 streets per hour.",
    "9 streets per hour + 11 streets per hour = 20 streets per hour."
