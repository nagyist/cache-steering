  "query": "Paul lives in a 5th story apartment.  He makes 3 trips out from and back to his apartment throughout the day each day of a week.  How many feet does he travel vertically in total over the week if each story is 10 feet tall?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many trips Paul makes in one day. He makes 3 trips out from his apartment and returns each time, so he completes 3 round trips in a day.",
    "A single round trip means he goes down and then back up. Since he lives on the 5th story, he travels 5 stories down and 5 stories up per round trip.",
    "Thus, for one round trip, he travels 5 stories down + 5 stories up = 10 stories per round trip.",
    "He makes 3 round trips each day. Therefore, in one day, he travels 10 stories/round trip * 3 round trips = 30 stories.",
    "Next, I need to convert the number of stories into feet. Each story is 10 feet tall.",
    "In one day, Paul travels 30 stories * 10 feet/story = 300 feet.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week. A week has 7 days.",
    "In a week, the total vertical distance he travels is 300 feet/day * 7 days = 2100 feet."
  ],
  "solution": "2100"
