  "query": "Last week, Charles bought a t-shirt for $30, a backpack for $10, and a blue cap for $5. The store gave him a discount and, in total, he only spent $43. How much of a discount did they give him, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the original total cost of the items before the discount was applied.",
    "The cost of the t-shirt is $30.",
    "The cost of the backpack is $10.",
    "The cost of the blue cap is $5.",
    "Now, I add these amounts together: $30 + $10 + $5.",
    "The original total cost of the items is $45.",
    "Charles spent $43 in total after the discount.",
    "To find the discount amount, I subtract the amount he spent ($43) from the original cost ($45).",
    "$45 - $43 equals $2."

  "solution": "2"
