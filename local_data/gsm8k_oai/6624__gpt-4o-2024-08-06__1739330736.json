  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how much money Darwin has.",
    "Darwin has $45.",
    "I need to find out how much twice the amount of money Darwin has is.",
    "Twice $45 is calculated by multiplying $45 by 2.",
    "$45 * 2 = $90.",
    "Now, I need to add $20 to the result because Mia has $20 more than twice the amount Darwin has.",
    "$90 + $20 = $110."
