  "query": "Iain has 200 pennies. He realizes that 30 of his pennies are older than he is. If he wishes to get rid of these pennies and then throw out 20% of his remaining pennies, how many will he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Iain starts with 200 pennies in total.",
    "He identifies that 30 of these pennies are older than he is.",
    "Iain plans to get rid of the 30 pennies that are older than he is.",
    "Subtracting these 30 pennies from the total gives 200 - 30 = 170 pennies remaining.",
    "Next, he wants to throw out 20% of his remaining 170 pennies.",
    "First, I will calculate 20% of 170.",
    "20% of 170 is calculated by multiplying 170 by 0.20.",
    "170 x 0.20 = 34.",
    "So, Iain will throw out 34 pennies from the remaining 170.",
    "I will subtract 34 from 170 to find out how many pennies are left.",
    "170 - 34 = 136."
