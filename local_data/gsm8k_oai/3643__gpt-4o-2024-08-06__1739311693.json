    "I want to find out how many chairs there are in total at the bakery.",
    "I know that there are 8 indoor tables and 12 outdoor tables.",
    "Each table, whether indoor or outdoor, has 3 chairs.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of chairs for the indoor tables first.",
    "There are 8 indoor tables, and each has 3 chairs, so I multiply 8 by 3.",
    "8 times 3 equals 24, so there are 24 chairs for the indoor tables.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of chairs for the outdoor tables.",
    "There are 12 outdoor tables, each with 3 chairs, so I multiply 12 by 3.",
    "12 times 3 equals 36, so there are 36 chairs for the outdoor tables.",
    "Now, I add the number of chairs from the indoor tables and the outdoor tables.",
    "24 chairs from indoor tables plus 36 chairs from outdoor tables equals 60."
