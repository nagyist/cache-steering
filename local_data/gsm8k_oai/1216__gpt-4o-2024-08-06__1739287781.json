    "First, I need to determine the total number of desserts available.",
    "There are 14 mini-cupcakes.",
    "There are 12 donut holes.",
    "The total number of desserts is 14 mini-cupcakes + 12 donut holes = 26 desserts.",
    "The number of students in the class is 13.",
    "I need to divide the total number of desserts by the number of students to find out how many desserts each student gets.",
    "Perform the division: 26 desserts \u00f7 13 students = 2 desserts per student."
