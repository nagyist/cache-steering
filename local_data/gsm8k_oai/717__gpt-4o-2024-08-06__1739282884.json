  "query": "Jake splits 8 shots of vodka with his friend.  Each shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces.  If the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, how much pure alcohol did Jake drink?",
  "steps": [
    "Jake and his friend split 8 shots of vodka.",
    "Each shot is 1.5 ounces.",
    "First, calculate the total ounces of vodka they have together: 8 shots * 1.5 ounces per shot.",
    "8 shots * 1.5 ounces/shot = 12 ounces of vodka in total.",
    "Since Jake splits the vodka evenly with his friend, he drinks half of the total ounces of vodka.",
    "Half of 12 ounces is 12 ounces / 2 = 6 ounces.",
    "The vodka is 50% pure alcohol.",
    "Calculate the ounces of pure alcohol Jake consumes: 6 ounces of vodka * 0.50 (50%).",
    "6 ounces * 0.50 = 3 ounces of pure alcohol."
