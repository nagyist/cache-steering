  "query": "Charles is wondering how much chocolate milk he can make with all the supplies he finds in the fridge. He is going to keep drinking 8-ounce glasses until he uses up all the ingredients. Each glass must contain 6.5 ounces of milk and 1.5 ounces of chocolate syrup. If he has 130 ounces of milk and 60 ounces of chocolate syrup, how many total ounces ounce of chocolate milk will he drink?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many 8-ounce glasses of chocolate milk Charles can make with his supplies.",
    "Each glass requires 6.5 ounces of milk, so I will divide the total milk by the amount needed per glass to find the limiting number of glasses.",
    "130 ounces of milk divided by 6.5 ounces per glass equals 20 glasses.",
    "Now, I will do the same for chocolate syrup. Each glass requires 1.5 ounces of chocolate syrup.",
    "60 ounces of chocolate syrup divided by 1.5 ounces per glass equals 40 glasses.",
    "The maximum number of complete glasses he can make is limited by the ingredient for which he can make the least number of glasses.",
    "Since 20 glasses can be made with the available milk and 40 with the chocolate syrup, milk is the limiting factor.",
    "Charles can therefore make 20 glasses of chocolate milk.",
    "Each glass is 8 ounces, so I multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass to find the total amount of chocolate milk.",
    "20 glasses times 8 ounces per glass equals 160 ounces of chocolate milk."
