  "query": "Emmy has a collection of 14 iPods. She loses 6 out of the 14 she had but she still has twice as many as Rosa. How many iPods does Emmy and Rosa have together?",
  "steps": [
    "Emmy originally has 14 iPods.",
    "She loses 6 iPods.",
    "Now, Emmy has 14 - 6 iPods.",
    "This equals 8 iPods.",
    "Emmy now has twice as many iPods as Rosa.",
    "Let \\( x \\) be the number of iPods that Rosa has.",
    "According to the problem, 8 is twice the number of iPods that Rosa has.",
    "So, we set up the equation: 8 = 2 * \\( x \\).",
    "Solving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2.",
    "\\( x = \\frac{8}{2} \\).",
    "This simplifies to \\( x = 4 \\).",
    "Rosa has 4 iPods.",
    "Now, we add the number of iPods Emmy and Rosa have together.",
    "Emmy has 8 iPods and Rosa has 4 iPods.",
    "Adding these together, 8 + 4 equals 12."
