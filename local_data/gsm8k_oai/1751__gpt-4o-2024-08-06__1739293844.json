  "query": "The sewers in Middleton can handle 240,000 gallons of run-off. Each hour of rain produces 1000 gallons of runoff. How many days of rain can the sewers handle before they overflow?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that the problem involves calculating how many days worth of rain the sewers can handle.",
    "The sewers can handle a total of 240,000 gallons of runoff.",
    "Each hour of rain produces 1,000 gallons of runoff.",
    "To find the total hours of rain the sewers can manage, I need to divide the total capacity of the sewers by the runoff produced per hour.",
    "240,000 gallons divided by 1,000 gallons per hour equals 240 hours of rain.",
    "There are 24 hours in a day.",
    "To find the number of days, I divide the total hours of rain by the number of hours in a day.",
    "240 hours divided by 24 hours per day equals 10 days."
