  "query": "Peter and his dad Rupert shared the same birthday.  To make it special, they each got their own birthday cake.  Peter has 10 candles on his cake.  Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter.  How many candles will be on Rupert's cake?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter has 10 candles on his cake, which indicates he is 10 years old.",
    "Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter.",
    "To find Rupert's age, I need to calculate 3 and 1/2 times 10.",
    "3 and 1/2 can be expressed as the fraction 7/2.",
    "Now I'll multiply Peter's age (10) by 7/2.",
    "10 multiplied by 7/2 is equal to (10 * 7) / 2.",
    "10 * 7 = 70.",
    "Now I'll divide 70 by 2.",
    "70 divided by 2 equals 35.",
    "Rupert is 35 years old.",
    "Therefore, Rupert will have 35 candles on his cake."
