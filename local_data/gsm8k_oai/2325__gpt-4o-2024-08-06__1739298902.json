  "query": "George was selling some of his old toys on the internet. He managed to sell 3 little cars and a set of Legos. In total, he earned $45. How much did the Legos set cost, if one little car was sold for $5?",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by identifying what I know from the problem.",
    "George sold 3 little cars and a set of Legos for a total of $45.",
    "Each little car was sold for $5.",
    "I need to calculate the total amount earned from selling the 3 little cars.",
    "The total from the cars is 3 little cars \u00d7 $5 per car.",
    "Calculating that gives 3 \u00d7 5 = $15.",
    "So, George earned $15 from selling the little cars.",
    "I need to find out how much he earned from selling the Legos.",
    "The total amount George earned is $45.",
    "The amount earned from the Legos is the total earned minus the amount earned from the cars.",
    "So, $45 (total) - $15 (cars) = $30.",
    "Therefore, the Legos set cost $30."

  "solution": "30"
