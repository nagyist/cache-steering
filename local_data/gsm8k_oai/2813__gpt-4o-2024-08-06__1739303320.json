  "query": "Leila went to the supermarket to get some groceries. Then she headed to her mechanic to get her automobile fixed. If fixing her automobile cost $350 which was $50 more than thrice the amount she spent at the supermarket, how much has she spent altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the equation based on the information provided.",
    "We know that the cost to fix the automobile was $350.",
    "This cost was $50 more than three times the amount Leila spent at the supermarket.",
    "Let x represent the amount Leila spent at the supermarket.",
    "According to the problem, 350 = 3x + 50.",
    "To find x, subtract 50 from both sides: 350 - 50 = 3x.",
    "This simplifies down to 300 = 3x.",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 300 / 3.",
    "x = 100, which is the amount Leila spent at the supermarket.",
    "Now, to determine the total amount spent, add the supermarket expenses and the automobile repair costs together.",
    "The total amount spent is 100 + 350.",
    "Calculate the total: 100 + 350 = 450."
