  "query": "Rachel and Sara want to attend a beauty and modeling contest. They both want to buy new pairs of shoes and dresses. Sara buys a pair of shoes which costs $50 and a dress which costs $200. How much should Rachel budget if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total amount Sara spent on her pair of shoes and dress.",
    "Sara's pair of shoes cost $50.",
    "Sara's dress cost $200.",
    "To find the total cost for Sara, I add the cost of the shoes and the dress: $50 + $200.",
    "$50 + $200 equals $250.",
    "Now, I know Sara spent a total of $250.",
    "Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent.",
    "To find out how much Rachel should budget, I need to calculate twice the amount Sara spent: 2 * $250.",
    "2 * $250 equals $500."
