  "query": "Daria is raising money for a new vacuum cleaner. So far, she has collected $20 in her piggy bank and has decided to put $10 in it each week. If the vacuum cleaner costs $120, how many weeks will it take her to raise enough money to cover this expense?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Daria needs to raise. The vacuum cleaner costs $120, and she already has $20.",
    "To find out how much she still needs, I'll subtract the $20 she already has from the $120 total cost.",
    "$120 - $20 equals $100. So, Daria needs to raise an additional $100.",
    "Daria plans to put $10 in her piggy bank each week.",
    "To find out how many weeks it will take to raise $100, I'll divide the $100 by the $10 she adds each week.",
    "$100 divided by $10 equals 10 weeks."

  "solution": "10"
