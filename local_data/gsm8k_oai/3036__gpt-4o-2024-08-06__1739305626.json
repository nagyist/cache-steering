  "query": "A yearly book sale is held in school where students can sell their old books at a cheaper price. Two-fifths of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50.",
    "Two-fifths of the total number of books (which is 10) will be sold at $2.50 each.",
    "Calculate two-fifths of 10 by multiplying 2/5 by 10.",
    "\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\) books will be sold for $2.50 each.",
    "Now, calculate how many of the books are left to be sold for $2 each.",
    "Since Lovely has 10 books in total, and 4 books are to be sold for $2.50 each, the remaining books will be sold for $2 each.",
    "Total number of books to be sold for $2 each is \\( 10 - 4 = 6 \\).",
    "Calculate the amount earned from books sold at $2.50 each.",
    "The earnings from 4 books sold at $2.50 each is \\( 4 \\times 2.50 = 10 \\) dollars.",
    "Calculate the amount earned from books sold at $2 each.",
    "The earnings from 6 books sold at $2 each is \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) dollars.",
    "Add the earnings from both categories to find the total amount earned.",
    "Total amount earned is \\( 10 + 12 = 22 \\) dollars."
