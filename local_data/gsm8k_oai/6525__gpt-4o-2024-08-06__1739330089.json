  "query": "Jared likes to draw monsters. He drew a monster family portrait. The mom had 1 eye and the dad had 3. They had 3 kids, each with 4 eyes. How many eyes did the whole family have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eyes each member of the monster family has, starting with the parents.",
    "The mom has 1 eye.",
    "The dad has 3 eyes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of eyes for the kids. There are 3 kids, each with 4 eyes.",
    "Each of the 3 kids has 4 eyes, so I multiply 3 by 4 to find the total number of eyes for the kids.",
    "3 kids * 4 eyes per kid = 12 eyes in total for the kids.",
    "Now, I add up the eyes of all family members to get the total number of eyes in the family.",
    "The mom has 1 eye, the dad has 3 eyes, and the kids together have 12 eyes.",
    "1 (mom) + 3 (dad) + 12 (kids) = 16 eyes in total for the whole family."
