  "query": "Billy and George are picking dandelions. At first, Billy picks 36 and then George picks 1/3 as many as Billy. When they see the pile, they each decide to pick 10 more each. How many have they picked on average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many dandelions George picks initially.",
    "George picks 1/3 as many as Billy initially, and Billy picks 36 dandelions.",
    "1/3 of 36 is calculated by dividing 36 by 3.",
    "36 divided by 3 is 12.",
    "Therefore, George picks 12 dandelions initially.",
    "Next, they each decide to pick 10 more dandelions.",
    "Billy, who initially picked 36, now picks an additional 10.",
    "36 + 10 equals 46.",
    "George, who initially picked 12, now also picks an additional 10.",
    "12 + 10 equals 22.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of dandelions picked by both Billy and George.",
    "Billy picked 46 and George picked 22.",
    "I add the total dandelions picked by Billy and George.",
    "46 + 22 equals 68.",
    "Finally, to find the average number of dandelions picked, I divide the total by the number of people, which is 2.",
    "68 divided by 2 equals 34."
