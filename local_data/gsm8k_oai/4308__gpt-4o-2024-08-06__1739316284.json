  "query": "John goes to the bakery to buy rolls.  They sell them for 5 dollars for a dozen.  He spent 15 dollars.  How many rolls did he get?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many dozens of rolls John bought for 15 dollars when one dozen costs 5 dollars.",
    "First, I should calculate how many dozens John could buy with 15 dollars.",
    "If each dozen costs 5 dollars, then dividing the total amount spent (15 dollars) by the cost per dozen (5 dollars) will give the number of dozens bought.",
    "15 dollars divided by 5 dollars per dozen equals 3 dozens.",
    "Now, I know that John bought 3 dozens of rolls.",
    "Next, I need to convert the number of dozens into the number of individual rolls.",
    "One dozen is equal to 12 rolls.",
    "To find the total number of rolls, multiply the number of dozens (3) by the number of rolls per dozen (12).",
    "3 dozens multiplied by 12 rolls per dozen equals 36 rolls."

  "solution": "36"
