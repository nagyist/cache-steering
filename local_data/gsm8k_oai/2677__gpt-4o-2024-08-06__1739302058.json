  "query": "Ten adults went to a ball game with eleven children. Adult tickets are $8 each and the total bill was $124. How many dollars is one child's ticket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to find out how much was spent on adult tickets.",
    "There are 10 adults and each adult ticket costs $8.",
    "I calculate the total cost for adult tickets by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost per ticket: \\(10 \\times 8 = 80\\).",
    "So, $80 was spent on adult tickets.",
    "The total bill for all tickets was $124.",
    "I need to find how much was spent on child tickets by subtracting the amount spent on adult tickets from the total bill: \\(124 - 80 = 44\\).",
    "Therefore, $44 was spent on children's tickets.",
    "There are 11 children, and I need to find the cost of one child's ticket.",
    "I divide the total amount spent on children's tickets by the number of child tickets: \\( \\frac{44}{11} = 4 \\)."
