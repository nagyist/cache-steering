  "query": "Mark goes into the store to buy some groceries.  He buys 6 2$ cans of soup, 2 $5 loaves of bread, 2 3$ boxes of cereal, and 2 $4 gallons of milk.  When he gets to the register, he opens his wallet to pay and realizes he only has $10 bills in there.  How many $10 bills does he need to use to pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total cost of the cans of soup. Each can costs $2, and Mark buys 6 cans.",
    "6 cans \u00d7 $2 per can = $12 for the soup.",
    "Next, calculate the total cost of the loaves of bread. Each loaf costs $5, and Mark buys 2 loaves.",
    "2 loaves \u00d7 $5 per loaf = $10 for the bread.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost of the boxes of cereal. Each box costs $3, and Mark buys 2 boxes.",
    "2 boxes \u00d7 $3 per box = $6 for the cereal.",
    "Then, calculate the total cost of the gallons of milk. Each gallon costs $4, and Mark buys 2 gallons.",
    "2 gallons \u00d7 $4 per gallon = $8 for the milk.",
    "Add up all the costs to find the total amount Mark needs to pay.",
    "$12 (soup) + $10 (bread) + $6 (cereal) + $8 (milk) = $36.",
    "Mark can only pay in $10 bills. Determine how many $10 bills are needed to cover the $36 total.",
    "$36 divided by $10 per bill equals 3.6. Since Mark can't use a fraction of a bill, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number.",
    "Rounding up 3.6 gives 4. Therefore, Mark needs to use 4 $10 bills."

  "solution": "4"
