  "query": "Axel bought an aquarium that was marked down 50% from an original price of $120. But he also paid additional sales tax equal to 5% of the reduced price. What was the total cost of the aquarium?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the reduced price of the aquarium after the 50% markdown.",
    "The original price of the aquarium is $120.",
    "The markdown is 50% of $120.",
    "50% of $120 is calculated as \\(0.50 \\times 120 = 60\\).",
    "The reduced price of the aquarium is $120 - $60.",
    "$120 - $60 equals $60.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the sales tax, which is 5% of the reduced price.",
    "5% of the reduced price ($60) is calculated as \\(0.05 \\times 60 = 3\\).",
    "The sales tax amount is $3.",
    "To find the total cost of the aquarium, I add the reduced price and the sales tax.",
    "Total cost equals $60 (reduced price) + $3 (sales tax).",
    "$60 + $3 equals $63."

  "solution": "63"
