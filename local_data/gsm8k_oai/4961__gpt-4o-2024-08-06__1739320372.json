  "query": "On national lipstick day, half of the students who attended class wore colored lipstick.  Of those students who wore lipstick, one quarter wore red lipstick.  There were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as were wearing red lipstick.  If 200 students attended school that day, how many wore blue lipstick?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students attended school that day. The question tells me 200 students attended.",
    "Next, I need to find how many students wore colored lipstick. Half of the students wore colored lipstick. So, I take half of 200.",
    "Half of 200 is 100. Therefore, 100 students wore colored lipstick.",
    "Out of those 100 students, one quarter wore red lipstick. I need to calculate one quarter of 100.",
    "One quarter of 100 is 25. Thus, 25 students wore red lipstick.",
    "Now, I need to find how many students wore blue lipstick. There were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as those who wore red lipstick.",
    "I need to calculate one-fifth of 25.",
    "One-fifth of 25 is 5."
