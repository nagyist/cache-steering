  "query": "Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many crickets Calvin has.",
    "He has 12 giant roaches, and he has half as many crickets as roaches.",
    "Calculate the number of crickets: 12 / 2 = 6.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many caterpillars Calvin has.",
    "He has 3 scorpions and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.",
    "Calculate the number of caterpillars: 3 * 2 = 6.",
    "Now, I will add up all the insects in Calvin's collection.",
    "He has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, 6 crickets, and 6 caterpillars.",
    "Add them together: 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27."
