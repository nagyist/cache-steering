  "query": "In his phone gallery, Malachi has the number of selfies he took last year and this year in the ratio of 10:17. If he has 2430 photos in his gallery, how many more photos did he take this year than last year?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the number of photos Malachi took last year and this year. I know the ratio of photos taken last year to this year is 10:17 and the total number of photos is 2430.",
    "Let the number of photos taken last year be 10x and the number taken this year be 17x, where x is a common factor.",
    "The total number of photos taken is given by: \n\n10x (last year) + 17x (this year) = 2430 photos.",
    "Combine the terms: \n\n10x + 17x = 27x.",
    "So, 27x = 2430.",
    "To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 27.\n\n2430 / 27 = x.",
    "Calculating 2430 / 27. I will simplify step-by-step.\n\n2430 divided by 27 gives 90.\n\nThus, x = 90.",
    "Now that I have x, I will calculate the actual number of photos taken last year and this year.",
    "For last year: 10x = 10 * 90 = 900 photos.",
    "For this year: 17x = 17 * 90 = 1530 photos.",
    "Now, I need to find how many more photos Malachi took this year than last year.",
    "Subtract the number of photos taken last year from the number of photos taken this year: \n\n1530 - 900 = 630."

  "solution": "630"
