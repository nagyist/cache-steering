  "query": "On the last night that roller skate rink was open, 40 people showed up to roller skate one last time.  When all 40 people skated at one time, how many wheels were on the floor?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know each roller skate has 4 wheels.",
    "Since each person wears a pair of roller skates, they would use 2 skates each.",
    "Each person, therefore, uses skates with a combined total of 8 wheels (since 2 skates x 4 wheels each = 8 wheels).",
    "There are 40 people, and each uses a pair of skates.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of wheels for all 40 people.",
    "I can do this by multiplying the number of people by the number of wheels each person uses, i.e., 40 people x 8 wheels per person.",
    "40 x 8 = 320."
  ],
  "solution": "320"
