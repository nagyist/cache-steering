  "query": "Olivia earns $9 per hour.  She worked 4 hours on Monday, 3 hours on Wednesday and 6 hours on Friday.  How much money did Olivia make this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Olivia earned on each day she worked.",
    "On Monday, she worked 4 hours.",
    "So, she earned 4 hours * $9/hour = $36 on Monday.",
    "On Wednesday, she worked 3 hours.",
    "So, she earned 3 hours * $9/hour = $27 on Wednesday.",
    "On Friday, she worked 6 hours.",
    "So, she earned 6 hours * $9/hour = $54 on Friday.",
    "Next, I need to add up her earnings for all the days she worked.",
    "$36 (Monday) + $27 (Wednesday) + $54 (Friday) = $117.",
    "I have now calculated the total amount Olivia made this week."
