  "query": "Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily and three times as many as Bob bought. If Emily bought 6 candies, how many candies did Bob buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand what the problem is asking. We need to find out how many candies Bob bought given the purchases Jennifer and Emily made.",
    "We know Emily bought 6 candies. This is a clear and given piece of information.",
    "According to the problem, Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily. So, calculate Jennifer's candies: 2 times 6.",
    "2 times 6 equals 12. So, Jennifer bought 12 candies.",
    "The problem also states that Jennifer bought three times as many candies as Bob bought. We are trying to find out how many candies Bob bought.",
    "If Jennifer bought 12 candies, and this is 3 times what Bob bought, then Bob must have bought a third of 12.",
    "Calculate one third of 12 by dividing 12 by 3.",
    "12 divided by 3 equals 4. Therefore, Bob bought 4 candies."
