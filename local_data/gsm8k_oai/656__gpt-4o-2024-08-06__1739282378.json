  "query": "Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. If Zig wrote 60 books, how many books did they write altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Zig wrote 60 books.",
    "Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo.",
    "To find how many books Flo wrote, I'll divide the number of books Zig wrote by 4.",
    "60 divided by 4 equals 15.",
    "Therefore, Flo wrote 15 books.",
    "To find the total number of books they wrote together, I need to add the number of books Zig wrote and the number of books Flo wrote.",
    "60 books (Zig) + 15 books (Flo) equals 75 books."

  "solution": "75"
