  "query": "For every bike Henry sells, he is paid $8 more than he is paid to paint the bike. If Henry gets $5 to paint the bike, how much does he get paid to sell and paint 8 bikes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem.",
    "Henry gets paid for painting the bike and for selling the bike.",
    "I know that Henry gets $5 to paint the bike.",
    "For every bike he sells, he is paid $8 more than he is paid to paint the bike.",
    "So, the amount he gets paid to sell the bike is $5 + $8.",
    "Therefore, Henry gets paid $13 to sell one bike.",
    "Now, to find out how much he gets paid to sell and paint one bike, I need to add the painting fee and the selling fee.",
    "He gets $5 for painting and $13 for selling a bike.",
    "So, $5 + $13 equals $18 for painting and selling one bike.",
    "He needs to paint and sell 8 bikes.",
    "To find the total amount, I multiply the total payment for one bike by 8.",
    "$18 multiplied by 8 equals $144."

  "solution": "144"
