  "query": "Charlotte, Lisa, and Patricia have a joint baseball collection. One of their friends is selling a rare baseball card for $100 on his website. Not wanting to miss such a rare opportunity, they have pooled all their money to buy the card. Patricia has $6. Lisa has five times Patricia\u2019s money, but double Charlotte\u2019s. How much more money do they require?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine how much money Patricia has. According to the problem, Patricia has $6.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money Lisa has. Lisa has five times the amount of Patricia's money. So, I multiply Patricia's money by 5.",
    "Calculating Lisa's money: 5 times $6 equals $30. Therefore, Lisa has $30.",
    "The problem also states that Lisa's money is double Charlotte's money. So, I can use Lisa's amount to find out how much Charlotte has.",
    "To find Charlotte's amount, divide Lisa's money by 2. Calculating: $30 divided by 2 equals $15. Therefore, Charlotte has $15.",
    "Now, I have the amounts for all three girls. Patricia has $6, Lisa has $30, and Charlotte has $15. I will add all these amounts together to find their total money.",
    "Adding their amounts: $6 (Patricia) + $30 (Lisa) + $15 (Charlotte) equals $51. The total amount they have together is $51.",
    "Their friend is selling the card for $100. I need to find out how much more money they require to buy the card by subtracting what they have from the price of the card.",
    "Calculating how much more they need: $100 (price of the card) minus $51 (their total amount) equals $49."
