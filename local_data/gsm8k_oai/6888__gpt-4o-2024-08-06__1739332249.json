  "query": "A supermarket has pints of strawberries on sale. They sold 54 pints and made $216, which was $108 less than they would have made selling the same number of pints without the sale. How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's first find out how much revenue they would have made if the strawberries were not on sale. They made $216 with the sale, and this is $108 less than the original price.",
    "If the revenue with the sale is $216 and this is $108 less, then the original revenue without the sale would be $216 + $108.",
    "Calculate the original revenue: $216 + $108 = $324.",
    "They sold 54 pints of strawberries, so now we need to find the price per pint with and without the sale.",
    "First, find the price per pint with the sale. They made $216 from selling 54 pints, so the sale price per pint is $216 / 54.",
    "Calculate the sale price per pint: $216 / 54 = $4.",
    "Now, find the original price per pint without the sale. They would have made $324 from selling 54 pints, so the original price per pint is $324 / 54.",
    "Calculate the original price per pint: $324 / 54 = $6.",
    "Determine how much more a pint costs without the sale. We need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price per pint.",
    "Subtract the sale price from the original price: $6 - $4 = $2."
