  "query": "Michael and Thomas are selling their lego collections. They agree to split any money they earn. They sell them based on how many circles are on top. Each circle costs 1 cent. They earned $5 each after selling 100 single pieces, 45 double pieces, 50 triple pieces and a number of quadruple pieces. How many quadruple pieces did they sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money they earned in total. They each earned $5, so together they earned $10.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money they made from selling each type of piece. Each circle is worth 1 cent.",
    "Single pieces have 1 circle on top. They sold 100 single pieces, so this contributed 100 circles (or cents) to the total.",
    "Double pieces have 2 circles on top. They sold 45 double pieces, so this contributed 45 x 2 = 90 circles to the total.",
    "Triple pieces have 3 circles on top. They sold 50 triple pieces, so this contributed 50 x 3 = 150 circles to the total.",
    "Now, I will add up the circles from the single, double, and triple pieces: 100 + 90 + 150 = 340 circles.",
    "Since they earned $10 in total, which is equivalent to 1000 cents, the remaining circles must have come from the quadruple pieces.",
    "I know they got 1000 total circles, and they already have accounted for 340 circles from other pieces. So, the number of circles from the quadruple pieces is 1000 - 340 = 660 circles.",
    "Each quadruple piece has 4 circles on top. Therefore, to find the number of quadruple pieces sold, I need to divide the number of circles from quadruple pieces by 4.",
    "660 circles \u00f7 4 circles per piece = 165 quadruple pieces."

  "solution": "165"
