  "query": "Connor scored 2 in a game while Amy scored 4 more than Connor. Jason scored twice the score of Amy. If Connor, Amy, and Jason belong to the same team, how many points did their team have?",
  "steps": [
    "Connor scored 2 points.",
    "Amy scored 4 more than Connor.",
    "To find Amy's score, I add 4 to Connor's score: 2 + 4 = 6.",
    "Jason scored twice the score of Amy.",
    "To find Jason's score, I multiply Amy's score by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.",
    "To find the total score of the team, I add up the scores of Connor, Amy, and Jason.",
    "Connor's score is 2, Amy's score is 6, and Jason's score is 12.",
    "Adding these together: 2 + 6 + 12.",
