  "query": "Hartley has 4 puppies that each weigh 7.5 kilograms. The rescue center has 14 cats that each weigh 2.5 kilograms. How many kilograms more do the cats weigh than the puppies?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how much all the puppies weigh together.",
    "Each of the 4 puppies weighs 7.5 kilograms.",
    "To find the total weight of the puppies, I multiply the number of puppies by the weight of each puppy.",
    "4 puppies * 7.5 kilograms each = 30 kilograms.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much all the cats weigh together.",
    "There are 14 cats and each weighs 2.5 kilograms.",
    "To find the total weight of the cats, I multiply the number of cats by the weight of each cat.",
    "14 cats * 2.5 kilograms each = 35 kilograms.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many kilograms more the cats weigh than the puppies.",
    "The cats weigh 35 kilograms and the puppies weigh 30 kilograms.",
    "To find the difference, I subtract the weight of the puppies from the weight of the cats.",
    "35 kilograms (cats) - 30 kilograms (puppies) = 5 kilograms."
