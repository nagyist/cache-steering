  "query": "A truck driver has to spend $2 per gallon of gas. She can drive 10 miles per gallon. She drives at a rate of 30 miles per hour. If she is paid $.50 per mile, how much money does she make if she drives for 10 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many miles the truck driver can drive in 10 hours.",
    "The truck driver's speed is 30 miles per hour.",
    "If she drives for 10 hours, she will drive 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.",
    "Next, let's find out how much she earns from driving 300 miles.",
    "She is paid $0.50 per mile.",
    "For 300 miles, she will earn 300 miles * $0.50/mile = $150.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much gas she uses to drive 300 miles.",
    "She can drive 10 miles per gallon of gas.",
    "For 300 miles, she will need 300 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 30 gallons of gas.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the cost of the gas.",
    "Gas costs $2 per gallon.",
    "The cost for 30 gallons of gas will be 30 gallons * $2/gallon = $60.",
    "Finally, I'll calculate her net earnings after subtracting the cost of gas.",
    "Her earnings are $150, and the gas cost is $60.",
    "Her net earnings will be $150 - $60 = $90."

  "solution": "90"
