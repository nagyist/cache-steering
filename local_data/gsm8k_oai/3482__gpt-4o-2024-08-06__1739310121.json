  "query": "Cersei bought 50 cotton candies. She gave her brother and sister 5 cotton candies each, then gave the remaining one-fourth of them to her cousin. If she ate 12 cotton candies, how many cotton candies are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Cersei starts with 50 cotton candies.",
    "She gave 5 cotton candies to her brother.",
    "She gave another 5 cotton candies to her sister.",
    "Together, she has given 5 + 5 = 10 cotton candies to her brother and sister.",
    "Subtract these 10 cotton candies from the 50 she started with: 50 - 10 = 40 cotton candies remaining.",
    "Next, she gives one-fourth of these remaining candies to her cousin.",
    "A quarter of 40 cotton candies is 40 / 4 = 10 cotton candies.",
    "After giving these 10 cotton candies to her cousin, she has 40 - 10 = 30 cotton candies left.",
    "Cersei eats 12 of the remaining cotton candies.",
    "Subtract the 12 candies she ate from the 30 left: 30 - 12 = 18 cotton candies."
