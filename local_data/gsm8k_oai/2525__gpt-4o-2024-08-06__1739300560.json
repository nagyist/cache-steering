  "query": "There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many blue crayons there are.",
    "The problem states there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons.",
    "There are 14 red crayons.",
    "So, the number of blue crayons is 14 + 5.",
    "14 + 5 equals 19.",
    "Thus, there are 19 blue crayons.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of yellow crayons.",
    "The problem states there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.",
    "First, I calculate double the number of blue crayons.",
    "Double of 19 is 19 * 2.",
    "19 * 2 equals 38.",
    "Now, I need to subtract 6 from 38.",
    "38 - 6 equals 32.",
    "Therefore, there are 32 yellow crayons."

  "solution": "32"
