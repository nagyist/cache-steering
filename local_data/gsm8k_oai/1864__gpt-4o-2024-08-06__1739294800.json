  "steps": [
    "Phoebe is currently 10 years old.",
    "In 5 years, Phoebe will be 10 + 5 = 15 years old.",
    "In 5 years, Raven will be 4 times as old as Phoebe, who will then be 15 years old.",
    "4 times 15 is 60.",
    "Therefore, in 5 years, Raven will be 60 years old.",
    "To find Raven's current age, we need to subtract the 5 years from Raven's future age.",
    "60 - 5 = 55.",
    "Therefore, Raven is currently 55 years old."
