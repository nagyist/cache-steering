  "query": "Tomorrow, Pete must finish paying off the last $90 he owes on a bike. He goes through his wallet and finds two $20 bills. Checking his pockets, he finds four $10 bills. Unhappy that he doesn't have the entire amount, he suddenly remembers that he has plastic bottles that can be returned to his local store for cash. If the store pays 50 cents for each bottle, how many bottles will Pete have to return to the store?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Pete currently has.",
    "He has two $20 bills.",
    "2 times $20 equals $40.",
    "He also has four $10 bills.",
    "4 times $10 equals $40.",
    "So, Pete has $40 + $40 = $80 in total.",
    "He owes $90.",
    "I need to find out how much more money Pete needs.",
    "He needs to pay $90 and currently has $80.",
    "$90 - $80 equals $10.",
    "Pete needs an additional $10 to pay off the bike.",
    "The store pays 50 cents per bottle.",
    "50 cents is $0.50, which is half of a dollar.",
    "If each bottle brings 50 cents, two bottles would bring $1.",
    "To find out how many bottles he needs for $10, I divide the total amount he needs ($10) by the amount earned per bottle ($0.50).",
    "$10 divided by $0.50 is 20."

  "solution": "20"
