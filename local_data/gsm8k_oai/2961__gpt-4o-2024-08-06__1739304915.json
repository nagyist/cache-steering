  "query": "Jasmine wants to organize her books in order of most number of pages to least number of pages. Jasmine's longest book has 396 pages and her shortest book has one-fourth as many pages as the longest. If the book in the middle of her shelf has three times the number of pages of the shortest book, then how many pages does the middle book have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pages the shortest book has.",
    "The shortest book has one-fourth the number of pages of the longest book.",
    "The longest book has 396 pages.",
    "I calculate one-fourth of 396 pages.",
    "One-fourth of 396 is 396 divided by 4.",
    "396 divided by 4 equals 99.",
    "Therefore, the shortest book has 99 pages.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pages the middle book has.",
    "The middle book has three times the number of pages of the shortest book.",
    "The shortest book has 99 pages.",
    "I calculate three times 99.",
    "Three times 99 equals 297.",
    "Therefore, the middle book has 297 pages."
