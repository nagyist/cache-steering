  "query": "The result from the 40-item Statistics exam Marion and Ella took already came out. Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion's score?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the score that Ella received on her exam.",
    "The exam consists of 40 items, and Ella got 4 incorrect, so she answered 40 - 4 = 36 correctly.",
    "Ella's corrected score is 36.",
    "Next, I need to figure out Marion's score based on the information given.",
    "Marion's score is described as 6 more than half the score of Ella.",
    "To find half of Ella's score, I take 36 and divide it by 2.",
    "Half of Ella's score is 36 / 2 = 18.",
    "Now, to find Marion's score, I add 6 to 18.",
    "Marion's score is 18 + 6 = 24."
