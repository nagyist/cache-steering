  "query": "Jessica wrote a long letter to her aunt and needed to put stamps on it to mail it. She used eight pieces of paper that weigh 1/5 of an ounce each, and her envelope weighs 2/5 of an ounce. She needed one stamp per ounce. How many stamps did Jessica need to mail her letter?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total weight of the eight pieces of paper.",
    "Each piece of paper weighs 1/5 of an ounce, and there are eight pieces of paper.",
    "To find the total weight of the papers, I will multiply 8 by 1/5.",
    "8 times 1/5 is 8/5.",
    "8/5 as a decimal is 1.6 ounces. So, the total weight of the paper is 1.6 ounces.",
    "Next, I need to add the weight of the envelope to the total weight of the paper.",
    "The envelope weighs 2/5 of an ounce.",
    "To add 1.6 ounces (the weight of the paper) and 2/5 ounces (the weight of the envelope), I need to convert 2/5 to a decimal.",
    "2/5 as a decimal is 0.4.",
    "Adding 1.6 (paper weight) and 0.4 (envelope weight), I get 1.6 + 0.4.",
    "The total weight of the letter and envelope is 2.0 ounces.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many stamps Jessica needs. She needs one stamp for each ounce or part thereof.",
    "Since the total weight is 2.0 ounces, Jessica needs two stamps."

  "solution": "2"
