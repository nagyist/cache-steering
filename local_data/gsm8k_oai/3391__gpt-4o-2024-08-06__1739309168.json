Then, she spends the next 5 days at her brother's house.  Then she spent two days traveling to her sister's house, spent several days at her sister's house, and then spent two more days traveling home.  How many days did she spend at her sister's house?",
  "steps": [
    "Kelly booked a three week vacation, which means she planned a total of 21 days for the entire trip.",
    "She spent 1 day traveling initially.",
    "She spent the next 5 days at her Grandparents' house.",
    "Then, she spent 1 more day traveling to her brother's house.",
    "She spent 5 days at her brother's house.",
    "She spent 2 days traveling to her sister's house.",
    "She spent 2 more days traveling back home.",
    "Let's add up the days spent traveling and at different locations so far: 1 (travel) + 5 (Grandparents) + 1 (travel) + 5 (brother) + 2 (travel) + 2 (travel) = 16 days.",
    "Subtract the 16 days used so far from the total 21 days to find the number of days spent at her sister's house.",
    "21 days (total vacation) - 16 days (used days) = 5 days."
