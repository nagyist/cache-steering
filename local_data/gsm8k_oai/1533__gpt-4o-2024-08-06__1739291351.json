  "query": "Jen bought a bag of cookies and ate three-quarters of the bag that day. The next day, she ate half of the remaining cookies. She has 8 cookies left on the third day. How many cookies were in the bag to start?",
  "steps": [
    "Let \\( x \\) be the total number of cookies in the bag initially.",
    "On the first day, Jen ate three-quarters of the cookies.",
    "This means that she ate \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\) cookies on the first day.",
    "Therefore, the number of cookies left after the first day is \\( x - \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{1}{4}x \\).",
    "The next day, she ate half of the remaining cookies.",
    "Half of the remaining cookies on the second day is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4}x = \\frac{1}{8}x \\).",
    "After eating half of the remaining cookies on the second day, she had \\( \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{8}x = \\frac{1}{8}x \\) cookies left.",
    "According to the problem, she has 8 cookies left on the third day.",
    "So, we have the equation \\( \\frac{1}{8}x = 8 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by 8.",
    "\\( x = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\)."

  "solution": "64"
