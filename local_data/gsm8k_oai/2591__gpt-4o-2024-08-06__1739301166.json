  "query": "In one week, Jake can eat 3 papayas, his brother can eat 5 papayas, and his father can eat 4 papayas.  To account for 4 weeks, how many papayas does Jake need to buy from the farmer\u2019s market?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many papayas each person can eat in one week.",
    "Jake eats 3 papayas in one week.",
    "His brother eats 5 papayas in one week.",
    "His father eats 4 papayas in one week.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total number of papayas the family eats in one week.",
    "3 (Jake) + 5 (brother) + 4 (father) = 12 papayas per week.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many papayas are required for 4 weeks.",
    "12 papayas per week * 4 weeks = 48 papayas.",
    "Therefore, Jake needs to buy 48 papayas for 4 weeks."
