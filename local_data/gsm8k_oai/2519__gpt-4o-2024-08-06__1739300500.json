  "query": "Lee is saving up for a new pair of sneakers which cost $90. He already has $15 saved. He plans to sell his old action figures to make the rest. If he sells 10 action figures and still has $25 left after buying the sneakers how much did he charge per action figure?",
  "steps": [
    "Calculate how much more money Lee needs to buy the sneakers. The sneakers cost $90, and he already has $15 saved.",
    "Subtract $15 from $90 to find out how much more Lee needs: $90 - $15 = $75.",
    "Determine how much money Lee has after buying the sneakers. If he has $25 left, it means he had $25 more than what he spent on the sneakers.",
    "Add the $90 cost of the sneakers to the $25 Lee has left to find out how much he had before buying the sneakers: $90 + $25 = $115.",
    "Subtract the $15 he originally had saved from the total amount he had before buying the sneakers to find out how much he earned from the action figures: $115 - $15 = $100.",
    "Now, Lee earned $100 by selling his action figures. He sold 10 action figures in total.",
    "To find out how much Lee charged per action figure, divide the total amount he earned ($100) by the number of action figures he sold (10).",
    "$100 divided by 10 equals $10. So, Lee charged $10 per action figure."
