  "query": "Max has a collection of stamps in three colors: 20 red stamps, 80 blue stamps and 7 yellow ones. He is trying to sell the whole collection. He already sold 20 red stamps for the price of $1.1 for each stamp and 80 blue stamps for the price of $0.8 for each stamp. What price did he need to set for each yellow stamp to be able to earn the total of $100 from the whole sale?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount Max has already earned from selling the red and blue stamps.",
    "Max sold 20 red stamps at $1.1 each. So, the total from red stamps is 20 * 1.1 = $22.",
    "Max sold 80 blue stamps at $0.8 each. So, the total from blue stamps is 80 * 0.8 = $64.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total earnings from these two colors combined.",
    "I add the earnings from red and blue stamps: $22 + $64 = $86.",
    "Max wants to earn $100 in total from his entire stamp collection.",
    "I need to determine how much more money Max needs from the sale of the yellow stamps to reach his goal.",
    "To find out the additional amount needed, I subtract the current earnings from the total goal: $100 - $86 = $14.",
    "Max has 7 yellow stamps to sell to make this additional $14.",
    "I need to calculate the price for each yellow stamp by dividing the remaining amount needed by the number of yellow stamps.",
    "The price per yellow stamp is $14 divided by 7 stamps, which equals $2."
