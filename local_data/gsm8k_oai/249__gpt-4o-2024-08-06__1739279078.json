Then, he divided the remaining dandelion puffs equally among his 3 friends. How many dandelion puffs did each friend receive if he originally picked 40 dandelion puffs?",
  "steps": [
    "Caleb originally picked 40 dandelion puffs.",
    "Caleb gave 3 dandelion puffs to his mom.",
    "Caleb gave 3 more dandelion puffs to his sister.",
    "Caleb gave 5 dandelion puffs to his grandmother.",
    "Caleb gave 2 dandelion puffs to his dog.",
    "I need to add up all the dandelion puffs he gave away: 3 (to mom) + 3 (to sister) + 5 (to grandmother) + 2 (to dog).",
    "3 + 3 equals 6.",
    "6 + 5 equals 11.",
    "11 + 2 equals 13.",
    "Caleb gave away a total of 13 dandelion puffs.",
    "I need to subtract the given away dandelion puffs from the total picked to find how many are left: 40 - 13.",
    "40 minus 13 equals 27.",
