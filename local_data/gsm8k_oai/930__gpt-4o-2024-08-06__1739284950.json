  "query": "How many apples did two men and three women buy at a certain store if the two men each bought 30 apples, 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many apples each woman bought.",
    "The problem states that each man bought 30 apples and each woman bought 20 more apples than each man.",
    "If each man bought 30 apples, then each woman bought 30 + 20 apples.",
    "Therefore, each woman bought 50 apples.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of apples bought by the two men.",
    "Each man bought 30 apples, and there are two men.",
    "Therefore, the total number of apples bought by the two men is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of apples bought by the three women.",
    "Each woman bought 50 apples, and there are three women.",
    "Therefore, the total number of apples bought by the three women is 3 * 50 = 150 apples.",
    "Finally, I should add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women to find the overall total.",
    "The total number of apples bought is 60 (from the men) + 150 (from the women).",
    "This sum is 210 apples."
