  "query": "Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks. If he loses half his white socks, how many more white socks does he still have than black socks if he has 6 black socks?",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the number of black socks Andy has: 6.",
    "Determine how many white socks Andy initially has. Since he has 4 times as many white socks as black socks, calculate 4 \u00d7 6.",
    "4 \u00d7 6 equals 24. Andy has 24 white socks initially.",
    "Andy loses half of his white socks. Calculate half of 24.",
    "Half of 24 is 24 \u00f7 2, which equals 12.",
    "Subtract the lost white socks from the initial amount. Calculate 24 - 12.",
    "24 - 12 equals 12. Andy now has 12 white socks.",
    "Determine how many more white socks Andy has than black socks. Subtract the number of black socks from the current number of white socks.",
    "12 white socks - 6 black socks equals 6."
