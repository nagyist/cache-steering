  "query": "The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height. What is the base length of a triangle with height 8 and area 24 square units?",
  "steps": [
    "The formula for the area of a triangle is given by the expression: Area = 1/2 * base * height.",
    "We need to find the base length of a triangle, given that the area is 24 square units and the height is 8 units.",
    "Let's denote the base length as b.",
    "Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we can write the equation: 1/2 * b * 8 = 24.",
    "We can simplify the left side of the equation: 1/2 * 8 = 4, so the equation becomes 4b = 24.",
    "Now, we need to solve for b. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 4.",
    "Performing the division, we get b = 24 / 4.",
    "Calculating the division, we find that b = 6."
