  "query": "Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana. If the number of their dresses combined is 48, how many dresses does Ana have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of dresses Ana has be represented by the variable A.",
    "Since Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana, the number of dresses Lisa has can be represented as A + 18.",
    "According to the problem, the total number of dresses they both have is 48.",
    "Therefore, we can set up the equation: A + (A + 18) = 48.",
    "Simplifying the equation gives us: 2A + 18 = 48.",
    "Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with A: 2A = 30.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for A: A = 15."

  "solution": "15"
