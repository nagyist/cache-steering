  "query": "Arnold's collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops.  His protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop.  And his steak has 56 grams of protein.   If he has 1 scoop of collagen powder, 1 scoop of protein powder and his steak, how many grams of protein will he consume?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much protein is in 1 scoop of collagen powder.",
    "I know that 2 scoops of collagen powder have 18 grams of protein.",
    "If I divide 18 grams by 2, I can find out how much protein is in 1 scoop of collagen powder.",
    "18 grams / 2 scoops = 9 grams per scoop.",
    "Now I know that 1 scoop of collagen powder has 9 grams of protein.",
    "Next, I consider the protein powder, which has 21 grams of protein per scoop.",
    "Since Arnold uses 1 scoop of protein powder, he gets 21 grams of protein from it.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total protein intake from both collagen powder and protein powder.",
    "Collagen powder provides 9 grams, and the protein powder provides 21 grams.",
    "Adding these gives 9 grams + 21 grams = 30 grams of protein from both powders.",
    "The steak has 56 grams of protein.",
    "I need to add the protein from the steak to the total protein from the powders.",
    "Total protein from powders is 30 grams, and from the steak, it's 56 grams.",
    "Adding these gives me 30 grams + 56 grams = 86 grams of protein in total."
