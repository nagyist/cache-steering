  "query": "John releases 3 videos on his channel a day.  Two of them are short 2 minute videos and 1 of them is 6 times as long.  Assuming a 7-day week, how many minutes of video does he release per week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the length of the two short videos that John releases each day. Each video is 2 minutes long.",
    "Since John releases 2 short videos each day, the total duration for these is 2 videos \u00d7 2 minutes/video = 4 minutes per day.",
    "Next, find the length of the longer video. It is 6 times as long as one of the short videos.",
    "Therefore, the longer video is 6 \u00d7 2 minutes = 12 minutes long.",
    "Add the time of the two short videos and the long video to find the total video minutes released by John each day.",
    "The total video time per day is 4 minutes (short videos) + 12 minutes (long video) = 16 minutes per day.",
    "Now, to find out the weekly video time, calculate the total for a 7-day week.",
    "Multiply the daily total by 7: 16 minutes/day \u00d7 7 days/week = 112 minutes/week."
  ],
  "solution": "112"
