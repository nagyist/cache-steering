  "query": "Roberto and Valerie are jumping rope at recess. Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. If they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, how many skips will they total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many minutes Roberto and Valerie are jumping rope. The problem states that they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight.",
    "To find out how many skips Roberto can do in fifteen minutes, I start by finding out how many skips he does per minute.",
    "Roberto can skip 4,200 times in one hour. One hour equals 60 minutes.",
    "Roberto's skips per minute would be 4,200 divided by 60.",
    "4,200 divided by 60 equals 70. Roberto skips 70 times a minute.",
    "Next, I calculate how many skips Roberto can do in fifteen minutes by multiplying his skips per minute by 15.",
    "70 skips per minute times 15 minutes equals 1,050 skips for Roberto.",
    "Now, I determine how many skips Valerie can do in fifteen minutes.",
    "Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. To find the total number of skips in fifteen minutes, I multiply 80 by 15.",
    "80 skips per minute times 15 minutes equals 1,200 skips for Valerie.",
    "To find the total skips Roberto and Valerie do together, I add Roberto\u2019s and Valerie\u2019s skips.",
    "1,050 skips (Roberto) plus 1,200 skips (Valerie) equals 2,250 total skips."

  "solution": "2,250"
