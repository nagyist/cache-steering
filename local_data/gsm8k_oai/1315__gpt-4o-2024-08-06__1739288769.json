  "query": "Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once. He bakes 7 batches of pies, then slips and drops 8 of them. How many pies are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many pies Marcus bakes in total.",
    "Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven for one batch, and he bakes 7 batches.",
    "To find the total number of pies baked, I will multiply the number of pies per batch by the number of batches.",
    "5 pies/batch * 7 batches = 35 pies",
    "Now, I need to account for the 8 pies that Marcus drops.",
    "He initially has 35 pies but drops 8, so I need to subtract 8 from 35.",
    "35 - 8 = 27 pies"

  "solution": "27"
