  "query": "Emma is planning a dinner party, so she went to a shop to buy the products she needs. She bought 8 kg of cheese and 7 kg of vegetables. One kilogram of cheese costs $4 and one kilogram of vegetable costs is $2 more expensive. How much did she pay for her shopping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Emma spent on cheese.",
    "She bought 8 kilograms of cheese.",
    "The cost of one kilogram of cheese is $4.",
    "Therefore, the cost for the cheese is 8 kg \u00d7 $4/kg.",
    "8 \u00d7 4 = 32",
    "Emma spent $32 on cheese.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Emma spent on vegetables.",
    "She bought 7 kilograms of vegetables.",
    "I know that one kilogram of vegetables costs $2 more than one kilogram of cheese.",
    "The cost of one kilogram of cheese is $4, so the cost of one kilogram of vegetables is $4 + $2.",
    "4 + 2 = 6",
    "The cost of one kilogram of vegetables is $6.",
    "Therefore, the cost for the vegetables is 7 kg \u00d7 $6/kg.",
    "7 \u00d7 6 = 42",
    "Emma spent $42 on vegetables.",
    "To find out the total amount Emma paid for her shopping, I need to add the costs of cheese and vegetables.",
    "$32 (cheese) + $42 (vegetables) = $74"

  "solution": "74"
