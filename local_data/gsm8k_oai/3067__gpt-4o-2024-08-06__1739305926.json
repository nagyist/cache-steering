  "query": "Stefan, Vail, and Aiguo collected seashells. Stefan had 16 more seashells than Vail. Vail had 5 less than Aiguo. Aiguo had 20 seashells. How many seashells did the 3 children have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Aiguo had 20 seashells.",
    "Vail had 5 less seashells than Aiguo.",
    "So, Vail had 20 - 5 seashells, which is 15 seashells.",
    "Stefan had 16 more seashells than Vail.",
    "This means Stefan had 15 + 16 seashells.",
    "15 + 16 equals 31, so Stefan had 31 seashells.",
    "Now, I need to add all the seashells together.",
    "Aiguo had 20 seashells, Vail had 15, and Stefan had 31.",
    "Adding these numbers: 20 + 15 + 31.",
    "20 + 15 is 35.",
    "35 + 31 is 66."

  "solution": "66"
