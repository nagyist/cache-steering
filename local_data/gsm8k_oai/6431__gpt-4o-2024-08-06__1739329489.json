  "query": "John decided to sell his PlayStation to buy a new computer.  The computer's cost was $700 and the accessories cost was $200.  The PlayStation was worth $400 but he sold it for 20% less than its value.  How much money came out of his pocket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much John sold the PlayStation for. The PlayStation was worth $400.",
    "He sold it for 20% less than its value, so I need to calculate 20% of $400.",
    "20% of $400 is 0.20 * 400 = $80.",
    "So, John sold the PlayStation for $400 - $80 = $320.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories. The computer costs $700 and the accessories cost $200.",
    "Thus, the total cost is $700 + $200 = $900.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money John paid out of his pocket. He sold the PlayStation for $320, so he still needs $900 - $320 to cover the total purchase.",
    "Subtracting the money he got from selling the PlayStation from the total cost gives $900 - $320 = $580."
