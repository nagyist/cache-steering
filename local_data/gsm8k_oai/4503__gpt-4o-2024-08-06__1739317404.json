  "query": "Christine is subbing aquafaba for egg whites in baking.  Every 2 tablespoons of aquafaba is equivalent to 1 egg white.  She's making 2 angel food cakes that call for 8 egg whites each.  How many tablespoons of aquafaba will she need in order not to use egg whites?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of egg whites needed for the two angel food cakes.",
    "Each cake requires 8 egg whites, and there are 2 cakes, so I need to multiply 8 by 2.",
    "8 egg whites per cake times 2 cakes equals 16 egg whites in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tablespoons of aquafaba are needed for 16 egg whites.",
    "According to the conversion given, 2 tablespoons of aquafaba are equivalent to 1 egg white.",
    "Therefore, I need to multiply the number of egg whites by 2 to find out how many tablespoons of aquafaba are needed.",
    "16 egg whites times 2 tablespoons per egg white equals 32 tablespoons of aquafaba."

  "solution": "32"
