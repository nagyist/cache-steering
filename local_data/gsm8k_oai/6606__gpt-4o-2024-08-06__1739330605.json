  "query": "Ali turned 8 years old this year, and is now 3 years older than Yusaf. If Umar is twice Yusaf\u2019s age, how old is Umar?",
  "steps": [
    "Ali is 8 years old this year.",
    "Yusaf is 3 years younger than Ali.",
    "To find Yusaf's age, I subtract 3 from Ali's age.",
    "8 - 3 = 5. So, Yusaf is 5 years old.",
    "Umar is twice Yusaf\u2019s age.",
    "To find Umar's age, I multiply Yusaf's age by 2.",
    "5 * 2 = 10. Umar is 10 years old."
