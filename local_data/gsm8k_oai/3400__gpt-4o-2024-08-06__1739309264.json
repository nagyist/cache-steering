  "query": "Rodney, Roger and Ron can lift a combined weight of 239 pounds.  Rodney can lift twice as much as Roger, and Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times the amount that Ron can lift.  How much can Rodney lift?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the variables: let Rn be the amount Ron can lift, Rg be the amount Roger can lift, and Rd be the amount Rodney can lift.",
    "We know their combined lifting weight is 239 pounds: Rn + Rg + Rd = 239.",
    "Rodney can lift twice as much as Roger, so Rd = 2 * Rg.",
    "Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times what Ron can lift, so Rg = 4 * Rn - 7.",
    "Now we have three equations: \n1) Rn + Rg + Rd = 239,\n2) Rd = 2 * Rg,\n3) Rg = 4 * Rn - 7.",
    "Substitute the second and third equations into the first equation:\nRn + (4 * Rn - 7) + (2 * (4 * Rn - 7)) = 239.",
    "Simplify the equation: \nRn + 4 * Rn - 7 + 8 * Rn - 14 = 239.",
    "Combine like terms: \nRn + 4 * Rn + 8 * Rn = 13 * Rn,\nand -7 - 14 = -21.",
    "Now the equation is 13 * Rn - 21 = 239.",
    "Add 21 to both sides: \n13 * Rn = 260.",
    "Divide both sides by 13: \nRn = 20.",
    "So Ron can lift 20 pounds. Now, use Rg = 4 * Rn - 7 to find how much Roger can lift: \nRg = 4 * 20 - 7.",
    "Calculate: \nRg = 80 - 7,\nRg = 73.",
    "Now, Rd = 2 * Rg to find how much Rodney can lift: \nRd = 2 * 73.",
    "Calculate: \nRd = 146.",
    "Rodney can lift 146 pounds."
