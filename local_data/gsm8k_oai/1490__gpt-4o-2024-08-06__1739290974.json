  "query": "Tommy ordered a total weight of 10 kilograms of apple, orange, grape, and strawberry fruits. He ordered 3 kilograms of apples, 1 kilogram of orange, and 3 kilograms of grapes. How many kilograms of strawberries did he order?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total weight of apples, oranges, and grapes that Tommy ordered.",
    "Tommy ordered 3 kilograms of apples.",
    "He also ordered 1 kilogram of orange.",
    "He ordered 3 kilograms of grapes.",
    "I will sum up the weights of apples, oranges, and grapes: 3 kg (apples) + 1 kg (orange) + 3 kg (grapes) = 7 kg.",
    "The total weight of all the fruits Tommy ordered is 10 kilograms.",
    "To find the weight of strawberries he ordered, I subtract the weight of the other fruits from the total: 10 kg (total) - 7 kg (apples, orange, and grapes) = 3 kg."
