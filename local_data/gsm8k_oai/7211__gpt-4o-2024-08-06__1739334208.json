  "query": "Cary is trying to strip the ivy off a tree in her yard. She strips 6 feet of ivy every day, but the ivy grows another 2 feet every night. If the tree is covered by 40 feet of ivy, how many days will it take Cary to strip all the ivy off?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by calculating how much ivy Cary effectively removes each day.",
    "She removes 6 feet of ivy during the day.",
    "Then the ivy grows back 2 feet at night.",
    "The effective amount of ivy removed each day is 6 feet - 2 feet = 4 feet.",
    "Now, determine how many days it will take to remove all 40 feet of ivy at this rate.",
    "Divide the total feet of ivy (40 feet) by the effective daily removal rate (4 feet/day).",
    "40 feet / 4 feet/day = 10 days.",
    "Check to ensure the calculations are correct and correspond with the problem details.",
    "Starting with 40 feet of ivy and removing it at an effective rate of 4 feet per day, all the ivy will be stripped after 10 days."
