  "query": "Bob buys nose spray.  He buys 10 of them for a \"buy one get one free\" promotion.  They each cost $3.  How much does he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "Bob wants to buy 10 nose sprays.",
    "There is a \"buy one get one free\" promotion.",
    "For every two nose sprays, Bob only needs to pay for one.",
    "Therefore, for 10 nose sprays, Bob only needs to pay for 5 of them.",
    "Each nose spray costs $3.",
    "So, if Bob is paying for 5 nose sprays, the total cost will be 5 times $3.",
    "5 multiplied by $3 equals $15."
