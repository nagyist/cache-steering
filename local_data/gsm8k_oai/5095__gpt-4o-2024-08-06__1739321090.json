  "query": "The number of Christmas presents David found was twice as many as the number of birthday presents. If David found a total of 60 Christmas presents, how many presents did he get all together?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many birthday presents David found.",
    "The number of Christmas presents David found is twice as many as the number of birthday presents.",
    "David found 60 Christmas presents.",
    "Since the Christmas presents are twice the birthday presents, I can set up this equation: 2x = 60, where x is the number of birthday presents.",
    "I need to solve the equation 2x = 60 for x to find the number of birthday presents.",
    "Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives me: x = 60 / 2",
    "Calculating 60 / 2 gives me 30.",
    "So, David found 30 birthday presents.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total number of presents David received.",
    "The total number of presents is the sum of Christmas presents and birthday presents.",
    "That means I add 60 (Christmas presents) + 30 (birthday presents).",
    "Calculating 60 + 30 gives me 90."

  "solution": "90"
