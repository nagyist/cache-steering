  "query": "Adam had a farm with animals. He had 12 cows and twice as many sheep. He decided to buy 3 pigs for every sheep he had. How many animals were on the farm after the transaction?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sheep Adam had. He had twice as many sheep as cows.",
    "Since Adam had 12 cows, he had twice that number in sheep, making it 12 * 2 = 24 sheep.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many pigs Adam bought. He bought 3 pigs for every sheep.",
    "For 24 sheep, he would buy 3 * 24 = 72 pigs.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of animals on the farm after the transaction. Originally, there were 12 cows and 24 sheep.",
    "Adding the new pigs to the existing animals, there are a total of 12 cows + 24 sheep + 72 pigs.",
    "Adding these together gives 12 + 24 + 72 = 108 animals."

  "solution": "108"
