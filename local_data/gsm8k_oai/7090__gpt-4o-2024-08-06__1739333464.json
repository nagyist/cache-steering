  "query": "Stacy, Steve and Sylar have 1100 berries total. Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, and Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has. How many berries does Stacy have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of berries Skylar has be \\( x \\).",
    "Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has, so Steve has \\( 2x \\) berries.",
    "Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, so Stacy has \\( 4 \\times 2x = 8x \\) berries.",
    "The total number of berries Stacy, Steve, and Skylar have is 1100.",
    "This can be represented by the equation \\( x + 2x + 8x = 1100 \\).",
    "Combine the terms on the left side: \\( 11x = 1100 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 11: \\( x = \\frac{1100}{11} = 100 \\).",
    "Skylar has \\( x = 100 \\) berries.",
    "Steve has \\( 2x = 200 \\) berries.",
    "Stacy has \\( 8x = 800 \\) berries."
