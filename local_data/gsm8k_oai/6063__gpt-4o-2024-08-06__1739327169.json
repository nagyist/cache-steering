  "query": "Megan is making food for a party.  She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven.  Each dish can feed 5 people.  She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party.  How many people can she feed with these dishes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dishes Megan can prepare in 2 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.",
    "Each dish takes 20 minutes to prepare.",
    "To find out how many dishes can be made in 120 minutes, I divide 120 by 20.",
    "120 \u00f7 20 = 6",
    "Megan can prepare 6 dishes in 2 hours.",
    "Each dish can feed 5 people.",
    "To find the total number of people Megan can feed, I multiply the number of dishes by the number of people each dish can feed.",
    "6 dishes x 5 people per dish = 30 people"
  ],
  "solution": "30"
