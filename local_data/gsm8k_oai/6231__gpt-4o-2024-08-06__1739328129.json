  "query": "Ms. Warren ran at 6 mph for 20 minutes. After the run, she walked at 2 mph for 30 minutes. How many miles did she run and walk in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the distance Ms. Warren ran first, using the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "She was running at a speed of 6 mph for 20 minutes.",
    "I must convert the running time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour.",
    "20 minutes is equal to 20/60 hours, which simplifies to 1/3 of an hour.",
    "The distance she ran is 6 mph \u00d7 1/3 hours.",
    "Calculating that gives a distance of 2 miles for running.",
    "Next, I calculate the distance she walked.",
    "She was walking at a speed of 2 mph for 30 minutes.",
    "Similarly, convert the walking time from minutes to hours.",
    "30 minutes is equal to 30/60 hours, which simplifies to 1/2 hour.",
    "The distance she walked is 2 mph \u00d7 1/2 hours.",
    "Calculating that gives a distance of 1 mile for walking.",
    "Now, add the distances from running and walking to get the total distance.",
    "The total distance is 2 miles (running) + 1 mile (walking).",
    "The calculation results in a total distance of 3 miles."
