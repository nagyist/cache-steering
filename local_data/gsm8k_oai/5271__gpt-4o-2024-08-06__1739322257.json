  "query": "It takes a duck 40 days to fly to the south during winter, twice as much time to fly to the north during summer, and 60 days to travel to the East during spring. How many days is the duck flying during these seasons?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to determine how many days the duck spends flying south during winter.",
    "The problem states that it takes the duck 40 days to fly south during winter.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many days the duck flies north during summer.",
    "It specifies that flying north takes twice as long as flying south.",
    "Flying south takes 40 days, so flying north takes \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\) days.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the time spent flying east during spring.",
    "The problem states that it takes 60 days to fly east.",
    "Now, I will add up all the days the duck spends flying during these three seasons.",
    "The flying days are 40 days south, 80 days north, and 60 days east.",
    "Add these together: \\(40 + 80 + 60 = 180\\)."

  "solution": "180"
