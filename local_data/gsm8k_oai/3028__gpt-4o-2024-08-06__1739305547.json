  "query": "There are 20 sandcastles on Mark's beach, each with 10 towers. On Jeff's beach, there are three times as many castles as on Mark's beach, each with 5 towers. What is the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches?",
  "steps": [
    "Start with determining the number of sandcastles on Mark's beach. There are 20 sandcastles.",
    "Each sandcastle on Mark's beach has 10 towers. To find the total number of towers on Mark's beach, multiply the number of sandcastles by number of towers: 20 sandcastles * 10 towers per castle = 200 towers.",
    "Next, calculate the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach. Jeff has three times as many castles as Mark, so 20 sandcastles * 3 = 60 sandcastles.",
    "Now determine the number of towers on Jeff's beach. Each of Jeff\u2019s sandcastles has 5 towers, so 60 sandcastles * 5 towers = 300 towers.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of sandcastles on both beaches. Mark's 20 sandcastles + Jeff's 60 sandcastles = 80 sandcastles.",
    "Calculate the total number of towers on both beaches. Mark's 200 towers + Jeff's 300 towers = 500 towers.",
    "Combine the total number of sandcastles and towers. 80 sandcastles + 500 towers = 580."
