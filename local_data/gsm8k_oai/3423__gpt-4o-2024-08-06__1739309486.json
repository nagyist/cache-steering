  "query": "There are 14 chickens in the coop, and twice that many in the run. There is 4 less than double the number of chickens free ranging as in the run.  How many chickens are free ranging?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the number of chickens in the run.",
    "There are 14 chickens in the coop. The problem states that there are twice as many chickens in the run as in the coop.",
    "To find the number of chickens in the run, I multiply the number of chickens in the coop by 2: \n14 chickens * 2 = 28 chickens in the run.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of chickens that are free ranging.",
    "The problem states that there are 4 less than double the number of chickens free ranging as those in the run.",
    "Double the number of chickens in the run is: \n2 * 28 = 56.",
    "To find the number of chickens free ranging, I subtract 4 from this result: \n56 - 4 = 52."
