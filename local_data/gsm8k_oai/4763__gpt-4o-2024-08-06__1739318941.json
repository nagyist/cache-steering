  "query": "Dave bought 8 books about animals, 6 books about outer space, and 3 books about trains to keep him busy over the holidays. Each book cost $6. How much did Dave spend on the books?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many books Dave bought in total.",
    "Dave bought 8 books about animals.",
    "Dave bought 6 books about outer space.",
    "Dave bought 3 books about trains.",
    "To find the total number of books, I will add them together: 8 + 6 + 3.",
    "8 + 6 = 14.",
    "14 + 3 = 17.",
    "Dave bought a total of 17 books.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of all the books.",
    "Each book costs $6.",
    "To find the total cost, I will multiply the total number of books (17) by the cost per book ($6).",
    "17 \u00d7 6 = 102.",
    "Therefore, Dave spent $102 on the books."
