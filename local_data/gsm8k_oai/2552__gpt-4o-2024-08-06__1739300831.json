  "query": "Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy. 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. If Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls, how many dolls does Dina have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many total dolls Ivy has.",
    "I know that 2/3 of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions, and Ivy has 20 collectors edition dolls.",
    "The equation for Ivy's total dolls can be set up as: (2/3) * Total Ivy Dolls = 20.",
    "To find the total number of dolls Ivy has, I need to solve for Total Ivy Dolls.",
    "I will multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate Total Ivy Dolls: 3 * (2/3) * Total Ivy Dolls = 3 * 20.",
    "This simplifies to: 2 * Total Ivy Dolls = 60.",
    "Now, I will divide both sides by 2 to solve for Total Ivy Dolls: Total Ivy Dolls = 60 / 2.",
    "Ivy has 30 total dolls.",
    "Now that I know Ivy has 30 dolls, I need to determine how many dolls Dina has.",
    "The question states that Dina has twice as many dolls as Ivy.",
    "So, I can calculate Dina's dolls as: Dina's Dolls = 2 * Ivy's Dolls.",
    "Dina's Dolls = 2 * 30.",
    "Dina has 60 dolls."

  "solution": "60"
