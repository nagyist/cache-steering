  "query": "Due to the restrictions of Coronavirus, Mr. Trent, the local store owner, increased the prices of goods at his store by 15% each to make the same income he was making before. If buying an orange was $40 and the price of purchasing a mango was $50, calculate how much it costs in total now to buy ten oranges and ten mangoes at the new prices.",
  "steps": [
    "The original price of an orange was $40.",
    "The original price of a mango was $50.",
    "Mr. Trent increased the prices by 15%.",
    "Calculate the new price of an orange by adding 15% to the original price: $40 + (15/100 * $40).",
    "15% of $40 is $6.",
    "The new price of an orange is $40 + $6 = $46.",
    "Calculate the new price of a mango by adding 15% to the original price: $50 + (15/100 * $50).",
    "15% of $50 is $7.50.",
    "The new price of a mango is $50 + $7.50 = $57.50.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost for ten oranges at the new price: 10 * $46.",
    "10 * $46 = $460.",
    "Calculate the total cost for ten mangoes at the new price: 10 * $57.50.",
    "10 * $57.50 = $575.",
    "Add the total cost of ten oranges and ten mangoes at the new prices: $460 + $575.",
    "$460 + $575 = $1035."
