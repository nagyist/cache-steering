  "query": "Clyde's four children wanted to go see their favorite band perform.  The tickets were expensive so Clyde made a deal with his kids.  If the average of their scores on their next math test was higher than 89, then he would buy them tickets to the concert.   June earned a 97 on her math test, Patty earned an 85, Josh earned a 100 on his test and Henry earned a 94.  What was their average math test score?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the average score, I need to add up all the individual scores first.",
    "June scored 97, Patty scored 85, Josh scored 100, and Henry scored 94.",
    "I will add these scores: 97 + 85 + 100 + 94.",
    "97 + 85 is 182.",
    "182 + 100 is 282.",
    "282 + 94 is 376.",
    "Now, I will divide the total sum by the number of scores to find the average. There are 4 scores.",
    "Divide 376 by 4.",
    "376 divided by 4 equals 94."
