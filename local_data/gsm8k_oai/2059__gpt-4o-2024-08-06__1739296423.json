  "query": "In the jar, there are 7 blue marbles, 11 red marbles, and some yellow marbles. If the chance of randomly picking a yellow marble is 1/4, how many yellow marbles are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total probability context for selecting a marble from the jar.",
    "The probability of picking a yellow marble is given as 1/4. This means the probability that a marble is not yellow is 3/4.",
    "I note there are 7 blue marbles and 11 red marbles, which makes a total of 18 marbles that are not yellow.",
    "Let the number of yellow marbles be denoted by \"y\".",
    "The total number of marbles would then be the sum of blue, red, and yellow marbles: 7 + 11 + y, which is 18 + y.",
    "The probability of picking a yellow marble is computed by dividing the number of yellow marbles by the total number of marbles: y / (18 + y).",
    "Since this probability is 1/4, set up the equation: y / (18 + y) = 1/4.",
    "To solve this equation, perform cross multiplication: 4y = 18 + y.",
    "Subtract y from both sides of the equation: 4y - y = 18.",
    "This simplifies to: 3y = 18.",
    "Divide by 3 to solve for y: y = 18 / 3.",
    "So, y = 6."
