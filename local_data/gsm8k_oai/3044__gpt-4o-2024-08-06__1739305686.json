  "query": "Tom decides to make lasagna with all his beef.  It takes twice as many noodles as beef.  He has 10 pounds of beef.  He already has 4 pounds of lasagna noodles and the noodles come in 2-pound packages.  How many packages does he need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know Tom has 10 pounds of beef.",
    "The recipe requires twice as many noodles as there is beef.",
    "Twice 10 pounds of beef would be 20 pounds of noodles.",
    "Tom already has 4 pounds of noodles.",
    "He needs a total of 20 pounds.",
    "So, 20 pounds needed minus 4 pounds he has equals 16 pounds more noodles needed.",
    "The noodle packages each contain 2 pounds.",
    "To find out how many packages he needs, I divide 16 pounds of noodles by 2 pounds per package.",
    "16 divided by 2 is 8."

  "solution": "8"
