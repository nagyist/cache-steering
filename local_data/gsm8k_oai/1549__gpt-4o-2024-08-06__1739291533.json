  "query": "Melanie does her weekly shopping at the farmer's market.  She starts with an 8-ounce wheel of brie cheese.  Next is a 1 pound loaf of bread.  She grabs a pound of tomatoes and 2 pounds of zucchini.  After that, she grabs 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts and treats herself to 8 ounces of fresh raspberries and 8 ounces of fresh blueberries.  How many pounds of food does she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "I begin by converting everything into the same unit, pounds, since some items are in ounces and some are in pounds.",
    "The brie cheese is 8 ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound.",
    "So, the wheel of brie cheese is 8/16 = 0.5 pounds.",
    "The loaf of bread is already given in pounds, which is 1 pound.",
    "The tomatoes are also given as 1 pound.",
    "The zucchini is 2 pounds.",
    "The chicken breasts are 1 1/2 pounds, which is 1.5 pounds.",
    "The raspberries are 8 ounces. Converting to pounds: 8/16 = 0.5 pounds.",
    "The blueberries are also 8 ounces. Converting to pounds: 8/16 = 0.5 pounds.",
    "Now I add all these weights together in pounds: 0.5 (brie) + 1 (bread) + 1 (tomatoes) + 2 (zucchini) + 1.5 (chicken) + 0.5 (raspberries) + 0.5 (blueberries).",
    "0.5 + 1 = 1.5",
    "1.5 + 1 = 2.5",
    "2.5 + 2 = 4.5",
    "4.5 + 1.5 = 6",
    "6 + 0.5 = 6.5",
    "6.5 + 0.5 = 7"
  ],
  "solution": "7"
