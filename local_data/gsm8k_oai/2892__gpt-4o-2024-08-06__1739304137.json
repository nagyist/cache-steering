  "query": "John travels 150 miles in 2 hours.  The speed limit is 60 mph.  How many mph above the speed limit was he driving?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate John's average speed during his travel.",
    "He traveled 150 miles in 2 hours.",
    "To find his speed, I divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 2 hours.",
    "150 divided by 2 is 75.",
    "John was driving at an average speed of 75 mph.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much above the speed limit he was driving.",
    "The speed limit is 60 mph.",
    "I subtract the speed limit from John's average speed: 75 mph - 60 mph.",
    "75 minus 60 equals 15."

  "solution": "15"
