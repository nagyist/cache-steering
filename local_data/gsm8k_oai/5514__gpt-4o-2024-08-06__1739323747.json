  "query": "A cooler is filled with 24 cans of cherry soda and orange pop. If there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda, how many cherry sodas are there?",
  "steps": [
    "I am given that the total number of cans is 24.",
    "I am also given that there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda.",
    "Let me denote the number of cherry soda cans as C.",
    "Then the number of orange pop cans would be 2C because there are twice as many.",
    "The sum of the cans of cherry soda and orange pop equals the total number of cans.",
    "This can be expressed as C (cherry soda) + 2C (orange pop) = 24.",
    "Simplify the equation: C + 2C = 3C.",
    "So, 3C = 24.",
    "To find C, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "3C / 3 = 24 / 3",
    "C = 8"
  ],
  "solution": "8"
