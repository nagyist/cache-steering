  "steps": [
    "Tom charges $100 per day for the first 5 days.",
    "For the first 5 days, the cost is 5 days * $100 per day.",
    "5 days * $100 per day = $500.",
    "Tom charges $60 per day for every day after the first 5 days.",
    "He searches for an additional 5 days after the initial 5 days, as he searched for 10 days in total.",
    "For these additional 5 days, the cost is 5 days * $60 per day.",
    "5 days * $60 per day = $300.",
    "Now, add the cost for the first 5 days to the cost of the additional 5 days.",
    "$500 (first 5 days) + $300 (additional 5 days) = $800."
