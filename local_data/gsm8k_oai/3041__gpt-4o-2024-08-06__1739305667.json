  "query": "On a three-day trip, Wendy drove 125 miles on the first day, and 223 miles on the second day. How many miles did she drive on the third day, if the total miles that Wendy drove for the trip is 493 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles Wendy drove on the first two days combined.",
    "Wendy drove 125 miles on the first day and 223 miles on the second day.",
    "To find the total miles driven in the first two days, I will add the miles from the first day and the second day: 125 + 223.",
    "Calculating that gives 348 miles driven in the first two days.",
    "Now, I know the total miles driven for the trip is 493.",
    "To find out how many miles Wendy drove on the third day, I subtract the miles driven on the first two days from the total miles: 493 - 348.",
    "Calculating that gives 145 miles driven on the third day."

  "solution": "145"
