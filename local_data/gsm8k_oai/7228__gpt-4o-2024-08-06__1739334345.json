  "query": "If Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year, and this year he doubles that number while Matt reads only 50% more, how many books does Pete read across both years if Matt read 75 books in his second year?",
  "steps": [
    "Matt read 75 books this year, which is the second year.",
    "This year, Matt reads 50% more than he did last year.",
    "If Matt read 75 books this year, which is 150% of what he read last year, let's calculate what he read last year.",
    "Let's denote the number of books Matt read last year as M. Since he read 75 books this year, which is 1.5 times last year's books, we have 1.5 * M = 75.",
    "To find M, divide both sides by 1.5: M = 75 / 1.5.",
    "Calculate 75 / 1.5, which equals 50.",
    "So Matt read 50 books last year.",
    "Pete read twice as many books as Matt last year.",
    "So Pete read 2 * 50 = 100 books last year.",
    "This year, Pete doubles the number of books he read compared to last year.",
    "So this year, Pete reads 2 * 100 = 200 books.",
    "To find the total number of books Pete read across both years, add the books from last year and this year.",
    "100 (last year) + 200 (this year) = 300 books."

  "solution": "300"
