  "query": "Jackson wants to improve his endurance running. His goal is to start by running 3 miles a day the first week, then spend the next four weeks running one additional mile/day each week. How many miles is Jackson running each day at the end of this exercise program?",
  "steps": [
    "Jackson starts by running 3 miles a day during the first week.",
    "In the second week, he will run one additional mile each day. So, he will run 3 + 1 = 4 miles a day.",
    "In the third week, he increases his daily run by one more mile. He will run 4 + 1 = 5 miles a day.",
    "In the fourth week, he will add another mile to his daily run. Therefore, he will run 5 + 1 = 6 miles a day.",
    "In the fifth and final week, Jackson will again add one more mile. His daily running distance will be 6 + 1 = 7 miles."

  "solution": "7"
