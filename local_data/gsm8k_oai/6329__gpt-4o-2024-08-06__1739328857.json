  "query": "The teachers divided the group of students into 3 groups of 8. But 2 students left early. How many remain?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining the initial total number of students.",
    "The problem states there are 3 groups of 8.",
    "Multiply the number of groups by the number of students in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.",
    "Next, account for the students who left early.",
    "2 students left, so subtract 2 from the total.",
    "24 - 2 = 22"
