  "query": "Kelly has 8 chickens that lay 3 eggs each per day. If Kelly sells these eggs for $5 a dozen. How much money will she make in 4 weeks if she sells all her eggs?",
  "steps": [
    "Kelly has 8 chickens.",
    "Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day.",
    "To find out how many eggs are laid per day by all the chickens, multiply the number of chickens by the number of eggs each lays: 8 chickens * 3 eggs = 24 eggs per day.",
    "Kelly collects 24 eggs per day.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "In one week, Kelly will collect 24 eggs/day * 7 days = 168 eggs.",
    "We need to calculate the number of eggs collected in 4 weeks.",
    "Multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the total for 4 weeks: 168 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 672 eggs.",
    "Eggs are sold by the dozen, which means 12 eggs per dozen.",
    "Divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozen eggs Kelly has: 672 eggs \u00f7 12 eggs/dozen = 56 dozen eggs.",
    "Kelly sells each dozen of eggs for $5.",
    "Multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen: 56 dozen * $5/dozen = $280."
  ],
  "solution": "280"
