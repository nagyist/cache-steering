  "query": "Janet is getting paid to moderate social media posts. She gets paid 25 cents per post she checks. If it takes her 10 seconds to check a post, how much does she earn per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "Janet earns 25 cents per post.",
    "It takes her 10 seconds to check one post.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "Therefore, there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.",
    "If she spends 10 seconds per post, then in one hour she can check 3600 / 10 posts.",
    "3600 / 10 = 360 posts per hour.",
    "She gets paid 25 cents per post, so for 360 posts, she earns 360 x 25 cents.",
    "360 x 25 = 9000 cents.",
    "There are 100 cents in a dollar.",
    "So, 9000 cents is equivalent to 9000 / 100 dollars.",
    "9000 / 100 = 90 dollars."

  "solution": "90"
