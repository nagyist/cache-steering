  "query": "James' keyboard is missing 1/7 of the consonants and two vowels. How many keys are missing in total? (Remember there are 5 vowels and 21 consonants in the alphabet.)",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. James' keyboard is missing keys, specifically some consonants and vowels.",
    "There are 21 consonants in the alphabet.",
    "The problem states that 1/7 of the consonants are missing.",
    "To find out how many consonant keys are missing, I need to calculate 1/7 of 21 consonants.",
    "1/7 of 21 is calculated by dividing 21 by 7, which equals 3.",
    "So, 3 consonant keys are missing.",
    "Now, I need to account for the vowels. There are 5 vowels in the alphabet.",
    "The problem states that James' keyboard is also missing two vowels.",
    "Therefore, 2 vowel keys are missing.",
    "To find the total number of missing keys, I need to add the missing consonant keys to the missing vowel keys.",
    "Adding 3 missing consonant keys and 2 missing vowel keys gives me 5 missing keys in total."
