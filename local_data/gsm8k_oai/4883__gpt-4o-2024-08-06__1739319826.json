  "query": "Tim has to go to the doctor for a sporting injury.  He gets an MRI which costs $1200.  The doctor needs to examine it for 30 minutes and charges $300 per hour.  There is also a $150 fee just for being seen.  Insurance covered 80% how much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "Tim's MRI costs $1200.",
    "The doctor examines the MRI for 30 minutes. The doctor charges $300 per hour.",
    "Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge for 30 minutes is $300 * 0.5 = $150.",
    "There is also a $150 fee just for being seen.",
    "To find the total cost before insurance, add the cost of the MRI, the doctor's examination fee, and the being seen fee: $1200 + $150 + $150.",
    "$1200 + $150 + $150 = $1500. So, the total cost before insurance is $1500.",
    "Insurance covers 80% of the total cost, so calculate 80% of $1500.",
    "80% of $1500 is 0.8 * $1500 = $1200.",
    "Subtract the insurance coverage from the total cost to find how much Tim pays: $1500 - $1200.",
    "$1500 - $1200 = $300. Thus, Tim pays $300."
