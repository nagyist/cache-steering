  "query": "Casey takes 6 hours to complete a marathon race, while Zendaya takes 1/3 times longer to cover the same distance. What is the average time the two take to complete to race?",
  "steps": [
    "Casey takes 6 hours to complete the marathon race.",
    "I need to find out how long Zendaya takes. Zendaya takes 1/3 times longer than Casey.",
    "To calculate how much longer Zendaya takes, I need to multiply Casey's time by 1/3.",
    "Zendaya takes 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours longer than Casey.",
    "So, Zendaya's time is 6 hours (Casey's time) + 2 hours = 8 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find the average time the two take to complete the race. The formula for average time is (Casey's time + Zendaya's time) / 2.",
    "Substituting the times into the formula, I have (6 hours + 8 hours) / 2 = 14 hours / 2.",
    "Calculating this gives 14 / 2 = 7 hours."
