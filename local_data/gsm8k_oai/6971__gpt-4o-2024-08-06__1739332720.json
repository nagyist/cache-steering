  "query": "A bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards. There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. If there are 200 hockey cards in the bag, how many cards are there altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "I see that there are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards.",
    "I also notice that the number of football cards is 4 times the number of hockey cards.",
    "I know there are 200 hockey cards given in the problem.",
    "I can calculate the number of football cards by multiplying the number of hockey cards by 4.",
    "So, the number of football cards equals 4 * 200.",
    "Calculating that gives me 800 football cards.",
    "Now, to find the number of baseball cards, I'll take the number of football cards and subtract 50.",
    "So, I calculate 800 - 50.",
    "This results in 750 baseball cards.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of cards in the bag, which is the sum of baseball, football, and hockey cards.",
    "Adding together 200 hockey cards, 800 football cards, and 750 baseball cards gives me the total.",
    "So, I calculate 200 + 800 + 750.",
    "This sum equals 1750 cards."
