  "query": "The GooGoo brand of clothing manufactures two types of shirts, one with 3 buttons and the other with 5 buttons.  A large department store ordered GooGoo to manufacture 200 of each type of shirt.  How many buttons will the GooGoo brand use to manufacturer all of the shirts for this order?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem involves two types of shirts, one with 3 buttons and another with 5 buttons.",
    "The department store ordered 200 shirts of each type.",
    "First, calculate the total number of 3-button shirts ordered.",
    "There are 200 shirts with 3 buttons each.",
    "So, the total number of buttons needed for the 3-button shirts is 200 shirts * 3 buttons/shirt.",
    "200 * 3 = 600",
    "Next, calculate the total number of 5-button shirts ordered.",
    "There are 200 shirts with 5 buttons each.",
    "So, the total number of buttons needed for the 5-button shirts is 200 shirts * 5 buttons/shirt.",
    "200 * 5 = 1000",
    "Finally, add the buttons needed for both types of shirts to get the total number of buttons used.",
    "Total buttons = 600 (from 3-button shirts) + 1000 (from 5-button shirts)",
    "600 + 1000 = 1600"
  ],
  "solution": "1600"
