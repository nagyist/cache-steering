  "query": "Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Francis spent on muffins.",
    "Francis had 2 muffins, and each muffin costs $2.",
    "2 muffins at $2 each means Francis spent 2 * $2 = $4 on muffins.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Francis spent on fruit cups.",
    "Francis had 2 fruit cups, and each fruit cup costs $3.",
    "2 fruit cups at $3 each means Francis spent 2 * $3 = $6 on fruit cups.",
    "I now add the amount spent by Francis on muffins and fruit cups to get his total.",
    "Francis's total is $4 (muffins) + $6 (fruit cups) = $10.",
    "I will now calculate how much Kiera spent on muffins.",
    "Kiera had 2 muffins, and each muffin costs $2.",
    "2 muffins at $2 each means Kiera spent 2 * $2 = $4 on muffins.",
    "Now, I calculate how much Kiera spent on fruit cups.",
    "Kiera had 1 fruit cup, and each fruit cup costs $3.",
    "1 fruit cup at $3 means Kiera spent 1 * $3 = $3 on fruit cups.",
    "I add the amount spent by Kiera on muffins and fruit cups to get her total.",
    "Kiera's total is $4 (muffins) + $3 (fruit cups) = $7.",
    "To find the total cost of their breakfast, I add Francis's total and Kiera's total.",
    "The total cost is $10 (Francis) + $7 (Kiera) = $17."
