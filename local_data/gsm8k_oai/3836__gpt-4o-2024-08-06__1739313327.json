  "query": "Five shirts together cost $85. Of the 5 shirts, there are 3 shirts that cost $15 each. If the remaining shirts are each equal in value, what is the cost, in dollars, of one of the remaining shirts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total cost of the 5 shirts, which is given as $85.",
    "Next, I note that 3 shirts cost $15 each.",
    "Calculate the total cost of these 3 shirts. Multiply 3 shirts by $15.",
    "3 shirts x $15 = $45",
    "Subtract the cost of the 3 shirts from the total cost of all 5 shirts to find the cost of the remaining 2 shirts.",
    "$85 total - $45 for 3 shirts = $40",
    "Now, we know that the remaining cost of $40 is for the 2 shirts.",
    "The problem states that the remaining shirts are equal in value.",
    "Thus, divide $40 by 2 to find the cost of one shirt.",
    "$40 / 2 = $20"

  "solution": "20"
