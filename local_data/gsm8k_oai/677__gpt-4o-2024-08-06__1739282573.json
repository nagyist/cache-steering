  "query": "Mr. Caiden wants to do repairs to his house and requires 300 feet of metal roofing to do this. If each foot of roofing costs $8, and the supplier of the metal roofing brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free, how much money is Mr. Caiden required to pay for the remaining metal roofing?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much metal roofing Mr. Caiden needs in total.",
    "According to the question, Mr. Caiden requires 300 feet of metal roofing for his house repairs.",
    "Next, I need to account for the metal roofing that the supplier provides for free.",
    "The supplier brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free.",
    "To find out how much more metal roofing Mr. Caiden needs to purchase, I subtract the free metal roofing from the total amount required: 300 feet - 250 feet = 50 feet.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of the remaining 50 feet of metal roofing that Mr. Caiden needs to purchase.",
    "Each foot of roofing costs $8.",
    "I multiply the number of feet needed by the cost per foot: 50 feet * $8 per foot = $400."
