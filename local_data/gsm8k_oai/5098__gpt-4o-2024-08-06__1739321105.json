  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many teslas Sam has. Sam has half the number of teslas as Chris.",
    "Chris has 6 teslas, so Sam has half of 6.",
    "Half of 6 is 3, so Sam has 3 teslas.",
    "Now I need to find out how many teslas Elon has. Elon has 10 more teslas than Sam.",
    "Sam has 3 teslas, and 10 more than 3 is calculated as 3 + 10.",
    "3 + 10 equals 13."
