  "query": "Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many total miles the dogs walk in a day.",
    "The total distance the dogs walk is given as 70 miles per week.",
    "Since there are 7 days in a week, I divide 70 miles by 7 to find the average daily distance both dogs walk.",
    "70 miles per week divided by 7 days equals 10 miles per day.",
    "Now, I know the two dogs together walk 10 miles per day on average.",
    "I'm told that the first dog walks 2 miles a day on average.",
    "I need to find out how many miles a day the second dog walks.",
    "The total daily distance covered by both dogs is 10 miles.",
    "Since the first dog walks 2 miles a day, I subtract this from the total daily distance.",
    "10 miles minus 2 miles equals 8 miles.",
    "This means the second dog averages 8 miles a day."

  "solution": "8"
