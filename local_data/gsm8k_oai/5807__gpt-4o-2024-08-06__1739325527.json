  "query": "It takes Emmalyn and her research team, the Polar Bears, 30 minutes to fully navigate around a volcanic island. On Saturday, they decided to start off by rounding the island once. They then re-grouped and planned out the rest of their weekend research schedule. They completed 10 more round that day and then went home. When they came on Sunday, they were able to complete 15 rounds. Calculate the total time, in minutes, the Polar Bears spent circling the island over that weekend.",
  "steps": [
    "The initial step is to identify the number of rounds they completed on Saturday.",
    "On Saturday, they did 1 initial round and then 10 more rounds.",
    "This means they completed 1 + 10 = 11 rounds on Saturday.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many rounds were completed on Sunday.",
    "The problem states they completed 15 rounds on Sunday.",
    "Next, I will add the rounds from Saturday and Sunday to find the total number of rounds over the weekend.",
    "11 rounds (Saturday) + 15 rounds (Sunday) = 26 rounds in total.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total time spent circling the island.",
    "Each round takes 30 minutes.",
    "Multiply the total number of rounds by the time each round takes: 26 rounds \u00d7 30 minutes/round.",
    "26 \u00d7 30 = 780"
  ],
  "solution": "780"
