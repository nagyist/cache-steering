  "query": "Julie wants to give her favorite cousin a $2345 mountain bike for his birthday. So far, she has saved $1500. Since the birthday is still a few weeks away, Julie has time to save even more. She plans on mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 of her neighbors\u2019 dogs. She is paid $20 for each lawn, 40 cents per newspaper, and $15 per dog. After purchasing the bike, how much money will Julie have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Julie has saved $1500 so far.",
    "She plans to mow 20 lawns. She earns $20 for each lawn.",
    "For mowing lawns, she will earn 20 lawns * $20/lawn = $400.",
    "She plans to deliver 600 newspapers. She earns 40 cents per newspaper.",
    "To convert 40 cents to dollars, we use 0.40 dollars per newspaper.",
    "For delivering newspapers, she will earn 600 newspapers * $0.40/newspaper = $240.",
    "She plans to walk 24 dogs. She earns $15 per dog.",
    "For walking dogs, she will earn 24 dogs * $15/dog = $360.",
    "Now, I'll calculate her total earnings from all three jobs.",
    "Total earned from mowing lawns = $400.",
    "Total earned from delivering newspapers = $240.",
    "Total earned from walking dogs = $360.",
    "Add the earnings: $400 + $240 + $360 = $1000.",
    "Add the $1000 to Julie's existing savings of $1500.",
    "Total savings = $1500 + $1000 = $2500.",
    "The mountain bike costs $2345.",
    "To find out how much money Julie will have after buying the bike, subtract the cost of the bike from her total savings.",
    "$2500 total savings - $2345 cost of bike = $155."

  "solution": "155"
