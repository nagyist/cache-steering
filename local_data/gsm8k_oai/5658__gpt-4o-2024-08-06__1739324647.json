  "query": "Dilan, Martha, Phillip, and Veronica went to the park together to have some fun. They all had a different number of marbles: Dilan had 14 marbles, Martha had 20 marbles, Phillip had 19 marbles and finally, Veronica had only 7 marbles. They wanted to redistribute the marbles so they each had an equal number. How many marbles did each friend have at the end of the day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of marbles altogether.",
    "Dilan has 14 marbles, Martha has 20 marbles, Phillip has 19 marbles, and Veronica has 7 marbles.",
    "I will add these numbers together. 14 + 20 + 19 + 7 = 60.",
    "The total number of marbles is 60.",
    "There are 4 friends who want to share the marbles equally.",
    "To find out how many marbles each friend should have, I need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of friends.",
    "60 divided by 4 equals 15.",
    "Each friend should have 15 marbles after redistributing."

  "solution": "15"
