  "query": "Ronald is rolling a die and won't stop rolling until the average of all his rolls is a 3. He rolls a 1, a 3, a 2, a 4, a 3, a 5, a 3, a 4, a 4 and a 2. What does he need to roll on the next roll to be able to stop?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to list all the rolls Ronald has already made: 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4, 4, and 2.",
    "Next, I will calculate the sum of these rolls.",
    "Adding up the numbers: 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 31.",
    "I count the number of rolls he made. There are 10 rolls in total.",
    "The current average of his rolls is calculated by dividing the sum of the rolls by the number of rolls.",
    "The current average is 31 divided by 10, which is 3.1.",
    "He wants the average to be exactly 3 in order to stop.",
    "Suppose he rolls x in his next roll. The new sum would be 31 + x and the total number of rolls would be 11.",
    "We set up the equation for the average to be 3: (31 + x) / 11 = 3.",
    "Multiplying both sides by 11 to eliminate the denominator, we get: 31 + x = 33.",
    "Solving for x, we subtract 31 from both sides to get: x = 33 - 31.",
    "x = 2."
