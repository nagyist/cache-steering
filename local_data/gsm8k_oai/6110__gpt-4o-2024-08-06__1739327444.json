  "query": "Ginger ended up working 8 hours outside in her garden.  She kept a water bottle with her that held 2 cups of water.  She drank a full bottle of every hour she was outside.  She also poured an additional 5 bottles of water over the new plants she planted.  How many cups of water did Ginger drink/use that day?",
  "steps": [
    "Ginger worked outside for 8 hours in total.",
    "She drank a full water bottle every hour she was outside.",
    "The water bottle holds 2 cups of water.",
    "In 8 hours, she drank 8 bottles.",
    "Since each bottle is 2 cups, she drank 8 bottles * 2 cups/bottle = 16 cups of water.",
    "She also poured an additional 5 bottles of water over the new plants.",
    "The 5 bottles for the plants are 5 bottles * 2 cups/bottle = 10 cups of water.",
    "To find the total water used, add the water she drank and the water for the plants: 16 cups + 10 cups.",
    "That totals to 26 cups of water."
