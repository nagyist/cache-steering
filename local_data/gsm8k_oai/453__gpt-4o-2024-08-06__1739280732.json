  "query": "Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton were collecting shells on the beach. Jillian collected 29, Savannah collected 17, and Clayton collected 8. They decided that they wanted to give the shells to two of their friends who had just arrived. They put their shells together and distributed them evenly to each friend. How many shells did each friend get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton.",
    "Jillian collected 29 shells.",
    "Savannah collected 17 shells.",
    "Clayton collected 8 shells.",
    "To find the total number of shells, I need to add these numbers together: 29 + 17 + 8.",
    "First, I add 29 and 17, which equals 46.",
    "Then I add 46 and 8, which equals 54.",
    "The total number of shells collected is 54.",
    "They decided to distribute these shells evenly between their two friends.",
    "I need to divide the total number of shells by the number of friends. So, 54 divided by 2.",
    "54 divided by 2 equals 27."
