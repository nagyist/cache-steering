  "query": "Alicia has to buy some books for the new school year. She buys 2 math books, 3 art books, and 6 science books, for a total of $30. If both the math and science books cost $3 each, what was the cost of each art book?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the cost of the math books. She buys 2 math books at $3 each.",
    "The cost of 2 math books is 2 * $3 = $6.",
    "Next, calculate the cost of the science books. She buys 6 science books at $3 each.",
    "The cost of 6 science books is 6 * $3 = $18.",
    "Now, calculate the combined cost of the math and science books.",
    "The total cost of the math and science books is $6 + $18 = $24.",
    "Subtract the total cost of the math and science books from the overall total to find the cost of the art books.",
    "The overall total is $30, so the total cost of the art books is $30 - $24 = $6.",
    "Alicia buys 3 art books.",
    "Divide the total cost of the art books by the number of art books to find the cost per art book.",
    "The cost per art book is $6 / 3 = $2."
