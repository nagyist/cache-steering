  "query": "Miss Adamson has four classes with 20 students each. She makes a study guide for her class and uses 5 sheets of paper per student. How many sheets of paper will she use for all of her students?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the total number of students Miss Adamson has.",
    "Miss Adamson has four classes, each with 20 students.",
    "To find the total number of students, I multiply 4 classes by 20 students per class.",
    "4 classes * 20 students per class = 80 students.",
    "Next, I consider how many sheets of paper each student will use.",
    "Each student uses 5 sheets of paper.",
    "To find the total number of sheets of paper used, I multiply the total number of students by the number of sheets each student uses.",
    "80 students * 5 sheets per student = 400 sheets of paper."
