  "query": "Jina likes to collect mascots. She has 5 teddies, 3 times more bunnies, and a koala bear. Her mom decided to give her two additional teddies for every bunny she has. How many mascots Jina has in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of bunnies Jina has.",
    "Jina has 5 teddies.",
    "She has 3 times more bunnies than teddies.",
    "So, the number of bunnies is 5 times 3, which equals 15.",
    "Jina has 1 koala bear.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the additional teddies Jina will receive.",
    "Her mom gives her 2 more teddies for every bunny she has.",
    "Jina has 15 bunnies, so she receives 2 teddies per bunny.",
    "This means she will receive 15 times 2, which equals 30 additional teddies.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of mascots.",
    "First, add the original teddies: 5.",
    "Add the bunnies: 15.",
    "Add the koala bear: 1.",
    "Add the additional teddies: 30.",
    "Total mascots are 5 + 15 + 1 + 30.",
    "Perform the calculation: 5 + 15 + 1 + 30 = 51."
