  "query": "At its current growth rate, a certain plant will be 80 feet tall after a year. If the plant grows at the same rate every month and is currently 20 feet tall, what's its monthly growth rate in feet?",
  "steps": [
    "The plant's current height is 20 feet.",
    "The plant is expected to be 80 feet tall after a year.",
    "To find out how much the plant grows in one year, I need to subtract its current height from its future height.",
    "80 feet (future height) - 20 feet (current height) = 60 feet of growth in one year.",
    "The total growth over the year is 60 feet.",
    "To find the monthly growth rate, I need to divide the total yearly growth by the number of months in a year.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "60 feet of growth / 12 months = 5 feet per month."

  "solution": "5"
