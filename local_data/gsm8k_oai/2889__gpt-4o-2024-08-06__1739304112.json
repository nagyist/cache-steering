  "query": "Sean and Sierra invited 200 guests to their wedding.  If 83% of the guests RSVP with a Yes response and 9% of the guests RSVP with a No response, how many guests did not respond at all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem statement: Sean and Sierra invited 200 guests to their wedding.",
    "Of these 200 guests, 83% RSVP with a Yes response.",
    "Additionally, 9% RSVP with a No response.",
    "To solve this, I need to determine the number of guests who responded with Yes and No, and then subtract these from the total guests to find those who did not respond at all.",
    "First, calculate 83% of 200 guests to find out how many RSVP'd Yes.",
    "83% of 200 is calculated as (83/100) * 200 = 166.",
    "Next, calculate 9% of 200 guests to find out how many RSVP'd No.",
    "9% of 200 is calculated as (9/100) * 200 = 18.",
    "Now, I will add the number of guests who responded with Yes and No.",
    "166 (Yes) + 18 (No) = 184 guests who responded.",
    "Subtract the number of guests who responded from the total number of guests invited to find those who didn't respond.",
    "200 total guests - 184 guests who responded = 16 guests who did not respond at all."
