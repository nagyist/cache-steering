  "query": "In preparation for his mountain climbing, Arvin wants to run a total of 20 kilometers in a week. On the first day, he ran 2 kilometers. On each subsequent day, he increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. If he runs for 5 days a week, how many kilometers did he run on the 5th day?",
  "steps": [
    "Arvin runs for 5 days and starts with 2 kilometers on the first day.",
    "On the first day, Arvin ran 2 kilometers.",
    "On the second day, he increases the distance by 1 kilometer, so he runs 2 + 1 = 3 kilometers.",
    "On the third day, he again increases the distance by 1 kilometer, so he runs 3 + 1 = 4 kilometers.",
    "On the fourth day, he increases the distance by 1 kilometer, so he runs 4 + 1 = 5 kilometers.",
    "On the fifth day, he increases the distance by 1 kilometer, so he runs 5 + 1 = 6 kilometers."
