  "query": "Ben's new car cost twice as much as his old car. He sold his old car for $1800 and used that to pay off some of the cost of his new car. He still owes another $2000 on his new car. How much did his old car cost, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Ben sold his old car for $1800.",
    "He used this $1800 toward the cost of his new car.",
    "He still owes $2000 on his new car.",
    "The amount he still owes combined with the amount he used from the old car sale makes up the total amount he paid for the new car. So, $1800 + $2000 = $3800.",
    "The new car cost twice as much as his old car.",
    "Let the cost of the old car be X.",
    "The new car cost, which is $3800, is twice the cost of the old car, so 2X = $3800.",
    "To find the cost of the old car, divide both sides by 2: X = $3800 / 2.",
    "Calculate X: X = $1900."

  "solution": "1900"
