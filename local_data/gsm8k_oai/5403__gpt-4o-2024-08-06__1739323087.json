  "query": "Brody\u2019s calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery. Brody has used three quarters of its battery up, and he is about to take a two-hour math exam that will require his calculator the whole time. How many hours of battery will Brody\u2019s calculator have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours of battery life are in a full battery.",
    "The calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much battery Brody has already used.",
    "Brody has used three quarters of the battery.",
    "To find out how many hours this represents, I calculate three quarters of 60 hours.",
    "Three quarters of 60 is calculated as (3/4) * 60.",
    "(3/4) * 60 = 45 hours.",
    "Brody has used 45 hours of battery life.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much battery Brody has left.",
    "Since the full battery is 60 hours and Brody has used 45 hours, I subtract 45 from 60.",
    "60 - 45 = 15 hours remaining.",
    "Brody\u2019s calculator has 15 hours of battery left.",
    "Brody is about to take a two-hour math exam.",
    "I need to check if the remaining battery is sufficient for the exam.",
    "The exam requires 2 hours, and Brody has 15 hours of battery left.",
    "15 hours is more than enough for a 2-hour exam.",
    "To find out how much battery Brody will have left after the exam, I subtract 2 hours from the remaining battery.",
    "15 - 2 = 13 hours."
