  "query": "Kevin's fish tank was leaking slowly at a rate of 1.5 ounces per hour.  He planned to go to the fish tank store later that day to get a new tank, but it may be as long as 12 hours before he can return home with the new tank.  Therefore, to collect the leaking fluid over that time, he placed a bucket underneath the tank that could hold twice the amount of fluid that would leak over 12 hours.  What size bucket, in ounces, did he use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much fluid leaks from the tank in one hour.",
    "The tank leaks at a rate of 1.5 ounces per hour.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much fluid will leak in 12 hours.",
    "I multiply the leakage rate by the duration: 1.5 ounces/hour * 12 hours.",
    "1.5 ounces/hour * 12 hours = 18 ounces.",
    "This calculation shows that 18 ounces of fluid will leak in 12 hours.",
    "Kevin's bucket needs to hold twice this amount.",
    "Twice 18 ounces is 18 ounces * 2.",
    "18 ounces * 2 = 36 ounces."
  ],
  "solution": "36"
