  "query": "Barry, Thomas and Emmanuel are to share a jar of 200 jelly beans. If Thomas takes 10%, and Barry and Emmanuel are to share the remainder in the ratio 4:5 respectively, how many jelly beans will Emmanuel get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many jelly beans Thomas takes. He takes 10% of the total jar.",
    "10% of 200 is calculated as \\(0.10 \\times 200\\).",
    "\\(0.10 \\times 200 = 20\\).",
    "So, Thomas takes 20 jelly beans.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many jelly beans are left for Barry and Emmanuel to share after Thomas takes his portion.",
    "200 total jelly beans minus the 20 jelly beans Thomas took equals 180 jelly beans.",
    "This means Barry and Emmanuel will share 180 jelly beans.",
    "Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio 4:5.",
    "The ratio 4:5 implies Barry gets 4 parts and Emmanuel gets 5 parts of the total ratio share.",
    "The total number of parts in the ratio is \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) parts.",
    "I need to calculate the value of one part by dividing the remaining jelly beans by the total number of parts in the ratio.",
    "\\(180 \\div 9 = 20\\).",
    "Each part of the ratio represents 20 jelly beans.",
    "Emmanuel gets 5 parts of the ratio.",
    "So, the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets is \\(5 \\times 20\\).",
    "\\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\)."
