  "query": "Javier is an Olympic javelin thrower.  In the last Olympics, he threw the javelin three times.  The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw.  If the sum of all three throws was 1050 meters, then how far, in meters, did he throw the javelin on his first throw?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the distance of the first throw be \\( x \\) meters.",
    "The condition states the first throw is twice as far as the second throw. So, the second throw must be \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) meters.",
    "The condition also states the first throw is half as far as the third throw. So, the third throw must be \\( 2x \\) meters.",
    "The sum of the three throws is 1050 meters. So, the equation is \\( x + \\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 1050 \\).",
    "Combine the terms: \\( x + \\frac{x}{2} + 2x = \\frac{2x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{4x}{2} = \\frac{7x}{2} \\).",
    "Set up the equation \\( \\frac{7x}{2} = 1050 \\).",
    "Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( 7x = 2100 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 7 to find \\( x \\): \\( x = 300 \\).",
    "Therefore, the distance of the first throw is 300 meters."
