  "query": "It will take Richard and Sarah 3 years to save enough for a down payment on a house at their current rates. If the house's downpayment is $108000, calculate the amount each person saves per month if they share the monthly savings.",
  "steps": [
    "They've agreed to share the monthly savings equally.",
    "The total down payment required for the house is $108,000.",
    "They are saving for this down payment over a period of 3 years.",
    "First, I need to convert the years into months because they are saving monthly.",
    "There are 12 months in a year, so over 3 years, that's 3 * 12 = 36 months.",
    "The total amount they need to save each month can be found by dividing the total down payment by the number of months.",
    "So, they need to save $108,000 / 36 months = $3,000 per month combined.",
    "Since Richard and Sarah share the monthly savings equally, each person saves half of this amount per month.",
    "So, each person's monthly savings would be $3,000 / 2 = $1,500."

  "solution": "1500"
