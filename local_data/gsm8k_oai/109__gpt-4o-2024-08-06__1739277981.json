  "query": "Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall ordered 100 chicken nuggets from a fast-food restaurant. Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa. How many did Alyssa eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate as \\( x \\).",
    "Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, so each of them ate \\( 2x \\) nuggets.",
    "We know that the total number of nuggets eaten by all three is 100.",
    "The equation representing this situation is \\( x + 2x + 2x = 100 \\).",
    "Let's simplify the equation: \\( x + 2x + 2x = 5x \\).",
    "We can write \\( 5x = 100 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 5.",
    "This gives us \\( x = 20 \\).",
    "I should double-check my work: if Alyssa ate 20 nuggets, then Keely and Kendall each ate \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\).",
    "Adding these up: \\( 20 + 40 + 40 = 100 \\), which is correct."
