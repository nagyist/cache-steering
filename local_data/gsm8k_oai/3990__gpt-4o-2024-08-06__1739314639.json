  "query": "A charity is delivering chicken and rice dinners to a shelter for the hungry. They have a hundred plates to deliver. The rice cost ten cents a plate and the chicken cost forty cents a plate. How many dollars did the charity spend on the food for the dinners?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of rice for each plate.",
    "The cost of rice per plate is ten cents.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of chicken for each plate.",
    "The cost of chicken per plate is forty cents.",
    "To calculate the total cost per plate, I add the cost of rice and chicken together.",
    "Ten cents plus forty cents equals fifty cents per plate.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for all one hundred plates.",
    "Fifty cents per plate times one hundred plates equals five thousand cents total.",
    "Now, I need to convert cents to dollars.",
    "There are one hundred cents in a dollar, so five thousand cents is equal to fifty dollars.",
    "Therefore, the charity spent fifty dollars in total on the food for the dinners."
