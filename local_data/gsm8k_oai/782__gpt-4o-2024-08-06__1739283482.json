  "query": "Melissa wants to make some dresses to sell at the upcoming festival. She has 56 square meters of fabric to make them. She knows that each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric and 3 hours to make. How many hours does she have to work?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dresses Melissa can make with the available fabric.",
    "She has 56 square meters of fabric.",
    "Each dress requires 4 square meters of fabric.",
    "To find out how many dresses she can make, I need to divide the total fabric by the fabric required per dress.",
    "56 divided by 4 equals 14.",
    "So, Melissa can make 14 dresses.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total hours she will need to work.",
    "Each dress takes 3 hours to make.",
    "If she makes 14 dresses, I multiply 14 by 3 to get the total hours.",
    "14 times 3 equals 42."
