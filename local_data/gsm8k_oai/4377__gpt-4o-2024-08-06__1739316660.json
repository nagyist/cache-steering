  "query": "Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy.  If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then how many pencils does Candy have?",
  "steps": [
    "Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb.",
    "Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils. So originally, Calen had 10 + 10 = 20 pencils.",
    "Since Calen had 20 pencils originally, and this was 5 more than Caleb, Caleb originally had 20 - 5 = 15 pencils.",
    "Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as Candy.",
    "Let the number of pencils Candy has be denoted by C.",
    "Twice the number of pencils Candy has is 2C.",
    "Caleb's number of pencils is 3 less than twice Candy's, so 2C - 3 = 15.",
    "I need to solve the equation 2C - 3 = 15 to find the number of pencils Candy has.",
    "Add 3 to both sides of the equation: 2C - 3 + 3 = 15 + 3, which simplifies to 2C = 18.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for C: 2C/2 = 18/2, which simplifies to C = 9."
