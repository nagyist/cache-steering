  "query": "The Jacksonville Walmart normally gets 120 customer complaints per day. That number increases by 1/3rd when they're short-staffed and this increases by another 20% when the self-checkout is broken. If the store was short-staffed and the self-checkout was broken for 3 days, how many complaints does the store get?",
  "steps": [
    "The normal number of complaints per day is 120.",
    "When the store is short-staffed, the complaints increase by 1/3rd.",
    "Calculate the increase when short-staffed: 120 * 1/3 = 40.",
    "Add the increase to the normal complaints: 120 + 40 = 160.",
    "When the self-checkout is broken, the complaints further increase by 20% on the already increased number.",
    "Calculate the 20% increase on 160 complaints: 160 * 0.20 = 32.",
    "Add this increase to the short-staffed complaints: 160 + 32 = 192.",
    "The store experiences 192 complaints per day when short-staffed and the self-checkout is broken.",
    "They experienced this scenario for 3 days.",
    "Multiply the daily complaints by the 3 days: 192 * 3.",
    "Calculate the total complaints over the 3 days: 192 * 3 = 576."
