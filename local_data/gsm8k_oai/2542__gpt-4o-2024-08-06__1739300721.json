  "query": "When the machine is cold, as it is in the first hour of production, it takes 6 minutes to produce each molded flower pot. Thereafter, once it is warm, it takes only 5 minutes to produce each pot. How many additional pots are produced in the last hour of the day, compared to the first?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pots are produced during the first hour.",
    "The machine takes 6 minutes to produce each pot during the first hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To find the number of pots produced, I divide 60 minutes by 6 minutes per pot.",
    "60 minutes \u00f7 6 minutes/pot = 10 pots",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pots are produced in the last hour when the machine is warm.",
    "When the machine is warm, it takes 5 minutes to produce each pot.",
    "I again have 60 minutes in the hour to use for calculation.",
    "To find the number of pots produced, I divide 60 minutes by 5 minutes per pot.",
    "60 minutes \u00f7 5 minutes/pot = 12 pots",
    "Now, I compare the number of pots produced in the last hour to the first hour.",
    "In the first hour, 10 pots were produced, and in the last hour, 12 pots were produced.",
    "I need to find the difference in the number of pots produced between the last hour and the first hour.",
    "12 pots (last hour) - 10 pots (first hour) = 2 additional pots"
