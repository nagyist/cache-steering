  "query": "John decides to get the vaccine for COVID.  He has to wait 20 minutes for the first dose.  The second dose has a wait time half as long.  How long was the total wait time?",
  "steps": [
    "John waits 20 minutes for the first dose.",
    "The wait time for the second dose is half of the first dose.",
    "Half of 20 minutes is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.",
    "The total wait time is the wait time for the first dose plus the wait time for the second dose.",
    "Therefore, the total wait time is 20 minutes + 10 minutes.",
    "20 + 10 equals 30 minutes."
  ],
  "solution": "30"
