  "query": "Carson leans over the railing at the zoo to get the perfect selfie and falls into the combined wombat and rhea enclosure.  There are 9 wombats and 3 rheas. If each wombat claws him 4 times and each rhea claws him once, how many times does he get clawed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many times Carson gets clawed by the wombats.",
    "There are 9 wombats in the enclosure.",
    "Each wombat claws Carson 4 times.",
    "To find out how many times the wombats claw Carson in total, I multiply the number of wombats by the number of times each one claws him: 9 wombats * 4 claws = 36 claws.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times Carson gets clawed by the rheas.",
    "There are 3 rheas in the enclosure.",
    "Each rhea claws Carson 1 time.",
    "To find out how many times the rheas claw Carson in total, I multiply the number of rheas by the number of times each one claws him: 3 rheas * 1 claw = 3 claws.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of claws from the wombats and the number of claws from the rheas to find the total number of times Carson gets clawed.",
    "36 claws (from wombats) + 3 claws (from rheas) = 39 total claws."

  "solution": "39"
