  "query": "Diane is playing poker with her friends and is not having very good luck. She starts with $100 and wins 5 hands for a total of $65 dollars to add to her $100. Emboldened, she begins betting bigger and riskier and ends up losing all her money and owing her friends $50. How much money did Diane lose in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Diane starts with $100.",
    "She wins $65 by winning 5 hands.",
    "Total money she has after winning these hands is $100 + $65.",
    "Calculate the total: $100 + $65 = $165.",
    "Diane then loses all this money.",
    "So, she loses $165 initially.",
    "In addition, she owes her friends $50.",
    "Total money lost or owed is $165 + $50.",
    "Calculate the total loss: $165 + $50 = $215."
