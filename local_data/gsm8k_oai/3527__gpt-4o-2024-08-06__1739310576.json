  "query": "Marsha works as a delivery driver for Amazon. She has to drive 10 miles to deliver her first package, 28 miles to deliver her second package, and half that long to deliver her third package. If she gets paid $104 for the day, how many dollars does she get paid per mile?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the distance Marsha drove for each delivery.",
    "The first delivery was 10 miles.",
    "The second delivery was 28 miles.",
    "The third delivery was half as long as the second delivery, which is 28 miles / 2 = 14 miles.",
    "Next, I will add all the distances together to find the total distance traveled.",
    "10 miles + 28 miles + 14 miles = 52 miles in total.",
    "Marsha gets paid $104 for driving these 52 miles.",
    "To find out how many dollars she gets paid per mile, I will divide the total pay by the total miles driven.",
    "$104 divided by 52 miles equals $2 per mile."

  "solution": "2"
