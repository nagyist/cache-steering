  "query": "George bought some food for his trip: a bottle of juice, a sandwich, and a bottle of milk. The sandwich was for $4, and the juice was two times more expensive. The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. How much did George pay for his food?",
  "steps": [
    "George bought a sandwich for $4.",
    "The juice was two times more expensive than the sandwich.",
    "Two times the cost of the sandwich ($4) is $8.",
    "Thus, the cost of the juice is $8.",
    "Now, we calculate the total cost of the sandwich and the juice together.",
    "The total cost of the sandwich and juice is $4 + $8 = $12.",
    "The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice.",
    "First, I need to find 75% of $12.",
    "75% of $12 is 0.75 * $12 = $9.",
    "Now, I add up the costs of the sandwich, juice, and milk to find the total cost.",
    "The total cost is $4 (sandwich) + $8 (juice) + $9 (milk) = $21."
