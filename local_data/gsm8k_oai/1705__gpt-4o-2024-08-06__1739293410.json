  "query": "For every one dozen flowers bought, a customer gets 2 free flowers. If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many flowers are in one dozen. One dozen equals 12 flowers.",
    "Maria wants to buy 3 dozens of flowers. To find out how many flowers this is, I multiply 3 by 12.",
    "3 dozen flowers is equal to 3 x 12, which is 36 flowers.",
    "For every one dozen flowers bought, Maria gets 2 additional free flowers. I need to calculate how many free flowers she would receive for 3 dozens.",
    "Since she gets 2 free flowers for each dozen, for 3 dozens she would receive 3 x 2 free flowers.",
    "3 x 2 equals 6, so Maria gets 6 free flowers in total.",
    "To find the total number of flowers Maria will have, I need to add the free flowers to the purchased flowers.",
    "Maria has 36 purchased flowers plus 6 free flowers.",
    "36 + 6 equals 42."

  "solution": "42"
