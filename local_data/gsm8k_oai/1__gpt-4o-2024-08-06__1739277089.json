  "query": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the minutes Weng worked into hours because her pay rate is in dollars per hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour.",
    "Calculate 50/60 to find out how many hours Weng worked: 50/60 = 5/6 of an hour.",
    "Weng earns $12 per hour.",
    "To find out how much she earned, multiply the number of hours she worked by her hourly wage: (5/6) * $12.",
    "Now, calculate (5/6) * $12. First calculate 12 * 5 = 60.",
    "Then calculate 60 divided by 6, which equals 10.",
    "So, Weng earned $10."

  "solution": "10"
