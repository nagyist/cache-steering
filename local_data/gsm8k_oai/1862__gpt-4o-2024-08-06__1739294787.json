  "query": "Jason bought 4 dozen cupcakes. He plans to give 3 cupcakes each to his cousins. How many cousins does Jason have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cupcakes Jason bought.",
    "A dozen is equal to 12 items.",
    "Jason bought 4 dozen cupcakes.",
    "To find the total number of cupcakes, multiply 4 dozen by 12.",
    "4 dozen = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 cupcakes.",
    "Next, Jason plans to give 3 cupcakes to each of his cousins.",
    "To find out how many cousins Jason can give 3 cupcakes each, divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each cousin gets.",
    "I need to divide 48 by 3.",
    "48 divided by 3 equals 16.",
    "Jason has 16 cousins."
