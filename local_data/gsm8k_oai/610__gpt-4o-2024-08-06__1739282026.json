  "query": "68% of all pies are eaten with forks. If there are 2000 pies of all kinds, how many of the pies are not eaten with forks?",
  "steps": [
    "I understand the problem is about calculating the number of pies not eaten with forks.",
    "First, I need to calculate the number of pies that are eaten with forks.",
    "68% of the pies are eaten with forks.",
    "68% of 2000 pies can be calculated as (68/100) * 2000.",
    "I will calculate 68% of 2000 first.",
    "68/100 = 0.68.",
    "Now, multiply 0.68 by 2000 to find the number of pies eaten with forks.",
    "0.68 * 2000 = 1360.",
    "Now I know 1360 pies are eaten with forks.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks.",
    "The total number of pies is 2000.",
    "The number of pies not eaten with forks is the total number of pies minus the number of pies eaten with forks.",
    "2000 - 1360 = 640.",
    "So, 640 pies are not eaten with forks."

  "solution": "640"
