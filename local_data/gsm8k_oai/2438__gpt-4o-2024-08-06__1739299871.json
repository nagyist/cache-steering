  "query": "Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo, who has 8 more than Lily. If Lily has 3 tennis balls, how many does Brian have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tennis balls Frodo has.",
    "I know that Lily has 3 tennis balls.",
    "Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily.",
    "Therefore, Frodo has 3 + 8 = 11 tennis balls.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many tennis balls Brian has.",
    "Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo.",
    "To find out how many tennis balls Brian has, I multiply the number of tennis balls Frodo has by 2.",
    "Brian has 11 * 2 = 22 tennis balls."
