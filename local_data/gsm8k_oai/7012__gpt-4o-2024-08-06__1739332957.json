  "query": "Jake earns thrice what Jacob does. If Jacob earns $6 per hour, how much does Jake earn in 5 days working 8 hours a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Jacob earns per day. Jacob works 8 hours a day, earning $6 per hour.",
    "Jacob earns 8 hours/day * $6/hour = $48 per day.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Jake earns per hour since he earns thrice what Jacob does.",
    "If Jacob earns $6 per hour, then Jake earns 3 times $6, so Jake earns $6/hour * 3 = $18 per hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Jake earns per day.",
    "Jake works the same amount, which is 8 hours a day, so he earns 8 hours/day * $18/hour = $144 per day.",
    "Finally, to find out how much Jake earns in 5 days, I multiply his daily earnings by the number of days.",
    "Jake earns $144/day * 5 days = $720 in 5 days."

  "solution": "720"
