  "query": "Meryll wants to write 35 multiple-choice questions and 15 problem-solving questions for her Chemistry class. She already has written 2/5 of the multiple-choice and 1/3 of the problem-solving questions. How many more questions does she need to write for both multiple-choice and problem-solving?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many multiple-choice questions Meryll has already written.",
    "She needs to write a total of 35 multiple-choice questions.",
    "She has written 2/5 of these multiple-choice questions.",
    "To find out how many multiple-choice questions that is, I calculate 2/5 of 35.",
    "So, (2/5) * 35 = 14. Meryll has written 14 multiple-choice questions.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many multiple-choice questions she still needs to write.",
    "Subtract the amount she has written from the total number needed: 35 - 14.",
    "35 - 14 = 21. Meryll needs to write 21 more multiple-choice questions.",
    "Now, calculate how many problem-solving questions she has already written.",
    "She needs to write a total of 15 problem-solving questions.",
    "She has written 1/3 of these problem-solving questions.",
    "To find out how many problem-solving questions that is, calculate 1/3 of 15.",
    "(1/3) * 15 = 5. Meryll has written 5 problem-solving questions.",
    "Next, find out how many problem-solving questions she still needs to write.",
    "Subtract the amount she has written from the total number needed: 15 - 5.",
    "15 - 5 = 10. Meryll needs to write 10 more problem-solving questions.",
    "Now, add the number of multiple-choice and problem-solving questions she still needs to write to find the total.",
    "21 + 10 = 31."

  "solution": "31"
