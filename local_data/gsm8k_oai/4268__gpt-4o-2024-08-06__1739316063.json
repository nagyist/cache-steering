  "steps": [
    "Derek starts with $40.",
    "Derek spends $14 on lunch for himself.",
    "After spending $14, Derek has $40 - $14 = $26 left.",
    "Derek spends another $11 on lunch for his dad.",
    "After spending $11, Derek has $26 - $11 = $15 left.",
    "Derek spends another $5 on lunch for himself.",
    "After spending $5, Derek has $15 - $5 = $10 left.",
    "Dave starts with $50.",
    "Dave spends $7 on lunch for his mom.",
    "After spending $7, Dave has $50 - $7 = $43 left.",
    "To find how much more money Dave has than Derek, subtract Derek's remaining money from Dave's.",
    "Dave has $43 and Derek has $10, so $43 - $10 = $33."
