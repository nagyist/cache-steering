  "query": "Melissa is repairing her shoes. For each shoe, it takes her 5 minutes to replace the buckle and 10 minutes to even out the heel. How many minutes does Melissa spend on this project total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much time Melissa spends on each shoe.",
    "For each shoe, it takes 5 minutes to replace the buckle.",
    "Additionally, it takes 10 minutes to even out the heel for each shoe.",
    "I need to add these two times together to find the total time spent on one shoe.",
    "5 minutes (buckle) + 10 minutes (heel) = 15 minutes per shoe.",
    "Next, I need to determine if Melissa is repairing one shoe or both shoes.",
    "The question does not specify the number of shoes, so I will assume it is a pair of shoes, which means 2 shoes.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time spent on both shoes.",
    "15 minutes per shoe multiplied by 2 shoes equals 30 minutes."

  "solution": "30"
