  "query": "Janice has been working part-time at a convenience store 5 days a week. She can earn $30 per day and can earn $15 more when she works a 2 hour overtime shift. If she works three overtime shifts this week, how much will she earn this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Janice earns in a regular week without overtime.",
    "She works 5 days a week and earns $30 per day.",
    "So, her regular earnings for 5 days are 5 days * $30/day = $150.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much she earns from three overtime shifts.",
    "Each overtime shift earns her an additional $15.",
    "Therefore, three overtime shifts will earn her 3 shifts * $15/shift = $45.",
    "Now, I add her regular earnings with her overtime earnings to find the total earnings for the week.",
    "Her regular earnings are $150, and her overtime earnings are $45.",
    "Total earnings for the week are $150 + $45 = $195."

  "solution": "195"
