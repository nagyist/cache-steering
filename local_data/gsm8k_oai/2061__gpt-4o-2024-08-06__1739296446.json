  "query": "The coach of a football team asked his players to do six laps of the field. The field is in the shape of a rectangle of length 100 m and width 50 m. What is the distance each player will run, in meters?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular field.",
    "The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width.",
    "The length of the field is given as 100 meters.",
    "The width of the field is given as 50 meters.",
    "I will calculate the sum of the length and width: 100 m + 50 m = 150 m.",
    "Now, I need to multiply this sum by 2: 2 \u00d7 150 m = 300 m.",
    "The perimeter of the field is 300 meters.",
    "Each player is asked to do six laps of the field, so I need to multiply the perimeter by 6.",
    "Calculating this gives me: 300 m \u00d7 6 = 1800 m.",
    "Therefore, the distance each player will run is 1800 meters."

  "solution": "1800"
