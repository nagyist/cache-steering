  "query": "Gerald wants to buy a meat pie that costs 2 pfennigs. Gerald has 54 farthings, and there are 6 farthings to a pfennig. How many pfennigs will Gerald have left after buying the pie?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the meat pie costs 2 pfennigs.",
    "Gerald has 54 farthings.",
    "I need to convert farthings into pfennigs to see how many pfennigs Gerald can initially have.",
    "There are 6 farthings in a pfennig.",
    "To convert farthings to pfennigs, I need to divide the number of farthings by the number of farthings per pfennig.",
    "54 farthings / 6 farthings per pfennig = 9 pfennigs",
    "So, Gerald has 9 pfennigs after converting his farthings.",
    "The cost of the pie is 2 pfennigs.",
    "Now, I subtract the cost of the pie from Gerald's total pfennigs.",
    "9 pfennigs - 2 pfennigs = 7 pfennigs"
