  "query": "Jane is painting her fingernails. She applies a base coat that takes 2 minutes to dry, two color coats that take 3 minutes each to dry, and a clear top coat that takes 5 minutes to dry. How many minutes total does Jane spend waiting for her nail polish to dry?",
  "steps": [
    "Jane applies a base coat first.",
    "The base coat takes 2 minutes to dry.",
    "Next, Jane applies the first color coat.",
    "The first color coat takes 3 minutes to dry.",
    "Then, Jane applies the second color coat.",
    "The second color coat takes another 3 minutes to dry.",
    "Finally, Jane applies the clear top coat.",
    "The clear top coat takes 5 minutes to dry.",
    "Now, I will add up all the drying times: 2 minutes (base coat) + 3 minutes (first color coat) + 3 minutes (second color coat) + 5 minutes (top coat).",
    "2 + 3 = 5",
    "5 + 3 = 8",
    "8 + 5 = 13"

  "solution": "13"
