  "steps": [
    "Grace can read a 200-page book in 20 hours.",
    "First, I need to determine how many pages Grace reads per hour.",
    "To find pages per hour, I can divide the total pages by the total hours.",
    "200 pages / 20 hours = 10 pages per hour.",
    "Now, I have established that Grace reads 10 pages per hour.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it would take her to read a 250-page book at this rate.",
    "I will divide the total number of pages of the new book by the number of pages she reads per hour.",
    "250 pages / 10 pages per hour = 25 hours.",
    "I have calculated that it would take Grace 25 hours to finish reading a 250-page book."
