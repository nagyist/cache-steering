  "query": "Bill gets a flat-screen TV that measures 48 inches by 100 inches. His brother Bob gets a TV that measures 70 inches by 60 inches. If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of Bill's TV.",
    "The area of Bill's TV is 48 inches multiplied by 100 inches.",
    "48 x 100 = 4800 square inches. This is the area of Bill's TV.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the area of Bob's TV.",
    "The area of Bob's TV is 70 inches multiplied by 60 inches.",
    "70 x 60 = 4200 square inches. This is the area of Bob's TV.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the weight of Bill's TV by multiplying the area by the weight per square inch.",
    "4800 square inches x 4 ounces per square inch = 19200 ounces. This is the weight of Bill's TV.",
    "Next, I calculate the weight of Bob's TV using the same method.",
    "4200 square inches x 4 ounces per square inch = 16800 ounces. This is the weight of Bob's TV.",
    "I need to compare the weights to find the heavier TV. Bill's TV weighs 19200 ounces, and Bob's TV weighs 16800 ounces.",
    "Bill's TV is heavier. I need to find out how much more it weighs than Bob's TV.",
    "19200 ounces - 16800 ounces = 2400 ounces. Bill's TV weighs 2400 ounces more than Bob's TV.",
    "To convert the difference in weight from ounces to pounds, I divide by 16 since there are 16 ounces per pound.",
    "2400 ounces / 16 = 150 pounds. The heavier TV weighs 150 pounds more."
