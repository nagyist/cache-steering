  "query": "The faucet in Betsy's bathroom is broken. Every minute it drips about 10 times. What amount of water is wasted during one hour if each drop contains 0.05 mL?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many drops there are in one hour.",
    "Since there are 10 drips per minute, I'll multiply 10 drips by the number of minutes in one hour, which is 60.",
    "10 drips/minute \u00d7 60 minutes = 600 drips in one hour.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total amount of water wasted in one hour.",
    "I know each drop contains 0.05 mL.",
    "I'll multiply the number of drops by the amount of water in each drop to get the total volume of water wasted.",
    "600 drips \u00d7 0.05 mL/drip = 30 mL."
