  "query": "Hadassah took six hours to paint 12 paintings. What would be the total time she's taken to finish all the paintings if she paints 20 more paintings?",
  "steps": [
    "Hadassah paints at a constant rate.",
    "Hadassah painted 12 paintings in 6 hours.",
    "To find her rate, I divide the number of paintings by the number of hours: 12 paintings / 6 hours = 2 paintings per hour.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it takes her to paint 20 more paintings at this rate.",
    "To find the time, I divide the number of paintings by her rate: 20 paintings / 2 paintings per hour = 10 hours.",
    "She already spent 6 hours painting the initial 12 paintings.",
    "Adding these times together gives the total time: 6 hours + 10 hours = 16 hours."
