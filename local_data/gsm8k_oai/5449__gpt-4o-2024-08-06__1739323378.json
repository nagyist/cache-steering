  "query": "A mailman has to deliver 48 pieces of junk mail.  There are 8 houses on the block.  2 of the houses have white mailboxes and 3 have red mailboxes.  How many pieces of junk mail will each of those houses get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many houses have non-white and non-red mailboxes.",
    "There are 8 houses in total, and I know that 2 have white mailboxes and 3 have red mailboxes.",
    "If I add the houses with white mailboxes and the houses with red mailboxes, I get 2 + 3 = 5 houses.",
    "This means that 8 - 5 = 3 houses have mailboxes that are neither white nor red.",
    "Next, I need to determine how the mail is distributed among all the houses.",
    "There are 48 pieces of junk mail to deliver, and these pieces need to be distributed evenly among the 8 houses.",
    "To find out how many pieces each house gets, I will divide the total number of pieces by the total number of houses: 48 \u00f7 8 = 6.",
    "Therefore, each house, regardless of mailbox color, receives 6 pieces of junk mail."

  "solution": "6"
