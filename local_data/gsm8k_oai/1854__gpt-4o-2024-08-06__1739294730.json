  "query": "A bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds and each individual ear of corn weighs .5 pounds.  If Clyde picked 2 bushels of corn over the weekend, how many individual corn cobs did he pick?",
  "steps": [
    "A bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds.",
    "Clyde picked 2 bushels of corn.",
    "To find the total weight of corn picked, multiply the number of bushels by the weight of one bushel.",
    "The total weight is 2 bushels \u00d7 56 pounds/bushel = 112 pounds.",
    "An individual ear of corn weighs 0.5 pounds.",
    "To find the number of individual corn cobs, divide the total weight of corn by the weight of one individual ear.",
    "112 pounds \u00f7 0.5 pounds/ear = 224 ears."

  "solution": "224"
