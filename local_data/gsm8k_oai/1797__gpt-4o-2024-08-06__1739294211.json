  "query": "John buys 3 t-shirts that cost $20 each.  He also buys $50 in pants.  How much does he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how much John spends on the t-shirts.",
    "Each t-shirt costs $20 and John buys 3 t-shirts.",
    "To calculate the total cost of the t-shirts, I multiply the cost of each t-shirt by the number of t-shirts: 3 * $20.",
    "3 * $20 equals $60.",
    "Now I know John spends $60 on t-shirts.",
    "Next, I need to add the cost of the pants to the cost of the t-shirts to find the total amount John spends.",
    "John buys pants costing $50.",
    "To find the total spending, I add the $60 spent on t-shirts to the $50 spent on pants.",
    "$60 + $50 equals $110.",
    "So, the total amount John spends is $110."

  "solution": "110"
