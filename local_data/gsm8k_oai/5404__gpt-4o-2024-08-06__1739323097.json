  "steps": [
    "Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, she sent 10 more pieces than on Monday.",
    "65 pieces on Monday plus 10 equals 75 pieces on Tuesday.",
    "On Wednesday, Lauren sent 5 fewer pieces than on Tuesday.",

    "On Thursday, she sent 15 more pieces than on Wednesday.",
    "70 pieces on Wednesday plus 15 equals 85 pieces on Thursday.",
    "Now, add up all the pieces of mail sent: 65 (Monday) + 75 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) + 85 (Thursday).",
    "Add 65 and 75 to get 140.",
    "Add 140 and 70 to get 210.",
    "Add 210 and 85 to get 295."
