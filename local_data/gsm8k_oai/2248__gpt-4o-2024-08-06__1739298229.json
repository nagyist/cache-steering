  "query": "A basketball team won 40 games in their last competition. In the next competition, they won 5/8 times as many games as they won in their first competition. In the third competition, they won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings. Calculate the total number of wins they had in the three competitions.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many games the team won in the second competition.",
    "They won 5/8 times as many games in the second competition as in the first competition.",
    "The number of games they won in the first competition is 40.",
    "I'll multiply 40 by 5/8 to find the number of games won in the second competition.",
    "40 multiplied by 5/8 equals 25.",
    "So, they won 25 games in the second competition.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many games they won in the third competition.",
    "The problem states they won as many games in the third competition as the sum of the first and second competition winnings.",
    "The number of games they won in the first competition is 40 and in the second competition is 25.",
    "I will add these two numbers together: 40 + 25.",
    "40 + 25 equals 65.",
    "So, they won 65 games in the third competition.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate the total number of games won across all three competitions.",
    "I will add the number of games won in each competition: 40 (first) + 25 (second) + 65 (third).",
    "40 + 25 + 65 equals 130."

  "solution": "130"
