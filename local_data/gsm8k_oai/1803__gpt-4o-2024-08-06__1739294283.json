  "query": "There are 90 students who have lunch during period 5. Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about. How many students are now in the cafeteria?",
  "steps": [
    "There are 90 students in total.",
    "Two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria initially.",
    "Calculate two-thirds of 90: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 90 = 60 \\).",
    "So, 60 students are initially in the cafeteria.",
    "The remainder of the students, \\( 90 - 60 = 30 \\), are sitting outside.",
    "One-third of the students outside run inside. Calculate one-third of 30: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10 \\).",
    "So 10 students run from outside to inside the cafeteria.",
    "Now calculate the new number of students in the cafeteria: \\( 60 + 10 = 70 \\).",
    "Meanwhile, 3 students from the cafeteria go outside.",
    "Subtract the 3 students who go outside from the cafeteria count: \\( 70 - 3 = 67 \\)."
