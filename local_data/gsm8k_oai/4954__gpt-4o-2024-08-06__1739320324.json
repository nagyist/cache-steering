  "query": "Jangshe spent $610 on 7 pieces of clothing. One piece was $49 and another piece was $81. If the other pieces were all the same price, how many dollars was one of the other pieces?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Jangshe spent on the two pieces that have specific prices.",
    "One piece is $49.",
    "Another piece is $81.",
    "The total cost for these two pieces is $49 + $81 = $130.",
    "Jangshe spent a total of $610 on 7 pieces of clothing.",
    "To find out how much she spent on the remaining pieces, I will subtract the cost of the two known pieces from the total amount spent.",
    "610 - 130 = 480. So, Jangshe spent $480 on the remaining pieces.",
    "There are 5 other pieces, all at the same price.",
    "To find the price of one of the other pieces, I will divide the total amount spent on the other pieces by the number of pieces.",
    "480 divided by 5 equals 96.",
    "So, each of the other pieces costs $96."

  "solution": "96"
