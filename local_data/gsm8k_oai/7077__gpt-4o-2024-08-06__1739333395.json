  "query": "Boston had .5 feet of snow on the first day of winter.  The next day they got an additional 8 inches.  Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of the snow melted.  On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day.  How many feet of snow do they now have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert all measurements to the same unit for consistency. I'll convert everything to inches and then back to feet at the end.",
    "The initial snowfall on the first day was 0.5 feet. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so I convert 0.5 feet to inches: 0.5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 6 inches.",
    "On the second day, they received an additional 8 inches. I need to add this to the existing snow from the first day: 6 inches + 8 inches = 14 inches.",
    "Over the next two days, 2 inches of snow melted. I subtract the melted snow from the total: 14 inches - 2 inches = 12 inches.",
    "On the fifth day, they received another snowfall. The problem states it's 2 times the amount they received on the first day. The first day's snowfall in inches was 6 inches, so twice that is: 6 inches x 2 = 12 inches.",
    "Now, I add this new snowfall to the existing total: 12 inches + 12 inches = 24 inches.",
    "Finally, I convert the total amount of snow from inches back to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, I divide the total inches by 12: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = 2 feet."
