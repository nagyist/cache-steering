  "query": "There were three jars of candy in the cabinet. The jar of peanut butter candy had 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy. The jar of grape candy had 5 more pieces of candy than the jar of banana candy. How many pieces of candy did the peanut butter jar have if the banana jar had 43?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by understanding the problem. There are three jars: peanut butter, grape, and banana.",
    "I know the banana jar has 43 pieces of candy.",
    "The grape jar has 5 more pieces than the banana jar.",
    "So, I add 5 to 43 to find out how many pieces of candy are in the grape jar.",
    "43 + 5 = 48 pieces of candy are in the grape jar.",
    "The peanut butter jar contains 4 times as much candy as the grape jar.",
    "I multiply the amount of candy in the grape jar by 4 to find out how much is in the peanut butter jar.",
    "48 * 4 = 192 pieces of candy are in the peanut butter jar."

  "solution": "192"
