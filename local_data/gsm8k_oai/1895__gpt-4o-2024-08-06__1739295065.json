  "query": "Natalia is riding a bicycle for the cycling competition. On Monday she rode 40 kilometers and on Tuesday 50 kilometers. On Wednesday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before. On Thursday she rode as many as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday. How many kilometers did Natalie ride in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many kilometers Natalia rode on Wednesday. She rode 50% fewer kilometers than she rode on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday, Natalia rode 50 kilometers. Therefore, 50% of 50 kilometers is 25 kilometers.",
    "To find the kilometers rode on Wednesday, I subtract 25 kilometers from 50 kilometers, which equals 25 kilometers.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many kilometers Natalia rode on Thursday. She rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday.",
    "On Monday, Natalia rode 40 kilometers and on Wednesday she rode 25 kilometers. I need to add these two amounts together.",
    "40 kilometers (Monday) + 25 kilometers (Wednesday) = 65 kilometers (Thursday).",
    "To find the total kilometers Natalia rode over all four days, I need to add together the kilometers from each day: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.",
    "Natalia rode 40 kilometers on Monday, 50 kilometers on Tuesday, 25 kilometers on Wednesday, and 65 kilometers on Thursday.",
    "Adding these amounts: 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 kilometers."
