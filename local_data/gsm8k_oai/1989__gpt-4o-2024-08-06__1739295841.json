  "query": "Yulia was able to net $44 in profit this week. Her lemonade stand made a gross revenue of $47 this week. She was also able to babysit and made $31. However, her lemonade stand is expensive to run because she needs to buy lemons, sugar, and sunscreen. How much did she spend to operate her lemonade stand, in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Yulia's total profit for the week is given as $44.",
    "She made $31 from babysitting.",
    "The remaining profit must come from her lemonade stand.",
    "Since she made a total of $44 in profit and $31 came from babysitting, the profit from the lemonade stand is $44 - $31.",
    "$44 - $31 equals $13. So, she made $13 profit from her lemonade stand.",
    "The gross revenue from the lemonade stand is given as $47.",
    "To find out how much she spent on her lemonade stand, we need to find the difference between the gross revenue and the profit from the lemonade stand.",
    "The spending on the lemonade stand is calculated as gross revenue minus the profit made from it.",
    "So, her spending is $47 - $13.",
    "$47 - $13 equals $34."

  "solution": "34"
