  "query": "James buys 5 packs of sodas that are 12 sodas each.  He had 10 sodas already.  He finishes all the sodas in 1 week.  How many sodas does he drink a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of sodas James buys with the 5 packs.",
    "Each pack has 12 sodas, and he buys 5 packs. Therefore, the total number of sodas from the packs is 5 * 12.",
    "5 * 12 equals 60 sodas.",
    "Next, I add the 10 sodas that James already had to the 60 sodas he bought.",
    "60 + 10 equals 70 sodas in total.",
    "James finishes all the sodas in 1 week, which is 7 days.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the average number of sodas James drinks per day by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of days.",
    "70 sodas divided by 7 days equals 10 sodas per day."
