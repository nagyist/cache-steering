  "query": "A dietitian ate three-fourths of her lunch during her lunch break. If the total amount of food she had prepared for lunch had 40 calories, and the recommended calorie intake by the FDA is 25, how many more calories than the recommended amount did she eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many calories the dietitian consumed during her lunch break.",
    "She ate three-fourths of her lunch, and the total amount of food she had prepared contained 40 calories.",
    "To find out how many calories she consumed, I multiply the total calories by the fraction she ate: (3/4) * 40.",
    "Calculating (3/4) * 40 gives me 30 calories.",
    "Now, I need to compare the number of calories she ate to the recommended calorie intake, which is 25 calories.",
    "She consumed 30 calories, and the recommended amount is 25 calories.",
    "To determine how many more calories she consumed than recommended, I subtract 25 from 30.",
    "30 - 25 equals 5."

  "solution": "5"
