  "query": "Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cars in total are in the parking lot.",
    "There are 10 cars from the guests.",
    "In addition, there are 2 cars belonging to Dylan's parents: Dylan's mother's car and Dylan's father's jeep.",
    "Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot is 10 (guest cars) + 2 (parent cars) = 12 cars.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of car wheels.",
    "Each car has 4 wheels.",
    "So, I multiply the number of cars by the number of wheels per car: 12 cars * 4 wheels per car = 48 wheels."

  "solution": "48"
