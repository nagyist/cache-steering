  "query": "Will and Henry go fishing in a river. Will catches 16 catfish and 10 eels. Henry challenges himself to catch 3 trout for every catfish Will catches. Due to environmental concerns, Henry decides to return half his catch after meeting his own challenge. How many fishes do they have altogether now?",
  "steps": [
    "Will catches 16 catfish.",
    "Will also catches 10 eels.",
    "Henry aims to catch 3 trout for each catfish Will catches.",
    "Since Will catches 16 catfish, Henry aims for 3 times 16 trout.",
    "3 times 16 is 48, so Henry catches 48 trout.",
    "However, Henry decides to return half of his catch.",
    "Half of 48 is 24, so Henry returns 24 trout.",
    "After returning, Henry has 24 trout left.",
    "Now, let's add the number of fishes Will has and the number Henry has left.",
    "Will has 16 catfish + 10 eels = 26 fish.",
    "Henry has 24 trout.",
    "The total number of fish both have is 26 (Will) + 24 (Henry).",
    "26 + 24 equals 50."

  "solution": "50"
