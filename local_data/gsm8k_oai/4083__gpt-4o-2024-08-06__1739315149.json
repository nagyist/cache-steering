  "query": "In Hawaii, they normally get an average of 2 inches of rain a day. With 100 days left in the year, they've gotten 430 inches of rain. How many inches on average do they need to finish the year with the normal average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total average rain expected for the whole year.",
    "A normal year has 365 days, and the average is 2 inches per day.",
    "Multiply 365 days by 2 inches per day to find the total expected rainfall for the year: 365 * 2 = 730 inches.",
    "They have already received 430 inches of rain this year.",
    "I need to subtract the rain they've already gotten from the total expected rainfall for the year.",
    "730 inches (total expected) - 430 inches (already received) = 300 inches remaining needed to achieve the average.",
    "There are 100 days left in the year.",
    "I need to divide the remaining 300 inches needed by the 100 days left to find the average they need per day.",
    "300 inches / 100 days = 3 inches per day."

  "solution": "3"
