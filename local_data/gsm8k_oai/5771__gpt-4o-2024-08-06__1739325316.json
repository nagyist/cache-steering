  "steps": [
    "James buys 10 shirts.",
    "He buys half as many pants as shirts, so he buys 10 / 2 = 5 pants.",
    "Each shirt costs $6.",
    "The total cost for shirts is 10 shirts * $6/shirt = $60.",
    "Each pair of pants costs $8.",
    "The total cost for pants is 5 pants * $8/pair = $40.",
    "The total cost for everything is the cost of shirts plus the cost of pants.",
    "So, the total expenditure is $60 (shirts) + $40 (pants) = $100."
