  "query": "A class of 30 high school students is preparing for a field trip. If each student contributes $2 every Friday for their trip, how many dollars will they have in 2 months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Each student contributes $2 every Friday, and there are 30 students in the class.",
    "Let's calculate the total contribution per Friday first. Each student gives $2, so for 30 students, the total would be 30 times $2.",
    "30 students * $2/student = $60 per Friday.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many Fridays there are in 2 months.",
    "Assuming that an average month has about 4 weeks, 2 months would be about 8 weeks.",
    "Since there is one Friday each week, there would be roughly 8 Fridays in 2 months.",
    "Now I need to calculate the total contribution over these 8 Fridays. Multiply $60 by 8.",
    "$60 * 8 Fridays = $480."
  ],
  "solution": "480"
