  "query": "Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to set up variables to represent the number of cucumbers and the number of tomatoes.",
    "Let \\( c \\) be the number of cucumbers.",
    "Let \\( t \\) be the number of tomatoes.",
    "According to the problem, Barry uses a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. So, I have the equation \\( c + t = 280 \\).",
    "It is also stated that there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers. This can be expressed as \\( t = 3c \\).",
    "Now, I will substitute the expression for \\( t \\) from the second equation into the first equation.",
    "Substitute \\( t = 3c \\) into \\( c + t = 280 \\) to get \\( c + 3c = 280 \\).",
    "Combine like terms to simplify: \\( 4c = 280 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( c \\), divide both sides by 4: \\( c = 280 / 4 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 280 / 4 = 70 \\).",
    "So, \\( c = 70 \\). Barry will use 70 cucumbers in the salad."
