  "query": "Mathilda is determined to pay back the money she owes a friend so she decides to pay an initial installment of $125. If she still has 75% left to pay, how much did she owe originally?",
  "steps": [
    "Mathilda pays an initial installment of $125.",
    "She still has 75% of the full amount left to pay.",
    "This means the $125 she paid accounts for 25% of the original amount because 100% - 75% = 25%.",
    "Therefore, $125 represents 25% of the total amount owed.",
    "To find the total amount, I can use the equation: 25% of total = $125.",
    "This can be rewritten as (25/100) * total = $125.",
    "To find the total, I can divide both sides by (25/100).",
    "So, total = $125 / (25/100).",
    "Simplifying the division: total = $125 / 0.25.",
    "$125 divided by 0.25 equals $500."
  ],
  "solution": "500"
