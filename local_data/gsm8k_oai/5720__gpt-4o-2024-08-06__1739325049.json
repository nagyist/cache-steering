  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many ladies are on the first floor. According to the problem, there are a hundred ladies on the first floor.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many girls are on the second floor. It is stated that there are three times as many girls on the second floor as there are ladies on the first floor.",
    "To calculate the number of girls on the second floor, I multiply the number of ladies on the first floor by three. So, 100 ladies * 3 = 300 girls.",
    "To find the total number of ladies on both floors, I add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor.",
    "100 ladies (first floor) + 300 girls (second floor) = 400 ladies in total."
