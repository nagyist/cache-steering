  "query": "Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",
  "steps": [
    "Jack collects 2 liters of seawater.",
    "The seawater is 20% salt.",
    "To find out the amount of salt, I need to calculate 20% of 2 liters.",
    "First, I convert 2 liters into milliliters because the final answer needs to be in ml. There are 1000 ml in a liter.",
    "So, 2 liters = 2 * 1000 = 2000 ml.",
    "Now, I need to find 20% of 2000 ml.",
    "20% is equivalent to 20/100 or 0.2.",
    "To calculate 20% of 2000 ml, I multiply 2000 by 0.2.",
    "2000 * 0.2 = 400.",
    "So, there are 400 ml of salt in the 2 liters of seawater."

  "solution": "400"
