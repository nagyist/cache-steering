  "query": "Keith bought 8 new baseball trading cards to add to his collection. The next day his dog ate half of his collection. There are now only 46 cards left. How many cards did Keith start with?",
  "steps": [
    "Keith started by adding 8 new cards to his collection.",
    "After his dog ate half of his collection, he was left with 46 cards.",
    "This means that 46 cards represent half of Keith's total collection after adding the 8 new cards.",
    "If 46 cards is half of the collection, then doubling 46 will give us the total number of cards he had after adding the new cards.",
    "Doubling 46 gives us 92, so after adding the 8 cards, Keith had 92 cards.",
    "To find out how many cards Keith originally had before adding the 8 new ones, we need to subtract 8 from 92.",
    "92 - 8 = 84."

  "solution": "84"
