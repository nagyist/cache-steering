  "query": "Julia bought 3 packs of red balls, 10 packs of yellow balls, and 8 packs of green balls. There were 19 balls in each package. How many balls did Julie buy in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many red balls Julia bought.",
    "Julia bought 3 packs of red balls.",
    "There are 19 balls in each pack.",
    "To find the total number of red balls, I multiply 3 packs by the 19 balls in each pack: 3 * 19.",
    "3 * 19 equals 57.",
    "So, Julia bought 57 red balls.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many yellow balls Julia bought.",
    "Julia bought 10 packs of yellow balls.",
    "There are 19 balls in each pack.",
    "To find the total number of yellow balls, I multiply 10 packs by the 19 balls in each pack: 10 * 19.",
    "10 * 19 equals 190.",
    "So, Julia bought 190 yellow balls.",
    "Now, I will calculate the number of green balls Julia bought.",
    "Julia bought 8 packs of green balls.",
    "There are 19 balls in each pack.",
    "To find the total number of green balls, I multiply 8 packs by the 19 balls in each pack: 8 * 19.",
    "8 * 19 equals 152.",
    "So, Julia bought 152 green balls.",
    "To find the total number of balls Julia bought, I will add the number of red, yellow, and green balls she purchased.",
    "The total number of red balls is 57.",
    "The total number of yellow balls is 190.",
    "The total number of green balls is 152.",
    "Adding these together, 57 + 190 + 152.",
    "First, I add 57 and 190, which equals 247.",
    "Next, I add 247 and 152.",
    "247 + 152 equals 399.",
    "So, Julia bought a total of 399 balls."
