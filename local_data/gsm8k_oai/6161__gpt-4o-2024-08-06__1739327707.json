  "query": "Jermaine, Terrence, and Emilee earn a total of $90. Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence in a month. If Terrence earns $30, how much does Emilee earn?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by noting that Jermaine, Terrence, and Emilee together earn a total of $90.",
    "I'm given that Terrence earns $30.",
    "Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence.",
    "Since Terrence earns $30, Jermaine must earn $30 + $5.",
    "Calculating Jermaine's earnings, I get $35.",
    "Now, I add Jermaine and Terrence's earnings: $30 + $35.",
    "Their combined total is $65.",
    "To find how much Emilee earns, I subtract $65 from the total earnings of $90.",
    "Calculating the difference gives me $90 - $65.",
    "This results in $25."
