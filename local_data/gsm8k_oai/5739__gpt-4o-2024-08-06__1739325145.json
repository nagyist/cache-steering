  "query": "Vanessa wants to buy a dress she saw at the mall, which costs $80, and she already has $20 in savings. Her parents give her $30 every week, but she also spends $10 each weekend at the arcades. How many weeks will she have to wait until she can gather enough money to buy the dress?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how much more money Vanessa needs to buy the dress. The dress costs $80, and she has $20 in savings.",
    "Subtract the savings from the cost of the dress: $80 - $20 = $60. So, Vanessa needs $60 more.",
    "Next, consider the money Vanessa receives and spends weekly. Her parents give her $30 every week.",
    "However, she spends $10 each weekend at the arcades. So her net saving each week is $30 - $10 = $20.",
    "Now, calculate how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining $60 at a rate of $20 per week.",
    "Divide the total amount needed by the amount saved per week: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 weeks."

  "solution": "3"
