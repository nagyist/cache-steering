  "query": "Wilma has a garden with 3 types of flowers. The garden has 6 rows, with 13 flowers in each row. Wilma has 12 yellow flowers, two times more green flowers, and the rest consist of red flowers. How many red flowers does Wilma have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.",
    "The garden has 6 rows with 13 flowers in each row.",
    "So, the total number of flowers is 6 rows multiplied by 13 flowers per row.",
    "6 * 13 = 78 flowers in total.",
    "Next, I know Wilma has 12 yellow flowers.",
    "Wilma has two times more green flowers than yellow flowers.",
    "Two times more green flowers than 12 yellow flowers is 2 * 12 = 24 green flowers.",
    "Now, I calculate how many flowers are not yellow or green, which must be red.",
    "So, I subtract the number of yellow and green flowers from the total number of flowers.",
    "Yellow flowers: 12",
    "Green flowers: 24",
    "Total non-red flowers: 12 + 24 = 36 flowers",
    "Now, I subtract the non-red flowers from the total number of flowers to find the number of red flowers.",
    "78 total flowers - 36 non-red flowers = 42 red flowers"
  ],
  "solution": "42"
