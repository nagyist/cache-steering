  "query": "Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla, and Carla has twice as much money as Cosima. If Natasha has $60, and the three decide to buy goods worth the total amount they have and sell the goods at 7/5 of the buying price, how much profit would they make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how much money Natasha, Carla, and Cosima each have individually.",
    "Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla and we know Natasha has $60.",
    "Since Natasha has $60, Carla must have $60/3 = $20.",
    "Carla has twice as much as Cosima, therefore, Cosima has $20/2 = $10.",
    "Now add up the total money they have: Natasha's $60 + Carla's $20 + Cosima's $10.",
    "The total sum they have is $60 + $20 + $10 = $90.",
    "Next, calculate the selling price of the goods. They sell the goods at 7/5 of the buying price.",
    "The selling price of the goods is 7/5 of $90.",
    "Compute 7/5 of $90: (7/5) * $90 = $126.",
    "Now, calculate the profit they make by selling the goods.",
    "The profit is the selling price minus the buying price: $126 - $90.",
    "The profit they make is $126 - $90 = $36."

  "solution": "36"
