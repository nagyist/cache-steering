  "query": "Gina is figuring out how much she'll have to spend on college this year. She's taking 14 credits that cost $450 each, and she has to pay $120 for each of her 5 textbooks plus a $200 facilities fee. How much will Gina spend in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost for her credits. Gina is taking 14 credits.",
    "The cost per credit is $450.",
    "To find the total cost for the credits, I multiply the number of credits by the cost per credit: 14 credits * $450/credit.",
    "14 * 450 = $6300. The total cost for credits is $6300.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for textbooks. She needs 5 textbooks.",
    "Each textbook costs $120.",
    "To find the total cost for textbooks, I multiply the number of textbooks by the cost per textbook: 5 textbooks * $120/textbook.",
    "5 * 120 = $600. The total cost for textbooks is $600.",
    "Gina also needs to pay a facilities fee.",
    "The facilities fee is $200.",
    "To find the total amount Gina will spend, I add up the costs for credits, textbooks, and the facilities fee.",
    "Total cost = $6300 (credits) + $600 (textbooks) + $200 (facilities fee).",
    "6300 + 600 + 200 = $7100."
  ],
  "solution": "7100"
