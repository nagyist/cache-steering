  "query": "Every 4 weeks, Helen hand washes her silk pillowcases.  It takes 30 minutes to hand wash all of them.  In 1 year, how much time does Helen spend hand washing her pillowcases?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many 4-week periods are in 1 year. A year is typically 52 weeks long.",
    "I divide 52 weeks by 4 weeks to find out how many 4-week periods there are in a year: 52 / 4 = 13.",
    "Helen spends 30 minutes hand washing her pillowcases every 4 weeks.",
    "To find the total amount of time she spends in a year, I multiply the number of 4-week periods by the time spent per period: 13 periods * 30 minutes = 390 minutes."

  "solution": "390"
