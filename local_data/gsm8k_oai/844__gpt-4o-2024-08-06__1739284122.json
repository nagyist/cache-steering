  "query": "In 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. Rahim is 6 now. How much older is Andy than Rahim, right now, in years?",
  "steps": [
    "Rahim's current age is given as 6 years.",
    "We need to find Andy's age in 5 years. Let's denote Andy's current age as A.",
    "In 5 years, Andy's age will be A + 5.",
    "The problem states that in 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now.",
    "Since Rahim is currently 6, \"twice as old as Rahim is now\" means 2 times 6, which is 12.",
    "So, in 5 years, Andy's age (A + 5) will be 12.",
    "Set up the equation A + 5 = 12.",
    "To find Andy's current age, solve for A: A = 12 - 5.",
    "A = 7.",
    "We just found out that Andy is currently 7 years old.",
    "To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim right now, subtract Rahim's age from Andy's age: 7 - 6.",
    "7 - 6 = 1."
