  "query": "June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.  There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.  How many birds eggs did she find?",
  "steps": [
    "June found 2 bird nests in one tree.",
    "Each of these nests has 5 eggs.",
    "So, she calculates the number of eggs in that tree as \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) eggs.",
    "Next, June finds 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.",
    "So, she has 3 eggs in that second tree.",
    "In addition, she sees a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the eggs she found: 10 eggs (first tree) + 3 eggs (second tree) + 4 eggs (front yard).",
    "Calculating the total: \\(10 + 3 + 4 = 17\\)."
