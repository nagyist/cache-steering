  "query": "Paul went to a shop to buy some groceries. He bought some bread for $2, butter for $3, and juice for two times the price of the bread. He had $15 for his shopping. How much money did Paul have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the items Paul bought.",
    "Paul bought bread for $2.",
    "He bought butter for $3.",
    "The juice cost two times the price of the bread. So, juice cost 2 * $2 = $4.",
    "Now, I sum the costs of all the items: bread $2 + butter $3 + juice $4.",
    "The total cost of the groceries is $2 + $3 + $4 = $9.",
    "Paul had $15 initially for shopping.",
    "To find out how much money he has left, I subtract the total cost of the groceries from the money he had: $15 - $9.",
    "$15 - $9 equals $6."

  "solution": "6"
