  "query": "The cost of filling a car fuel tank is $45, and this can take you 500 miles before refilling. Mallory was going to her grammy's house, 2000 miles away. If she used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey, calculate the total amount of money she used.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many full tanks of fuel Mallory will need to travel 2000 miles.",
    "If one full tank takes her 500 miles, then to travel 2000 miles, I need to divide 2000 by 500.",
    "2000 \u00f7 500 = 4",
    "Mallory needs 4 full tanks of fuel for the 2000-mile journey.",
    "Each full tank costs $45.",
    "The total cost for fuel is 4 tanks \u00d7 $45 per tank.",
    "4 \u00d7 45 = $180",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much she spent on food.",
    "Mallory used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank.",
    "She spent $180 on fuel; thus, the amount spent on food is 3/5 of $180.",
    "To find 3/5 of $180, I calculate (3/5) \u00d7 180.",
    "First, calculate 180 \u00f7 5 = 36.",
    "Now, 36 \u00d7 3 = 108.",
    "Mallory spent $108 on food.",
    "To get the total amount of money spent, I add the costs for fuel and food together.",
    "$180 (fuel) + $108 (food) = $288."
