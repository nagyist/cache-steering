  "query": "A baker is making bread according to a recipe that requires him to use 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour.  If the baker wants to use up the 6 cups of flour he has remaining in his pantry, how many eggs will he need to use?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem describes a ratio between eggs and flour: 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour.",
    "We need to find out how many sets of 2 cups of flour are in 6 cups.",
    "If I divide 6 cups of flour by 2 cups (the amount per set in the ratio), I get 3 sets.",
    "Since each set in the problem uses 3 eggs, we need 3 eggs per set.",
    "Now, multiply the number of sets (3) by the number of eggs per set (3) to find the total number of eggs needed.",
    "3 sets multiplied by 3 eggs per set results in 9 eggs needed."

  "solution": "9"
