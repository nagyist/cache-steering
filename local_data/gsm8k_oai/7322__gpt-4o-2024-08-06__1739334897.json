  "query": "Wynter went to her local town bike shop to buy her sister a bicycle as her birthday gift. While at the shop, Wynter counted 50 bicycles and 20 tricycles. How many wheels in total did the vehicles she saw have?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by considering the number of bicycles. Wynter counted 50 bicycles.",
    "Each bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "To find the total number of bicycle wheels, I multiply the number of bicycles by the number of wheels per bicycle: 50 bicycles * 2 wheels/bicycle = 100 wheels.",
    "Next, I consider the number of tricycles. Wynter counted 20 tricycles.",
    "Each tricycle has 3 wheels.",
    "To find the total number of tricycle wheels, I multiply the number of tricycles by the number of wheels per tricycle: 20 tricycles * 3 wheels/tricycle = 60 wheels.",
    "Now, I add the total number of bicycle wheels and tricycle wheels to find the total number of wheels: 100 wheels + 60 wheels = 160 wheels."

  "solution": "160"
