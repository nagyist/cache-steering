  "query": "An eagle can fly 15 miles per hour; a falcon can fly 46 miles per hour; a pelican can fly 33 miles per hour; a hummingbird can fly 30 miles per hour. If the eagle, the falcon, the pelican, and the hummingbird flew for 2 hours straight, how many miles in total did the birds fly?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how far each bird flew in 2 hours.",
    "The distance flown by each bird can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "For the eagle, the speed is 15 miles per hour.",
    "The time is 2 hours.",
    "The distance flown by the eagle is 15 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 30 miles.",
    "Next is the falcon, which flies at a speed of 46 miles per hour.",
    "The time is still 2 hours.",
    "The distance flown by the falcon is 46 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 92 miles.",
    "Now, I'll consider the pelican, flying at 33 miles per hour.",
    "The time is again 2 hours.",
    "The distance flown by the pelican is 33 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 66 miles.",
    "Finally, the hummingbird flies at 30 miles per hour.",
    "The time remains 2 hours.",
    "The distance flown by the hummingbird is 30 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 60 miles.",
    "To find the total distance flown by all the birds, I need to add the distances together.",
    "The total distance is 30 miles (eagle) + 92 miles (falcon) + 66 miles (pelican) + 60 miles (hummingbird).",
    "Calculating the total distance: 30 + 92 + 66 + 60 = 248 miles."
