  "query": "The number of students who wish to go on a skiing trip is twice as many as those who wish to go on a scavenger hunting trip. If there are 4000 students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip, how many students are there altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip. It is given as 4000 students.",
    "The problem states that the number of students who wish to go skiing is twice the number of those wanting to go on the scavenger hunting trip.",
    "To find the number of students who wish to go skiing, multiply the number of scavenger hunting students by 2. That is, 4000 * 2.",
    "Calculation: 4000 multiplied by 2 equals 8000 students who wish to go skiing.",
    "Now, add the number of students who wish to go on both trips to determine the total number of students.",
    "Total number of students = number of scavenger hunting students + number of skiing students.",
    "That is, 4000 + 8000.",
    "Calculation: 4000 + 8000 equals 12000 students altogether."

  "solution": "12000"
