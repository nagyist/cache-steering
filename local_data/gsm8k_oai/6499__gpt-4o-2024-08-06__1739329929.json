    "Vincent is 22 years old. Rupert is 2 years younger than Vincent.",
    "Calculating Rupert's age: 22 - 2 = 20.",
    "Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe.",
    "Calculating Khloe's age: 20 - 10 = 10.",
    "Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age.",
    "Calculating Eugene's age: 10 * 3 = 30.",
    "Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age.",
