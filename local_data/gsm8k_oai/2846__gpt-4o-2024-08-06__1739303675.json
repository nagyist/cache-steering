  "query": "Chris wanted to buy a new video game that costs $60 as well as an assortment of candy that costs $5.  To earn the money, he agreed to babysit his little sister for $8 per hour.  If he works 9 hours, how much money will be left over after he makes his purchases?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Chris will earn by babysitting.",
    "Chris earns $8 per hour and he works for 9 hours.",
    "To find the total earnings, I multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $8 * 9 = $72.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total cost of the items Chris wants to buy.",
    "The video game costs $60 and the candy costs $5.",
    "To find the total cost, I add the cost of the video game and the candy: $60 + $5 = $65.",
    "Now, I subtract the total cost of the items from the total earnings to find out how much money will be left over.",
    "Subtract $65 from $72: $72 - $65 = $7."
  ],
  "solution": "7"
