  "query": "Vincent's bookstore is divided into different kinds of books. His top-selling books are fantasy books. He also sells literature books which cost half of the price of a fantasy book. If his fantasy books cost $4 each, and he sold five fantasy books and eight literature books per day, how much money will he earn after five days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the price of the literature books.",
    "Literature books cost half of the price of a fantasy book.",
    "The price of a fantasy book is $4.",
    "Therefore, the price of a literature book is $4 / 2 = $2.",
    "Next, I calculate the earnings from fantasy books in one day.",
    "Vincent sells five fantasy books per day.",
    "The earnings from these are 5 books * $4 = $20 per day.",
    "Now, I calculate the earnings from literature books in one day.",
    "Vincent sells eight literature books per day.",
    "The earnings from these are 8 books * $2 = $16 per day.",
    "Now, I calculate the total earnings from both types of books in one day.",
    "The total daily earnings are $20 (fantasy books) + $16 (literature books) = $36.",
    "Finally, I calculate the earnings after five days.",
    "In five days, the earnings would be $36 per day * 5 days.",
    "The total earnings after five days are $36 * 5 = $180."

  "solution": "180"
