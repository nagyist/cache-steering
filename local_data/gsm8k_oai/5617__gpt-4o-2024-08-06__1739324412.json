  "query": "How long is it before Kayla can reach the minimum age of driving of her state, which is 18, if she is currently half the age of her sister Kimiko who is 26 years old?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Kayla's current age.",
    "I know that Kayla is currently half the age of her sister Kimiko.",
    "Kimiko is 26 years old.",
    "To find Kayla's age, I need to divide Kimiko's age by 2.",
    "26 divided by 2 equals 13.",
    "Kayla is currently 13 years old.",
    "Next, I need to find out how long it will take Kayla to turn 18.",
    "The minimum age for driving is 18 years old.",
    "Kayla needs to be 18 years old to be eligible for driving.",
    "I will subtract Kayla's current age from the minimum driving age.",
    "18 minus 13 equals 5."
