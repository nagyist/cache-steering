    "Kyle earns $3200 every month.",
    "His monthly bills are $1250 for rent, $150 for utilities, $400 for retirement and savings, $300 for groceries/eating out, $200 for insurance, and $200 for miscellaneous expenses.",
    "Let's calculate his total current monthly expenses without the car payment: \n$1250 + $150 + $400 + $300 + $200 + $200 = $2500.",
    "Now, he is considering an additional car payment of $350.",
    "Including the car payment, his total expenses become: \n$2500 + $350 = $2850.",
    "Subtract the total expenses from his monthly income to find out how much he has left:\n$3200 - $2850 = $350."
