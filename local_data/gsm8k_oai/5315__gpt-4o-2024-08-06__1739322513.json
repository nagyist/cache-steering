  "query": "Sam went for a run in the morning. In the afternoon, he went grocery shopping and walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning. That evening, he went on a bike ride with his family and biked for 12 miles. In all, he went 18 miles that day. How many miles was Sam\u2019s morning run?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the distance Sam ran in the morning be x miles.",
    "According to the problem, in the afternoon he walked twice the distance he ran in the morning. So, the distance he walked is 2x miles.",
    "It is given that he biked 12 miles in the evening.",
    "The total distance covered in all activities throughout the day is 18 miles.",
    "So, the total distance can be expressed as the sum of the distances for each activity: x (running) + 2x (walking) + 12 (biking) = 18.",
    "Combine the terms involving x: x + 2x = 3x.",
    "Now we have the equation: 3x + 12 = 18.",
    "Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for 3x: 3x = 18 - 12.",
    "This simplifies to 3x = 6.",
    "Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 6 / 3.",
    "Thus, x = 2.",
    "So, Sam\u2019s morning run was 2 miles."
