  "query": "Carolyn counts 6 monkeys and 6 birds in the tree outside her window. Then two of the monkeys each eat one bird. What percent of the animals outside her window are monkeys now?",
  "steps": [
    "Carolyn initially counts 6 monkeys and 6 birds. This gives a total of 12 animals.",
    "Two monkeys each eat one bird. Two birds are eaten by the monkeys.",
    "After the birds are eaten, the number of birds is reduced by 2. Therefore, there are now 6 - 2 = 4 birds.",
    "The number of monkeys remains unchanged, so there are still 6 monkeys.",
    "Now, let's calculate the new total number of animals: 6 monkeys + 4 birds = 10 animals.",
    "To find the percentage of the animals that are monkeys, we divide the number of monkeys by the total number of animals.",
    "The number of monkeys is 6, and the total number of animals is 10. Therefore, the fraction of animals that are monkeys is 6/10.",
    "Convert this fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100. So, (6/10) * 100 = 60%."

  "solution": "60"
