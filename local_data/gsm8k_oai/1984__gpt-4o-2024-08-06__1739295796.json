  "query": "Jacob is trying to eat less than 1800 calories a day. If he eats 400 calories for breakfast, 900 calories for lunch, and 1100 calories for dinner, how many more calories did he eat than he planned?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total calories Jacob eats in a day.",
    "He eats 400 calories for breakfast.",
    "He eats 900 calories for lunch.",
    "He eats 1100 calories for dinner.",
    "Now I will add these calories together: 400 + 900 + 1100.",
    "Calculating, 400 + 900 is 1300.",
    "Then, 1300 + 1100 is 2400.",
    "Jacob eats a total of 2400 calories in a day.",
    "Jacob wants to eat less than 1800 calories a day.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many more calories Jacob eats than he planned by subtracting 1800 from 2400.",
    "2400 - 1800 equals 600.",
    "Jacob ate 600 more calories than he planned."
