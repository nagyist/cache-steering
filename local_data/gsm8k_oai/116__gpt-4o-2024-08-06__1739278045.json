  "query": "Valerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
  "steps": [
    "Determine how many thank you cards Valerie has. She needs one card each for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt.",
    "That means she has 3 thank you cards to mail.",
    "Next, find out how many bills she needs to mail. Valerie needs to mail both the water bill and the electric bill separately.",
    "So she has 2 bills to mail.",
    "Now, calculate how many mail-in rebates she needs to send. She wants to send three more rebates than she does bills.",
    "Since she has 2 bills, she will send 2 + 3 = 5 mail-in rebates.",
    "Determine how many job applications she needs to mail. She has twice as many job applications as rebates.",
    "So, she has 2 * 5 = 10 job applications to mail.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of items she needs to mail. Add the thank you cards, bills, rebates, and job applications.",
    "Total items = 3 (thank you cards) + 2 (bills) + 5 (rebates) + 10 (job applications) = 20 items.",
    "Calculate how many stamps are needed for these items. Remember, each needs 1 stamp, except the electric bill, which needs 2 stamps.",
    "There are 20 items, and one of these (the electric bill) needs an additional stamp. So, total stamps = 20 + 1 = 21."
