    "Tania has five baskets with a total of 58 fruits.",
    "One basket contains 18 mangoes.",
    "Another basket contains 10 pears.",
    "Another basket contains 12 pawpaws.",
    "The remaining two baskets contain the same number of kiwi and lemons respectively.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of fruits accounted for by the 18 mangoes, 10 pears, and 12 pawpaws.",
    "18 (mangoes) + 10 (pears) = 28.",
    "28 + 12 (pawpaws) = 40.",
    "So, 40 fruits are accounted for by mangoes, pears, and pawpaws.",
    "Since the total number of fruits is 58, I should subtract the 40 fruits from the total to find the number of fruits in the remaining two baskets.",
    "58 - 40 = 18.",
    "The two baskets contain 18 fruits in total, and both baskets have the same number of fruits.",
    "To find the number of fruits in each of these two baskets, divide the total number of fruits in the two baskets by 2.",
    "18 / 2 = 9.",
    "So there are 9 lemons in one of the baskets."

  "solution": "9"
