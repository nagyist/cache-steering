  "query": "Phantom's mom gave him $50 to buy printer-inks. At the store, he bought two black printer inks which cost $11 each, three red printer inks which cost $15 each, and two yellow printer inks which cost $13 each. Phantom found out that his money is not enough to buy all the printer inks. How much more money should he ask his mom to be able to buy the printer inks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the black printer inks. Each black ink costs $11, and Phantom bought two.",
    "The total cost for the black inks is 2 * $11 = $22.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the red printer inks. Each red ink costs $15, and Phantom bought three.",
    "The total cost for the red inks is 3 * $15 = $45.",
    "Then, I calculate the total cost of the yellow printer inks. Each yellow ink costs $13, and Phantom bought two.",
    "The total cost for the yellow inks is 2 * $13 = $26.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost for all the printer inks combined.",
    "The total cost for all printer inks is $22 (black) + $45 (red) + $26 (yellow) = $93.",
    "Phantom's mom gave him $50, so I need to calculate how much more money he needs to buy all the printer inks.",
    "The additional money needed is $93 (total cost) - $50 (money Phantom has) = $43."

  "solution": "43"
