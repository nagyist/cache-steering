  "query": "A 20 person classroom is filled with 40% girls. If 5 new boys join the classroom, what is the new percentage of girls in the class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the current number of girls in the classroom.",
    "The problem states that 40% of the 20-person classroom are girls.",
    "I calculate 40% of 20 to find the number of girls: 0.40 * 20 = 8.",
    "There are currently 8 girls in the classroom.",
    "Next, I need to consider what happens when 5 new boys join the class.",
    "Initially, there are 20 students in the class. Adding 5 new boys gives us 25 students in total.",
    "Now, I must find the new percentage of the class that is girls.",
    "The number of girls remains the same, which is 8.",
    "The new total number of students is 25.",
    "To calculate the percentage of the class that is girls, I divide the number of girls by the total number of students and multiply by 100.",
    "The calculation is (8 / 25) * 100.",
    "(8 / 25) equals 0.32.",
    "Now I multiply 0.32 by 100 to find the percentage: 0.32 * 100 = 32.",
    "The new percentage of girls in the classroom is 32%."
