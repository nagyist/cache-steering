  "query": "Sally teaches elementary school and is given $320 to spend on books for her students. A reading book costs $12 and there are 30 students in her class. Unfortunately, if the money she is given by the school to pay for books is not sufficient, she will need to pay the rest out of pocket. How much money does Sally need to pay out of pocket, to buy every student a reading book?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost for purchasing reading books for all 30 students.",
    "Each reading book costs $12.",
    "The total cost for 30 students will be 30 multiplied by $12.",
    "Calculate 30 x $12 = $360.",
    "I now know that the total cost of books for all the students is $360.",
    "Sally has $320 provided by the school to spend on books.",
    "To find out how much Sally would need to pay out of pocket, I need to subtract the amount given by the school from the total cost.",
    "Calculate $360 (total cost) - $320 (amount provided) = $40.",
    "Sally needs to pay $40 out of pocket to cover the difference."

  "solution": "40"
