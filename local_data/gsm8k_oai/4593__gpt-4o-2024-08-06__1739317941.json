  "query": "Brittany uses 1/4 ounce of shampoo to wash her hair every other day. She buys shampoo in 14-ounce bottles. How many bottles does she need to get her through a leap year?",
  "steps": [
    "A leap year has 366 days.",
    "Brittany washes her hair every other day, so I need to find out how many days in a leap year she washes her hair.",
    "Since she uses shampoo every other day, she washes her hair 366 / 2 = 183 times in a leap year.",
    "Brittany uses 1/4 ounce of shampoo each time she washes her hair.",
    "I need to calculate the total amount of shampoo she uses in a leap year by multiplying the number of washes by the amount of shampoo per wash.",
    "Total shampoo used in a year = 183 washes * 1/4 ounce per wash = 45.75 ounces.",
    "Each bottle contains 14 ounces of shampoo.",
    "I need to find out how many 14-ounce bottles are needed to provide 45.75 ounces of shampoo.",
    "To do this, I need to divide the total amount of shampoo needed by the amount of shampoo per bottle: 45.75 ounces / 14 ounces per bottle.",
    "45.75 / 14 = approximately 3.268",
    "Since Brittany can't purchase a fraction of a bottle, she needs to round up to the next whole number.",
    "Therefore, Brittany needs 4 bottles of shampoo to get through a leap year."
