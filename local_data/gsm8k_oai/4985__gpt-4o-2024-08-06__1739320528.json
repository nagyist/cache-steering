  "query": "A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?",
  "steps": [
    "The length of the larger rectangle is given as 40 meters.",
    "The smaller rectangle has half the length of the larger rectangle.",
    "Half of 40 meters is 20 meters.",
    "The width of the larger rectangle is given as 20 meters.",
    "The smaller rectangle has half the width of the larger rectangle.",
    "Half of 20 meters is 10 meters.",
    "Now, I have the dimensions of the smaller rectangle: a length of 20 meters and a width of 10 meters.",
    "To find the area of a rectangle, I multiply its length by its width.",
    "I multiply 20 meters by 10 meters to find the area.",
    "20 meters times 10 meters equals 200 square meters."
