  "query": "Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, how old is Kody?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Mohamed's current age.",
    "I know Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old.",
    "Twice 30 is \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\).",
    "So, Mohamed is currently 60 years old.",
    "I need to find Kody's age four years ago.",
    "Four years ago, Mohamed was \\(60 - 4 = 56\\) years old.",
    "At that time, Kody was half as old as Mohamed.",
    "Half of 56 is \\(56 \\div 2 = 28\\).",
    "Therefore, four years ago, Kody was 28 years old.",
    "To find Kody's current age, I add 4 years to 28.",
    "So, Kody's current age is \\(28 + 4 = 32\\)."

  "solution": "32"
