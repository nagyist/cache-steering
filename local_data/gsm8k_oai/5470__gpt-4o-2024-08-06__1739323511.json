  "query": "Henry went to the beach and picked up 17 perfect shells and 52 broken shells. Out of those 52 broken shells, half of them were spiral. Out of the 17 perfect shells, 12 of them were not spiral. How many more broken spiral shells were there than perfect spiral shells?",
  "steps": [
    "Henry picked up a total of 17 perfect shells and 52 broken shells.",
    "Out of the 52 broken shells, half of them were spiral. To find half of 52, I divide 52 by 2.",
    "52 divided by 2 is 26, so there are 26 broken spiral shells.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many perfect shells are spiral. Out of the 17 perfect shells, 12 are not spiral.",
    "To find how many perfect shells are spiral, I subtract the 12 non-spiral perfect shells from the total perfect shells.",
    "The equation is 17 - 12, which equals 5. So there are 5 perfect spiral shells.",
    "Now I compare the number of broken spiral shells to the number of perfect spiral shells.",
    "There are 26 broken spiral shells and 5 perfect spiral shells.",
    "To find how many more broken spiral shells there are than perfect spiral shells, I subtract the number of perfect spiral shells from the number of broken spiral shells.",
    "26 - 5 equals 21."
