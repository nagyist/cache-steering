  "query": "Mr. Gardner bakes 20 cookies, 25 cupcakes, and 35 brownies for his second-grade class of 20 students. If he wants to give each student an equal amount of sweet treats, how many sweet treats will each student receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of sweet treats Mr. Gardner has baked.",
    "He baked 20 cookies, 25 cupcakes, and 35 brownies.",
    "I will add these numbers together to find the total number of treats.",
    "20 (cookies) + 25 (cupcakes) = 45",
    "45 + 35 (brownies) = 80",
    "So, Mr. Gardner baked a total of 80 sweet treats.",
    "There are 20 students in his class.",
    "To find out how many treats each student will receive, I need to divide the total number of treats by the number of students.",
    "80 (total treats) \u00f7 20 (students) = 4",
    "Each student will receive 4 sweet treats."

  "solution": "4"
