  "query": "Abigail collected 2 boxes of cookies for the bake sale. Grayson collected 3 quarters of a box, and Olivia collected 3 boxes. Assuming that each box contains 48 cookies, how many cookies did they collect in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Abigail collected 2 boxes of cookies.",
    "Each box contains 48 cookies.",
    "To find how many cookies Abigail collected, calculate 2 boxes \u00d7 48 cookies/box.",
    "2 \u00d7 48 = 96 cookies.",
    "Abigail collected 96 cookies.",
    "Grayson collected 3 quarters of a box.",
    "3 quarters of a box is the same as 0.75 boxes.",
    "To find how many cookies Grayson collected, calculate 0.75 boxes \u00d7 48 cookies/box.",
    "0.75 \u00d7 48 = 36 cookies.",
    "Grayson collected 36 cookies.",
    "Olivia collected 3 boxes.",
    "To find how many cookies Olivia collected, calculate 3 boxes \u00d7 48 cookies/box.",
    "3 \u00d7 48 = 144 cookies.",
    "Olivia collected 144 cookies.",
    "Now, add the total number of cookies collected by Abigail, Grayson, and Olivia together.",
    "96 (Abigail's cookies) + 36 (Grayson's cookies) + 144 (Olivia's cookies) = 276 cookies."
