    "I'm given that Grace's mother is 80 years old.",
    "The problem states that Grace's grandmother is twice the age of Grace's mother.",
    "Therefore, I can calculate Grace's grandmother's age by multiplying Grace's mother's age by 2.",
    "Grace's grandmother's age is 80 years * 2 = 160 years.",
    "I need to determine Grace's age, which is given as 3/8th the age of her grandmother.",
    "I calculate 3/8th of Grace's grandmother's age: (3/8) * 160.",
    "First, I'll divide 160 by 8, which equals 20.",
    "Next, I multiply 20 by 3 to get the value for Grace's age.",
    "20 * 3 = 60."
