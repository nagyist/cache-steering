  "query": "Kris has been suspended for bullying many times.  For every instance of bullying, she was suspended for 3 days.  If she has been suspended for three times as many days as a typical person has fingers and toes, how many instances of bullying is she responsible for?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many days Kris was suspended for based on the information about fingers and toes.",
    "A typical person has 10 fingers and 10 toes, which totals 20 fingers and toes.",
    "According to the problem, Kris has been suspended for three times the number of a typical person's fingers and toes.",
    "Thus, I need to multiply the total number of fingers and toes (20) by 3.",
    "20 \u00d7 3 = 60",
    "Kris has been suspended for a total of 60 days.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many instances of bullying occurred. Each instance results in a suspension of 3 days.",
    "To find the number of instances, I need to divide the total number of suspended days by 3.",
    "60 \u00f7 3 = 20",
    "Kris is responsible for 20 instances of bullying."

  "solution": "20"
