  "query": "Jerica is twice Louis' age. Matilda is 7 years older than Jerica. If Louis is 14, how many years old is Matilda?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Jerica's age. I know Jerica is twice Louis' age.",
    "Louis is 14 years old.",
    "Since Jerica is twice Louis' age, I calculate Jerica's age by multiplying Louis' age by 2.",
    "Thus, Jerica's age is 14 * 2 = 28 years old.",
    "Next, I need to determine Matilda's age. I know Matilda is 7 years older than Jerica.",
    "Jerica is 28 years old, so I add 7 to Jerica's age to find Matilda's age.",
    "Matilda's age is 28 + 7 = 35 years old."

  "solution": "35"
