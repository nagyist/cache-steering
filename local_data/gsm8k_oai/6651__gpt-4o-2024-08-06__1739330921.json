  "query": "There are 285 sweets in the bowl. If 49 of the sweets are red and 59 of the sweets are green, how many of the sweets are neither red nor green?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of sweets that are either red or green.",
    "I know there are 49 red sweets and 59 green sweets.",
    "I will add the number of red sweets and green sweets together: 49 + 59.",
    "Performing the addition: 49 + 59 = 108.",
    "Now I know there are 108 sweets that are either red or green.",
    "The total number of sweets in the bowl is 285.",
    "To find out how many sweets are neither red nor green, I need to subtract the number of red and green sweets from the total number of sweets.",
    "Performing the subtraction: 285 - 108.",
    "Subtracting gives me 177.",
    "This means there are 177 sweets that are neither red nor green."
