  "query": "The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?",
  "steps": [
    "Let me first calculate the total sum of ages for the three friends. The average age is given as 40 for the three friends.",
    "To find the total sum, I'll multiply the average age by the number of friends: 40 * 3 = 120.",
    "So, the total sum of their ages is 120.",
    "I know that Molly is 30 years old.",
    "Since Molly is 30, I'll subtract her age from the total sum: 120 - 30 = 90.",
    "Now, 90 is the combined age of Jared and Hakimi.",
    "I'm given that Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi.",
    "Let Hakimi's age be x. Thus, Jared's age will be x + 10.",
    "Their combined age is x + (x + 10) which equals 90.",
    "I will solve for x: x + x + 10 = 90.",
    "Simplify the equation: 2x + 10 = 90.",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 80.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to get x: x = 40.",
    "Hakimi's age is 40."
