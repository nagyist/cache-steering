    "First, I know that Max can mow the lawn in 40 minutes.",
    "Next, since it takes him twice as long to fertilize the lawn, I need to find how long it takes to fertilize.",
    "Twice the time of mowing is 2 times 40 minutes.",
    "2 times 40 minutes is 80 minutes.",
    "Now, I have the time for mowing and the time for fertilizing.",
    "Mowing takes 40 minutes and fertilizing takes 80 minutes.",
    "To find out how long it takes to do both tasks, I need to add the two times together.",
    "40 minutes + 80 minutes is 120 minutes."
