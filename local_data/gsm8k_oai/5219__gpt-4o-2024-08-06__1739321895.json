  "query": "Anne drops a mirror and breaks it into 60 pieces. She sweeps up half of them, then her cat steals 3 pieces and her boyfriend picks up 1/3 of the remaining pieces. How many pieces does her boyfriend pick up?",
  "steps": [
    "Anne initially breaks the mirror into 60 pieces.",
    "She sweeps up half of the pieces.",
    "Half of 60 is 30, so she sweeps up 30 pieces.",
    "After sweeping, there are 60 - 30 = 30 pieces left.",
    "Her cat then steals 3 pieces.",
    "After the cat steals 3 pieces, there are 30 - 3 = 27 pieces remaining.",
    "Her boyfriend picks up 1/3 of the remaining pieces, which is 27 pieces.",
    "To find 1/3 of 27, I divide 27 by 3.",
    "27 divided by 3 is 9.",
    "Therefore, her boyfriend picks up 9 pieces."
