  "query": "Keith and Blaine went fishing. Blaine caught 5 fish while Keith caught twice as many as Blaine's. How many fish did they catch together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many fish Keith caught.",
    "I know that Blaine caught 5 fish.",
    "Keith caught twice as many fish as Blaine.",
    "To find out how many fish Keith caught, I need to multiply the number of fish Blaine caught by 2.",
    "5 (number of fish caught by Blaine) multiplied by 2 equals 10.",
    "So, Keith caught 10 fish.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many fish they caught together.",
    "To do this, I add the number of fish Keith caught to the number of fish Blaine caught.",
    "Blaine caught 5 fish and Keith caught 10 fish.",
    "5 plus 10 equals 15."
