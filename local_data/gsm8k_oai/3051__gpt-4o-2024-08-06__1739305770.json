  "query": "It cost 50 dollars to get cats ready for adoption, 100 dollars to get adult dogs ready for adoption, and 150 to get puppies ready for adoption.  If 2 cats, 3 adult dogs, and 2 puppies are adopted what was the cost to get them ready?",
  "steps": [
    "I first need to determine the cost to get the 2 cats ready for adoption.",
    "The cost to get one cat ready is 50 dollars.",
    "So, for 2 cats, it would be 2 times 50 dollars.",
    "2 times 50 equals 100.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost for the 3 adult dogs.",
    "The cost to get one adult dog ready is 100 dollars.",
    "Thus, for 3 adult dogs, it would be 3 times 100 dollars.",
    "3 times 100 equals 300.",
    "Now, I calculate the cost for the 2 puppies.",
    "The cost to get one puppy ready is 150 dollars.",
    "So, for 2 puppies, it would be 2 times 150 dollars.",
    "2 times 150 equals 300.",
    "Finally, I add the costs of getting cats, adult dogs, and puppies ready.",
    "The total cost is 100 (cats) plus 300 (adult dogs) plus 300 (puppies).",
    "100 plus 300 equals 400.",
    "400 plus 300 equals 700."

  "solution": "700"
