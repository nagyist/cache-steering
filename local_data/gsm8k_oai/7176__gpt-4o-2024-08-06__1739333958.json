  "query": "Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal.  It takes him 3 times that long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.  How many years did he spend in high school and college?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve the problem, I first need to understand what \"in 1 year less than normal\" means for finishing high school.",
    "Assuming that the \"normal\" duration to finish high school is 4 years.",
    "If Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than the normal duration, it means he finishes high school in 4 - 1 = 3 years.",
    "The problem states that it takes him 3 times as long as the duration of high school to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.",
    "This means, if high school took 3 years, his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. take 3 times that duration.",
    "Calculating the duration for his bachelor's degree and Ph.D: 3 years (high school duration) x 3 = 9 years.",
    "Next, I add the time spent in high school and in college to find the total number of years spent.",
    "3 years (high school) + 9 years (college) = 12 years in total."

  "solution": "12"
