  "query": "Manny had 3 birthday cookie pies to share with his 24 classmates and his teacher, Mr. Keith.   If each of the cookie pies were cut into 10 slices and Manny, his classmates, and Mr. Keith all had 1 piece, how many slices are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Manny has 3 birthday cookie pies.",
    "Each cookie pie is cut into 10 slices.",
    "To find the total number of slices from all pies, multiply the number of pies by the number of slices per pie: \n3 pies * 10 slices per pie = 30 slices.",
    "Manny wants to share the slices with 24 classmates and 1 teacher.",
    "Including Manny, the total number of people is: \n1 (Manny) + 24 (classmates) + 1 (teacher) = 26 people.",
    "Each person, including Manny, gets 1 slice.",
    "To find out how many slices are distributed, it's simply 1 slice per person: \n26 people * 1 slice per person = 26 slices.",
    "Now, subtract the number of slices distributed from the total slices to find out how many slices are left: \n30 total slices - 26 slices distributed = 4 slices left."
