  "query": "Maria buys a large bar of French soap that lasts her for 2 months.  She spends $8.00 per bar of soap.  If she wants to stock up for the entire year, how much will she spend on soap?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bars of soap Maria needs for the entire year.",
    "I know that 1 bar lasts for 2 months.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "To find out how many bars are needed for 12 months, I divide 12 months by 2 months per bar.",
    "12 divided by 2 equals 6 bars.",
    "Now, I know Maria needs 6 bars of soap for the year.",
    "Each bar of soap costs $8.00.",
    "To find out the total cost, I need to multiply the number of bars by the cost per bar.",
    "6 bars multiplied by $8.00 per bar equals $48.00."
