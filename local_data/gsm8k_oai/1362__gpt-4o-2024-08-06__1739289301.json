  "query": "Joanna and Jacques had 40 and 60 gumballs, respectively, in their dishes. They then purchased 4 times the number of gumballs they had initially and added these to their dishes. If they decided to put together their gumballs and shared them equally, how many gumballs did each get?",
  "steps": [
    "Joanna starts with 40 gumballs.",
    "Jacques starts with 60 gumballs.",
    "Joanna purchases 4 times the number of gumballs she had initially, which is 4 * 40 = 160 gumballs.",
    "Jacques purchases 4 times the number of gumballs he had initially, which is 4 * 60 = 240 gumballs.",
    "Joanna now has 40 + 160 = 200 gumballs in total.",
    "Jacques now has 60 + 240 = 300 gumballs in total.",
    "Together, they now have 200 + 300 = 500 gumballs.",
    "They decide to share the 500 gumballs equally between the two of them.",
    "To share 500 gumballs equally, divide by 2: 500 / 2 = 250 gumballs."
