  "query": "Monica made cookies for herself and her family. Her father ate 10 cookies and her mother ate half as much as the father. Her brother ate 2 more than her mother. How many cookies are left for Monica if she made 30 cookies in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Monica made 30 cookies in total.",
    "Her father ate 10 cookies.",
    "Her mother ate half as much as the father, which is 10 / 2 = 5 cookies.",
    "Her brother ate 2 more than her mother, which is 5 + 2 = 7 cookies.",
    "Now I need to add up the cookies eaten by her father, mother, and brother to find out how many were eaten in total.",
    "The total cookies eaten is 10 (father) + 5 (mother) + 7 (brother) = 22 cookies.",
    "To find out how many cookies are left for Monica, I subtract the total cookies eaten from the total cookies made.",
    "Remaining cookies for Monica = 30 (total made) - 22 (eaten) = 8 cookies."
