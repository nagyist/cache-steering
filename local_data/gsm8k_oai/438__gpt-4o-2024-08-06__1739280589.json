  "query": "While Greg was camping with his family for a week, it rained for 3 days. When he looked at the weather records, he saw that the amount of rain was 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm on the three days. During the same week, it rained 26 mm at his house. How much less rain did Greg experience while camping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping.",
    "Greg recorded 3 days of rain with amounts of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm.",
    "To find the total, I will add these amounts together: 3 mm + 6 mm + 5 mm.",
    "3 mm + 6 mm = 9 mm.",
    "9 mm + 5 mm = 14 mm.",
    "So, the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping is 14 mm.",
    "Next, I will determine how much rain fell at Greg's house during the same week.",
    "The amount of rain at his house was 26 mm.",
    "To find how much less rain Greg experienced, I need to subtract the rain experienced while camping from the rain at his house.",
    "That means I need to calculate 26 mm - 14 mm.",
    "26 mm - 14 mm = 12 mm."
  ],
  "solution": "12"
