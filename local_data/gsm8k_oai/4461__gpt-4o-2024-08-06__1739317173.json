Her co-teacher asked her to substitute for her fifth-grade class that has half as many students as the number of third-graders. How many students did Ms. Hatcher teach for the day?",
  "steps": [
    "Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders.",
    "The number of fourth-grade students is twice the number of third-graders.",
    "Calculate the number of fourth graders: 2 times 20 = 40.",
    "Her co-teacher's fifth-grade class has half as many students as the third-graders.",
    "Calculate the number of fifth graders: 20 divided by 2 = 10.",
    "Add the number of third, fourth, and fifth graders together to find the total number of students Ms. Hatcher taught for the day.",
    "Number of students: 20 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 10 (fifth-graders) = 70."
