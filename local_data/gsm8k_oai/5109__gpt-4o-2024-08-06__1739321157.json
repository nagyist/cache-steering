  "query": "The total mask production was doubled every month by a company after the outbreak of Coronavirus due to increased demand. If the company produced 3000 masks in March, calculate the total mask production of July.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the pattern of production. The production doubles each month.",
    "The company produced 3000 masks in March. So for April, the production will be double of March.",
    "In April, the production is 3000 masks * 2 = 6000 masks.",
    "In May, the production will be double of April. So it will be 6000 masks * 2 = 12000 masks.",
    "In June, the production will be double of May. So it will be 12000 masks * 2 = 24000 masks.",
    "In July, the production will be double of June. So it will be 24000 masks * 2 = 48000 masks."

  "solution": "48000"
