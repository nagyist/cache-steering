  "query": "Ernie's income is 4/5 of what it used to be and Jack's income is now twice what Ernie used to make. How much do they earn combined if Ernie used to make $6000?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine Ernie's old income. It is given that Ernie used to make $6000.",
    "Now calculate Ernie's current income. His current income is 4/5 of his old income.",
    "Let's calculate this: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 6000 = 4800 \\). So, Ernie now makes $4800.",
    "Next, calculate Jack's current income. Jack's income is twice what Ernie used to make.",
    "Jack's income is \\( 2 \\times 6000 = 12000 \\). So, Jack now makes $12000.",
    "Now, we sum Ernie's and Jack's current incomes to find how much they earn combined.",
    "Add Ernie's current income of $4800 and Jack's current income of $12000.",
    "This addition results in \\( 4800 + 12000 = 16800 \\)."

  "solution": "16800"
