  "query": "Toby is counting goldfish in the local pond. He knows that only 25% of goldfish are at the surface and the rest are too deep below the surface to be able to see. If he counts 15 goldfish, how many are below the surface?",
  "steps": [
    "Toby has counted 15 goldfish at the surface of the pond.",
    "He knows that these 15 goldfish represent 25% of all the goldfish in the pond.",
    "I need to find out what 100% of the goldfish would be if 15 is 25%.",
    "If 15 represents 25%, then we can set up the equation 0.25 * Total = 15.",
    "To find the total number of goldfish, I divide 15 by 0.25.",
    "15 divided by 0.25 equals 60.",
    "This means there are a total of 60 goldfish in the pond.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many goldfish are below the surface.",
    "The goldfish below the surface would be the remainder, or 100% - 25% = 75% of all goldfish.",
    "75% of 60 goldfish is calculated by multiplying 60 by 0.75.",
    "60 times 0.75 equals 45.",
    "Therefore, there are 45 goldfish below the surface."
