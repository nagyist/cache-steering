  "query": "Paul earns $12.50 for each hour that he works. He then has to pay 20% for taxes and fees. After working 40 hours, Paul receives his paycheck. If he spends 15% of his paycheck on gummy bears, how much, in dollars, does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Paul earns $12.50 per hour.",
    "Paul works for 40 hours.",
    "To calculate his total earnings before taxes, I need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked: $12.50 * 40 hours = $500.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the taxes and fees. Paul has to pay 20% of his earnings in taxes and fees.",
    "20% of $500 is calculated as (20/100) * $500 = $100.",
    "To find out how much Paul earns after taxes, subtract the taxes from his initial earnings: $500 - $100 = $400.",
    "Now, Paul spends 15% of his post-tax earnings on gummy bears.",
    "15% of $400 is calculated as (15/100) * $400 = $60.",
    "Finally, to find out how much Paul has left after buying gummy bears, subtract the amount spent on gummy bears from his earnings after taxes: $400 - $60 = $340."
