  "query": "Jorge and Giuliana each eat 7 croissants for breakfast, 18 cakes after school, and 30 pizzas before bedtime. What is the total number of croissants, cakes, and pizzas the two consume in a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate the total number of croissants eaten by both Jorge and Giuliana.",
    "Jorge eats 7 croissants and Giuliana eats 7 croissants.",
    "The total number of croissants they both eat is 7 + 7 = 14 croissants.",
    "Next, let's calculate the total number of cakes eaten by both Jorge and Giuliana.",
    "Jorge eats 18 cakes and Giuliana eats 18 cakes.",
    "The total number of cakes they both eat is 18 + 18 = 36 cakes.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both Jorge and Giuliana.",
    "Jorge eats 30 pizzas and Giuliana eats 30 pizzas.",
    "The total number of pizzas they both eat is 30 + 30 = 60 pizzas.",
    "Now, let's add up the total amounts of croissants, cakes, and pizzas.",
    "Total amount of croissants is 14, cakes is 36, and pizzas is 60.",
    "The total number of items consumed is 14 croissants + 36 cakes + 60 pizzas.",
    "14 + 36 = 50.",
    "50 + 60 = 110."
