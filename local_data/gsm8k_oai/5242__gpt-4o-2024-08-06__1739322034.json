  "query": "Willy has 10 stuffed animals. His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals for his birthday. After his birthday, if his dad gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has, how many stuffed animals does Willy have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Willy initially has 10 stuffed animals.",
    "His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals.",
    "After receiving 2 more stuffed animals, Willy now has 10 + 2 = 12 stuffed animals.",
    "His dad then gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he currently has.",
    "3 times more stuffed animals than 12 means his dad gives him 3 * 12 = 36 stuffed animals.",
    "Adding the stuffed animals from his dad to his current total, Willy has 12 + 36 stuffed animals.",
    "Willy now has a total of 48 stuffed animals."
