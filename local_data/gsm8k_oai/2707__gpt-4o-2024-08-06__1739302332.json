  "steps": [
    "Renaldo drove 15 kilometers.",
    "First, calculate one-third of Renaldo's distance.",
    "One-third of Renaldo's distance is 15 kilometers divided by 3.",
    "15 divided by 3 equals 5 kilometers.",
    "Next, calculate how far Ernesto drove.",
    "Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than one-third of Renaldo's distance, which is 5 kilometers.",
    "Add 7 kilometers to 5 kilometers to find Ernesto's distance.",
    "5 plus 7 equals 12 kilometers.",
    "Now, add the distances driven by both Renaldo and Ernesto to find the total distance.",
    "Renaldo drove 15 kilometers and Ernesto drove 12 kilometers.",
    "Add 15 kilometers to 12 kilometers.",
    "15 plus 12 equals 27 kilometers."
