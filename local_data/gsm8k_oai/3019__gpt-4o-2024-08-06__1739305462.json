  "query": "Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Janelle initially had 26 green marbles.",
    "She bought 6 bags of blue marbles.",
    "Each bag contained 10 marbles.",
    "The total number of blue marbles she bought is 6 bags * 10 marbles per bag = 60 blue marbles.",
    "Now, Janelle has 26 green marbles and 60 blue marbles.",
    "Janelle created a gift with 6 green marbles.",
    "After giving the gift, she has 26 - 6 = 20 green marbles left.",
    "Janelle created a gift with 8 blue marbles.",
    "After giving the gift, she has 60 - 8 = 52 blue marbles left.",
    "Total marbles remaining with Janelle = 20 green marbles + 52 blue marbles.",
    "Total remaining marbles = 20 + 52 = 72 marbles."
