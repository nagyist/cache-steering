  "query": "Amanda received $50 as a gift. She plans to buy two cassette tapes that cost $9 each and a headphone set that costs $25. How much money will she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Amanda received a total of $50.",
    "Each cassette tape costs $9.",
    "Amanda plans to buy two cassette tapes.",
    "The total cost for two cassette tapes is 2 times $9.",
    "2 multiplied by 9 equals $18.",
    "A headphone set costs $25.",
    "Amanda plans to buy the headphone set as well.",
    "The total cost for the headphone set is $25.",
    "Now, I will add the total costs of the cassette tapes and the headphone set: $18 + $25.",
    "$18 plus $25 equals $43.",
    "Amanda's total expenses amount to $43.",
    "She received $50 as a gift and spent $43.",
    "To find out how much money she will have left, I need to subtract $43 from $50.",
    "$50 minus $43 equals $7.",
    "Therefore, Amanda will have $7 left after her purchases."
