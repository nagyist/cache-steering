  "query": "Arthur has 3 dogs. They eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week. One dog eats 13 pounds a week. The second eats double this. How much does the third dog eat a week?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find how much the third dog eats per week in pounds.",
    "I know the first dog eats 13 pounds per week.",
    "The second dog eats double the amount the first dog eats.",
    "So, the second dog eats 13 * 2 = 26 pounds per week.",
    "I know the average amount of food eaten by all 3 dogs per week is 15 pounds.",
    "The total food eaten by all 3 dogs is 3 dogs * 15 pounds = 45 pounds per week.",
    "I need to calculate how much the third dog eats by subtracting the amount the first and second dogs eat from the total.",
    "The first and second dogs eat 13 + 26 = 39 pounds collectively.",
    "Subtracting from the total gives 45 - 39 = 6 pounds per week for the third dog."
