  "query": "Holden's current master bedroom is 309 sq ft and his master bath is 150 sq ft.  If he wants to add a home office/personal gym divided space that is twice as large as his bedroom and bathroom, how much sq ft will this new room have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total size of Holden's current master bedroom and master bath.",
    "The master bedroom is 309 sq ft, and the master bath is 150 sq ft.",
    "I add these two areas together: 309 sq ft + 150 sq ft.",
    "Calculating this gives a total of 459 sq ft for both the bedroom and bathroom.",
    "Now, I need to find out the size of the new home office/personal gym space Holden wants, which is twice the area of his current bedroom and bathroom combined.",
    "I multiply the total area (459 sq ft) by 2 to find the size of the new room.",
    "459 sq ft * 2 equals 918 sq ft."
  ],
  "solution": "918"
