  "query": "If one Burmese python can eat one 50-cm alligator per week, how many Burmese pythons would it take to eat fifteen 50-centimeter alligators in three weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that one Burmese python can eat one 50-cm alligator per week.",
    "I'm asked to find how many Burmese pythons are needed to eat fifteen 50-cm alligators in three weeks.",
    "First, I will calculate how many alligators one python can eat in three weeks.",
    "Since one python eats one alligator per week, in three weeks, one python can eat three alligators.",
    "Now, let's figure out the total alligators that need to be eaten, which is fifteen alligators.",
    "I need to calculate how many pythons are required to eat fifteen alligators if one python can eat three alligators in three weeks.",
    "To find the number of pythons needed, I will divide the total number of alligators by the number one python can eat in three weeks: 15 alligators / 3 alligators per python = 5 pythons."
