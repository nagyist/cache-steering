  "query": "Akeno spent $2985 to furnish his apartment. Lev spent one-third of that amount on his apartment and Ambrocio spent $177 less than Lev. How many dollars more did Akeno spend than the other 2 people combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Lev spent on furnishing his apartment.",
    "Lev spent one-third of what Akeno spent. So, I need to calculate one-third of $2985.",
    "To find one-third of $2985, I divide $2985 by 3.",
    "$2985 divided by 3 is equal to $995.",
    "Now, I know Lev spent $995.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Ambrocio spent.",
    "Ambrocio spent $177 less than Lev. So, I need to subtract $177 from Lev's expenditure.",
    "$995 minus $177 equals $818.",
    "Now, I know Ambrocio spent $818.",
    "To find the total amount Lev and Ambrocio spent together, I need to add their expenditures.",
    "Lev spent $995 and Ambrocio spent $818.",
    "I add $995 and $818 to get the combined expenditure of Lev and Ambrocio.",
    "$995 plus $818 equals $1813.",
    "Now, I know Lev and Ambrocio together spent $1813.",
    "I need to find out how much more Akeno spent compared to the combined total of Lev and Ambrocio.",
    "Akeno spent $2985, and Lev and Ambrocio together spent $1813.",
    "To find the amount more Akeno spent, I subtract the combined total from Akeno's expenditure.",
    "$2985 minus $1813 equals $1172."
