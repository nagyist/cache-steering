  "query": "Peter is raking leaves. It takes him 15 minutes to rake 3 bags of leaves. If he keeps raking at the same rate, how long will it take him to rake 8 bags?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Peter's raking rate.",
    "He takes 15 minutes to rake 3 bags.",
    "To find the rate, divide the time by the number of bags: 15 minutes / 3 bags = 5 minutes per bag.",
    "Now, I know it takes Peter 5 minutes to rake one bag of leaves.",
    "The question asks how long it will take him to rake 8 bags.",
    "If it takes 5 minutes for one bag, then for 8 bags it will take 8 * 5 minutes.",
    "Calculate 8 * 5 = 40."

  "solution": "40"
