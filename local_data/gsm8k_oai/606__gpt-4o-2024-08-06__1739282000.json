  "query": "In a big box, there are marbles in 4 colors. Inside, there are 20 red marbles.  There are three times more green marbles than red.  Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. How many marbles are of a different color if the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of green marbles. There are three times more green marbles than red marbles.",
    "The problem states there are 20 red marbles.",
    "So, the number of green marbles is 3 times 20.",
    "3 times 20 is 60, so there are 60 green marbles.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of yellow marbles, which make up 20% of the green marbles.",
    "To find 20% of the 60 green marbles, I multiply 60 by 0.20.",
    "0.20 multiplied by 60 is 12. So, there are 12 yellow marbles.",
    "The total number of marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles.",
    "This means the total number of marbles is 3 times 60, which equals 180 marbles.",
    "Now I need to determine the number of marbles of a different color (other than red, green, or yellow).",
    "Currently, I have accounted for 20 red, 60 green, and 12 yellow marbles.",
    "I add 20, 60, and 12 to find the total number of red, green, and yellow marbles.",
    "20 plus 60 plus 12 equals 92 marbles.",
    "Therefore, the number of marbles of a different color is the total number of marbles minus the number of red, green, and yellow marbles.",
    "180 minus 92 equals 88."
