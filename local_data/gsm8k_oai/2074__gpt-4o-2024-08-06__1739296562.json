  "query": "Samanta is planning a party for her friend Marta. She decided to raise some money among the guests she invited, to buy Marta a gift. Every participant gave Samanta $5 for this purpose and she herself put in $10. The gift cost was lower than expected, so there was $15 leftover. What was the price of the gift, if there were 12 guests invited?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money was collected in total from the guests for the gift.",
    "There were 12 guests, and each guest contributed $5.",
    "So, the total contribution from the guests is 12 multiplied by 5, which is $60.",
    "Samanta also contributed $10 herself.",
    "Adding Samanta's contribution to the guests' contribution, the total money collected is $60 + $10.",
    "The total money collected is $70.",
    "I know there was $15 leftover.",
    "To find the price of the gift, I need to subtract the leftover amount from the total money collected.",
    "So, the price of the gift is $70 - $15."

  "solution": "55"
