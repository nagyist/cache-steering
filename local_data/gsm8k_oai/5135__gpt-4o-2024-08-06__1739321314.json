  "query": "Kerry is ready to celebrate his birthday and wants to have three cakes with his age in candles on each of them. Candles come in boxes of 12 and cost $2.5 a box. If the candles cost $5, how old is Kerry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many boxes of candles Kerry bought for $5.",
    "Each box of candles costs $2.5.",
    "Kerry spent $5 on candles.",
    "To find out how many boxes Kerry bought, I divide the total amount he spent by the cost per box: 5 / 2.5.",
    "5 divided by 2.5 equals 2. So, Kerry bought 2 boxes of candles.",
    "Each box contains 12 candles.",
    "Since Kerry bought 2 boxes, he has 2 x 12 = 24 candles in total.",
    "Kerry wants to have his age in candles on each of the three cakes.",
    "Let x be Kerry's age. The total number of candles needed is 3 times his age, since each cake has his age in candles.",
    "We have the equation 3x = 24.",
    "To find x, I divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 24 / 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8."

  "solution": "8"
