  "query": "Norris saved $29 in September. He saved $25 in October and $31 in November. Then Hugo spent $75 on an online game. How much money does Norris have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Norris saved in September, October, and November.",
    "In September, Norris saved $29.",
    "In October, Norris saved $25.",
    "In November, Norris saved $31.",
    "Now, I will add these amounts together to find the total savings before any spending.",
    "$29 (September) + $25 (October) = $54",
    "$54 + $31 (November) = $85",
    "Norris has $85 in total savings.",
    "Next, I need to account for the $75 that Hugo spent on an online game.",
    "To find out how much money Norris has left, I will subtract the amount Hugo spent from Norris's total savings.",
    "$85 (total savings) - $75 (spent) = $10",
    "Norris has $10 left after the spending."
