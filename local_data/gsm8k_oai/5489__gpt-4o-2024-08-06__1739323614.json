  "query": "Kirsty collects small models of animals. The last time she bought some, each one cost $0.45. She saves enough to buy 30 models, but when she goes to the shop, she finds out that the price had increased to $0.50. How many models can she buy now?",
  "steps": [
    "Kirsty initially planned to buy 30 models at $0.45 each.",
    "First, I will calculate the total amount of money she had saved.",
    "The total cost of 30 models at $0.45 each is calculated as 30 models * $0.45 per model.",
    "30 * 0.45 = $13.50.",
    "Kirsty had saved $13.50.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many models she can buy at the new price of $0.50 each.",
    "To find out how many models she can buy at the new price, divide the total amount of money by the new price per model.",
    "$13.50 / $0.50 = 27 models."
