  "query": "Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to establish a variable for the number of apples Sara ate. Let's call this number \\( S \\).",
    "According to the problem, Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara.",
    "This means Ali ate \\( 4 \\times S \\) apples.",
    "Together, Ali and Sara ate 80 apples.",
    "So, the equation that represents this situation is \\( S + 4 \\times S = 80 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation gives \\( 5S = 80 \\).",
    "To find \\( S \\), I need to divide each side of the equation by 5.",
    "\\( S = 80 \\div 5 = 16 \\).",
    "Therefore, Sara ate 16 apples."
