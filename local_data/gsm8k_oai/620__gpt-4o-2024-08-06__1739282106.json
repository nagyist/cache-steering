  "query": "If seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the number of rabbits in the cage will be 1/3 the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. How many rabbits did Jasper see in the park today?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that there are thirteen rabbits in the cage initially.",
    "We need to add seven more rabbits to the ones in the cage.",
    "Thirteen plus seven equals twenty. So, there are now twenty rabbits in the cage.",
    "The number of rabbits in the cage (twenty) is 1/3 of the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today.",
    "Let \\( x \\) represent the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park.",
    "According to the problem, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 20\\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 20\\).",
    "Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \\( x \\).",
    "\\( x = 20 \\times 3 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 20 \\times 3 \\).",
    "\\( 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\).",
    "So, \\( x = 60 \\).",
    "This means Jasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today."
