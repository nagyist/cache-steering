  "query": "On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how far the ship had traveled before the storm.",
    "The ship was traveling for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.",
    "To calculate the total distance traveled, I multiply time by speed: 20 hours * 30 km/hour = 600 kilometers.",
    "Before the storm, the Skipper was halfway to the destination after traveling 600 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance to the destination must be twice that, which is 1200 kilometers.",
    "After the storm, the Skipper finds himself only one-third of the way to his destination.",
    "One-third of the total distance to the destination is 1200 km / 3 = 400 kilometers.",
    "Before the storm, he was 600 kilometers into his journey. After the storm, he was only 400 kilometers in.",
    "Therefore, the distance the Skipper's ship was blown westward by the storm is the difference between these two distances: 600 km - 400 km = 200 km."
