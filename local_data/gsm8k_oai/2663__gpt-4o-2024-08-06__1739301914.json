  "query": "Nicky is trading baseball cards with Jill. If Nicky trades two cards worth $8 each for 1 card worth $21, how many dollars of profit does he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the value of the cards Nicky is trading away. He is trading two cards, each worth $8.",
    "The total value of the two cards Nicky is trading away is $8 + $8.",
    "Calculating that gives me a total of $16 worth of cards that Nicky is giving to Jill.",
    "Next, I need to think about the value of the card Nicky is receiving. Jill is giving Nicky one card worth $21.",
    "To find the profit Nicky makes, I subtract the total value of the cards he traded away from the value of the card he received.",
    "That means I need to calculate $21 (value of card received) - $16 (total value of cards traded away).",
    "Subtracting those values gives me $5.",
    "I double-check my calculation: $21 - $16 is indeed $5."
