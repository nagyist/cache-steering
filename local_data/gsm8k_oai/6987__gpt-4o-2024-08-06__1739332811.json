  "query": "Because of the migration of salmon, the total number of salmon in river Trout has increased by ten times the number initially in the river. If there were 500 salmons initially, calculate the total number of fish in the river now.",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, I have the number of salmon in river Trout as 500.",
    "The problem states that the total number of salmon has increased by ten times the number initially in the river.",
    "Ten times the initial number of salmon is calculated as 500 * 10.",
    "500 * 10 equals 5000.",
    "To find the total number of salmon currently in the river, I need to add the initial amount to the increase.",
    "This is calculated as the initial number 500 plus the increase 5000.",
    "500 + 5000 equals 5500."

  "solution": "5500"
