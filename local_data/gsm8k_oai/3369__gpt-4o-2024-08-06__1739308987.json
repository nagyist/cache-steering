  "query": "Iris has a berry farm. Her brother and sister help her to pick up the berries and sell them to the market. Iris picked 30 blueberries, her sister picked 20 cranberries, and her brother was able to pick 10 raspberries. If 1/3 of the total berries they were able to pick are rotten and the remaining 1/2 of the fresh berries need to be kept, how many berries will they be able to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of berries picked.",
    "Iris picked 30 blueberries, her sister picked 20 cranberries, and her brother picked 10 raspberries.",
    "The total berries picked = 30 (blueberries) + 20 (cranberries) + 10 (raspberries) = 60 berries.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these berries are rotten.",
    "1/3 of the total berries are rotten.",
    "1/3 of 60 berries = 60 / 3 = 20 rotten berries.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many berries are fresh.",
    "The fresh berries = total berries - rotten berries = 60 - 20 = 40 fresh berries.",
    "It is mentioned that 1/2 of the fresh berries need to be kept.",
    "1/2 of the fresh berries = 40 / 2 = 20 berries need to be kept.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate the number of berries they will be able to sell.",
    "The number of berries they can sell = fresh berries - berries kept = 40 - 20 = 20 berries."

  "solution": "20"
