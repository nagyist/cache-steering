  "query": "Hakeem has always loved artichoke dip and plans to make it this weekend. He has $15 dollars to buy artichokes and can find the rest of the ingredients at home. It takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip. How many ounces can he make if artichokes cost $1.25 each?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many artichokes Hakeem can buy with $15 if each artichoke costs $1.25.",
    "I will divide the total budget by the cost per artichoke: $15 / $1.25.",
    "Calculating this, $15 / $1.25 = 12. Hakeem can buy 12 artichokes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much dip he can make with 12 artichokes.",
    "It takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip. So, I should figure out how many sets of 3 artichokes are in 12.",
    "To find that, I divide 12 artichokes by 3 artichokes per batch: 12 / 3 = 4.",
    "Now I know Hakeem can make 4 batches of dip.",
    "Each batch makes 5 ounces of dip, so I multiply the number of batches by the ounces per batch: 4 batches * 5 ounces per batch.",
    "This calculation gives 20 ounces."

  "solution": "20"
