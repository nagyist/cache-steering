  "steps": [
    "To find the number of judges under 30 years old, I need to calculate 10% of 40.",
    "10% of 40 is calculated as \\( 0.10 \\times 40 = 4 \\).",
    "So, there are 4 judges under 30 years old.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of judges who are 30-50 years old, which is 60% of the total number of judges.",
    "60% of 40 is calculated as \\( 0.60 \\times 40 = 24 \\).",
    "So, there are 24 judges in the 30-50 years old age range.",
    "To find how many judges are over 50 years old, I need to subtract the number of judges under 30 and the number between 30-50 from the total number of judges.",
    "Total judges = 40, judges under 30 = 4, judges 30-50 = 24.",
    "The number of judges over 50 is \\( 40 - 4 - 24 = 12 \\)."
