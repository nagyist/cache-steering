  "steps": [
    "The class has a total of 39 students.",
    "One-third of the class participated in the math competition.",
    "To find out how many students participated, I need to calculate one-third of 39.",
    "One-third of 39 is calculated as 39 divided by 3.",
    "39 divided by 3 equals 13.",
    "So, 13 students participated in the math competition.",
    "Now I need to find out how many students did not participate.",
    "I subtract the number of students who participated (13) from the total number of students (39).",
    "39 minus 13 equals 26."
