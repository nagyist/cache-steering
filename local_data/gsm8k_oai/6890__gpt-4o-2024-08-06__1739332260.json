  "query": "Christopher, Jameson, and June each bought a toy sword. June's sword is 5 inches longer than Jameson's sword. Jameson's sword is 3 inches longer than twice the length of Christopher's sword. Christopher's sword is 15 inches long. How many inches longer is June's sword than Christopher's sword?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know the length of Christopher's sword is 15 inches.",
    "Jameson's sword is 3 inches longer than twice the length of Christopher's sword.",
    "Twice the length of Christopher's sword is 2 * 15 = 30 inches.",
    "Adding 3 inches to this gives the length of Jameson's sword: 30 + 3 = 33 inches.",
    "June's sword is 5 inches longer than Jameson's sword.",
    "Adding 5 inches to the length of Jameson's sword gives the length of June's sword: 33 + 5 = 38 inches.",
    "Now, I need to find how many inches longer June's sword is than Christopher's sword.",
    "The length of June's sword is 38 inches, and the length of Christopher's sword is 15 inches.",
    "Subtracting the length of Christopher's sword from June's sword gives: 38 - 15 = 23 inches."
