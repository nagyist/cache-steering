  "query": "Karlee has 100 grapes and 3/5 as many strawberries as grapes. Giana and Ansley, two of her friends, come visiting, and she gives each of them 1/5 of each fruit. How many fruits is Karlee left with in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many strawberries Karlee has.",
    "Karlee has 3/5 as many strawberries as grapes. She has 100 grapes.",
    "I calculate the number of strawberries: 3/5 of 100 is (3/5) * 100 = 60.",
    "Now, I know Karlee has 100 grapes and 60 strawberries.",
    "I should calculate how many grapes Karlee gives to Giana and Ansley.",
    "Karlee gives 1/5 of her grapes to each Giana and Ansley.",
    "1/5 of 100 grapes is 20 grapes per person.",
    "Since there are two people, Karlee gives a total of 2 * 20 = 40 grapes.",
    "Now, I calculate how many strawberries Karlee gives to Giana and Ansley.",
    "Karlee gives 1/5 of her strawberries to each of them.",
    "1/5 of 60 strawberries is 12 strawberries per person.",
    "Since there are two people, Karlee gives a total of 2 * 12 = 24 strawberries.",
    "Now I need to calculate how many fruits Karlee is left with.",
    "Initially, Karlee had 100 grapes and 60 strawberries which totals to 160 fruits.",
    "Karlee gave away 40 grapes and 24 strawberries which totals to 64 fruits.",
    "To find out how many fruits Karlee is left with, I subtract the fruits given away from the initial total.",
    "160 fruits - 64 fruits = 96 fruits remaining."

  "solution": "96"
