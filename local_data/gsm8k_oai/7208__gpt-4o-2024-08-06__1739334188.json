  "query": "Nalani had two female dogs that were expecting and after a month gave birth to 10 puppies each. She then sold 3/4 of the puppies after they came of age, each at $200. Calculate the total amount of money she received from the sale of the puppies.",
  "steps": [
    "Nalani had two female dogs that gave birth to puppies.",
    "Each dog gave birth to 10 puppies.",
    "Since there are two dogs, the total number of puppies is 2 x 10 puppies = 20 puppies.",
    "Nalani sold 3/4 of the 20 puppies.",
    "First, I need to calculate how many puppies Nalani sold.",
    "3/4 of 20 puppies means 3/4 x 20 = 15 puppies.",
    "Each puppy was sold for $200.",
    "To find the total amount of money received, I need to multiply the number of puppies sold by the price per puppy.",
    "So, 15 puppies x $200 per puppy = $3000."

  "solution": "3000"
