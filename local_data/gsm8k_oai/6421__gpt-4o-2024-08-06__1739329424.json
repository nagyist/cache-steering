  "query": "Allie, Rob, and Allyn each bought a bowl of grapes.  Allie's bowl contained two more grapes than Rob's bowl.  Allyn's bowl contained four more grapes than Allie's bowl.  If Rob's bowl contained 25 grapes, what is the total combined number of grapes in all three bowls?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by identifying how many grapes Rob's bowl contains.",
    "We know that Rob's bowl contains 25 grapes.",
    "Next, let's find out how many grapes Allie's bowl contains.",
    "Allie's bowl contains two more grapes than Rob's bowl.",
    "Since Rob's bowl has 25 grapes, Allie's bowl would have 25 + 2 = 27 grapes.",
    "Now, let's determine how many grapes Allyn's bowl contains.",
    "Allyn's bowl has four more grapes than Allie's bowl.",
    "Since Allie's bowl has 27 grapes, Allyn's bowl would have 27 + 4 = 31 grapes.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total number of grapes in all three bowls combined.",
    "Rob's bowl has 25 grapes, Allie's bowl has 27 grapes, and Allyn's bowl has 31 grapes.",
    "The total combined number of grapes is 25 + 27 + 31.",
    "25 + 27 is 52.",
    "52 + 31 is 83."

  "solution": "83"
