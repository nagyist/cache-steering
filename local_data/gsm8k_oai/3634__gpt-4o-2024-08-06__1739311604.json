She doesn't want to spend much, so she called 3 salons to get their prices: Gustran Salon, Barbara's Shop, and The Fancy Salon. At Gustran Salon, the haircut is $45, the facial cleaning is $22 and the nails are $30. At Barbara's shop, the nails are $40, the haircut is $30 and the facial cleaning is $28. And, at the Fancy Salon, the facial cleaning is $30, the haircut is $34 and the nails are $20. How much would Haily spend at the cheapest salon?",
