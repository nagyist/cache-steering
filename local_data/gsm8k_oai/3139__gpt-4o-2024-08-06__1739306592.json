  "query": "Charley has a bag that contains 51 white beads and 90 black beads. He reaches in the bag and pulls out 1/6 of the black beads and a third of the white beads. How many beads in total did Charley pull out?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate how many black beads Charley pulled out.",
    "Charley pulls out 1/6 of the black beads.",
    "There are 90 black beads in the bag.",
    "To find 1/6 of the black beads, I need to divide 90 by 6.",
    "90 divided by 6 is 15.",
    "Charley pulled out 15 black beads.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many white beads Charley pulled out.",
    "Charley pulls out 1/3 of the white beads.",
    "There are 51 white beads in the bag.",
    "To find 1/3 of the white beads, I need to divide 51 by 3.",
    "51 divided by 3 is 17.",
    "Charley pulled out 17 white beads.",
    "Now, I will add the number of black beads and white beads Charley pulled out to find the total number of beads.",
    "Charley pulled out 15 black beads and 17 white beads.",
    "15 plus 17 equals 32."
