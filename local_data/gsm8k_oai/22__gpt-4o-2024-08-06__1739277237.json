  "query": "Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many letters are in Jamie's last name.",
    "Jamie\u2019s last name is \"Grey\". The name \"Grey\" has 4 letters.",
    "If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would be twice the length of Jamie\u2019s last name.",
    "Twice the length of Jamie\u2019s last name is 2 * 4 = 8 letters.",
    "Therefore, when Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, she still has 8 letters.",
    "This means that originally, Bobbie\u2019s last name must have 8 + 2 = 10 letters.",
    "Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name.",
    "So, Samantha\u2019s last name has 10 - 3 = 7 letters."
