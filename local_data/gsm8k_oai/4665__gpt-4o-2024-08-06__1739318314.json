  "query": "Marky owns a computer accessory shop. For this month, half of their sales are wireless mice, one-fourth are optical mice, and the rest are trackball mice. If Marky's shop was able to sell a total of 80 mice, how many of them are trackball mice?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total sales of mice.",
    "The problem states that Marky sold a total of 80 mice.",
    "Half of the sales were wireless mice.",
    "So, the number of wireless mice sold is 80 divided by 2.",
    "80 divided by 2 equals 40. Therefore, 40 wireless mice were sold.",
    "One-fourth of the sales were optical mice.",
    "So, the number of optical mice sold is 80 divided by 4.",
    "80 divided by 4 equals 20. Therefore, 20 optical mice were sold.",
    "I have calculated the number of wireless and optical mice. Now I need to find how many trackball mice were sold.",
    "The rest of the sales, which are not wireless or optical mice, must be trackball mice.",
    "I will calculate the number of trackball mice by subtracting the wireless and optical mice sales from the total sales.",
    "The total sales of wireless and optical mice is 40 plus 20.",
    "40 plus 20 equals 60. So, 60 mice were either wireless or optical mice.",
    "The number of trackball mice sold is the total mice minus the sum of wireless and optical mice.",
    "80 minus 60 equals 20."
