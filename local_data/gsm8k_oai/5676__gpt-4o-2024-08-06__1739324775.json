  "query": "Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute.",
    "I know Don can paint 3 tiles per minute.",
    "Ken can paint 2 more tiles per minute than Don, so Ken can paint \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) tiles per minute.",
    "Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken per minute, so Laura can paint \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) tiles per minute.",
    "Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles per minute than Laura, so Kim can paint \\(10 - 3 = 7\\) tiles per minute.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many tiles each person can paint in 15 minutes.",
    "Don can paint \\(3 \\text{ tiles/minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 45\\) tiles in 15 minutes.",
    "Ken can paint \\(5 \\text{ tiles/minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 75\\) tiles in 15 minutes.",
    "Laura can paint \\(10 \\text{ tiles/minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 150\\) tiles in 15 minutes.",
    "Kim can paint \\(7 \\text{ tiles/minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 105\\) tiles in 15 minutes.",
    "Next, I sum up the total number of tiles painted by all four people in 15 minutes.",
    "The total number of tiles is \\(45 + 75 + 150 + 105 = 375\\)."
