  "query": "There are 8 loads of laundry that need to be washed. Each load of laundry takes around 45 minutes to complete in the wash cycle and 1 hour in the dry cycle. How long, in hours, will it take to complete the entire set of laundry?",
  "steps": [
    "I have 8 loads of laundry to wash and dry.",
    "Each load takes 45 minutes to complete the wash cycle.",
    "Each load also takes 1 hour to complete the dry cycle.",
    "I first consider how long it takes to wash and dry one single load.",
    "45 minutes for the wash cycle is 0.75 hours.",
    "Adding the dry cycle of 1 hour to 0.75 hours for washing, I get 1.75 hours for one load.",
    "I need to do this for each of the 8 loads separately.",
    "Multiply 1.75 hours by 8 loads to get the total time for all loads.",
    "1.75 hours times 8 equals 14 hours."
