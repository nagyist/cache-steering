  "query": "Mr Cruz went to his doctor to seek advice on the best way to gain weight. His doctor told him to include more proteins in his meals and live a generally healthy lifestyle. After a month of following his doctor's advice, Mr Cruz had a weight gain of 20 pounds. He gained 30 more pounds in the second month after more healthy eating habits. If he originally weighed 70 pounds, what's his weight after the two months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Mr. Cruz's initial weight.",
    "Mr. Cruz's initial weight is given as 70 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total weight gain over the two months.",
    "He gained 20 pounds in the first month.",
    "He gained 30 pounds in the second month.",
    "To find the total weight gain, I'll add the weight gained in both months.",
    "20 pounds (first month) + 30 pounds (second month) = 50 pounds total weight gain.",
    "Now, I'll add the total weight gain to the initial weight to find his weight after two months.",
    "70 pounds (initial weight) + 50 pounds (total weight gain) = 120 pounds."
