  "query": "Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany. If he has 80 books total, how many zoology books does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of zoology books be \\( z \\).",
    "Milton has 4 times as many books about botany as he has about zoology. Therefore, the number of botany books is \\( 4z \\).",
    "Milton has a total of 80 books.",
    "The total number of books is the sum of the zoology and botany books: \\( z + 4z = 80 \\).",
    "Simplifying this equation gives us \\( 5z = 80 \\).",
    "To find \\( z \\), divide both sides of the equation by 5: \\( z = \\frac{80}{5} \\).",
    "Calculate the division: \\( \\frac{80}{5} = 16 \\)."
