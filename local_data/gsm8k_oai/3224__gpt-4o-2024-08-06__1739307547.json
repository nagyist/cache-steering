  "query": "Stephen rides his bicycle to church.  During the first third of his trip, he travels at a speed of 16 miles per hour. During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the time it takes for each third of the trip in hours.",
    "15 minutes is equal to 15/60 hours, which simplifies to 0.25 hours.",
    "I am given that each third of the trip lasts 0.25 hours.",
    "I must calculate the distance for each segment of the trip using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time.",
    "For the first segment, Stephen travels at 16 miles per hour for 0.25 hours.\nDistance = 16 mph \u00d7 0.25 h = 4 miles.",
    "For the second segment, Stephen travels at 12 miles per hour for 0.25 hours.\nDistance = 12 mph \u00d7 0.25 h = 3 miles.",
    "For the third segment, Stephen travels at 20 miles per hour for 0.25 hours.\nDistance = 20 mph \u00d7 0.25 h = 5 miles.",
    "Now, I need to find the total distance by summing the distances of each segment.",
    "Total distance = 4 miles + 3 miles + 5 miles = 12 miles."
