  "query": "There are 4 carriages in a train and each carriage has 25 seats. If each carriage could accommodate 10 more passengers, how many passengers would fill up 3 trains?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many passengers each carriage can accommodate with the additional capacity.",
    "Each carriage has 25 seats originally.",
    "Each carriage can accommodate 10 more passengers. So, each carriage can now accommodate 25 + 10 = 35 passengers.",
    "There are 4 carriages in a train, and each can accommodate 35 passengers.",
    "So, for one train, the total number of passengers that can be accommodated is 4 carriages * 35 passengers per carriage = 140 passengers.",
    "I need to determine how many passengers would fill up 3 trains.",
    "For 3 trains, the number of passengers that can be accommodated is 140 passengers per train * 3 trains = 420 passengers."
