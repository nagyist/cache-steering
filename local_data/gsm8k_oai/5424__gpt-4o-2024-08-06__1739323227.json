  "query": "A bead shop sells one set of crystal beads at $9 each and one set of metal beads at $10 each. Nancy buys one set of crystal beads and two sets of metal beads. How much does she spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of one set of crystal beads.",
    "The cost of one set of crystal beads is $9.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of one set of metal beads.",
    "The cost of one set of metal beads is $10.",
    "Nancy buys one set of crystal beads, which costs $9.",
    "Nancy buys two sets of metal beads.",
    "To find the total cost of the metal beads, I need to multiply the number of sets by the cost per set.",
    "The total cost for the metal beads is 2 sets * $10 per set = $20.",
    "Now, I need to add the cost of the crystal beads to the cost of the metal beads to find the total amount Nancy spends.",
    "The total cost is $9 (crystal beads) + $20 (metal beads) = $29."
