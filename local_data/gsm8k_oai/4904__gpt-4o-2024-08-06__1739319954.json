  "query": "The Lion King cost 10 million to make and earned 200 million at the box office. If it earned a profit that was half of what Star Wars made and Star Wars cost 25 million to make, how many millions did Star Wars earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the profit earned by The Lion King.",
    "The profit is the earnings minus the cost.",
    "Earnings (Lion King) = 200 million, and cost = 10 million.",
    "Therefore, profit (Lion King) = 200 million - 10 million = 190 million.",
    "I know from the question that Star Wars made twice the profit of The Lion King.",
    "Thus, profit (Star Wars) = 2 * 190 million = 380 million.",
    "I need to find out the earnings for Star Wars. I know the cost and the profit.",
    "The formula to calculate earnings is: earnings = cost + profit.",
    "Cost (Star Wars) = 25 million.",
    "Therefore, earnings (Star Wars) = 25 million + 380 million.",
    "Earnings (Star Wars) = 405 million."
