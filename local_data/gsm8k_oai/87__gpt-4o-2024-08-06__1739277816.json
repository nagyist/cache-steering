  "query": "John's cow weighs 400 pounds.  It increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.  He is able to sell the cow for $3 per pound.  How much more is it worth after gaining the weight?",
  "steps": [
    "The cow's initial weight is 400 pounds.",
    "The cow increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.",
    "To find the new weight, multiply the initial weight (400 pounds) by 1.5.",
    "400 pounds * 1.5 = 600 pounds.",
    "The cow's new weight is 600 pounds.",
    "To find out how much the cow is worth now, multiply the new weight (600 pounds) by the price per pound ($3).",
    "600 pounds * $3 per pound = $1800.",
    "To find out how much the cow was worth initially, multiply the initial weight (400 pounds) by the price per pound ($3).",
    "400 pounds * $3 per pound = $1200.",
    "Now, calculate how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight by subtracting the initial worth from the new worth.",
    "$1800 - $1200 = $600."
