  "query": "Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl earns $0.75 each week by taking out the trash.",
    "He wants to buy candy bars that cost $0.50 each.",
    "Carl will perform this task for 4 weeks.",
    "I need to calculate Carl's total earnings after 4 weeks.",
    "Total earnings in 4 weeks = $0.75 per week \u00d7 4 weeks = $3.00.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many $0.50 candy bars Carl can buy with $3.00.",
    "I need to divide Carl's total earnings by the cost of one candy bar.",
    "Number of candy bars = $3.00 \u00f7 $0.50 per candy bar = 6 candy bars."
