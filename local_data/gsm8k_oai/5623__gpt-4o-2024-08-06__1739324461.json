  "query": "In a class of 30 students, the teacher polls the students on their favorite subject. 1/5 of the students like Math, and 1/3 like English. 1/7 of the remaining students like Science. The rest don\u2019t have a favorite subject. How many students don\u2019t have a favorite subject?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the number of students who like Math.",
    "1/5 of the 30 students like Math.",
    "1/5 * 30 = 6 students like Math.",
    "Next, calculate the number of students who like English.",
    "1/3 of the 30 students like English.",
    "1/3 * 30 = 10 students like English.",
    "Now, calculate the number of students who like both Math and English.",
    "There is no indication of overlap, so assume students don\u2019t like more than one subject.",
    "Calculate the number of students left after accounting for the Math and English enthusiasts.",
    "30 - 6 (Math) - 10 (English) = 14 students remaining.",
    "Now calculate the number of students who like Science.",
    "1/7 of these remaining 14 students like Science.",
    "1/7 * 14 = 2 students like Science.",
    "Finally, calculate how many students don\u2019t have a favorite subject.",
    "Subtract those who like Math, English, or Science from the total students.",
    "30 - 6 (Math) - 10 (English) - 2 (Science) = 12 students don\u2019t have a favorite subject."
