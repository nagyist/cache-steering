  "query": "James writes 10 pages an hour.  If he writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people, how many hours a week does he spend writing?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pages James writes in total each day.",
    "James writes 5 pages to one person and another 5 pages to a second person each day.",
    "This means he writes 5 + 5 = 10 pages in total each day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pages he writes in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so he writes 10 pages/day * 7 days/week = 70 pages/week.",
    "James writes 10 pages an hour.",
    "To find out how many hours he writes in a week, I divide the total pages written in a week by the number of pages he writes in an hour.",
    "70 pages/week \u00f7 10 pages/hour = 7 hours/week."

  "solution": "7"
