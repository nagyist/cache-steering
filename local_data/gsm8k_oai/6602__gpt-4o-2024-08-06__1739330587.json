  "query": "In a math contest, Riley and Ofelia are on one team. The team's final score is obtained by adding the scores of the students of the same team. Out of the 35 questions, Riley got 3 mistakes while Ofelia got 5 more than half the score of Riley. How many incorrect answers did their team get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many questions Riley answered correctly. Since there are 35 questions in total and Riley made 3 mistakes, Riley answered 35 - 3 = 32 questions correctly.",
    "Now, I need to calculate Ofelia's score. Ofelia got 5 more than half the score of Riley. Half of Riley's score is 32 / 2 = 16. Adding 5 gives Ofelia a score of 16 + 5 = 21.",
    "Knowing Ofelia's score is 21, I need to find how many questions Ofelia got incorrect. Since there are 35 questions in total, Ofelia made 35 - 21 = 14 mistakes.",
    "Finally, I add the mistakes made by Riley and Ofelia to find the total number of incorrect answers for the team. Riley made 3 mistakes and Ofelia made 14 mistakes.",
    "3 mistakes (Riley) + 14 mistakes (Ofelia) equals a total of 17 mistakes for the team."
