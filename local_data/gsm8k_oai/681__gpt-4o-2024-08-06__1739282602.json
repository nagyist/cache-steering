  "query": "Fernanda purchased six audiobooks from Audible to listen to from her audible app. If each audiobook was 30 hours long and she listened to 2 hours of an audiobook each day, calculate the total time it took her to finish the six audiobooks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of hours for one audiobook.",
    "Each audiobook is 30 hours long.",
    "Fernanda purchased six audiobooks in total.",
    "Calculate the total number of hours for the six audiobooks by multiplying the number of audiobooks by the number of hours in each audiobook.",
    "6 audiobooks * 30 hours/audiobook = 180 hours.",
    "Next, determine how many hours Fernanda listens to audiobooks each day.",
    "She listens to 2 hours of audiobook each day.",
    "Now, calculate how many days it will take for her to listen to 180 hours.",
    "Divide the total hours by the number of hours she listens each day.",
    "180 hours / 2 hours/day = 90 days."
