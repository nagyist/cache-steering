  "query": "Salem loves to write poems, and she always stores her poem in a creativity box kept safely in her home library. Last week, she created a poem with 20 stanzas. If each stanza has 10 lines, and each line has 8 words, calculate the total number of words in the poem.",
  "steps": [
    "Salem's poem consists of stanzas, lines, and words. I need to calculate the total number of words in the entire poem.",
    "The poem has 20 stanzas.",
    "Each stanza has 10 lines.",
    "This means that the total number of lines in the poem is 20 stanzas multiplied by 10 lines per stanza.",
    "20 stanzas \u00d7 10 lines per stanza = 200 lines.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of words in the poem.",
    "Each line has 8 words.",
    "Therefore, the total number of words can be calculated by multiplying the total number of lines by the number of words per line.",
    "200 lines \u00d7 8 words per line = 1600 words."

  "solution": "1600"
