  "query": "Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches and 8 egg sandwiches for the tea party.  Each cucumber sandwich was cut into 4 triangles.  Each egg sandwich was cut into 2 rectangles.  If her guests ate 28 triangles and 12 rectangles, how many slices of bread did they eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pieces each type of sandwich was made into.",
    "Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches, and each was cut into 4 triangles.",
    "So, the total number of cucumber sandwich triangles is 10 sandwiches * 4 triangles = 40 triangles.",
    "Next, Kiki made 8 egg sandwiches, and each was cut into 2 rectangles.",
    "Therefore, the total number of egg sandwich rectangles is 8 sandwiches * 2 rectangles = 16 rectangles.",
    "Now, I know that the guests ate 28 triangles.",
    "This means that 28 triangles were eaten out of the 40 total triangles.",
    "Next, the guests ate 12 rectangles.",
    "This means that 12 rectangles were eaten out of the 16 total rectangles.",
    "Each sandwich consists of two slices of bread. Each sandwich, when cut, still represents one original sandwich made from two slices of bread.",
    "I calculate how many cucumber sandwiches were eaten. Each sandwich has 4 triangles.",
    "If 28 triangles were eaten and each cucumber sandwich has 4 triangles, then 28 / 4 = 7 cucumber sandwiches were eaten.",
    "I calculate how many egg sandwiches were eaten. Each sandwich has 2 rectangles.",
    "If 12 rectangles were eaten and each egg sandwich has 2 rectangles, then 12 / 2 = 6 egg sandwiches were eaten.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten.",
    "The total sandwiches eaten are 7 cucumber sandwiches + 6 egg sandwiches = 13 sandwiches.",
    "Each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread.",
    "The total number of slices of bread used is 13 sandwiches * 2 slices of bread = 26 slices of bread."
