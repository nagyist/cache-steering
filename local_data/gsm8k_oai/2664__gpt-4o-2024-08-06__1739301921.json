  "query": "At a pool party, there are 4 pizzas cut into 12 slices each.  If the guests eat 39 slices, how many slices are left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many total pizza slices there are.",
    "There are 4 pizzas, each cut into 12 slices.",
    "4 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza equals 48 slices in total.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.",
    "39 slices are eaten, so I subtract 39 from 48 to find out how many slices are left.",
    "48 - 39 equals 9."

  "solution": "9"
