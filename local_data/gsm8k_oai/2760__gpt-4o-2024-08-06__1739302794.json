  "steps": [
    "Currently, Joel is 5 years old and his dad is 32 years old.",
    "I need to find how many years it will take for Joel's age to be half of his dad's age.",
    "Let's denote the number of years from now as \\( x \\).",
    "In \\( x \\) years, Joel will be \\( 5 + x \\) years old.",
    "In \\( x \\) years, Joel's dad will be \\( 32 + x \\) years old.",
    "I want Joel's dad to be twice as old as Joel in \\( x \\) years, so I set up the equation: \\( 32 + x = 2(5 + x) \\).",
    "Now, I'll solve the equation: \\( 32 + x = 10 + 2x \\).",
    "Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides: \\( 32 = 10 + x \\).",
    "Subtract 10 from both sides: \\( 32 - 10 = x \\).",
    "Calculate \\( x \\): \\( x = 22 \\).",
    "In 22 years, Joel will be \\( 5 + 22 = 27 \\) years old.",
    "I should check my answer to confirm the dad's age: \\( 32 + 22 = 54 \\).",
    "Checking if 54 is twice 27: \\( 54 = 2 \\times 27 \\).",
    "Everything checks out, so Joel will be 27 years old."
