  "query": "Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?",
  "steps": [
    "Marco has $24 initially.",
    "Mary has $15 initially.",
    "Marco gives Mary half of what he has.",
    "Half of Marco's money is $24 / 2 = $12.",
    "After giving $12 to Mary, Marco will have $24 - $12 = $12.",
    "Mary receives $12 from Marco.",
    "Mary's new total is $15 + $12 = $27.",
    "Mary spends $5.",
    "Mary's total after spending is $27 - $5 = $22.",
    "Now, Marco has $12 and Mary has $22.",
    "Find the difference between Mary's and Marco's money: $22 - $12 = $10."
