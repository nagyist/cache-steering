  "query": "Kendra tracks the different species of birds they spot on their birdwatching trip. On Monday they visited 5 sites and saw an average of 7 birds at each site. On Tuesday, Kendra visited 5 sites and saw an average of 5 birds at each site. On Wednesday visited 10 sites and saw an average of 8 birds at each site. On average, how many different birds did Kendra see on each site?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many birds Kendra saw on each day.",
    "On Monday, Kendra visited 5 sites with an average of 7 birds per site.",
    "The total number of birds seen on Monday is 5 sites * 7 birds per site = 35 birds.",
    "On Tuesday, Kendra visited 5 sites with an average of 5 birds per site.",
    "The total number of birds seen on Tuesday is 5 sites * 5 birds per site = 25 birds.",
    "On Wednesday, Kendra visited 10 sites with an average of 8 birds per site.",
    "The total number of birds seen on Wednesday is 10 sites * 8 birds per site = 80 birds.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of birds Kendra saw during the three days.",
    "The total number of birds is 35 (Monday) + 25 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 140 birds.",
    "Next, I find the total number of sites visited over the three days.",
    "The total number of sites is 5 (Monday) + 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) = 20 sites.",
    "Finally, I calculate the average number of birds seen per site.",
    "The average number of birds per site is the total number of birds divided by the total number of sites, which is 140 birds / 20 sites.",
    "The average number of birds per site is 7."
