  "query": "Jim decides to buy mayo in bulk.  He can buy 1 gallon of mayo at Costco for 8 dollars.  At the normal store, a 16-ounce bottle costs $3.  How much money does he save by buying the gallon container?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many ounces are in a gallon.",
    "There are 128 ounces in a gallon.",
    "Next, I compare the cost per ounce at Costco with the cost per ounce at the normal store.",
    "At Costco, Jim pays $8 for 128 ounces.",
    "The cost per ounce at Costco is 8 dollars / 128 ounces.",
    "Perform the division: 8 / 128 = 0.0625 dollars per ounce at Costco.",
    "Now, consider the normal store where a 16-ounce bottle costs $3.",
    "Calculate the cost per ounce at the normal store: 3 dollars / 16 ounces.",
    "Perform the division: 3 / 16 = 0.1875 dollars per ounce at the normal store.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much it costs at the normal store to buy 128 ounces (the equivalent of a gallon).",
    "Multiply the cost per ounce at the normal store by 128 ounces: 0.1875 * 128.",
    "Calculate: 0.1875 * 128 = 24 dollars at the normal store for 128 ounces.",
    "Finally, determine the savings by comparing the total cost at the normal store and the cost at Costco.",
    "Subtract the Costco price from the normal store price: 24 dollars - 8 dollars.",
    "Calculate: 24 - 8 = 16 dollars savings by buying the gallon container at Costco."
