  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount Kathleen saved over the three months.",
    "Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August.",
    "I will add these amounts: $21 + $46 + $45.",
    "$21 + $46 = $67",
    "$67 + $45 = $112",
    "Kathleen saved a total of $112 over the three months.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much money Kathleen spent.",
    "Kathleen spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes.",
    "I will add these expenses: $12 + $54.",
    "$12 + $54 = $66",
    "Kathleen spent a total of $66.",
    "Now I will subtract the amount Kathleen spent from the total amount she saved.",
    "$112 - $66 = $46",
    "At this point, Kathleen has $46 remaining.",
    "Kathleen\u2019s aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125.",
    "Kathleen saved $112, which is less than $125, so she will not receive the $25 from her aunt.",
    "Therefore, the final amount Kathleen has left is $46."
