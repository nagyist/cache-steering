  "query": "Ian spent half the money he made on doing online surveys. If he worked 8 hours doing surveys and on average he's able to earn $18 per hour doing surveys, how much money does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much money Ian made from doing surveys.",
    "He worked for 8 hours and earned $18 per hour.",
    "To find out the total earnings, I can multiply the number of hours by the earnings per hour: 8 hours * $18 per hour.",
    "Calculating that gives 8 * 18 = $144.",
    "Ian spent half of this money on doing online surveys.",
    "To find out how much he spent, I take half of $144, which is $144 / 2.",
    "Calculating that gives $144 / 2 = $72.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money he has left after spending.",
    "He started with $144 and spent $72, so the remaining amount is $144 - $72.",
    "Calculating that gives $144 - $72 = $72."

  "solution": "72"
