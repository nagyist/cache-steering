  "query": "In today's field day challenge, the 4th graders were competing against the 5th graders.  Each grade had 2 different classes.  The first 4th grade class had 12 girls and 13 boys.  The second 4th grade class had 15 girls and 11 boys.  The first 5th grade class had 9 girls and 13 boys while the second 5th grade class had 10 girls and 11 boys.  In total, how many more boys were competing than girls?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total number of girls in the 4th grade classes.",
    "The first 4th grade class has 12 girls.",
    "The second 4th grade class has 15 girls.",
    "Adding these together gives 12 + 15 = 27 girls in 4th grade.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of boys in the 4th grade classes.",
    "The first 4th grade class has 13 boys.",
    "The second 4th grade class has 11 boys.",
    "Adding these together gives 13 + 11 = 24 boys in 4th grade.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of girls in the 5th grade classes.",
    "The first 5th grade class has 9 girls.",
    "The second 5th grade class has 10 girls.",
    "Adding these together gives 9 + 10 = 19 girls in 5th grade.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of boys in the 5th grade classes.",
    "The first 5th grade class has 13 boys.",
    "The second 5th grade class has 11 boys.",
    "Adding these together gives 13 + 11 = 24 boys in 5th grade.",
    "Now, I will sum the totals for all the girls competing.",
    "There are 27 girls in 4th grade and 19 girls in 5th grade.",
    "Adding these gives 27 + 19 = 46 total girls.",
    "Now, I will sum the totals for all the boys competing.",
    "There are 24 boys in 4th grade and 24 boys in 5th grade.",
    "Adding these gives 24 + 24 = 48 total boys.",
    "To find out how many more boys were competing than girls, I will subtract the total number of girls from the total number of boys.",
    "48 boys - 46 girls = 2 more boys than girls."
