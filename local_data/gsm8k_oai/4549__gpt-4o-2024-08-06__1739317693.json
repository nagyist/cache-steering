  "query": "Amanda's car takes five fewer minutes to complete the same trip to the beach than the bus. If the bus takes 40 minutes to drive 80 miles to the beach, how many minutes will it take the car to make a round trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how long it takes Amanda's car to travel one way to the beach.",
    "The bus takes 40 minutes for a one-way trip to the beach.",
    "Amanda's car takes five fewer minutes than the bus for a one-way trip.",
    "Since 40 - 5 = 35, Amanda's car takes 35 minutes for a one-way trip to the beach.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how long it takes for a round trip.",
    "A round trip would mean traveling to the beach and coming back, which is two one-way trips.",
    "A single one-way trip with Amanda's car takes 35 minutes.",
    "For a round trip, the car will take 2 * 35 minutes.",
    "Therefore, 2 * 35 = 70 minutes in total for Amanda's car to complete a round trip."

  "solution": "70"
