  "query": "Six Grade 4 sections launched a recycling drive where they collect old newspapers to recycle. Each section collected 280 kilos in two weeks. After the third week, they found that they need 320 kilos more to reach their target. How many kilos of the newspaper is their target?",
  "steps": [
    "Each section collected 280 kilos in two weeks.",
    "There are six sections participating in the recycling drive.",
    "To find out how much all sections collected together in the two weeks, multiply the amount one section collected by the number of sections: 280 kilos/section * 6 sections.",
    "Calculating that gives 280 * 6 = 1680 kilos collected in two weeks.",
    "After the third week, they found they needed 320 kilos more to reach their target.",
    "The problem states that the amount they have already collected is not enough, and they need 320 more kilos to reach their target.",
    "This indicates that the target is the amount collected (1680 kilos) plus the additional needed (320 kilos).",
    "Calculate the target by adding these amounts: 1680 kilos + 320 kilos = 2000 kilos."
