  "query": "Mr. Mitchell is buying pizzas for the soccer team. He buys one slice for every goal they scored on the season. A large pizza has 12 slices. If he bought 6 pizzas, and the team had 8 games, how many goals did they score per game on average?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices that Mr. Mitchell bought. A large pizza has 12 slices, and he bought 6 pizzas.",
    "To find the total number of slices, I multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 6 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 72 slices.",
    "The problem states that Mr. Mitchell buys one slice for every goal scored. Therefore, the total number of slices is equal to the total number of goals scored.",
    "Thus, the team scored 72 goals in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average number of goals scored per game. The team played 8 games.",
    "To find the average number of goals per game, I divide the total number of goals by the number of games: 72 goals \u00f7 8 games = 9 goals per game."
