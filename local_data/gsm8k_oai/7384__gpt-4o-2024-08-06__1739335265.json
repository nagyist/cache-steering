  "query": "In twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as Loui today. If Loui is currently 23 years old, how old is Ramon now?",
  "steps": [
    "Loui's current age is 23 years.",
    "I need to find Loui's age in twenty years.",
    "Loui's age in twenty years will be 23 + 20 = 43 years.",
    "According to the problem, in twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as Loui's current age.",
    "Loui's current age is 23, so twice Loui's current age is 2 * 23 = 46.",
    "In twenty years, Ramon will be 46 years old.",
    "Now I need to find Ramon's current age.",
    "If Ramon will be 46 years old in twenty years, I need to subtract 20 years from 46 to find his current age.",
    "46 - 20 = 26"

  "solution": "26"
