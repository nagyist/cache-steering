  "query": "Janice adds 2 tablespoons of koolaid power and 16 tablespoons of water to a jug. She leaves it out long enough for 4 tablespoons of water to evaporate. Then she quadruples the amount of water in the jug. What percentage of the liquid in the jug is koolaid powder?",
  "steps": [
    "Janice starts by adding 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder to the jug.",
    "She adds 16 tablespoons of water to the same jug.",
    "Initially, there are 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder and 16 tablespoons of water in the jug.",
    "The total liquid in the jug before evaporation is 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder + 16 tablespoons of water = 18 tablespoons of liquid.",
    "4 tablespoons of water evaporate.",
    "After evaporation, there are 16 - 4 = 12 tablespoons of water left in the jug.",
    "Now, the total liquid in the jug is 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder + 12 tablespoons of water = 14 tablespoons of liquid.",
    "Janice then quadruples the amount of water in the jug.",
    "Quadrupling 12 tablespoons of water results in 12 * 4 = 48 tablespoons of water.",
    "Therefore, the jug now contains 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder + 48 tablespoons of water = 50 tablespoons of liquid in total.",
    "To find the percentage of liquid in the jug that is koolaid powder, calculate (koolaid powder amount / total liquid amount) * 100.",
    "The percentage of koolaid powder is (2 / 50) * 100.",
    "Performing the calculation, (2 / 50) * 100 = 4."
