  "query": "Debelyn, Christel, and Andrena collect dolls. Debelyn had 20 dolls before she gave Andrena 2 dolls. Christel had 24 dolls before giving Andrena 5 dolls. After all the gifts, Andrena now has 2 more dolls  than Christel, how many more dolls does andrena have now than Debelyn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note the initial number of dolls each person has. Debelyn starts with 20 dolls, Christel with 24 dolls, and we don't know Andrena's initial count.",
    "Debelyn gives Andrena 2 dolls. So Debelyn's new count is 20 - 2 = 18 dolls.",
    "Christel gives Andrena 5 dolls. So Christel's new count is 24 - 5 = 19 dolls.",
    "Now let's determine how many dolls Andrena received. She got 2 dolls from Debelyn and 5 dolls from Christel. That's 2 + 5 = 7 dolls.",
    "We are told that after receiving the gifts, Andrena has 2 more dolls than Christel.",
    "Since Christel has 19 dolls now, Andrena has 19 + 2 = 21 dolls.",
    "We need to determine how many more dolls Andrena has now than Debelyn.",
    "Debelyn now has 18 dolls. Andrena has 21 dolls.",
    "The difference in the number of dolls between Andrena and Debelyn is 21 - 18 = 3 dolls."
