  "query": "In a glee club, there are two times as many female than male members. How many female members are there if there are 18 members in the club?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of male members be x.",
    "Since there are twice as many female members as male members, the number of female members is 2x.",
    "The total number of members in the club is given as 18.",
    "We can set up the equation x + 2x = 18.",
    "Simplify the equation to get 3x = 18.",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x: x = 18 / 3.",
    "Calculate 18 / 3 to get x = 6.",
    "The number of male members is 6.",
    "Since there are twice as many female members, calculate 2 * 6 to find the number of female members.",
    "2 * 6 equals 12."

  "solution": "12"
