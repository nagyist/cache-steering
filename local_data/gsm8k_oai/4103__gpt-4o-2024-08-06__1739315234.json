  "query": "Abraham is buying some toiletries and creates a budget of $60 for his shopping. He buys 4 shower gels for $4 each, a tube of toothpaste for $3, and a box of laundry detergent. If he has $30 remaining in his budget, how much money, in dollars, did Abraham spend on the box of laundry detergent?",
  "steps": [
    "Abraham has a total budget of $60.",
    "He buys 4 shower gels for $4 each.",
    "To calculate the total cost for the shower gels, multiply the number of shower gels by the price per gel: 4 shower gels \u00d7 $4 = $16.",
    "Abraham also buys a tube of toothpaste for $3.",
    "Add the cost of the toothpaste to the cost of the shower gels: $16 + $3 = $19.",
    "Now we know he has spent $19 on shower gels and toothpaste combined.",
    "Abraham has $30 remaining in his budget after purchasing all his items.",
    "To find out how much he spent on the box of laundry detergent, we need to determine the total spent so far and subtract it from the budget.",
    "Total spent is the initial budget minus what remains: $60 - $30 = $30.",
    "He spent $30 in total.",
    "Subtract the amount he spent on shower gels and toothpaste from the total spent to find out how much he spent on the laundry detergent: $30 - $19 = $11."
