  "query": "Matt can paint a house in 12 hours.  Patty can paint the same house in one third the time.  Rachel can paint the same house in 5 more than double the amount of hours as Patty. How long will it take Rachel to paint the house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Matt can paint the house in 12 hours.",
    "It is given that Patty can paint the house in one third the time Matt takes.",
    "Matt takes 12 hours, so I will calculate one third of 12.",
    "One third of 12 is 12 divided by 3, which equals 4.",
    "This means Patty can paint the house in 4 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how long it takes Rachel to paint the house.",
    "It is given that Rachel can paint the house in 5 more than double the amount of hours Patty takes.",
    "Patty takes 4 hours, so I will first calculate double that time.",
    "Double of 4 hours is 4 times 2, which equals 8 hours.",
    "Now, I add 5 hours to this time.",
    "8 hours plus 5 hours equals 13 hours."

  "solution": "13"
