  "query": "Miles is going to spend 1/6 of a day reading. He will read comic books, graphic novels, and novels. He reads 21 pages an hour when he reads novels, 30 pages an hour when he reads graphic novels, and 45 pages an hour when he reads comic books. If he reads each for 1/3 of his time, how many pages does he read?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Miles will spend reading in total.",
    "Miles will spend 1/6 of a day reading.",
    "There are 24 hours in a day.",
    "1/6 of 24 hours is 24 / 6 = 4 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how long Miles will spend reading each type of book.",
    "He reads each type of book for 1/3 of his time.",
    "1/3 of 4 hours is 4 / 3 \u2248 1.33 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pages he reads for each type of book.",
    "First, for novels: He reads novels at 21 pages per hour.",
    "In 1.33 hours, at 21 pages per hour, he will read 1.33 * 21 \u2248 27.93 pages.",
    "Now, for graphic novels: He reads graphic novels at 30 pages per hour.",
    "In 1.33 hours, at 30 pages per hour, he will read 1.33 * 30 = 39.9 pages.",
    "Now, for comic books: He reads comic books at 45 pages per hour.",
    "In 1.33 hours, at 45 pages per hour, he will read 1.33 * 45 = 59.85 pages.",
    "Now I will sum up the pages read from each type of book to find the total pages he reads.",
    "Total pages = 27.93 (novels) + 39.9 (graphic novels) + 59.85 (comic books).",
    "27.93 + 39.9 + 59.85 = 127.68",
    "I need to round this to the nearest whole number because he can't read a fraction of a page."
