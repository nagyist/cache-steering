  "query": "Erin works in the school cafeteria serving soup. Each bowl of soup has 10 ounces, and Erin can serve 5 bowls per minute. If the pot of soup has 6 gallons of soup, how long will it take Erin to serve all the soup, rounded to the nearest minute? (There are 128 ounces to a gallon.)",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of ounces in the pot of soup.",
    "The pot has 6 gallons of soup, and there are 128 ounces in each gallon.",
    "I multiply 6 gallons by 128 ounces per gallon to find the total ounces: 6 * 128 = 768 ounces.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many total bowls of soup can be served from 768 ounces.",
    "Each bowl contains 10 ounces of soup.",
    "I divide the total ounces by the ounces per bowl: 768 ounces / 10 ounces per bowl = 76.8 bowls.",
    "Now, I know Erin can serve 5 bowls per minute.",
    "I need to calculate the total time required to serve all 76.8 bowls.",
    "I divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls served per minute: 76.8 bowls / 5 bowls per minute = 15.36 minutes.",
    "Finally, I round the time to the nearest minute.",
    "15.36 minutes rounds to 15 minutes."
