  "query": "Kantana loves chocolate. Every Saturday she goes to the candy store and buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister. This last Saturday she picked up an additional 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie. How many chocolates did Kantana end up buying for the month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many Saturdays there are in a month. Typically, a month has about 4 weeks.",
    "Since a typical month contains 4 weeks, there will be 4 Saturdays in a month.",
    "Next, I'll determine how many chocolates Kantana buys for herself every Saturday. She buys 2 chocolates each Saturday.",
    "For 4 Saturdays, Kantana buys 2 chocolates each time, which is 2 chocolates x 4 Saturdays = 8 chocolates for herself.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many chocolates Kantana buys for her sister every Saturday. She buys 1 chocolate each Saturday for her sister.",
    "For 4 Saturdays, Kantana buys 1 chocolate each time for her sister, which is 1 chocolate x 4 Saturdays = 4 chocolates for her sister.",
    "I also need to account for the additional chocolates she bought for her friend Charlie last Saturday. According to the information, she bought an additional 10 chocolates for Charlie.",
    "Now, I'll add all the chocolates she buys: 8 chocolates for herself + 4 chocolates for her sister + 10 chocolates for Charlie.",
    "The total number of chocolates she buys for the month is 8 + 4 + 10 = 22 chocolates."

  "solution": "22"
