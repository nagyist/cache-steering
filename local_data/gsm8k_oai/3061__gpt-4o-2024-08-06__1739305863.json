  "query": "Mikaela earns $10 an hour  tutoring. For the first month, she tutored for 35 hours and in the second month, she tutored 5 hours more than the first month. She spent 4/5 of her total earnings on her personal needs and saved the rest of the money. How much did she save?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours Mikaela tutored in the second month. She tutored 5 more hours than the first month.",
    "In the first month, Mikaela tutored for 35 hours. In the second month, she tutored 35 + 5 = 40 hours.",
    "Next, I will calculate her total hours tutored over the two months. That's 35 hours in the first month plus 40 hours in the second month.",
    "The total hours tutored is 35 + 40 = 75 hours.",
    "Now, I need to calculate her total earnings. She earns $10 per hour, so I multiply the total hours by her hourly rate.",
    "The total earnings are 75 hours * $10/hour = $750.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the amount Mikaela spent on her personal needs, which is 4/5 of her total earnings.",
    "The amount spent is (4/5) * $750.",
    "Calculating this gives $750 * 4/5 = $600.",
    "Finally, to find out how much Mikaela saved, I subtract the amount spent from the total earnings.",
    "Amount saved = Total earnings - Amount spent = $750 - $600.",
    "Amount saved = $150."
  ],
  "solution": "150"
