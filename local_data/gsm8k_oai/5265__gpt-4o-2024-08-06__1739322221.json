  "query": "Wendy works at a chocolate factory packing chocolates.  She can package 2 dozen chocolates in 5 minutes.  How many individual chocolates can she package in 4 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what is being asked. Wendy works at a chocolate factory and packages chocolates. I need to find out how many individual chocolates she can package in 4 hours.",
    "I'll begin by determining how many chocolates Wendy can package in a single minute.",
    "I know she can package 2 dozen chocolates in 5 minutes. One dozen is 12 chocolates, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 chocolates.",
    "Wendy packages 24 chocolates in 5 minutes. To find how many chocolates she can package in 1 minute, I divide 24 chocolates by 5 minutes.",
    "24 divided by 5 equals 4.8. Wendy can package 4.8 chocolates per minute.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many chocolates she can package in 4 hours.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 4 hours, there are 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.",
    "Since Wendy can package 4.8 chocolates per minute, in 240 minutes she would package 240 x 4.8 chocolates.",
    "Multiplying, 240 x 4.8 equals 1152."
  ],
  "solution": "1152"
