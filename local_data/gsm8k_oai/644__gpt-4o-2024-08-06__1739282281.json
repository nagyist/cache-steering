    "I want to find out how many people the bus system carries in 13 weeks.",
    "First, I need to determine how many days are in 13 weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "So, for 13 weeks, the number of days is 13 weeks * 7 days/week.",
    "13 * 7 = 91 days.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many people are carried in those 91 days.",
    "The bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day.",
    "To find the total number of people carried in 91 days, I multiply the daily number by the number of days.",
    "So, the calculation is 1,200,000 people/day * 91 days.",
    "1,200,000 * 91 = 109,200,000."
