  "query": "Four kids can wash three whiteboards in 20 minutes. How long would it take, in minutes, for one kid to wash six whiteboards?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how long it takes for four kids to wash one whiteboard.",
    "Four kids wash three whiteboards in 20 minutes, which means they wash one whiteboard in \\( \\frac{20}{3} \\) minutes.",
    "Now, I will figure out how long it takes for one kid to wash one whiteboard.",
    "Since four kids take \\( \\frac{20}{3} \\) minutes to wash one whiteboard, it implies that one kid would take \\( 4 \\times \\frac{20}{3} \\) minutes to wash one whiteboard.",
    "Calculating \\( 4 \\times \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\).",
    "Thus, one kid takes \\( \\frac{80}{3} \\) minutes to wash one whiteboard.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total time it takes for one kid to wash six whiteboards.",
    "For six whiteboards, the time would be \\( 6 \\times \\frac{80}{3} \\).",
    "Performing the multiplication: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{80}{3} = \\frac{480}{3} \\).",
    "Simplifying \\( \\frac{480}{3} \\) gives 160."
