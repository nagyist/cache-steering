  "query": "Robin likes to bake cupcakes for friends and to make her puppy North happy. Once Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce and twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting on her own. How many cupcakes did Robin eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Robin ate four cupcakes with chocolate sauce.",
    "She also ate twice as many cupcakes with buttercream frosting.",
    "Twice as many as four cupcakes is 4 * 2, which equals 8 cupcakes.",
    "So Robin ate a total of 4 cupcakes (chocolate sauce) + 8 cupcakes (buttercream frosting).",
    "Adding these together gives 4 + 8.",
    "4 + 8 equals 12."
