  "query": "There were students from three different schools taking part in a debate organized by the town's mayor on a stage. The first school had twice as many students as the second school, and the second school had 40 more students than the third school. If the third school had 200 students, and after the debate was over, every student shook the mayor's hand, calculate the total number of students who shook the mayor's hand on the stage.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many students each school had, starting with the third school.",
    "The third school had 200 students.",
    "The second school had 40 more students than the third school.",
    "Therefore, the second school had 200 + 40 = 240 students.",
    "The first school had twice as many students as the second school.",
    "So, the first school had 2 * 240 = 480 students.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of students from all three schools.",
    "Adding the students from all schools: 200 (third school) + 240 (second school) + 480 (first school).",
    "200 + 240 + 480 = 920",
    "There were a total of 920 students who shook the mayor's hand."

  "solution": "920"
