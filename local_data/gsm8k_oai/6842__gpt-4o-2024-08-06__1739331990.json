  "query": "Two-fifths of the seats in an auditorium that holds 500 people are currently taken. It was found that 1/10 of the seats are broken. How many seats are still available?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of seats currently taken.",
    "The auditorium holds 500 people.",
    "Two-fifths of the seats are taken.",
    "I calculate two-fifths of 500 seats: (2/5) * 500 = 200.",
    "So, 200 seats are currently taken.",
    "Next, determine the number of broken seats.",
    "One-tenth of the seats are broken.",
    "I calculate one-tenth of 500 seats: (1/10) * 500 = 50.",
    "So, 50 seats are broken.",
    "I need to calculate how many seats are available.",
    "I subtract the number of taken seats and broken seats from the total.",
    "Total seats: 500.",
    "Taken seats: 200.",
    "Broken seats: 50.",
    "Seats not taken and not broken (available seats): 500 - 200 - 50.",
    "Calculation: 500 - 200 = 300.",
    "Then, 300 - 50 = 250.",
    "So, 250 seats are still available."
