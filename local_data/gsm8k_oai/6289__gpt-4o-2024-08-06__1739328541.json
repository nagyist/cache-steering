  "query": "Carly recently graduated and is looking for work in a field she studied for. She sent 200 job applications to companies in her state, and twice that number to companies in other states. Calculate the total number of job applications she has sent so far.",
  "steps": [
    "Carly sent 200 job applications to companies in her state.",
    "She sent twice that number to companies in other states.",
    "Twice 200 is calculated as 2 * 200.",
    "2 * 200 equals 400.",
    "Therefore, Carly sent 400 job applications to companies in other states.",
    "To find the total number of job applications Carly has sent, add the number sent in her state to the number sent to other states.",
    "Add 200 (applications sent in state) to 400 (applications sent to other states).",
    "200 + 400 equals 600."
