  "query": "Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears and 40 more brown bears than black bears in a national park. If the number of black bears in the park is 60, calculate the population of bears in the park.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of black bears Christi saw.",
    "According to the problem, the number of black bears is given as 60.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of white bears.",
    "Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears.",
    "If the number of black bears is 60, then the number of white bears would be half of that.",
    "Calculating, 60 divided by 2 equals 30.",
    "So, there are 30 white bears.",
    "I also need to determine the number of brown bears.",
    "The problem states there are 40 more brown bears than black bears.",
    "If there are 60 black bears, then the number of brown bears would be 60 plus 40.",
    "Calculating, 60 plus 40 equals 100.",
    "There are 100 brown bears in the park.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total population of bears in the park.",
    "The total population of bears is the sum of white bears, black bears, and brown bears.",
    "The number of white bears is 30, black bears is 60, and brown bears is 100.",
    "Summing these up, 30 plus 60 plus 100.",
    "Calculating, 30 plus 60 equals 90 and 90 plus 100 equals 190."
