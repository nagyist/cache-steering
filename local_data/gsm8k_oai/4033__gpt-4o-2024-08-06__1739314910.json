  "query": "Tom decided to send his wife 2 dozen roses every day for the week.  How many total roses did he send?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many roses are in one dozen.",
    "There are 12 roses in one dozen.",
    "Tom sends 2 dozen roses each day.",
    "To find out how many roses that is, I need to multiply 2 dozen by the number of roses in a dozen, which is 12.",
    "2 dozen roses is 2 x 12 = 24 roses.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many days are in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Tom sends 24 roses every day for the entire week.",
    "I will multiply the number of roses he sends each day by the number of days in a week.",
    "24 roses/day * 7 days = 168 roses."

  "solution": "168"
