  "query": "Cheyenne is a craftswoman making pots for sale. On a particular week, she made 80 clay pots. However, when she put them in the sun to dry, 2/5 of the pots cracked and could not be sold. How much money did Cheyenne make from selling the remaining items at $40 per clay pot?",
  "steps": [
    "Cheyenne made 80 clay pots in total.",
    "2/5 of the pots cracked and could not be sold.",
    "To find out how many pots cracked, calculate 2/5 of 80.",
    "2/5 of 80 is calculated as (2/5) * 80.",
    "(2/5) * 80 = 32.",
    "So, 32 of the pots cracked and could not be sold.",
    "To find out how many pots could be sold, subtract the cracked pots from the total number of pots.",
    "80 - 32 = 48.",
    "Cheyenne was able to sell 48 pots.",
    "Each pot sells for $40.",
    "To find out how much money Cheyenne made, multiply the number of pots sold by the price per pot.",
    "48 pots * $40 per pot = $1920."
  ],
  "solution": "1920"
