  "query": "If it takes 10 people 10 days to shovel 10,000 pounds of coal, how many days will it take half of these ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much coal one person can shovel in one day based on the original scenario.",
    "If 10 people can shovel 10,000 pounds in 10 days, then the total number of person-days required to shovel 10,000 pounds is 10 people * 10 days = 100 person-days.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how much coal one person can shovel in one day. \n10,000 pounds / 100 person-days = 100 pounds per person per day.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many person-days are required to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal.",
    "40,000 pounds / 100 pounds per person per day = 400 person-days.",
    "I'll need to find out how many days it will take for 5 people (half of these ten people) to complete 400 person-days of work.",
    "I divide the total person-days (400 person-days) by the number of people (5 people).",
    "400 person-days / 5 people = 80 days."

  "solution": "80"
