  "query": "Jason's stove catches on fire. Buying a replacement will cost $1200 and fixing the damage to the wall behind it will cost 1/6th as much. How much does he spend in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much fixing the wall will cost.",
    "The cost of the stove is $1200.",
    "The damage to the wall behind the stove will cost 1/6th as much as the stove.",
    "I will calculate 1/6 of $1200.",
    "To do this, I divide $1200 by 6.",
    "$1200 divided by 6 equals $200.",
    "The cost to fix the wall is $200.",
    "Now, I need to find the total cost Jason will spend.",
    "I add the cost of replacing the stove ($1200) to the cost of fixing the wall ($200).",
    "Total cost = $1200 + $200.",
    "$1200 + $200 equals $1400.",
    "Jason will spend a total of $1400."
