  "query": "Before getting to work, Jess has a few errands to run. Jess has to walk 11 blocks to the store and 6 blocks to the gallery, before walking the final 8 blocks to arrive at work. If Jess has already walked 5 blocks, how many more blocks must she walk before arriving at work?",
  "steps": [
    "Jess has already walked 5 blocks.",
    "The total blocks Jess needs to walk: 11 (to the store) + 6 (to the gallery) + 8 (to work) = 25 blocks.",
    "Jess has walked 5 blocks so far.",
    "To find out how many more blocks Jess needs to walk, subtract the blocks already walked from the total blocks: 25 - 5 = 20."
