  "query": "A newspaper subscription costs $10/month. If you purchase an annual subscription you obtain a 20% discount on your total bill. How much do you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of the newspaper subscription for one year without any discounts.",
    "The monthly cost of the subscription is $10.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "So, the total cost for one year without any discount would be 12 months times $10 per month.",
    "12 times $10 equals $120.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the discount for the annual subscription.",
    "The discount is 20% of the total annual cost without a discount.",
    "20% as a decimal is 0.20.",
    "So, I need to multiply the total annual cost of $120 by 0.20 to find the discount amount.",
    "120 times 0.20 equals $24.",
    "Now, I subtract the discount amount from the total annual cost without discount to find the final cost with the discount applied.",
    "$120 minus $24 equals $96."

  "solution": "96"
