  "query": "Blake wants to spend his Friday making milkshakes for his family. He knows that he needs 4 ounces of milk and 12 ounces of ice cream for each milkshake. If he has 72 ounces of milk and 192 ounces of ice cream, how much milk will be left over when he is done?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many milkshakes Blake can make with the amount of milk he has.",
    "Blake has 72 ounces of milk, and each milkshake requires 4 ounces of milk.",
    "To find out how many milkshakes he can make, I will divide the total ounces of milk by the ounces needed per milkshake.",
    "72 ounces of milk \u00f7 4 ounces of milk per milkshake = 18 milkshakes.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many milkshakes can be made with the ice cream.",
    "Blake has 192 ounces of ice cream, and each milkshake requires 12 ounces of ice cream.",
    "To find out how many milkshakes he can make with ice cream, I will divide the total ounces of ice cream by the ounces needed per milkshake.",
    "192 ounces of ice cream \u00f7 12 ounces of ice cream per milkshake = 16 milkshakes.",
    "Blake can make only the number of milkshakes that the limiting ingredient allows for, which is 16 milkshakes.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much milk Blake will use to make 16 milkshakes.",
    "16 milkshakes \u00d7 4 ounces of milk per milkshake = 64 ounces of milk.",
    "Blake started with 72 ounces of milk.",
    "I will subtract the milk used from the initial amount to find out how much milk will be left over.",
    "72 ounces of milk - 64 ounces of milk used = 8 ounces of milk remaining."
