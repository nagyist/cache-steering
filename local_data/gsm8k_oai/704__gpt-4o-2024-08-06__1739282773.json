  "query": "Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her brother. Her mother gave Sabrina half the number of cookies she gave her brother. Then Sabrina gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister. If Sabrina had 20 cookies at the start, how many cookies are left with her?",
  "steps": [
    "Sabrina initially had 20 cookies.",
    "Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her brother.",
    "Now, Sabrina has 20 - 10 = 10 cookies left.",
    "Her mother gave Sabrina half the number of cookies she gave her brother.",
    "Sabrina gave her brother 10 cookies, so half of that is 10 / 2 = 5 cookies.",
    "Sabrina receives 5 additional cookies from her mother.",
    "After receiving cookies from her mother, Sabrina now has 10 + 5 = 15 cookies.",
    "Sabrina gave two-thirds of her cookies to her sister.",
    "Two-thirds of 15 cookies is (2/3) * 15 = 10 cookies.",
    "Sabrina gave 10 cookies to her sister.",
    "Now, Sabrina has 15 - 10 = 5 cookies left."
