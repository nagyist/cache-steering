  "query": "Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Zilla's total monthly earnings. I know she spends 7% of her earnings on rent and the amount is $133.",
    "I can set up an equation to find her total monthly earnings: 0.07 * Total Earnings = $133.",
    "To find Total Earnings, I divide $133 by 0.07.",
    "133 \u00f7 0.07 equals $1,900. So, Zilla\u2019s total monthly earnings are $1,900.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much she spends on her other monthly expenses.",
    "She spends half of her monthly earnings on other expenses.",
    "Half of $1,900 is $950. So, she spends $950 on other expenses.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much she deposits into her savings account.",
    "Her savings will be the remainder of her earnings after accounting for rent and other expenses.",
    "First, calculate the total amount spent on rent and expenses: $133 (rent) + $950 (other expenses) = $1,083.",
    "Subtract total expenses from her earnings to find the savings: $1,900 - $1,083 = $817."

  "solution": "817"
