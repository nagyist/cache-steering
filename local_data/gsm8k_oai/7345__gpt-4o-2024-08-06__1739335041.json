  "query": "A cat spends its time hunting birds.  The cat catches 8 birds during the day and twice this many at night. In total, how many birds did the cat catch?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that the cat catches 8 birds during the day.",
    "At night, the cat catches twice as many birds as it does during the day.",
    "Twice as many means we need to multiply the birds caught during the day by 2.",
    "The number of birds caught at night is 8 * 2.",
    "8 * 2 equals 16.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of birds caught during the day to the number of birds caught at night to find the total.",
    "The total number of birds caught is 8 (day) + 16 (night).",
    "8 + 16 equals 24."

  "solution": "24"
