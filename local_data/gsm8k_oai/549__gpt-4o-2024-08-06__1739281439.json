  "query": "In his company, Kenzo has 80 office chairs with five legs each and 20 round tables with three legs each. If after a month 40% of the chairs are damaged and have to be disposed of, calculate the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of legs for all the office chairs before any are disposed of. Each chair has five legs, and there are 80 chairs.",
    "To find the total number of chair legs, I multiply the number of chairs by the number of legs per chair: 80 chairs * 5 legs per chair = 400 legs.",
    "Next, I am told that 40% of these chairs are damaged and have to be disposed of. So, I must calculate the number of chairs that are damaged.",
    "40% of 80 chairs is 0.4 * 80 = 32 chairs.",
    "The remaining number of chairs after the damaged ones are disposed of is 80 - 32 = 48 chairs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of legs remaining from the undamaged chairs. There are 48 chairs remaining, each with 5 legs.",
    "48 chairs * 5 legs per chair = 240 legs from the undamaged chairs.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of legs from the round tables. Each table has 3 legs, and there are 20 tables.",
    "To find the total number of table legs, I multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table: 20 tables * 3 legs per table = 60 legs.",
    "To get the total number of legs of furniture remaining, I need to add the legs from the remaining chairs to the legs from the tables.",
    "240 legs from undamaged chairs + 60 legs from tables = 300 legs."
