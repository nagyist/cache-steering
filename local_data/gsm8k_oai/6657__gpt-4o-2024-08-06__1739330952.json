  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many 12-sided dice Mark has.",
    "Mark has a bag of 10 dice and 60% of them are 12-sided.",
    "To find the number of 12-sided dice Mark has, I calculate 60% of 10.",
    "60% of 10 is \\(0.6 \\times 10 = 6\\).",
    "Mark has 6 dice that are 12-sided.",
    "Now I need to find out how many 12-sided dice James has.",
    "James has a bag of 8 dice and 75% of them are 12-sided.",
    "To find the number of 12-sided dice James has, I calculate 75% of 8.",
    "75% of 8 is \\(0.75 \\times 8 = 6\\).",
    "James also has 6 dice that are 12-sided.",
    "Now, I add the number of 12-sided dice that Mark and James have.",
    "Mark's 12-sided dice (6) plus James's 12-sided dice (6) equals 12 dice.",
    "They need a total of 14 dice that are 12-sided for their game.",
    "They currently have a total of 12 dice that are 12-sided.",
    "To find out how many more dice they need, subtract the number they have (12) from the number they need (14).",
    "14 - 12 = 2"
