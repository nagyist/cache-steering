  "query": "A banana plantation on Jakies Island can produce ten times as many bananas as a banana plantation on a nearby island. If the banana plantation on the nearby island produced 9000 bananas in a year, what's the total banana produce from the two islands that year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the banana plantation on the nearby island produced 9000 bananas in a year.",
    "The question states that the banana plantation on Jakies Island produces ten times as many bananas as the nearby island.",
    "To find out how many bananas the plantation on Jakies Island produced, I need to multiply the production of the nearby island by ten.",
    "9000 bananas \u00d7 10 = 90000 bananas.",
    "Now I have the production numbers for both islands: nearby island = 9000 bananas and Jakies Island = 90000 bananas.",
    "To find the total banana produce from the two islands, I add the bananas from both islands together.",
    "9000 bananas + 90000 bananas = 99000 bananas."

  "solution": "99000"
