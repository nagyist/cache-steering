  "query": "On Black Friday a popular electronics store sells 327 televisions. This is 50 more than they sold last Black Friday. If this sales trend continues and they sell 50 more televisions each year for three years, how many televisions will they sell on Black Friday three years from now?",
  "steps": [
    "Currently, the store sold 327 televisions on Black Friday.",
    "This is 50 more televisions than they sold last Black Friday. Therefore, they sold 327 - 50 = 277 televisions last year.",
    "The sales trend is that they sell 50 more televisions each year than the previous year.",
    "So, this year they sold 327 televisions, which is 50 more than last year.",
    "Next year, they will sell 327 + 50 = 377 televisions.",
    "The following year, they will sell 377 + 50 = 427 televisions.",
    "In the third year from now, they will sell 427 + 50 = 477 televisions."
