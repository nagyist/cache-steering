  "query": "Nancy wanted to make peanut butter cookies for a family gathering, but her cousin is allergic to peanuts. She decided to make almond butter cookies instead. A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies. A jar of peanut butter costs $3. How many dollars more does it cost per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the cost of a jar of almond butter.",
    "A jar of peanut butter costs $3.",
    "A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does.",
    "Therefore, the cost of a jar of almond butter is 3 times $3.",
    "Calculating the cost of a jar of almond butter: $3 * 3 = $9.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost per batch for both types of cookies.",
    "Each batch requires half a jar of nut butter, whether it's peanut or almond butter.",
    "For peanut butter cookies, half a jar costs 0.5 * $3 = $1.50.",
    "For almond butter cookies, half a jar costs 0.5 * $9 = $4.50.",
    "To find out how many dollars more it costs per batch to make almond butter cookies, I subtract the cost per batch of peanut butter cookies from the cost per batch of almond butter cookies.",
    "The difference in cost is $4.50 - $1.50.",
    "Calculating the difference: $4.50 - $1.50 = $3.00."
