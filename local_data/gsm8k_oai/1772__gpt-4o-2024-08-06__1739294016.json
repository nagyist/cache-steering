    "I need to find the total distance Tod drove.",
    "He drove 55 miles to the north and 95 miles to the west.",
    "Add the distances together: 55 miles + 95 miles = 150 miles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how long it took if Tod drove 25 miles per hour.",
    "To find the time, divide the total distance by the speed: 150 miles / 25 miles per hour.",
    "150 divided by 25 is 6."
