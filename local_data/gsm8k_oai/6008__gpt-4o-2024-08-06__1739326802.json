  "query": "Tom catches crabs for a living.  He has 8 crab buckets that he checks every day.  Each crab bucket gets 12 crabs.  He sells each of these crabs for $5 each.  How much money does he make per week?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom has 8 crab buckets.",
    "Each crab bucket gets 12 crabs.",
    "To find out the total number of crabs Tom catches in a day, I need to multiply the number of buckets by the number of crabs per bucket.",
    "8 buckets * 12 crabs per bucket = 96 crabs.",
    "Tom sells each crab for $5.",
    "To find out how much money Tom makes in a day, I need to multiply the total number of crabs by the selling price per crab.",
    "96 crabs * $5 per crab = $480.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much money Tom makes in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week: $480 per day * 7 days = $3360."
