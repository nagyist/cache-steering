  "query": "Sam has 3 German Shepherds and 4 French Bulldogs. Peter wants to buy 3 times as many German Shepherds as Sam has and 2 times as many French Bulldogs as Sam has. How many dogs does Peter want to have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many German Shepherds Sam has. According to the problem, Sam has 3 German Shepherds.",
    "Peter wants to have 3 times as many German Shepherds as Sam. So, I need to multiply the number of German Shepherds Sam has (which is 3) by 3.",
    "3 multiplied by 3 is 9. Therefore, Peter wants to have 9 German Shepherds.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many French Bulldogs Sam has. According to the problem, Sam has 4 French Bulldogs.",
    "Peter wants to have 2 times as many French Bulldogs as Sam. So, I need to multiply the number of French Bulldogs Sam has (which is 4) by 2.",
    "4 multiplied by 2 is 8. Therefore, Peter wants to have 8 French Bulldogs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of dogs Peter wants to have. This would be the sum of the German Shepherds and French Bulldogs he wants.",
    "Peter wants 9 German Shepherds and 8 French Bulldogs.",
    "9 plus 8 is 17."
