  "query": "Edith has 80 novels stuffed on her schoolbook shelf, half as many as the number of writing books she has stuffed in her suitcase. How many novels and writing books does Edith have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Edith has 80 novels on her schoolbook shelf.",
    "The problem states that she has half as many novels as she has writing books.",
    "Let's denote the number of writing books as W.",
    "According to the problem, 80 novels is half of the number of writing books, so 80 = W/2.",
    "To find W, multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 80 * 2 = W.",
    "This gives W = 160.",
    "Now we have 80 novels and 160 writing books.",
    "To find the total number of novels and writing books, add the two quantities together: 80 + 160.",
    "80 + 160 = 240."

  "solution": "240"
