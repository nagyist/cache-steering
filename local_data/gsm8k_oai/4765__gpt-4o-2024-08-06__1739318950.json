  "query": "Javier spends 30 minutes outlining his speech, 28 more minutes writing than outlining, and half as much time practicing as writing. How much time does he spend on his speech in total?",
  "steps": [
    "Javier spends 30 minutes outlining his speech.",
    "He spends 28 more minutes writing than outlining, which means he spends 30 + 28 = 58 minutes writing.",
    "Javier spends half as much time practicing as writing, which means he spends 58 / 2 = 29 minutes practicing.",
    "To find the total time spent, I need to add up all the time spent on each activity: outlining, writing, and practicing.",
    "The total time spent is 30 (outlining) + 58 (writing) + 29 (practicing) = 117 minutes."
