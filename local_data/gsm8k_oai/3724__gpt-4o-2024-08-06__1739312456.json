  "query": "Bruce recently had a birthday. His aunt sent him a card with $75 and his grandfather sent him a card that had $150 in it. He wants to go on a trip to Europe soon, so he decides to put one-fifth of the money he got for his birthday in the bank. How much money did he put in the bank?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of money Bruce received for his birthday.",
    "Bruce received $75 from his aunt.",
    "Bruce also received $150 from his grandfather.",
    "To find the total amount, I add the amounts from his aunt and grandfather: $75 + $150.",
    "$75 + $150 equals $225.",
    "Next, I need to calculate one-fifth of the total amount Bruce received.",
    "One-fifth is the same as dividing by 5.",
    "So, I need to divide $225 by 5.",
    "$225 divided by 5 equals $45.",
    "Therefore, Bruce put $45 in the bank."

  "solution": "45"
