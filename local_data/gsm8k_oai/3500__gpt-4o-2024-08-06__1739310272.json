  "query": "I run 12 miles in 90 minutes. What is my average speed in miles per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many hours are equivalent to 90 minutes.",
    "I know that there are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "To convert 90 minutes into hours, I divide 90 by 60.",
    "90 divided by 60 equals 1.5 hours.",
    "Now, I need to find the average speed in miles per hour.",
    "Average speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.",
    "The total distance I've run is 12 miles.",
    "The total time in hours is 1.5 hours.",
    "I divide the distance (12 miles) by the time (1.5 hours).",
    "12 divided by 1.5 equals 8.",
    "So, my average speed is 8 miles per hour."
