  "steps": [
    "Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies.",
    "His baseball season lasts for 4 months.",
    "He needs to save up enough money for 4 months of supplies.",
    "Calculate the total cost of the supplies: $100 per month times 4 months equals $400.",
    "Gerald's off-season lasts for 12 months in a year minus the 4 months of the season, which leaves him with 8 months to save.",
    "He wants to save up $400 over those 8 months.",
    "Calculate how much he needs to save per month: $400 divided by 8 months equals $50 per month.",
    "Each chore Gerald does earns him $10.",
    "To save $50 in a month, determine how many chores he needs to do: $50 divided by $10 per chore equals 5 chores per month."
