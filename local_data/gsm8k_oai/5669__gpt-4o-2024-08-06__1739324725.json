  "query": "Jett bought a cow from the market at $600 and took it to his farm. He spent $20 every day to buy food. He also used $500 to vaccinate and deworm the cow. If he sold the cow for $2500 after 40 days, calculate the profit he made from selling back the cow to the market.",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the initial cost Jett incurred to buy the cow. This cost was $600.",
    "Next, calculate the total expenditure on food. Jett spent $20 per day for 40 days, so the total food cost is 20 * 40 = $800.",
    "Jett also spent $500 on vaccination and deworming. Add this to his expenses.",
    "Add the initial cost, food cost, and vaccine cost together to find the total expenses. The calculation is 600 + 800 + 500.",
    "Calculate 600 + 800 = 1400.",
    "Then calculate 1400 + 500 = 1900. The total expenses are $1900.",
    "Next, determine the amount Jett received from selling the cow, which is $2500.",
    "Subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the profit. The calculation is 2500 - 1900.",
    "Calculate 2500 - 1900 = 600. The profit Jett made is $600."
