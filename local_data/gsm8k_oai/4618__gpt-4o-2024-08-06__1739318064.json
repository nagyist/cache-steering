  "query": "Dexter filled 3 fewer plastic boxes with football cards than basketball cards. He filled 9 boxes with basketball cards and each box has 15 cards. For the boxes with football cards, he filled each box with 20 cards. How many cards does Dexter have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many boxes of football cards Dexter has. Since he filled 3 fewer boxes with football cards than basketball cards, and he filled 9 boxes with basketball cards, I subtract 3 from 9.",
    "9 - 3 = 6, so Dexter has 6 boxes of football cards.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of basketball cards. He has 9 boxes of basketball cards, each containing 15 cards.",
    "To find the total number of basketball cards, I multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box: 9 * 15.",
    "9 * 15 = 135, so Dexter has 135 basketball cards.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of football cards. He has 6 boxes of football cards, each containing 20 cards.",
    "To find the total number of football cards, I multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box: 6 * 20.",
    "6 * 20 = 120, so Dexter has 120 football cards.",
    "Finally, I add the total number of basketball cards and football cards to find the total number of cards Dexter has.",
    "135 (basketball cards) + 120 (football cards) = 255."
