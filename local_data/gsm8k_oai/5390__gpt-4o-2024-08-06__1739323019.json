  "query": "A milk teas shop was able to sell a total of 50 cups of milk tea yesterday. Two-fifths of their sales are winter melon flavor, three-tenths are Okinawa flavor, and the rest are chocolate flavor. How many cups of chocolate-flavored milk tea were they able to sell yesterday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cups of winter melon flavored milk tea were sold. I know that two-fifths of 50 cups were winter melon flavor.",
    "To find the number of winter melon flavored cups, I calculate (2/5) * 50.",
    "(2/5) * 50 = 20. So, 20 cups of winter melon flavor were sold.",
    "Next, I will determine how many cups of Okinawa flavored milk tea were sold. Three-tenths of the 50 cups were Okinawa flavor.",
    "To find the number of Okinawa flavored cups, I calculate (3/10) * 50.",
    "(3/10) * 50 = 15. So, 15 cups of Okinawa flavor were sold.",
    "Now, I need to find how many cups of chocolate flavored milk tea were sold. The rest of the sales were chocolate flavor.",
    "The total sales of winter melon and Okinawa flavors is 20 + 15 = 35 cups.",
    "To find the chocolate flavored milk tea sales, I subtract the total flavored cups from the overall total: 50 - 35.",
    "50 - 35 = 15. Therefore, 15 cups of chocolate flavored milk tea were sold."
