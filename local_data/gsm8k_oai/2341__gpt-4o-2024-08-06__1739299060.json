  "query": "Bill and Ted head to the river to throw stuff into the water. Bill throws 6 more sticks into the river than Ted does, but Ted tosses twice as many rocks into the river as Bill. If Ted tosses 10 sticks and 10 rocks into the river, how many objects did Bill toss into the river?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many sticks Ted throws. The problem states that Ted tosses 10 sticks.",
    "Bill throws 6 more sticks than Ted. Since Ted throws 10 sticks, Bill throws 10 + 6 sticks.",
    "Performing the calculation, Bill throws 16 sticks into the river.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many rocks Ted tosses. The problem states that Ted tosses 10 rocks.",
    "Ted tosses twice as many rocks as Bill, so if Ted tosses 10 rocks, Bill tosses half that number.",
    "Calculating half of 10, Bill throws 5 rocks into the river.",
    "To find out the total number of objects Bill tosses into the river, I add the number of sticks to the number of rocks.",
    "Bill throws 16 sticks and 5 rocks. So, the total is 16 + 5.",
    "Performing the calculation, Bill tosses a total of 21 objects into the river."

  "solution": "21"
