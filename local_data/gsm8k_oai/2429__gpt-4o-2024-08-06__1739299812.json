  "query": "Bea and Dawn both have a lemonade stand. Bea sells her lemonade at 25 cents while Dawn sells hers at 28 cents. If Bea sold 10 glasses and Dawn sold 8 glasses, how much more money (in cents) did Bea earn than Dawn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Bea earned by selling her lemonade.",
    "Bea sold 10 glasses at 25 cents each.",
    "I multiply 10 glasses by 25 cents per glass to get Bea's total earnings.",
    "10 * 25 = 250. Bea earned 250 cents.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Dawn earned by selling her lemonade.",
    "Dawn sold 8 glasses at 28 cents each.",
    "I multiply 8 glasses by 28 cents per glass to get Dawn's total earnings.",
    "8 * 28 = 224. Dawn earned 224 cents.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the difference between Bea's earnings and Dawn's earnings.",
    "I subtract Dawn's earnings from Bea's earnings: 250 - 224.",
    "250 - 224 = 26."

  "solution": "26"
