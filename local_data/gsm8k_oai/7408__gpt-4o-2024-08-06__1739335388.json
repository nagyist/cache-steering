  "query": "A storm dropped 5 inches of rain in the first thirty minutes.  In the next 30 minutes, the hurricane dropped half that amount of rain.  It then dropped 1/2 inch of rain for the next hour.  What was the average rainfall total for the duration of the storm?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that the storm dropped 5 inches of rain in the first thirty minutes.",
    "In the next 30 minutes, it dropped half that amount of rain. Half of 5 inches is 2.5 inches.",
    "So, in the first hour (which consists of two 30-minute periods), the total rain dropped is 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 inches.",
    "The storm then dropped 0.5 inch of rain for the next hour.",
    "Thus, in the second hour, the total rain dropped is 0.5 inch, since it consistently dropped this amount the whole hour.",
    "Calculating the total rainfall for the entire duration: 7.5 inches (first hour) + 0.5 inches (second hour) = 8 inches.",
    "The entire storm duration is 1 hour (first period of rain) + 1 hour (second period of rain) = 2 hours.",
    "To find the average rainfall total, we divide the total rainfall by the total duration of the storm in hours. Thus, 8 inches / 2 hours = 4 inches per hour."
