  "query": "3/5 of the mangoes on a mango tree are ripe. If Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes, calculate the number of ripe mangoes remaining if there were 400 mangoes on the tree to start with.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by calculating the number of ripe mangoes on the tree.",
    "There are 400 mangoes on the tree initially.",
    "3/5 of the mangoes are ripe.",
    "To find the number of ripe mangoes, multiply 400 by 3/5.",
    "400 multiplied by 3/5 is equal to (400 * 3) / 5.",
    "1200 divided by 5 is equal to 240.",
    "Thus, there are 240 ripe mangoes on the tree.",
    "Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes.",
    "To find out how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats, calculate 60% of 240.",
    "60% of 240 is equal to (60/100) * 240.",
    "This is equivalent to 0.6 * 240.",
    "0.6 multiplied by 240 is equal to 144.",
    "Thus, Lindsay eats 144 ripe mangoes.",
    "To find the number of ripe mangoes remaining, subtract the number of mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes.",
    "240 (the original number of ripe mangoes) minus 144 (the number eaten by Lindsay) is equal to 96."

  "solution": "96"
