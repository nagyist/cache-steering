  "query": "The journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles and is divided into 5 equal portions. Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour. After traveling for 0.7 hours, how many portions of the journey has he covered?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles Abel covers in 0.7 hours at a speed of 40 miles per hour.",
    "To find the distance traveled, I multiply the time by the speed: \\(0.7 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 40 \\, \\text{miles per hour} = 28 \\, \\text{miles}\\).",
    "Next, I calculate the length of each portion of the journey. The total journey is 35 miles and is divided into 5 equal portions.",
    "Each portion is \\( \\frac{35 \\, \\text{miles}}{5} = 7 \\, \\text{miles} \\).",
    "Now, I need to determine how many 7-mile portions Abel has covered by traveling 28 miles.",
    "To find the number of portions covered, I divide the distance Abel has traveled by the length of each portion: \\( \\frac{28 \\, \\text{miles}}{7 \\, \\text{miles per portion}} = 4 \\).",
    "Abel has covered 4 portions of his journey."

  "solution": "4"
