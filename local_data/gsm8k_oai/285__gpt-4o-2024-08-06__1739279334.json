  "query": "John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of minutes for the entire show.",
    "There are 20 episodes and each episode is 30 minutes long.",
    "I will multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total minutes: 20 episodes * 30 minutes/episode.",
    "20 * 30 = 600 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to convert the total minutes to hours because the question asks for hours per day.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I will divide the total minutes by 60.",
    "600 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours.",
    "John wants to watch all episodes in 5 days, so I need to divide the total hours by the number of days.",
    "10 hours / 5 days = 2 hours per day."
