  "query": "Ellen is baking bread. It takes 3 hours to rise 1 ball of dough, and then another 2 hours to bake it. If she makes 4 balls of dough one after another and then bakes them one after another when they're done rising, how many hours will it take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider how long it takes to complete the process of rising and baking for a single ball of dough.",
    "For one ball of dough, it takes 3 hours to rise and 2 hours to bake.",
    "Adding these together, it takes a total of 5 hours to complete the process for one ball of dough.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time for 4 balls of dough.",
    "If she does them one after another, that means she starts the second after the first is baked, the third after the second is baked, and so on.",
    "For the first ball, it takes 5 hours (3 hours rising + 2 hours baking).",
    "For the second ball, it will start rising after the first is baked, requiring an additional 5 hours.",
    "For the third ball, similarly, it will start after the second ball is completed, adding another 5 hours.",
    "The same logic applies to the fourth ball, requiring another 5 hours on top of everything else.",
    "So the total time required for 4 balls of dough is 4 * 5 hours.",
    "4 * 5 = 20 hours."

  "solution": "20"
