  "query": "Doc's Pizza contains 6 pieces of pizza. Ten fourth-graders each bought 20 pizzas from Doc's Pizza and put them in their box. How many pieces of pizza are the children carrying in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pizzas were bought in total.",
    "There are 10 fourth-graders, each buying 20 pizzas.",
    "So, the total number of pizzas bought is 10 students multiplied by 20 pizzas each.",
    "10 * 20 equals 200 pizzas in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many pieces of pizza there are in each pizza.",
    "Each pizza contains 6 pieces.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of pieces of pizza by multiplying the total number of pizzas by the number of pieces per pizza.",
    "200 pizzas times 6 pieces per pizza equals 1200 pieces of pizza."
