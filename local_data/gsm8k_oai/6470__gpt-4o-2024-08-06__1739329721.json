  "query": "Greg drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market. After buying his groceries at the farmers market, he drives home. To get home, he travels for 30 minutes at 20 miles per hour. How many miles in total does Greg travel?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine the distance Greg travels from the farmer's market to his home.",
    "We know he drives for 30 minutes at a speed of 20 miles per hour.",
    "30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours.",
    "Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time",
    "Distance = 20 miles/hour \u00d7 0.5 hours = 10 miles",
    "Next, we calculate the total distance traveled by Greg.",
    "He drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market.",
    "He then drives 10 miles from the farmer's market to his home.",
    "Total distance = 30 miles + 10 miles",
    "Total distance = 40 miles"
  ],
  "solution": "40"
