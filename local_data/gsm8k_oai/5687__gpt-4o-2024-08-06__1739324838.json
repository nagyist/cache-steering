  "query": "Maddie bought 2 packs of white T-shirts and 4 packs of blue T-shirts for her basketball team. The white T-shirts come in packs of 5, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 3. Each T-shirt cost $3. How much did Maddie spend in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many white T-shirts Maddie bought. Each pack of white T-shirts contains 5 T-shirts, and Maddie bought 2 packs.",
    "Calculating the total number of white T-shirts: 2 packs * 5 T-shirts per pack = 10 white T-shirts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many blue T-shirts Maddie bought. Each pack of blue T-shirts contains 3 T-shirts, and Maddie bought 4 packs.",
    "Calculating the total number of blue T-shirts: 4 packs * 3 T-shirts per pack = 12 blue T-shirts.",
    "Now, I will find the total number of T-shirts Maddie bought by adding the number of white T-shirts and blue T-shirts.",
    "Total number of T-shirts = 10 white T-shirts + 12 blue T-shirts = 22 T-shirts.",
    "Each T-shirt costs $3. To find out how much Maddie spent in total, I need to multiply the total number of T-shirts by the cost per T-shirt.",
    "Total cost = 22 T-shirts * $3 per T-shirt = $66."

  "solution": "66"
