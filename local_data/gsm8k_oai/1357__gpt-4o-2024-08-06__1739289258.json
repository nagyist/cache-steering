  "query": "Lizzy's mother gave her 80 cents and her father gave her 40 cents for keeping to her promise. She went to her uncle's and spent 50 cents buying candy for her little cousin. Her uncle gave her another 70 cents. How many cents does she have now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Lizzy received from her mother and father.",
    "Lizzy's mother gave her 80 cents.",
    "Lizzy's father gave her 40 cents.",
    "To find the total received from her parents, I add these amounts: 80 cents + 40 cents.",
    "80 + 40 equals 120 cents.",
    "Lizzy went to her uncle's and spent 50 cents on candy.",
    "I need to subtract the 50 cents spent from the 120 cents she had after receiving from her parents.",
    "120 - 50 equals 70 cents.",
    "Her uncle then gave her an additional 70 cents.",
    "I need to add the 70 cents from her uncle to the 70 cents she had left after spending.",
    "70 + 70 equals 140 cents."
