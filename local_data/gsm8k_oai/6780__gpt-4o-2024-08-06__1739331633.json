  "query": "Chuck can ride the merry-go-round 5 times longer than Dave who can only ride it for 10 minutes before getting sick.  Erica can stay on the merry-go-round 30% longer than Chuck before getting sick.  How long can Erica stay on the merry-go-round?",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to find out how long Chuck can stay on the merry-go-round.",
    "Chuck can ride the merry-go-round 5 times longer than Dave.",
    "Dave can ride for 10 minutes.",
    "Therefore, Chuck can ride for 5 times 10 minutes.",
    "Calculating 5 times 10 gives 50.",
    "So, Chuck can stay on the merry-go-round for 50 minutes.",
    "Now, let's find out how long Erica can stay on the merry-go-round.",
    "Erica can stay on 30% longer than Chuck.",
    "To find 30% of Chuck's time, we calculate 30% of 50 minutes.",
    "30% as a decimal is 0.30.",
    "Multiplying 50 by 0.30 gives 15.",
    "Erica can ride 15 minutes longer than Chuck.",
    "Adding 15 to Chuck's 50 minutes gives us the total time Erica can ride.",
    "50 plus 15 equals 65."

  "solution": "65"
