  "query": "Mitch is baking a cake and needs 3 cups of flour and two cups of sugar. He doesn't have a one cup scoop, only a 1/3 cup scoop. How many total scoops will he need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many scoops of flour Mitch needs.",
    "He needs 3 cups of flour.",
    "Since Mitch only has a 1/3 cup scoop, he will need to take 3 scoops to get 1 full cup of flour.",
    "To find the total number of scoops for flour, I multiply 3 cups by 3 scoops per cup.",
    "3 cups x 3 scoops/cup = 9 scoops of flour.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many scoops of sugar Mitch needs.",
    "He needs 2 cups of sugar.",
    "Similarly, he will need to take 3 scoops to get 1 cup of sugar.",
    "To find the total number of scoops for sugar, I multiply 2 cups by 3 scoops per cup.",
    "2 cups x 3 scoops/cup = 6 scoops of sugar.",
    "Now, I add the scoops needed for flour and sugar together to get the total number of scoops.",
    "9 scoops of flour + 6 scoops of sugar = 15 scoops total."

  "solution": "15"
