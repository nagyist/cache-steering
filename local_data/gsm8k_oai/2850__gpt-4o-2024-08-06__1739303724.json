  "query": "Mr. John works at a shopping mall and receives a monthly income of $2000, but he spends approximately 5% of this amount on public transport to and from the mall in a month. How much will he have left after deducting his monthly transport fare from his income?",
  "steps": [
    "Mr. John's monthly income is $2000.",
    "He spends approximately 5% of this amount on public transport.",
    "First, I need to calculate 5% of $2000 to find his monthly transport fare.",
    "5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal form.",
    "To calculate 5% of $2000, multiply $2000 by 0.05.",
    "$2000 * 0.05 = $100",
    "So, Mr. John spends $100 on public transport each month.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the monthly transport fare from Mr. John's monthly income.",
    "Subtracting $100 from $2000 gives $1900.",
    "Therefore, after deducting his transport fare, Mr. John will have $1900 left from his monthly income."

  "solution": "1900"
