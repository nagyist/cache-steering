  "query": "Vaishali wears a beautiful piece of clothing called a Saree,  a traditional Indian dress for women.  It is mostly tangerine-colored, with blue, brown, and gold-colored decorative stripes.  There are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes, and five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes. If there are 4 brown stripes, how many blue stripes does Vaishali's Saree have?",
  "steps": [
    "I know there are 4 brown stripes on the Saree.",
    "The problem states there are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes.",
    "Therefore, there are 3 * 4 = 12 gold stripes.",
    "The problem also states there are five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes.",
    "So, I need to multiply the number of gold stripes by 5 to get the number of blue stripes.",
    "This means there are 5 * 12 = 60 blue stripes."

  "solution": "60"
