  "query": "William and Harry played 15 rounds of tic-tac-toe.  William won 5 more rounds than Harry.  How many rounds did William win?",
  "steps": [
    "Let W represent the number of rounds William won.",
    "Let H represent the number of rounds Harry won.",
    "According to the problem, W = H + 5.",
    "The total number of rounds played is given as 15.",
    "Therefore, the equation is W + H = 15.",
    "Substitute the value of W from the equation W = H + 5 into the W + H = 15 equation.",
    "This gives (H + 5) + H = 15.",
    "Combine like terms to get 2H + 5 = 15.",
    "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2H = 10.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for H: H = 5.",
    "Substitute the value of H back into the W = H + 5 equation.",
    "This gives W = 5 + 5.",
    "Therefore, W = 10."
