  "query": "A lorry is 500 pounds when empty. What will its weight be if it's loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "The weight of the empty lorry is 500 pounds.",
    "Each bag of apples weighs 60 pounds.",
    "There are 20 bags of apples.",
    "First, calculate the total weight of the apples by multiplying the weight of each bag by the number of bags.",
    "60 pounds per bag multiplied by 20 bags equals 1200 pounds.",
    "Next, add the weight of the apples to the weight of the empty lorry to find the total weight.",
    "500 pounds (lorry) plus 1200 pounds (apples) equals 1700 pounds."
