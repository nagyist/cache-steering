    "John took a test with a total of 80 questions.",
    "For the first 40 questions, John got 90% correct.",
    "To find how many questions John got right in the first half, calculate 90% of 40.",
    "90% of 40 is calculated as (90/100) * 40 = 36.",
    "Therefore, John got 36 questions right in the first half.",
    "For the next 40 questions, John got 95% correct.",
    "To find how many questions John got right in the second half, calculate 95% of 40.",
    "95% of 40 is calculated as (95/100) * 40 = 38.",
    "John got 38 questions right in the second half.",
    "Now add the number of correct answers from both halves to find the total number of correct questions.",
    "36 (first half) + 38 (second half) = 74."
