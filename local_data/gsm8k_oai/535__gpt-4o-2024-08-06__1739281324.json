  "query": "Tim buys 3 dozen eggs.  Eggs cost $.50 each.  How much did he pay for eggs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eggs Tim bought. A dozen means 12, so 3 dozen eggs is 3 times 12.",
    "3 times 12 is 36. So, Tim bought 36 eggs in total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of these 36 eggs. Each egg costs $0.50.",
    "To find the total cost, I should multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg, which is 36 eggs times $0.50 per egg.",
    "36 times 0.50 is equal to 18. Therefore, the total cost for the eggs is $18."
  ],
  "solution": "18"
