  "query": "At a UFO convention, there are 120 conference attendees. If there are 4 more male attendees than female attendees, how many male attendees are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number of female attendees as F.",
    "The number of male attendees would then be F + 4, since there are 4 more males than females.",
    "The total number of attendees is the sum of male and female attendees. So, F + (F + 4) = 120.",
    "Simplifying this equation: 2F + 4 = 120.",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides: 2F = 116.",
    "Divide both sides by 2: F = 58.",
    "If F = 58, then the number of male attendees is F + 4, which is 58 + 4.",
    "So, the number of male attendees is 62."

  "solution": "62"
