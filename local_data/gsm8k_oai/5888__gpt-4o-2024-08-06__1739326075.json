  "query": "Julie works at a restaurant that pays her an hourly rate of $5. She works 8 hours a day and 6 days a week. How much is her monthly salary if she was not able to go to work for a day?",
  "steps": [
    "Julie earns $5 per hour.",
    "She works 8 hours a day.",
    "To calculate her daily earnings, we multiply 5 dollars per hour by 8 hours.",
    "5 * 8 = 40",
    "So, Julie earns $40 per day.",
    "She usually works 6 days a week.",
    "To calculate her weekly earnings, multiply her daily earnings by 6.",
    "40 * 6 = 240",
    "Julie usually earns $240 per week.",
    "There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.",
    "To calculate her usual monthly earnings, multiply her weekly earnings by 4.",
    "240 * 4 = 960",
    "Her usual monthly salary is $960.",
    "Since she missed one day of work, she didn't earn for one day.",
    "Her daily earning is $40, and she missed one day, so she missed out on $40.",
    "Subtract the missed earnings from her usual monthly salary.",
    "960 - 40 = 920"
  ],
  "solution": "920"
