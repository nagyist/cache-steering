  "query": "Daphney buys 5 kg of potatoes at the supermarket. If 2 kg of potatoes costs $6, how much will she pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of 1 kg of potatoes.",
    "I know that 2 kg of potatoes costs $6.",
    "To find the cost of 1 kg, I need to divide the total cost by the total weight.",
    "So, $6 \u00f7 2 kg = $3 per kg.",
    "Now that I know the cost per kg, I can calculate the cost for 5 kg.",
    "I will multiply the cost per kg by the total weight Daphney is purchasing.",
    "That is, $3 per kg \u00d7 5 kg = $15.",
    "Therefore, Daphney will pay $15 for 5 kg of potatoes."
