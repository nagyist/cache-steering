  "query": "Bob, a marathon runner, is preparing for a race.  He runs a total of 70 miles in the 3 days leading up to the race. On day one he runs 20 percent of the total miles and on day 2 he runs 50 percent of the remaining miles.  How many miles does he run on day three to complete the 70 miles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total miles Bob runs, which is given as 70 miles.",
    "On day one, Bob runs 20 percent of the total 70 miles.",
    "Calculate the miles run on day one: 20% of 70 miles = 0.20 * 70 = 14 miles.",
    "Subtract the miles run on day one from the total miles to find the remaining miles: 70 miles - 14 miles = 56 miles.",
    "On day two, Bob runs 50 percent of the remaining miles (56 miles).",
    "Calculate the miles run on day two: 50% of 56 miles = 0.50 * 56 = 28 miles.",
    "Subtract the miles run on day two from the remaining miles to find the miles left to run on day three: 56 miles - 28 miles = 28 miles."

  "solution": "28"
