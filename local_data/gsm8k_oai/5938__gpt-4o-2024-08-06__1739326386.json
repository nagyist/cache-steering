  "query": "A man is purchasing a pair of sneakers at a club store where he receives a membership discount of 10% off any purchase.  In addition to the membership discount, the man also has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers.  If the man wants to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers and the membership discount must be applied after the coupon, how much will he pay for the sneakers after using both the coupon and membership discount?",
  "steps": [
    "The original price of the sneakers is $120.",
    "The man has a coupon for $10 off. First, I will subtract the coupon amount from the original price.",
    "$120 - $10 = $110. The price after applying the coupon is $110.",
    "Next, I need to apply the membership discount of 10% to the price after the coupon.",
    "10% of $110 is calculated as $110 * 0.10 = $11.",
    "Now, I subtract the 10% discount amount from the price after the coupon.",
    "$110 - $11 = $99. The final price after applying both the coupon and the membership discount is $99."

  "solution": "99"
