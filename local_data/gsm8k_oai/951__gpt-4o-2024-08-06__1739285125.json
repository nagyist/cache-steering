  "query": "Michonne is inviting her friends to her birthday party. She invites 6 of her friends from school and 12 of her friends from her neighborhood. Each of her friends asks if they can bring two friends along as well. How many people are going to Michonne\u2019s birthday party?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many friends Michonne originally invited.",
    "Michonne invited 6 friends from school.",
    "Michonne also invited 12 friends from her neighborhood.",
    "To find the total number of friends invited, I add the school friends and neighborhood friends.",
    "6 + 12 = 18",
    "So, Michonne invited 18 friends in total.",
    "Each friend can bring two additional friends.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of additional friends coming.",
    "Each of the 18 invited friends is bringing 2 additional friends.",
    "I need to multiply the number of invited friends by the number of additional friends each can bring.",
    "18 * 2 = 36",
    "Therefore, 36 additional friends are coming.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of people attending the party.",
    "I add the original invited friends and the additional friends they are bringing.",
    "18 + 36 = 54"
  ],
  "solution": "54"
