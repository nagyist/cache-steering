  "query": "John buys dinner plates and silverware.  The silverware cost $20.  The dinner plates cost 50% as much as the silverware.  How much did he pay for everything?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know from the problem that the silverware costs $20.",
    "Next, the problem states that the dinner plates cost 50% as much as the silverware.",
    "To find out how much the dinner plates cost, I calculate 50% of the $20 the silverware costs.",
    "50% of $20 is 0.50 times $20, which equals $10.",
    "Now, I know the cost of the dinner plates is $10.",
    "To find out how much John paid for everything, I need to add the cost of the silverware and the dinner plates together.",
    "The silverware costs $20, and the dinner plates cost $10.",
    "Therefore, the total cost is $20 + $10.",
    "$20 + $10 equals $30."

  "solution": "30"
