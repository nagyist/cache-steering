  "query": "Jerry is trying to cut down on the amount of soda he drinks. Right now, he drinks 48 sodas a week. If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, how many weeks will it take him to only drink 6 sodas per week?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerry currently drinks 48 sodas a week.",
    "He plans to cut his consumption in half each week.",
    "After the first week, he will drink half of 48 sodas. So, 48 / 2 = 24 sodas.",
    "After the second week, he will again cut his consumption in half. So, 24 / 2 = 12 sodas.",
    "After the third week, he will cut his consumption in half again. So, 12 / 2 = 6 sodas.",
    "Jerry will reach 6 sodas per week after 3 weeks."
