  "query": "Fred has 12 identical candy bars, and Uncle Bob has 6 more. If Jacqueline has ten times the total number of candy bars Fred and Uncle Bob have, what's 40% of Jacqueline's candy bars?",
  "steps": [
    "Fred has 12 candy bars.",
    "Uncle Bob has 6 more candy bars than Fred.",
    "Therefore, Uncle Bob has 12 + 6 = 18 candy bars.",
    "I need to find the total number of candy bars Fred and Uncle Bob have together.",
    "The total is 12 (Fred's candy bars) + 18 (Uncle Bob's candy bars) = 30 candy bars.",
    "Jacqueline has ten times the total number of candy bars Fred and Uncle Bob have.",
    "Therefore, Jacqueline has 10 * 30 = 300 candy bars.",
    "Now, I need to calculate 40% of Jacqueline's candy bars.",
    "40% of 300 is calculated as 0.40 * 300.",
    "0.40 * 300 = 120"
  ],
  "solution": "120"
