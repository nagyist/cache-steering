  "query": "Susan has 3 fish tanks to fill. 1 fish tank contains 7 goldfish and 8 beta fish. The second fish tank contains twice as many fish as the first tank and the third fish tank has a third of the number of fish in the second fish tank. How many fish are in the third fish tank?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of fish in the first fish tank.",
    "The first fish tank has 7 goldfish and 8 beta fish.",
    "So, the total number of fish in the first tank is 7 + 8 = 15 fish.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of fish in the second fish tank.",
    "The second fish tank contains twice as many fish as the first tank.",
    "Twice the number of fish in the first tank is 2 * 15 = 30 fish.",
    "Now, I will calculate the number of fish in the third fish tank.",
    "The third fish tank has a third of the number of fish in the second fish tank.",
    "A third of the fish in the second tank is 30 / 3 = 10 fish."
