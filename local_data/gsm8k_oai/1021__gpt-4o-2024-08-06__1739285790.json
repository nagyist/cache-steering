  "query": "Porche has 3 hours to get all her homework done. Her math homework takes her 45 minutes. Her English homework takes her 30 minutes. Her science homework takes her 50 minutes. Her history homework takes her 25 minutes. She also has a special project due the next day. How much time does she have left to get that project done?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of time Porche spends on her math homework.",
    "The math homework takes 45 minutes.",
    "Next, I will determine the total time she spends on her English homework.",
    "The English homework takes 30 minutes.",
    "Now, I will find out how much time she spends on her science homework.",
    "The science homework takes 50 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time spent on her history homework.",
    "The history homework takes 25 minutes.",
    "I will add up all the time spent on each subject to find the total time spent on homework.",
    "Total time spent = 45 minutes (math) + 30 minutes (English) + 50 minutes (science) + 25 minutes (history).",
    "Let's do the addition: 45 + 30 = 75, 75 + 50 = 125, 125 + 25 = 150.",
    "Porche spends a total of 150 minutes on her homework.",
    "Next, I need to compare this time with the total time available, which is 3 hours.",
    "3 hours is equivalent to 180 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the time spent on homework from the total available time.",
    "Time left for the project = 180 minutes (total time) - 150 minutes (homework time).",
    "This subtraction gives 180 - 150 = 30 minutes."
