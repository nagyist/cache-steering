  "query": "A gecko lays 30 eggs per year. 20 percent of them are infertile, and a third of the remaining eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues.  How many eggs actually hatch?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by calculating the number of infertile eggs.",
    "20 percent of 30 eggs is 0.20 * 30 = 6 eggs.",
    "Subtract the number of infertile eggs from the total number of eggs to find the remaining fertile eggs.",
    "30 total eggs - 6 infertile eggs = 24 fertile eggs.",
    "Now calculate the eggs that will not hatch due to calcification from the remaining fertile eggs.",
    "A third of the 24 fertile eggs will not hatch due to calcification.",
    "Calculate one third of 24 eggs: 24 / 3 = 8 eggs.",
    "Subtract the number of eggs that will not hatch due to calcification from the fertile eggs to find the number of eggs that actually hatch.",
    "24 fertile eggs - 8 eggs with calcification issues = 16 eggs."
