  "query": "Libby has 160 quarters in her piggy bank. She has to pay $35 to replace her sister\u2019s dress that she borrowed and ruined. After replacing the dress, how many quarters will Libby have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money in dollars Libby has in her piggy bank with 160 quarters.",
    "There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so I will divide the number of quarters, which is 160, by 4.",
    "160 divided by 4 is 40. So, Libby has $40 in her piggy bank.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money Libby will have left after spending $35 to replace the dress.",
    "I will subtract $35 from the $40 that Libby has.",
    "40 minus 35 is 5. So, Libby will have $5 left.",
    "Finally, I need to convert the remaining $5 back into quarters.",
    "Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, I will multiply 5 by 4.",
    "5 times 4 is 20. Thus, Libby will have 20 quarters left."

  "solution": "20"
