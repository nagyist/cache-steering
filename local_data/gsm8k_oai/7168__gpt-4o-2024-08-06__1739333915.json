  "query": "Wario is a field goal kicker on the high school football team.  He attempts 60 field goals throughout the season.  He misses 1/4 of the field goals.  Of the field goals missed 20 percent were wide right.  How many missed field goals went wide right?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many field goals Wario missed.",
    "He attempted 60 field goals and missed 1/4 of them.",
    "To find the number of missed field goals, calculate 1/4 of 60.",
    "1/4 of 60 is 60 divided by 4, which equals 15.",
    "Wario missed 15 field goals in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many of these missed field goals were wide right.",
    "20 percent of the missed field goals went wide right.",
    "To find 20 percent of the missed field goals, calculate 20 percent of 15.",
    "20 percent of 15 is (20/100) times 15.",
    "(20/100) times 15 equals 3."
