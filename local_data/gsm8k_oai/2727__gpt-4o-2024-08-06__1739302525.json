  "query": "Oshea bought 200 basil seeds. He wants to plant them in planters. He has 4 large planters that can hold 20 seeds each. He also has small planters that can hold 4 seeds each. How many small planters will he need to plant all the basil seeds?",
  "steps": [
    "Oshea has a total of 200 basil seeds to plant.",
    "He has 4 large planters, and each can hold 20 seeds.",
    "Calculate the total number of seeds that can be planted in the large planters: 4 large planters * 20 seeds each = 80 seeds.",
    "Subtract the seeds planted in large planters from the total seeds: 200 total seeds - 80 seeds in large planters = 120 seeds remaining.",
    "Next, calculate how many small planters are needed for the remaining seeds.",
    "Each small planter can hold 4 seeds.",
    "Divide the remaining seeds by the capacity of a small planter: 120 seeds remaining \u00f7 4 seeds per small planter = 30 small planters needed."

  "solution": "30"
