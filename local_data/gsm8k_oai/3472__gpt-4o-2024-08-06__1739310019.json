  "query": "Tom rents a helicopter for 2 hours a day for 3 days.  It cost $75 an hour to rent.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many hours in total Tom rents the helicopter.",
    "Tom rents the helicopter for 2 hours each day.",
    "He rents it for 3 days.",
    "To find the total hours, I multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days: 2 hours/day * 3 days.",
    "2 * 3 = 6 hours. So, Tom rents the helicopter for a total of 6 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost.",
    "The helicopter rental rate is $75 per hour.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the total hours by the hourly rate: 6 hours * $75/hour.",
    "6 * 75 = 450.",
    "Therefore, Tom pays a total of $450 for renting the helicopter."
