  "query": "Summer and Jolly both went to the same middle school. However, when they finished college, Summer had five more degrees than Jolly. If Summer has a total of 150 degrees, what's the combined number of degrees they both have?",
  "steps": [
    "Summer has five more degrees than Jolly.",
    "Summer has a total of 150 degrees.",
    "Let's represent the number of degrees Jolly has as \\( x \\).",
    "Since Summer has five more degrees, we can express this as: Summer's degrees = Jolly's degrees + 5.",
    "Substituting the number of degrees Summer has: 150 = \\( x \\) + 5.",
    "To find \\( x \\), subtract 5 from both sides: \\( x \\) = 150 - 5.",
    "This gives: \\( x \\) = 145.",
    "So, Jolly has 145 degrees.",
    "Now, we need the combined number of degrees Summer and Jolly have.",
    "Add the number of degrees Summer has to the number of degrees Jolly has: 150 + 145.",
    "This equals 295."

  "solution": "295"
