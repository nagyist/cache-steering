  "query": "A chocolate cake needs 3 eggs per cake. Cheesecake requires 8 eggs for each cheesecake. How many more eggs are needed for 9 cheesecakes than are needed for 5 chocolate cakes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eggs are needed for the chocolate cakes.",
    "Each chocolate cake requires 3 eggs.",
    "There are 5 chocolate cakes, so I multiply 5 by 3 to find the total eggs needed.",
    "5 chocolate cakes \u00d7 3 eggs per cake = 15 eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes.",
    "Next, I find out how many eggs are required for the cheesecakes.",
    "Each cheesecake requires 8 eggs.",
    "There are 9 cheesecakes, so I multiply 9 by 8 to find the total number of eggs needed.",
    "9 cheesecakes \u00d7 8 eggs per cheesecake = 72 eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes.",
    "Now, I compare the number of eggs needed for the cheesecakes with the chocolate cakes.",
    "Subtract the number of eggs needed for the chocolate cakes from the number of eggs needed for the cheesecakes to find the difference.",
    "72 eggs (cheesecakes) - 15 eggs (chocolate cakes) = 57 more eggs needed for cheesecakes."
