  "query": "Madison makes 30 paper boats and sets them afloat. 20% are eaten by fish and Madison shoots two of the others with flaming arrows. How many boats are left?",
  "steps": [
    "Madison starts with 30 paper boats.",
    "I need to determine how many boats are eaten by fish. 20% of 30 is what I need to calculate.",
    "20% in decimal form is 0.2. Multiplying 30 by 0.2 gives me the number of boats eaten by fish.",
    "30 multiplied by 0.2 is 6. So, 6 boats are eaten by fish.",
    "Now I subtract the number of boats eaten by fish from the total number of boats to find out how many are left before Madison shoots any.",
    "Subtracting 6 from 30 gives me 24 boats left.",
    "Next, Madison shoots two more boats with flaming arrows, so I need to subtract 2 from the remaining 24 boats.",
    "24 minus 2 equals 22 boats.",
    "22 boats are left after accounting for the boats eaten by fish and the ones Madison shoots."

  "solution": "22"
