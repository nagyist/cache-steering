  "query": "At a convention, 16 of 36 delegates arrived with pre-printed name badges. Half of the remaining delegates made their own, hand-written name badges. How many delegates were not wearing name badges?",
  "steps": [
    "First, find out how many delegates did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.",
    "Subtract the number of delegates with pre-printed name badges from the total number of delegates: 36 - 16 = 20.",
    "Next, calculate how many of these remaining delegates made their own badges.",
    "Half of these remaining 20 delegates made their own badges: 20 / 2 = 10.",
    "Now, figure out how many delegates did not have any badges at all.",
    "Subtract the number of delegates who made their own badges from the number of delegates without pre-printed badges: 20 - 10 = 10."
