  "query": "The ratio of boys to girls in a math class is 5:8. How many girls are in the class if the total number of students in the class is 260?",
  "steps": [
    "I'm given the ratio of boys to girls as 5:8.",
    "The total number of students in the class is 260.",
    "The ratio 5:8 means for every 5 boys, there are 8 girls.",
    "The sum of parts of the ratio is 5 + 8 = 13.",
    "This means the class can be divided into 13 equal parts.",
    "I need to calculate the size of one part by dividing the total number of students by the sum of the ratio parts.",
    "260 divided by 13 equals 20. So, each part is equal to 20 students.",
    "To find the number of girls, I multiply the number of parts for girls by the size of one part.",
    "The number of parts for girls is 8.",
    "8 multiplied by 20 equals 160."

  "solution": "160"
