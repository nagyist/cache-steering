  "query": "Lydia has 80 plants. 40% of her plants are flowering plants. Lydia wants to place a fourth of her flowering plants on the porch. If each flowering plant produces 5 flowers, how many flowers are there in total on the porch?",
  "steps": [
    "Lydia has 80 plants in total.",
    "Out of those, 40% are flowering plants.",
    "To find the number of flowering plants, calculate 40% of 80.",
    "40% of 80 is calculated as (40/100) * 80.",
    "(40/100) * 80 equals 32.",
    "Therefore, Lydia has 32 flowering plants.",
    "Lydia wants to place a fourth of her flowering plants on the porch.",
    "To find a fourth of 32, divide 32 by 4.",
    "32 divided by 4 equals 8.",
    "Therefore, Lydia places 8 flowering plants on the porch.",
    "Each flowering plant produces 5 flowers.",
    "To find the total number of flowers on the porch, multiply the number of flowering plants on the porch by the number of flowers each plant produces.",
    "8 flowering plants on the porch times 5 flowers each equals 40 flowers."
