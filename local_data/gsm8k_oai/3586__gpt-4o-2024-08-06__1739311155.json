  "query": "Ernest bought 50 meters of wire and cut it into 5 equal parts. He then used 3 parts of the wire. How many meters of wire is not used?",
  "steps": [
    "Ernest bought 50 meters of wire in total.",
    "He cut the 50 meters into 5 equal parts.",
    "To find the length of each part, I need to divide the total length by the number of parts.",
    "So, I divide 50 meters by 5 parts.",
    "50 divided by 5 is 10.",
    "Each part of the wire is 10 meters long.",
    "Ernest used 3 parts of the wire.",
    "If each part is 10 meters, then the total length of the wire used is 3 times 10.",
    "3 times 10 is 30 meters.",
    "I subtract the wire used from the total length to find out how much is not used.",
    "The total length of wire not used is 50 meters minus 30 meters.",
    "50 minus 30 is 20."

  "solution": "20"
