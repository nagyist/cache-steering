  "query": "Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year. Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May. How many shark sightings are there in Cape May?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the relationship between shark sightings in Daytona Beach and Cape May. Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May.",
    "Let \\( x \\) be the number of shark sightings in Cape May. According to the problem, Daytona Beach has three times the number of sightings in Cape May plus 5.",
    "Set up an equation based on the information given: \\( 3x + 5 = \\text{number of sightings in Daytona Beach} \\).",
    "We know from the problem statement that Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year.",
    "Substitute the known number of sightings in Daytona Beach into the equation: \\( 3x + 5 = 26 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by first subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: \\( 3x = 21 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 7 \\)."
