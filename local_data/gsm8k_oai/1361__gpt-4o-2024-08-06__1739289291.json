  "query": "Annie has some money. The restaurant next door sells hamburgers for $4 each. The restaurant across the street sells milkshakes for $5 each. Annie buys 8 hamburgers and 6 milkshakes. She has $70 left. How much money, in dollars, did Annie have at first?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Annie spent on hamburgers.",
    "Annie buys 8 hamburgers for $4 each.",
    "8 hamburgers at $4 each equals \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) dollars.",
    "Now, I calculate how much Annie spent on milkshakes.",
    "Annie buys 6 milkshakes for $5 each.",
    "6 milkshakes at $5 each equals \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\) dollars.",
    "Now, I add the amount spent on hamburgers and milkshakes together to get the total amount spent.",
    "\\$32 (on hamburgers) + \\$30 (on milkshakes) = \\$62 total spent.",
    "I know that after spending this amount, Annie has $70 left.",
    "I now need to determine how much Annie had at first.",
    "Annie's initial amount of money would be the total spent plus the amount she has left.",
    "Annie had \\(62 + 70\\).",
    "So, Annie had \\(132\\) dollars initially."

  "solution": "132"
