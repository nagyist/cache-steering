  "query": "If Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants, and he has 40 pants, what's the total number of pieces of clothes he owns if all other factors remain the same?",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand the ratio given: Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants.",
    "He has 40 pairs of pants.",
    "To find the total number of shirts, multiply the number of pairs of pants by the ratio of shirts to pants.",
    "Calculate the number of shirts: 6 shirts per pair of pants times 40 pairs of pants equals 6 * 40.",
    "6 * 40 equals 240.",
    "So, Mr. Jones has 240 shirts.",
    "Now add the number of shirts to the number of pants to find the total number of pieces of clothing he owns.",
    "The total number of pieces of clothing is 240 shirts plus 40 pairs of pants.",
    "240 plus 40 equals 280."

  "solution": "280"
