  "query": "Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra. Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty. If Betty has 12 oranges, how many oranges does Emily have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many oranges Sandra has.",
    "I'm told that Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty.",
    "Betty has 12 oranges.",
    "Since Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty, I multiply 12 by 3.",
    "12 times 3 equals 36, so Sandra has 36 oranges.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many oranges Emily has.",
    "Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra.",
    "Sandra has 36 oranges.",
    "I multiply 36 by 7 to find out how many oranges Emily has.",
    "36 times 7 equals 252."
