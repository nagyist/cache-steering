  "query": "Nate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot. He had to walk through every row in Section G and Section H to find it. Section G has 15 rows that each hold 10 cars. Section H has 20 rows that each hold 9 cars. If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cars are in Section G.",
    "Section G has 15 rows, and each row holds 10 cars.",
    "I multiply the number of rows by the number of cars per row to get the total number of cars in Section G: 15 rows * 10 cars/row = 150 cars.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many cars are in Section H.",
    "Section H has 20 rows, and each row holds 9 cars.",
    "I multiply the number of rows by the number of cars per row to get the total number of cars in Section H: 20 rows * 9 cars/row = 180 cars.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cars Nate walked past in both sections.",
    "I add the number of cars in Section G to the number of cars in Section H: 150 cars + 180 cars = 330 cars.",
    "Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute.",
    "To find out how many minutes Nate spent searching, I divide the total number of cars by the number of cars he can walk past in a minute: 330 cars \u00f7 11 cars/minute = 30 minutes."

  "solution": "30"
