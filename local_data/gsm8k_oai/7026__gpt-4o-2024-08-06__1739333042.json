  "query": "Alton owns a business. He is currently renting a space that costs $20 per week. If Alton earns $8 per day, how much is his total profit every week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Alton earns in a week.",
    "Since Alton earns $8 per day, I need to determine how many days are in a week to find his weekly earnings.",
    "A week has 7 days.",
    "So, Alton earns $8 per day multiplied by 7 days per week.",
    "8 dollars/day * 7 days/week = 56 dollars/week.",
    "Next, I need to consider Alton's weekly expense for renting space.",
    "The rent costs $20 per week.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the weekly rent cost from the weekly earnings.",
    "So, 56 dollars/week - 20 dollars/week = 36 dollars/week."

  "solution": "36"
