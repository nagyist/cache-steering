  "query": "Hayes does 3 loads of laundry a week using a detergent pod for each load.  His detergent pods come 39 to a pack.  How many packs of detergent pods will he need to do a full year of laundry?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of loads of laundry Hayes does in a year.",
    "He does 3 loads of laundry each week.",
    "There are 52 weeks in a year.",
    "To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, I multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year.",
    "3 * 52 equals 156.",
    "Hayes does 156 loads of laundry in a year.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many packs of detergent pods Hayes needs to buy.",
    "Each pack contains 39 detergent pods.",
    "Hayes needs 156 pods for the year.",
    "To calculate the number of packs needed, I divide the total number of pods by the number of pods per pack: 156 pods \u00f7 39 pods/pack.",
    "156 \u00f7 39 equals 4 when rounded up because he can't buy a fraction of a pack.",
    "Therefore, Hayes needs 4 packs of detergent pods to do a full year of laundry."

  "solution": "4"
