  "query": "Paige bought some new stickers and wanted to share them with 3 of her friends. She decided to share a sheet of 100 space stickers and a sheet of 50 cat stickers equally among her 3 friends. How many stickers will she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Paige starts with a sheet of 100 space stickers.",
    "She also has a sheet of 50 cat stickers.",
    "Paige wants to share these with 3 friends equally.",
    "First, let's determine how many space stickers each friend will get.",
    "She has 100 space stickers and 3 friends, so we divide 100 by 3.",
    "100 divided by 3 is 33 with a remainder of 1.",
    "Each friend will get 33 space stickers.",
    "Now, I calculate how many cat stickers each friend will get.",
    "She has 50 cat stickers and 3 friends, so we divide 50 by 3.",
    "50 divided by 3 is 16 with a remainder of 2.",
    "Each friend will get 16 cat stickers.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many stickers Paige will have left.",
    "For the space stickers, there was a remainder of 1, so Paige has 1 space sticker left.",
    "For the cat stickers, there was a remainder of 2, so Paige has 2 cat stickers left.",
    "Adding the leftover space and cat stickers, 1 + 2 equals 3."
