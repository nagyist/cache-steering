  "query": "A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that each watermelon weighs 23 pounds.",
    "The price per pound for a watermelon is $2.",
    "To find the total price for one watermelon, I need to multiply the weight of the watermelon by the price per pound.",
    "23 pounds \u00d7 $2 per pound = $46.",
    "So, Farmer Kent makes $46 for one watermelon.",
    "Farmer Kent has 18 watermelons.",
    "To find out how much money he makes from selling all the watermelons, I need to multiply the price for one watermelon by the number of watermelons.",
    "$46 per watermelon \u00d7 18 watermelons = $828.",
    "Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 from selling 18 watermelons."

  "solution": "828"
