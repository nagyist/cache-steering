  "query": "Mary and Ann are going sledding. Mary slides down a hill that's 630 feet long at a speed of 90 feet/minute. Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how long it takes Mary to slide down the hill.",
    "Mary's hill is 630 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 90 feet per minute.",
    "The time it takes for Mary to slide down is the distance divided by her speed.",
    "That is 630 feet divided by 90 feet/minute.",
    "630 divided by 90 equals 7.",
    "So Mary takes 7 minutes to slide down the hill.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how long it takes Ann to slide down the hill.",
    "Ann's hill is 800 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 40 feet per minute.",
    "The time it takes for Ann to slide down is the distance divided by her speed.",
    "That is 800 feet divided by 40 feet/minute.",
    "800 divided by 40 equals 20.",
    "So Ann takes 20 minutes to slide down the hill.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much longer Ann's trip takes compared to Mary's.",
    "I subtract the time it takes Mary from the time it takes Ann.",
    "That is 20 minutes minus 7 minutes.",
    "20 minus 7 equals 13."

  "solution": "13"
