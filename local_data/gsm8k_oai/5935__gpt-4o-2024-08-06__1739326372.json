  "query": "Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house.  On the way back she has to take a detour that is 20% longer.  She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house.  She drives at a speed of 44 mph.  How long did she spend away from home?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the distance Kim drove on her way to her friend's house. It was given as 30 miles.",
    "Next, I need to find out the distance Kim drove on her way back home, which includes a detour that is 20% longer.",
    "To find the length of the detour, I can calculate 20% of 30 miles.",
    "20% of 30 miles is 0.2 * 30 = 6 miles.",
    "The return trip distance, including the detour, is 30 miles + 6 miles = 36 miles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the time Kim spent driving to her friend's house using her speed of 44 mph.",
    "Time taken to drive to her friend's house is distance divided by speed, which is 30 miles / 44 mph.",
    "30 miles divided by 44 mph is 30/44 hours, simplifying this gives 15/22 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time Kim spent driving back home, again using her speed of 44 mph.",
    "Time taken to drive back is 36 miles divided by 44 mph.",
    "36 miles divided by 44 mph is 36/44 hours, which simplifies to 9/11 hours.",
    "I also have the information that Kim spent 30 minutes at her friend's house. I need to convert this to hours to be consistent.",
    "30 minutes is 0.5 hours.",
    "Now I will add all these times together to find the total time Kim spent away from home.",
    "Adding these times: 15/22 hours (going) + 9/11 hours (returning) + 0.5 hours (at friend's house).",
    "Converting all times to a common denominator, 15/22 is already simplified, 9/11 is equivalent to 18/22 when converted, and 0.5 hours is 11/22 when converted.",
    "Adding them gives: (15/22) + (18/22) + (11/22) = 44/22.",
    "44/22 simplifies to 2 hours."
