  "query": "Jane picked 64 apples at the orchard. She sorted them into 4 different baskets to send to her friends. When Jane wasn't looking her sister took 3 apples from each of the baskets. How many apples are in each basket now?",
  "steps": [
    "Jane picked 64 apples initially.",
    "She sorted them evenly into 4 baskets.",
    "To find out how many apples are in each basket initially, divide the total number of apples by the number of baskets: 64 \u00f7 4 = 16.",
    "Each basket initially has 16 apples.",
    "Jane's sister took 3 apples from each basket.",
    "To find out how many apples are left in each basket, subtract 3 from the initial amount in each basket: 16 - 3 = 13.",
    "Now, each basket has 13 apples remaining."

  "solution": "13"
