  "query": "Aleesia lost 1.5 pounds each week for 10 weeks. Alexei lost 2.5 pounds each week for 8 weeks. How many pounds did the two friends combine to lose?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much weight Aleesia lost in total.",
    "Aleesia lost 1.5 pounds every week.",
    "She lost 1.5 pounds for 10 weeks.",
    "To find total weight lost by Aleesia, I multiply 1.5 pounds by 10 weeks.",
    "1.5 pounds/week * 10 weeks = 15 pounds.",
    "Next, I calculate how much weight Alexei lost in total.",
    "Alexei lost 2.5 pounds every week.",
    "He lost 2.5 pounds for 8 weeks.",
    "To find total weight lost by Alexei, I multiply 2.5 pounds by 8 weeks.",
    "2.5 pounds/week * 8 weeks = 20 pounds.",
    "Now, I add Aleesia's total weight loss to Alexei's total weight loss.",
    "15 pounds + 20 pounds = 35 pounds."
