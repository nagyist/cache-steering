  "query": "The ratio of cows to bulls in a barn is 10:27. If there are 555 cattle on the farm, how many bulls are on the farm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify what the ratio 10:27 represents. It represents cows:bulls.",
    "The total ratio parts can be calculated by adding the ratio parts for cows and bulls together: 10 (cows) + 27 (bulls) = 37 parts.",
    "If there are 555 cattle on the farm, these 555 cattle correspond to the 37 parts of the ratio.",
    "Next, we need to determine how many cattle one part of the ratio represents. This is calculated using the total number of cattle divided by the total number of parts: \\( \\frac{555}{37} \\).",
    "Dividing, \\( 555 \\div 37 = 15 \\). Thus, each part of the ratio represents 15 cattle.",
    "Now, to determine the number of bulls, we need to multiply the number of parts associated with bulls (27) by the number of cattle per part (15).",
    "Calculate the number of bulls: \\( 27 \\times 15 = 405 \\)."
