  "query": "Brenda is a vet who needs to spay some cats and twice as many dogs. If she needs to spay 21 animals total today, how many cats does she need to spay?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many cats and dogs Brenda is going to spay.",
    "Let's assume Brenda is going to spay 'C' cats.",
    "She will spay twice as many dogs as cats, which is '2C' dogs.",
    "The total number of animals to be spayed is given as 21.",
    "Therefore, the equation would be: C + 2C = 21.",
    "This simplifies to 3C = 21.",
    "Now I need to solve for C by dividing both sides by 3.",
    "Doing the division gives C = 7.",
    "This means Brenda needs to spay 7 cats."

  "solution": "7"
