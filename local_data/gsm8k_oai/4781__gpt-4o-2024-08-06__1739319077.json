  "query": "Joseph drives his car at 50 mph for 2.5 hours. Kyle drives his car at 62 mph for 2 hours. How many more miles does Joseph drive than Kyle?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the distance Joseph drives. The formula to find distance is speed multiplied by time.",
    "Joseph's speed is 50 mph and he drives for 2.5 hours.",
    "Calculating Joseph's distance: 50 mph * 2.5 hours = 125 miles.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the distance Kyle drives using the same formula.",
    "Kyle's speed is 62 mph and he drives for 2 hours.",
    "Calculating Kyle's distance: 62 mph * 2 hours = 124 miles.",
    "Now, I find the difference between the distances Joseph and Kyle drive.",
    "Joseph drives 125 miles and Kyle drives 124 miles.",
    "Calculating the difference: 125 miles - 124 miles = 1 mile."
