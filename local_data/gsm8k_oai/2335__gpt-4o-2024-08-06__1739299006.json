  "query": "A loaf of bread was sliced into 15. Ten friends bought 4 loaves of bread. If they all eat all 4 loaves equally, how many slices of bread did each of them eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices from one loaf of bread.",
    "I know that each loaf of bread is sliced into 15 slices.",
    "There are 4 loaves of bread in total.",
    "To find the total number of slices from all the loaves, I multiply the number of slices per loaf by the number of loaves.",
    "15 slices/loaf * 4 loaves = 60 slices in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many friends are sharing these slices.",
    "There are 10 friends who are sharing the loaves.",
    "Each friend gets an equal number of slices.",
    "To find how many slices each friend gets, I divide the total number of slices by the number of friends.",
    "60 slices / 10 friends = 6 slices per friend."
