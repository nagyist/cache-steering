  "query": "Beth went shopping. She bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn that she bought. If she bought 35 cans of peas, how many cans of corn did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's put together an equation to describe the relationship between the cans of peas and the cans of corn Beth bought.",
    "Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cans of corn Beth bought.",
    "We know from the problem statement that she bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn.",
    "Thus, the equation is: \\( \\text{cans of peas} = 2c + 15 \\).",
    "We are given that she bought 35 cans of peas.",
    "Substitute 35 for the number of cans of peas in the equation: \\( 35 = 2c + 15 \\).",
    "Now, solve for \\( c \\).",
    "First, subtract 15 from both sides: \\( 35 - 15 = 2c \\).",
    "This simplifies to: \\( 20 = 2c \\).",
    "Next, divide both sides by 2: \\( c = 10 \\).",
    "The solution is \\( c = 10 \\), meaning she bought 10 cans of corn."
