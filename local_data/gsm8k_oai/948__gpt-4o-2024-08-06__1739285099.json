  "query": "Jason goes to the library 4 times more often than William goes. If William goes 2 times per week to the library, how many times does Jason go to the library in 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many times William goes to the library in one week.",
    "William goes to the library 2 times per week.",
    "Next, compute how many times William goes to the library in 4 weeks.",
    "Multiply the weekly visits by the number of weeks: 2 times/week \u00d7 4 weeks = 8 times.",
    "Now, remember that Jason goes 4 times more often than William does.",
    "To find out how often Jason goes to the library in one week, multiply William's weekly visits by 4.",
    "2 times/week \u00d7 4 = 8 times/week.",
    "Now, calculate how many times Jason goes to the library in 4 weeks.",
    "Multiply Jason's weekly visits by the number of weeks: 8 times/week \u00d7 4 weeks = 32 times."
