  "query": "Two athletes decided to compete to see who had the best jumping ability. They were each going to do the long jump, triple jump, and high jump to see who had the highest average jump. The first athlete jumped 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump. The second athlete jumped 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. What was the average jump of the winner?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the average jump for the first athlete.",
    "The first athlete's jumps are: 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump.",
    "To find the average, I will add these jump distances together.",
    "26 + 30 + 7 = 63 feet",
    "Now, I will divide the total by the number of jumps, which is 3.",
    "63 / 3 = 21 feet",
    "The average jump for the first athlete is 21 feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the average jump for the second athlete.",
    "The second athlete's jumps are: 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump.",
    "I will add these jump distances together.",
    "24 + 34 + 8 = 66 feet",
    "Now, I will divide the total by the number of jumps, which is 3.",
    "66 / 3 = 22 feet",
    "The average jump for the second athlete is 22 feet.",
    "To determine the winner, I need to compare the average jumps.",
    "The first athlete has an average jump of 21 feet, and the second athlete has an average jump of 22 feet.",
    "The second athlete has the higher average jump."
