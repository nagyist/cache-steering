  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of games played.",
    "Archibald has won 12 games, and his brother has won 18 games.",
    "The total number of games played is the sum of the games won by Archibald and his brother.",
    "12 games + 18 games = 30 games.",
    "Archibald won 12 of these 30 games.",
    "To find the percentage of games Archibald has won, I will use the formula: (number of games won by Archibald / total number of games) * 100%.",
