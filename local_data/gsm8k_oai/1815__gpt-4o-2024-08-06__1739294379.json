  "query": "Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each.",
    "The initial number of trees is 2 rows * 4 trees/row = 8 trees.",
    "Jim starts planting a new row of trees every year at the age of 10.",
    "From ages 10 to 14, Jim plants one new row of 4 trees per year.",
    "I need to calculate the number of rows added from age 10 to 14. That is 14 - 10 + 1 = 5 additional rows.",
    "Each new row contains 4 trees.",
    "The total number of trees added from these new rows is 5 rows * 4 trees/row = 20 trees.",
    "Adding the initial trees, Jim has 8 + 20 = 28 trees before his 15th birthday.",
    "On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has.",
    "Doubling 28 trees, Jim has 28 * 2 = 56 trees."
