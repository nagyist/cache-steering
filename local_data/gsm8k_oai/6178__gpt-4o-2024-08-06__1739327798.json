  "query": "Ibrahim wants to buy an MP3 player for 120 euros and a CD for 19 euros. He has 55 euros in savings. His father participates in his purchase by giving him 20 euros. How much money does Ibrahim lack?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the MP3 player and the CD together.",
    "The MP3 player costs 120 euros and the CD costs 19 euros.",
    "Adding these together: 120 euros + 19 euros = 139 euros.",
    "Now, I have to figure out how much money Ibrahim currently has.",
    "Ibrahim has 55 euros in savings.",
    "His father adds an additional 20 euros to his savings.",
    "Adding these together: 55 euros + 20 euros = 75 euros.",
    "To find out how much money he lacks, subtract the money he has from the total cost.",
    "The total cost is 139 euros and he has 75 euros.",
    "Subtracting these gives: 139 euros - 75 euros = 64 euros."
