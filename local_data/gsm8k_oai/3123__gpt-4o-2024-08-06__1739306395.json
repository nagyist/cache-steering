  "query": "Madeline wants to drink 100 ounces of water in a day. Her water bottle can hold 12 ounces of water. She refills her water bottle 7 times. How much more water does she need to drink?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of water Madeline drinks with the refills.",
    "Her water bottle holds 12 ounces, and she refills it 7 times.",
    "That means she drinks 12 ounces per refill.",
    "To find the total amount of water from the refills, I multiply the number of refills by the ounces per refill.",
    "7 refills \u00d7 12 ounces per refill = 84 ounces.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much more water she needs to drink to reach her goal.",
    "Madeline wants to drink 100 ounces in total.",
    "She has already drunk 84 ounces.",
    "To find out how much more she needs, I subtract the amount she has already drunk (84 ounces) from her goal (100 ounces).",
    "100 ounces - 84 ounces = 16 ounces."
