  "query": "Sean played cricket for 50 minutes each day for 14 days. Indira also played cricket. Together they played cricket for 1512 minutes. How many minutes did Indira play cricket?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total minutes Sean played cricket over the 14 days.",
    "Sean played for 50 minutes each day for 14 days.",
    "To find the total minutes Sean played, I multiply 50 minutes by 14 days.",
    "50 minutes/day * 14 days = 700 minutes",
    "Sean played cricket for a total of 700 minutes.",
    "Now, I know that Sean and Indira together played for 1512 minutes.",
    "To find out how many minutes Indira played, I need to subtract the minutes Sean played from the total minutes they played together.",
    "1512 minutes - 700 minutes = 812 minutes",
    "Indira played cricket for a total of 812 minutes."
