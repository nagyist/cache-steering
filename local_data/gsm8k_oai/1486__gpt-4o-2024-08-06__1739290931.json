  "query": "Tammy just got her hair cut. For every 14 haircuts, she gets a free additional haircut. She has gotten 5 free haircuts already. She is 5 haircuts away from another free one. How many haircuts has she gotten there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many paid haircuts correspond to the free haircuts Tammy has received.",
    "Tammy gets one free haircut for every 14 paid haircuts. She has already received 5 free haircuts.",
    "To find the number of paid haircuts, I multiply the number of free haircuts by 14. This is because each free haircut represents 14 paid ones.",
    "5 free haircuts times 14 paid haircuts per free haircut equals 70 paid haircuts.",
    "Next, I need to account for the haircuts Tammy has gotten since her last free haircut. She is 5 haircuts away from another free haircut.",
    "Since she receives a free haircut after 14 paid ones and she is 5 haircuts away from getting another one, she must have had 9 paid haircuts since her last free haircut.",
    "Adding these 9 paid haircuts to the previous 70 total gives the number of haircuts she actually got.",
    "70 paid haircuts plus 9 paid haircuts since the last free one equals 79.",
    "Therefore, Tammy has gotten a total of 79 haircuts."

  "solution": "79"
