  "query": "Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cupcakes Dani has. I know that \"two and a half dozen\" means two dozen and a half dozen.",
    "A dozen is 12, so two dozen is 24.",
    "A half dozen is 6.",
    "Adding those together, two and a half dozen is 24 + 6 = 30 cupcakes.",
    "Now I need to figure out how many people are in the class on that day.",
    "There are 27 students in the class.",
    "However, 3 students are out sick, so 27 - 3 = 24 students are present.",
    "In addition to the students, there is 1 teacher and 1 teacher's aide. Therefore, I add 2 more people.",
    "So, 24 students + 1 teacher + 1 teacher's aide = 26 people present on that day.",
    "Dani gives one cupcake to everyone who is present, which means she's giving out 26 cupcakes.",
    "I started with 30 cupcakes and gave out 26.",
    "So, 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes are left."
