  "query": "Susan loves chairs. In her house there are red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs. There are 5 red chairs. There are 4 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs, and there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. How many chairs are there in Susan's house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that there are 5 red chairs.",
    "There are 4 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. So, I will multiply the number of red chairs by 4.",
    "5 red chairs x 4 = 20 yellow chairs.",
    "There are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. So, I need to subtract 2 from the number of yellow chairs to find the number of blue chairs.",
    "20 yellow chairs - 2 = 18 blue chairs.",
    "Now, I will add the number of red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs together to find the total number of chairs.",
    "5 red chairs + 20 yellow chairs + 18 blue chairs = 43 chairs."

  "solution": "43"
