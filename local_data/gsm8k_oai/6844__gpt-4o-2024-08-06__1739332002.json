  "query": "Julia's internet speed is 20 MBps (megabytes per second). How many songs she can download in half an hour if the size per song is 5MB?",
  "steps": [
    "To find out how many songs Julia can download in half an hour, I first need to calculate the total number of megabytes (MB) she can download in that time frame.",
    "Since her internet speed is 20 MBps, I need to determine how much she can download in one second.",
    "According to the problem, Julia downloads at a rate of 20 MB per second.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many MB she can download in 30 minutes (half an hour).",
    "First, I'll convert 30 minutes into seconds because her speed is given in seconds.",
    "30 minutes is equal to 30 x 60 seconds.",
    "30 x 60 equals 1800 seconds.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of MB she can download in 1800 seconds at a rate of 20 MB per second.",
    "This is done by multiplying 20 MB per second by 1800 seconds.",
    "20 x 1800 equals 36,000 MB.",
    "Each song is 5 MB in size.",
    "To find out how many 5 MB songs she can download, I divide the total MB she can download by the size of each song.",
    "So, I divide 36,000 MB by 5 MB per song.",
    "36,000 divided by 5 equals 7,200."

  "solution": "7200"
