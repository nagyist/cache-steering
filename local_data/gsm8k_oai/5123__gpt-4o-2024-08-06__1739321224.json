  "query": "Olivia bought two packs of basketball cards at $3 each, and 5 decks of baseball cards at $4 each.  If she had one $50 bill, how much change did she receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the basketball cards. Olivia bought two packs.",
    "Each pack of basketball cards costs $3.",
    "So, the total cost for the basketball cards is 2 packs * $3/pack = $6.",
    "Next, I calculate the total cost of the baseball cards. She bought 5 decks.",
    "Each deck of baseball cards costs $4.",
    "So, the total cost for the baseball cards is 5 decks * $4/deck = $20.",
    "Now, I will find the total amount Olivia spent by adding the costs of the basketball and baseball cards together.",
    "$6 (basketball cards) + $20 (baseball cards) = $26.",
    "Olivia paid with a $50 bill.",
    "To find the change she received, I need to subtract the total amount spent from $50.",
    "$50 - $26 = $24."

  "solution": "24"
