  "query": "A box has 2 dozen water bottles and half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles. How many bottles are in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many water bottles are in the box.",
    "A dozen means 12, so 2 dozen water bottles would be 2 x 12.",
    "2 x 12 equals 24, so there are 24 water bottles in the box.",
    "The problem states there are half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles.",
    "Half a dozen means 6.",
    "Therefore, there are 6 more apple bottles than water bottles.",
    "Since there are 24 water bottles, the number of apple bottles would be 24 + 6.",
    "24 + 6 equals 30, so there are 30 apple bottles in the box.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of bottles by adding the water bottles and apple bottles together.",
    "There are 24 water bottles and 30 apple bottles.",
    "24 + 30 equals 54."

  "solution": "54"
