  "query": "Since Jason started investing, he has earned the same amount he invested twice over in 5 months. If Jason's investment currently is worth $90, how much has he been earning per month from his investment assuming he has been earning an equal amount of returns each month?",
  "steps": [
    "Jason's initial investment grew to be worth three times the amount he invested over 5 months.",
    "Let's call the initial investment amount \"I\".",
    "After 5 months, the total investment value is $90 which is three times his initial investment.",
    "So, 3 * I = $90.",
    "To find I, divide both sides by 3: I = $90 / 3.",
    "I = $30. This is the amount Jason initially invested.",
    "Jason earned twice his initial investment in returns, which means he earned 2 * $30.",
    "2 * $30 = $60 is the total amount he earned in returns over 5 months.",
    "To find the monthly return, divide the total earnings by the number of months: $60 / 5 months.",
    "$60 / 5 = $12."

  "solution": "12"
