  "query": "Walter fell from the eighth platform of some scaffolding and fell past David after falling 4 meters. If he fell for an additional three more times that depth before hitting the ground, and the platforms are evenly spaced out in height, what platform was David on?",
  "steps": [
    "First, Walter fell 4 meters past David.",
    "After falling those 4 meters, Walter fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground.",
    "Three times 4 meters is 12 meters, so Walter fell an additional 12 meters.",
    "If we add the initial 4 meters to the additional 12 meters, Walter fell a total of 16 meters from the eighth platform to the ground.",
    "Since the platforms are evenly spaced, the total fall of 16 meters includes the distance from the second platform to the ground.",
    "To find out from which platform David was passed, we determine how many platforms fit within the 16-meter fall.",
    "Assuming each platform is separated by 2 meters, since Walter falls from the 8th platform, passes one platform (4 meters past David), and the remaining distance down is a multiple of 3 (each distance reflecting another platform), it should fit the measurement of the remaining length.",
    "To verify assuming each platform is separated by 2 meters: when Walter falls 4 meters, he falls past 2 platforms, and has 3 additional 4-meter falls, which immerse 3 platforms for 12 meters (3 platforms further down).",
    "So, if Walter fell past David after 4 meters, it means David must have been standing on the sixth platform because there are two platforms between where he fell past David and where Walter started his fall."
