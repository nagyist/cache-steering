  "query": "The building has 42 storage units that are a total of 5040 square feet. Twenty of the units are 8 by 4 feet each. If the remaining units are all the same size, what is the area, in square feet, for one of the remaining units?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total area occupied by the 20 smaller units.",
    "Each of the 20 units is 8 feet by 4 feet.",
    "The area of one 8 by 4 unit is 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.",
    "To find the total area occupied by these 20 units, I multiply the number of units by the area of each unit: 20 * 32.",
    "20 * 32 = 640 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to subtract the area occupied by the smaller units from the total area to find the area occupied by the remaining units.",
    "The total area of all the storage units is 5040 square feet.",
    "So, the area occupied by the remaining units is 5040 - 640.",
    "5040 - 640 = 4400 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many remaining units there are.",
    "The total number of storage units is 42.",
    "There are 20 smaller units, so the number of remaining units is 42 - 20.",
    "42 - 20 = 22 remaining units.",
    "Each of these remaining units has the same size, with a total combined area of 4400 square feet.",
    "To find the area of one remaining unit, I divide the total area of the remaining units by the number of remaining units.",
    "4400 \u00f7 22 = 200 square feet."

  "solution": "200"
