  "query": "A wildlife team is monitoring the number of birds in a park. There are 3 blackbirds in each of the park\u2019s 7 trees. There are also 13 magpies roaming around the park. How many birds are in the park in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of blackbirds in the park.",
    "There are 3 blackbirds in each tree.",
    "There are 7 trees in the park.",
    "So, I multiply the number of blackbirds per tree by the number of trees: 3 blackbirds/tree * 7 trees = 21 blackbirds.",
    "Now, I need to add the number of magpies to the number of blackbirds to find the total number of birds.",
    "There are 13 magpies in the park.",
    "So, I add the 21 blackbirds to the 13 magpies: 21 blackbirds + 13 magpies = 34 birds."

  "solution": "34"
