    "Cloud 9 Diving Company has individual bookings worth $12,000.",
    "The company also has group bookings worth $16,000.",
    "To find the total amount of bookings, I need to add the individual and group bookings together.",
    "Adding $12,000 (individual bookings) and $16,000 (group bookings) gives $28,000.",
    "However, $1600 has had to be returned due to cancellations.",
    "To find the total amount of money taken after refunds, I need to subtract the amount returned from the total bookings.",
    "Subtracting $1600 from $28,000 gives $26,400."
