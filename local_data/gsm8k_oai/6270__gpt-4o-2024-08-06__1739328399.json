  "query": "There are 9 bicycles and 16 cars in the garage. How many wheels are there in the garage?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many wheels are on one bicycle.",
    "A standard bicycle has 2 wheels.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the total number of wheels from the bicycles.",
    "There are 9 bicycles, each with 2 wheels, so the total wheels from bicycles is 9 * 2.",
    "Calculating 9 * 2 gives me 18 wheels from the bicycles.",
    "Next, I determine how many wheels are on one car.",
    "A standard car has 4 wheels.",
    "Now, I need to figure out the total number of wheels from the cars.",
    "There are 16 cars, each with 4 wheels, so the total wheels from cars is 16 * 4.",
    "Calculating 16 * 4 gives me 64 wheels from the cars.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of wheels in the garage by adding the wheels from the bicycles and the wheels from the cars.",
    "The total number of wheels is 18 (from bicycles) + 64 (from cars).",
    "Calculating 18 + 64 gives me 82 wheels in total."

  "solution": "82"
