  "query": "Harry is joining a marathon that's why he practices and varies his workouts from day to day. He ran 10 meters per hour on Monday. From Tuesday to Thursday he ran 50% faster than on Monday. Then on Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday. How fast did Harry run on Friday?",
  "steps": [
    "On Monday, Harry's running speed was 10 meters per hour.",
    "From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday.",
    "To find the speed from Tuesday to Thursday, I need to calculate 50% of 10 meters per hour.",
    "50% of 10 meters per hour is 0.5 * 10 = 5 meters per hour.",
    "Adding this to the Monday speed, the speed from Tuesday to Thursday is 10 + 5 = 15 meters per hour.",
    "On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday.",
    "To find the speed increase on Friday, I need to calculate 60% of 15 meters per hour.",
    "60% of 15 meters per hour is 0.6 * 15 = 9 meters per hour.",
    "Adding this to the Thursday speed, Harry's running speed on Friday is 15 + 9 = 24 meters per hour."
