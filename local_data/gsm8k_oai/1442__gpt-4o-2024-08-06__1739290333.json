  "query": "Jame is trying to learn to tear playing cards.  He can tear 30 cards at a time.  A new deck of cards has 55 cards if you include the jokers and blank cards.  He tears cards 3 times a week.  If he buys 18 decks how many weeks can he go?",
  "steps": [
    "Each deck of cards has 55 cards including jokers and blank cards.",
    "Jame can tear 30 cards at a time.",
    "First, I need to determine how many cards Jame can tear in one session.",
    "Jame tears cards 3 times a week.",
    "Therefore, in one week, Jame can tear 30 cards per session * 3 sessions per week = 90 cards.",
    "Jame buys 18 decks, and each deck has 55 cards.",
    "The total number of cards Jame has is 18 decks * 55 cards/deck = 990 cards.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many weeks Jame can go with 990 cards, tearing 90 cards per week.",
    "The number of weeks Jame can tear cards is 990 cards / 90 cards per week = 11 weeks."
