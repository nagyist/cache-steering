  "query": "Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.",
  "steps": [
    "Giselle initially has 20 female doves.",
    "Each female dove laid 3 eggs.",
    "Calculate the total number of eggs laid: 20 doves * 3 eggs each = 60 eggs.",
    "3/4 of the eggs hatched into new doves.",
    "Calculate the number of eggs that hatched: (3/4) * 60 = 45 eggs hatched.",
    "Add the number of new doves to the initial number of female doves.",
    "Giselle initially had 20 doves, plus 45 new doves hatched from the eggs.",
    "Calculate the total number of doves: 20 + 45 = 65 doves."
