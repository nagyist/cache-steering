  "query": "Maisy has been offered a new job and now has the option of continuing to work at her current job or take the new job. Her current job is 8 hours a week with a wage of $10 per hour. The new job is offering 4 hours a week with a wage of $15 per hour with an additional bonus of $35 per week if she exceeds her quota. Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and decides to include this when calculating her wage at the new job. How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Maisy's weekly earnings at her current job.",
    "Her current job offers 8 hours a week at a rate of $10 per hour.",
    "To find her weekly earnings at her current job, I multiply the number of hours per week by the hourly wage: 8 hours * $10/hour.",
    "8 hours * $10/hour = $80. So, Maisy earns $80 per week at her current job.",
    "Next, I need to calculate Maisy's weekly earnings at her new job.",
    "The new job offers 4 hours a week at a rate of $15 per hour.",
    "To find her earnings before the bonus at the new job, I multiply the number of hours per week by the hourly wage: 4 hours * $15/hour.",
    "4 hours * $15/hour = $60. So, before the bonus, Maisy earns $60 per week at the new job.",
    "Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and receive the additional bonus of $35 per week.",
    "To find her total earnings at the new job, I add the bonus to her earnings before the bonus: $60 (earnings without bonus) + $35 (bonus).",
    "$60 + $35 = $95. So, Maisy will earn $95 per week at her new job.",
    "The final step is to find out how much more money she will earn at her new job compared to her current job.",
    "I subtract her current job's weekly earnings from her new job's weekly earnings: $95 (new job) - $80 (current job).",
    "$95 - $80 = $15. So, Maisy will earn $15 more per week at her new job."
