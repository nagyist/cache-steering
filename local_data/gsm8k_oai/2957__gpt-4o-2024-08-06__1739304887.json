    "First, I need to figure out how much sleep Tim gets in the 5 days when he sleeps 6 hours a day.",
    "He sleeps 6 hours/day for 5 days.",
    "6 hours/day * 5 days = 30 hours",
    "Now, I need to figure out how much sleep Tim gets in the 2 days when he sleeps 10 hours a day.",
    "He sleeps 10 hours/day for 2 days.",
    "10 hours/day * 2 days = 20 hours",
    "Now, I add the sleep hours from both periods together to get the total sleep for the week.",
    "30 hours (for 5 days) + 20 hours (for 2 days) = 50 hours"
