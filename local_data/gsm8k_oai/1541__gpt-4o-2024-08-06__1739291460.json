  "query": "Avery opens a flower shop. She ties 8 bunches of flowers with 9 flowers in each bunch. How many bunches would she have if she put 12 flowers in each bunch instead?",
  "steps": [
    "Avery initially makes 8 bunches with 9 flowers in each bunch.",
    "To find the total number of flowers, I multiply the number of bunches by the number of flowers in each bunch: 8 bunches * 9 flowers/bunch.",
    "8 * 9 = 72, so there are 72 flowers in total.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of bunches if she puts 12 flowers in each bunch instead.",
    "To find out how many bunches she can make with 12 flowers in each, I divide the total number of flowers by 12.",
    "72 \u00f7 12 = 6"

  "solution": "6"
