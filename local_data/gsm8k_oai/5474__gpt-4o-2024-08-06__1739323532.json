  "query": "Carla is dividing up insurance claims among 3 agents. Missy can handle 15 more claims than John, who can handle 30% more claims than Jan. If Jan can handle 20 claims, how many claims can Missy handle?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many claims John can handle.",
    "I know that John can handle 30% more claims than Jan.",
    "Jan can handle 20 claims.",
    "To find 30% of 20, I calculate 0.3 * 20 = 6.",
    "Therefore, John can handle 20 claims + 6 claims = 26 claims.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many claims Missy can handle.",
    "Missy can handle 15 more claims than John.",
    "John can handle 26 claims.",
    "Thus, Missy can handle 26 claims + 15 claims = 41 claims."
