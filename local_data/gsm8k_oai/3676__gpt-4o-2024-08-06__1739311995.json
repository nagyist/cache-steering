  "query": "Tabitha adds 1 serving of honey per cup of tea in the evening.  She usually has 2 cups of tea before bed.  She buys her honey in a 16-ounce container.  If there are 6 servings of honey per ounce, how many nights will she be able to enjoy honey in her tea before bed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how much honey is used in one evening. Tabitha has 2 cups of tea, and she adds 1 serving of honey per cup.",
    "This means she uses 2 servings of honey each evening (1 serving per cup \u00d7 2 cups).",
    "Next, we need to find out how many servings are in the entire container of honey. We know there are 6 servings per ounce, and the container is 16 ounces.",
    "Calculating the total number of servings in the container: 6 servings per ounce \u00d7 16 ounces = 96 servings.",
    "Now, we need to determine how many nights she can have honey using the 96 servings available.",
    "Since she uses 2 servings per night, we divide the total number of servings by the servings used per night: 96 servings \u00f7 2 servings per night = 48 nights."

  "solution": "48"
