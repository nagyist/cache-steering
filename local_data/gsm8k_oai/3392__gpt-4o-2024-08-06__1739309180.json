  "query": "At the museum, Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits. If she saw 80 paintings total, how many portraits did she see?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of portraits Bethany saw be P.",
    "According to the problem, Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits.",
    "This means the number of still lifes is 4 times the number of portraits, or 4P.",
    "The total number of paintings is the sum of portraits and still lifes, which is P + 4P.",
    "The equation representing the total number of paintings is P + 4P = 80.",
    "Simplify this equation to 5P = 80.",
    "To find P, divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, P = 80 / 5.",
    "80 divided by 5 is 16."

  "solution": "16"
