    "Tina buys 3 12-packs of soda.",
    "Each 12-pack contains 12 sodas.",
    "Calculate the total number of sodas: 3 packs \u00d7 12 sodas per pack = 36 sodas.",
    "Including Tina, there are 6 people at the party.",
    "Half of the people, which is 3 people (since 6/2 = 3), have 3 sodas each.",
    "Calculate the total number of sodas consumed by these 3 people: 3 people \u00d7 3 sodas each = 9 sodas.",
    "2 of the other people have 4 sodas each.",
    "Calculate the total number of sodas consumed by these 2 people: 2 people \u00d7 4 sodas each = 8 sodas.",
    "The remaining 1 person has 5 sodas.",
    "Add the sodas consumed: 9 sodas (3 people) + 8 sodas (2 people) + 5 sodas (1 person).",
    "The total number of sodas consumed is 9 + 8 + 5 = 22 sodas.",
    "Determine how many sodas are left: 36 sodas - 22 sodas consumed.",
