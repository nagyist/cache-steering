  "query": "Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. If Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, how many square feet is Benedict's house?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by establishing what we know from the question.",
    "Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet.",
    "Kennedy's house is also described as being 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house.",
    "We can set up an equation to describe this relationship.",
    "Let B represent the square footage of Benedict's house.",
    "According to the problem, 4 times the size of Benedict's house plus 600 square feet equals the size of Kennedy's house.",
    "So the equation is: 4B + 600 = 10000.",
    "To find B, I need to solve this equation.",
    "First, let's subtract 600 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with B on one side.",
    "10000 - 600 is 9400.",
    "Now the equation is: 4B = 9400.",
    "Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for B.",
    "9400 divided by 4 is 2350.",
    "Thus, Benedict's house is 2350 square feet."

  "solution": "2350"
