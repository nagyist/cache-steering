    "I need to calculate the total number of bottles ordered by the store owner.",
    "First, I will calculate the number of bottles ordered in April.",
    "The store owner ordered 20 cases in April, with each case containing 20 bottles.",

    "Next, I will calculate the number of bottles ordered in May.",
    "The store owner ordered 30 cases in May, with each case containing 20 bottles.",
    "To find out how many bottles that is, I need to multiply 30 cases by 20 bottles per case.",
    "30 cases * 20 bottles per case = 600 bottles were ordered in May.",
    "Now, I will add the number of bottles ordered in April and May to find the total.",
