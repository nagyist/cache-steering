  "query": "A clothing store sells 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans. A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that there are 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans being sold.",
    "A shirt costs $10 each, according to the problem.",
    "The cost of a pair of jeans is twice the cost of a shirt. Therefore, a pair of jeans costs $10 * 2 = $20.",
    "Now, I calculate the total earnings from the shirts. With 20 shirts at $10 each, the total is 20 * $10.",
    "20 * $10 = $200. So, selling the shirts will earn the store $200.",
    "Next, I calculate the total earnings from the jeans. With 10 pairs of jeans at $20 each, the total is 10 * $20.",
    "10 * $20 = $200. So, selling the jeans will earn the store $200.",
    "Finally, I add the earnings from the shirts and the jeans together to find the total earnings.",
    "Total earnings = $200 (shirts) + $200 (jeans) = $400."

  "solution": "400"
