  "query": "Pauly is making omelets for his family. There are three dozen eggs, and he plans to use them all. Each omelet requires 4 eggs. Including himself, there are 3 people. How many omelets does each person get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eggs Pauly has in total. He has three dozen eggs.",
    "A dozen equals 12 eggs. So, three dozen eggs would be 3 multiplied by 12.",
    "3 times 12 equals 36. Therefore, Pauly has 36 eggs in total.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many omelets Pauly can make with these eggs. Each omelet requires 4 eggs.",
    "I will divide the total number of eggs, 36, by the number of eggs required per omelet, which is 4.",
    "36 divided by 4 equals 9. So, Pauly can make 9 omelets.",
    "There are 3 people in total, including Pauly, sharing the omelets.",
    "To find out how many omelets each person gets, I will divide the total number of omelets, 9, by the number of people, which is 3.",
    "9 divided by 3 equals 3."
