  "query": "Carl wants to buy a new coat that is quite expensive. He saved $25 each week for 6 weeks.  On the seventh week, he had to use a third of his saving to pay some bills. On the eighth week, his dad gave him some extra money for him to buy his dream coat. If the coat cost $170, how much money did his dad give him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much money Carl saved in the first 6 weeks.",
    "Carl saved $25 each week for 6 weeks.",
    "So in 6 weeks, he saved: 25 * 6 = $150.",
    "On the seventh week, he had to use a third of his savings to pay bills.",
    "A third of Carl's savings ($150) is: 150 / 3 = $50.",
    "After paying the bills, Carl has: 150 - 50 = $100 left.",
    "I need to find out how much more money Carl needs to buy the coat that costs $170.",
    "Carl needs an additional: 170 - 100 = $70.",
    "On the eighth week, his dad gave him some extra money for the coat.",
    "Carl needs $70 more to be able to buy the coat."

  "solution": "70"
