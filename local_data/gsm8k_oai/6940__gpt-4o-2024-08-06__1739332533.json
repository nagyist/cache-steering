  "query": "One-fourth of the airing time of a television program is spent on commercials. If there are 6 thirty-minute programs, how many minutes are spent on commercials for the whole duration of the 6 programs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total airing time for one 30-minute program.",
    "Each program is 30 minutes long.",
    "There are 6 programs, so I multiply the duration of one program by 6 to get the total airing time for all programs combined.",
    "30 minutes per program * 6 programs = 180 minutes total airing time.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much of this total time is spent on commercials.",
    "One-fourth of the airing time is spent on commercials.",
    "To find one-fourth of the 180 minutes, I divide 180 by 4.",
    "180 minutes \u00f7 4 = 45 minutes are spent on commercials."

  "solution": "45"
