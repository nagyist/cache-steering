  "query": "55% of Toby's friends are boys and the rest are girls. If he has 33 friends who are boys, how many friends does he have who are girls?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that 55% of Toby's friends are boys.",
    "It's given that 33 of his friends are boys.",
    "I need to find the total number of friends Toby has.",
    "Since 55% of the total number of friends equals 33, I can set up the equation 0.55 * total_friends = 33.",
    "To find the total number of friends, I'll divide 33 by 0.55.",
    "33 divided by 0.55 equals 60.",
    "So, Toby has 60 friends in total.",
    "Now, I need to find the number of friends who are girls.",
    "If 60 is the total number of friends, and 33 are boys, I subtract 33 from 60 to find the number of girls.",
    "60 minus 33 equals 27.",
    "Therefore, Toby has 27 friends who are girls."

  "solution": "27"
