  "query": "Laura is planning her wedding. She expects 220 people to attend the wedding, but she has been told that approximately 5% typically don't show. How many people will go to her wedding?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. Laura expects 220 people to attend the wedding. However, there's an expectation that 5% of the invited guests typically don't show up.",
    "I need to calculate 5% of the total number of people invited, which is 220.",
    "To find 5% of 220, I calculate \\(220 \\times 0.05\\).",
    "Performing the calculation: \n\\(220 \\times 0.05 = 11\\).",
    "So, approximately 11 people are not expected to attend the wedding.",
    "To find the expected number of attendees, I subtract the number of people not expected to show (11) from the total number of invited guests (220).",
    "Performing the subtraction: \n\\(220 - 11 = 209\\).",
    "So, the expected number of people who will attend Laura's wedding is 209."

  "solution": "209"
