  "query": "At a station, a train comes every 5 minutes leaving 200 passengers and taking 320 others. How many different passengers step on and off a train at the station within an hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many trains arrive at the station within one hour.",
    "Since the train comes every 5 minutes, I can divide the total number of minutes in an hour by the frequency of train arrivals.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour. Dividing 60 by 5 gives me 12.",
    "Therefore, 12 trains arrive at the station in one hour.",
    "Each train leaves 200 passengers and takes 320 passengers.",
    "First, I calculate the total number of passengers leaving the train in an hour.",
    "The calculation is 200 passengers per train multiplied by 12 trains.",
    "200 \u00d7 12 = 2400 passengers leave the train in an hour.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of passengers boarding the train in an hour.",
    "The calculation is 320 passengers per train multiplied by 12 trains.",
    "320 \u00d7 12 = 3840 passengers board the train in an hour.",
    "The question asks for the total number of different passengers stepping on and off the train.",
    "I need to add the total number of passengers leaving and boarding to find this total.",
    "2400 passengers leaving plus 3840 passengers boarding equals 6240 different passengers."
