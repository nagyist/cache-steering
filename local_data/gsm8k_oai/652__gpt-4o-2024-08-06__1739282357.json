  "query": "Tanika is selling boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fund-raiser. On Saturday, she sold 60 boxes. On Sunday, she sold 50% more than on Saturday. How many boxes did she sell, in total, over the two days?",
  "steps": [
    "On Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes of crackers.",
    "On Sunday, she sold 50% more boxes than she did on Saturday.",
    "To find out how many boxes she sold on Sunday, I need to calculate 50% of the 60 boxes she sold on Saturday.",
    "50% of 60 is calculated by multiplying 60 by 0.50: 60 * 0.50 = 30 boxes.",
    "Therefore, on Sunday, she sold 60 boxes + 30 boxes = 90 boxes.",
    "To find the total number of boxes sold over the two days, I add the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday.",
    "So, the total number of boxes sold is 60 (Saturday) + 90 (Sunday) = 150 boxes."

  "solution": "150"
