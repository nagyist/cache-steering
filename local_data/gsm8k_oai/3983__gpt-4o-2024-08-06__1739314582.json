  "query": "Roberta wants to have a dinner party centered around souffl\u00e9s.  Each savory souffle calls for 8 eggs each and the dessert ones call for 6 eggs each.  She wants to make 3 savory souffl\u00e9s and 5 dessert souffl\u00e9s for the party.  How many eggs will she need?",
  "steps": [
    "Roberta wants to make 3 savory souffl\u00e9s.",
    "Each savory souffl\u00e9 requires 8 eggs.",
    "To find out how many eggs are needed for the savory souffl\u00e9s, I multiply the number of savory souffl\u00e9s by the number of eggs each requires: 3 savory souffl\u00e9s * 8 eggs/souffl\u00e9.",
    "3 * 8 equals 24. So, she needs 24 eggs for the savory souffl\u00e9s.",
    "Roberta also wants to make 5 dessert souffl\u00e9s.",
    "Each dessert souffl\u00e9 requires 6 eggs.",
    "To find out how many eggs are needed for the dessert souffl\u00e9s, I multiply the number of dessert souffl\u00e9s by the number of eggs each requires: 5 dessert souffl\u00e9s * 6 eggs/souffl\u00e9.",
    "5 * 6 equals 30. So, she needs 30 eggs for the dessert souffl\u00e9s.",
    "To find the total number of eggs needed, I need to add the eggs needed for savory souffl\u00e9s and dessert souffl\u00e9s together: 24 eggs + 30 eggs.",
    "24 + 30 equals 54."
