  "query": "Aaron and his brother Carson each saved up $40 to go to dinner. The bill is 3/4 of their total money. After, they go out for ice cream. Each scoop costs $1.5 and they get the same amount as each other. If they leave with $1 in change each, how many scoops did they each buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Aaron and Carson each saved $40. This means their total savings amount to $40 + $40.",
    "Calculating their total savings: $40 + $40 = $80.",
    "The dinner bill is 3/4 of their total money, which is 3/4 of $80.",
    "Calculating 3/4 of $80: (3/4) * $80 = $60.",
    "After paying the dinner bill of $60, they have $80 - $60 left.",
    "Calculating their remaining money: $80 - $60 = $20.",
    "They both have $1 in change at the end, meaning together they have $2 in change.",
    "Subtracting the $2 from the $20 left after dinner gives the total amount spent on ice cream: $20 - $2 = $18.",
    "Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.5, so I need to determine how many scoops they could buy with $18.",
    "Dividing the total spent on ice cream, $18, by the cost per scoop, $1.5, gives the total number of scoops they bought together.",
    "Calculating: $18 / $1.5 = 12 scoops total.",
    "Since Aaron and Carson bought the same number of scoops, each bought half of the total scoops.",
    "Dividing the total scoops by 2: 12 scoops / 2 = 6 scoops each."
