  "query": "Ben has $2000 for his business operations costs. He orders goods from his supplier and writes them a cheque for $600. His debtor pays him $800 from the purchases they had made on credit. Mr. Ben then decides to do equipment maintenance and spends $1200 on the whole operation. How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with?",
  "steps": [
    "Ben starts with $2000 for his business operations costs.",
    "He spends $600 on goods from his supplier, which means his remaining balance is $2000 - $600.",
    "Calculating the above, $2000 - $600 = $1400.",
    "His debtor pays him $800, which adds to his remaining balance. So, his new balance is $1400 + $800.",
    "Calculating the above, $1400 + $800 = $2200.",
    "Ben spends $1200 on equipment maintenance, which reduces his balance, so his new balance is $2200 - $1200.",
    "Calculating the above, $2200 - $1200 = $1000."
