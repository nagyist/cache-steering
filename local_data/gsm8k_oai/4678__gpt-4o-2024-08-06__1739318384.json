  "query": "A show debut and 200 people buy tickets.  For the second showing three times as many people show up.  If each ticket cost $25 how much did the show make?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that 200 people bought tickets for the first show.",
    "For the second show, three times as many people showed up.",
    "To find the number of people attending the second show, I need to multiply the number of people at the first show by three.",
    "So, for the second show: 200 people * 3 = 600 people.",
    "Now I know 200 people attended the first show and 600 people the second show.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of tickets sold for both shows.",
    "Total tickets sold = 200 (first show) + 600 (second show).",
    "Total tickets sold = 800.",
    "Each ticket costs $25.",
    "To find the total revenue, multiply the total number of tickets sold by the cost per ticket.",
    "Total revenue = 800 tickets * $25 per ticket.",
    "Total revenue = $20,000."

  "solution": "20000"
