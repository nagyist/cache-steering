  "query": "Mia can decorate 2 dozen Easter eggs per hour. Her little brother Billy can only decorate 10 eggs per hour. They need to decorate 170 eggs for the Easter egg hunt. If they work together, how long will it take them to decorate all the eggs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many eggs they can decorate together in one hour.",
    "Mia can decorate 2 dozen eggs per hour. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 24 eggs.",
    "Therefore, Mia can decorate 24 eggs per hour.",
    "Billy can decorate 10 eggs per hour.",
    "To find their combined rate, I need to add Mia's rate and Billy's rate.",
    "24 eggs per hour (Mia's rate) + 10 eggs per hour (Billy's rate) equals 34 eggs per hour.",
    "Together, they can decorate 34 eggs in one hour.",
    "Now, I need to determine how long it will take them to decorate 170 eggs.",
    "I can use the formula: time = total eggs / rate of work.",
    "The total number of eggs to decorate is 170.",
    "Their combined rate is 34 eggs per hour.",
    "So, time = 170 / 34.",
    "170 divided by 34 is 5.",
    "Thus, it will take them 5 hours to decorate all 170 eggs."
