  "query": "Lena has 16 candy bars. She needs 5 more candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin, and Kevin has 4 candy bars less than Nicole. How many more candy bars does Lena have than Nicole?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many candy bars Kevin has. The problem states that Lena needs 5 more candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin.",
    "Lena currently has 16 candy bars. If she needs 5 more to have 3 times as many as Kevin, she would then have \\(16 + 5 = 21\\) candy bars.",
    "If 21 is 3 times the number of candy bars Kevin has, then Kevin has \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\) candy bars.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many candy bars Nicole has. The problem states Kevin has 4 candy bars less than Nicole.",
    "If Kevin has 7 candy bars, then Nicole has \\(7 + 4 = 11\\) candy bars.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many more candy bars Lena has than Nicole.",
    "Lena has 16 candy bars, and Nicole has 11 candy bars.",
    "The difference between Lena's and Nicole's candy bars is \\(16 - 11 = 5\\)."
