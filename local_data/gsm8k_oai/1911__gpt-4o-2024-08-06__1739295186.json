    "Brooke currently has 12 balloons.",
    "Brooke adds 8 balloons to his current number.",
    "12 + 8 = 20 balloons for Brooke.",
    "Tracy currently has 6 balloons.",
    "Tracy adds 24 balloons to her current number.",
    "6 + 24 = 30 balloons for Tracy.",
    "Tracy pops half of her balloons, so I need to find half of 30.",
    "30 / 2 = 15 balloons popped by Tracy.",
    "Subtract the popped balloons from Tracy's total.",
    "30 - 15 = 15 balloons remaining for Tracy.",
    "Add Brooke's balloons to Tracy's remaining balloons for the total.",
    "20 (Brooke's) + 15 (Tracy's) = 35 balloons in total."
