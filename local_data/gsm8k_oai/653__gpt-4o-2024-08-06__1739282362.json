  "query": "Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies. He washed the family car and earned 6 dollars. What is his weekly allowance if he ended with 14 dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "Fred ended with 14 dollars after spending and earning money.",
    "He earned 6 dollars by washing the family car.",
    "If he didn\u2019t earn the 6 dollars, he would have had 14 - 6 = 8 dollars.",
    "Fred spent half of his allowance on the movies, so the 8 dollars he had left was half of his allowance.",
    "If 8 dollars is half of his allowance, then his full allowance is 8 * 2 = 16 dollars."
