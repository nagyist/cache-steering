  "query": "Vann is a veterinarian. Today he is going to be doing dental cleanings only. Dogs have 42 teeth, cats have 30 teeth and pigs have 28 teeth. If he is to do 5 dogs, 10 cats and 7 pigs, how many total teeth will Vann clean today?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total number of dog teeth Vann will clean.",
    "There are 5 dogs and each dog has 42 teeth.",
    "Multiply the number of dogs (5) by the number of teeth each dog has (42).",
    "5 dogs \u00d7 42 teeth/dog = 210 teeth from dogs.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of cat teeth Vann will clean.",
    "There are 10 cats and each cat has 30 teeth.",
    "Multiply the number of cats (10) by the number of teeth each cat has (30).",
    "10 cats \u00d7 30 teeth/cat = 300 teeth from cats.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of pig teeth Vann will clean.",
    "There are 7 pigs and each pig has 28 teeth.",
    "Multiply the number of pigs (7) by the number of teeth each pig has (28).",
    "7 pigs \u00d7 28 teeth/pig = 196 teeth from pigs.",
    "To find the total number of teeth Vann will clean, I need to add all of these numbers together.",
    "Add the teeth from dogs (210), cats (300), and pigs (196).",
    "210 + 300 + 196 = 706 total teeth."
