  "query": "Mel is three years younger than Katherine.  When Katherine is two dozen years old, how old will Mel be in years?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the current age of Katherine when she is described as two dozen years old.",
    "A dozen is 12, so two dozen is 24. Therefore, Katherine will be 24 years old.",
    "Next, I need to determine Mel's age when Katherine is 24 years old.",
    "The problem states that Mel is three years younger than Katherine.",
    "If Katherine is 24 years old, then Mel, being three years younger, will be 24 - 3 years old.",
    "I calculate that 24 - 3 = 21.",
    "Thus, when Katherine is 24 years old, Mel will be 21 years old."

  "solution": "21"
