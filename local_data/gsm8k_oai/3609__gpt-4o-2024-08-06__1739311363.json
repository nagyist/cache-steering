  "query": "A school bus has 4 columns and 10 rows of seats. If the school has 6 buses, how many students can the buses accommodate?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many seats are on one bus.",
    "Each bus has 4 columns of seats and 10 rows.",
    "To find the total number of seats on one bus, I multiply the number of columns by the number of rows: 4 columns * 10 rows.",
    "Calculating 4 * 10 gives me 40 seats per bus.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of seats for all the buses combined.",
    "There are 6 buses.",
    "To find the total capacity, I multiply the number of seats per bus by the number of buses: 40 seats/bus * 6 buses.",
    "Calculating 40 * 6 gives me 240 seats for all the buses."

  "solution": "240"
