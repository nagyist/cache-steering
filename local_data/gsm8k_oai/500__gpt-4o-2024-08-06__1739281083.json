  "query": "Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?",
  "steps": [
    "Joe caught the ball 23 times.",
    "I need to find out how many times Derek caught the ball.",
    "Derek caught the ball four less than double the number of times Joe did.",
    "First, I calculate double the number of times Joe caught the ball: 2 * 23 = 46.",
    "Now subtract four from that value to find Derek's catches: 46 - 4 = 42.",
    "So, Derek caught the ball 42 times.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times Tammy caught the ball.",
    "Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the number of times Derek did.",
    "I start by calculating one-third of Derek's catches: 42 / 3 = 14.",
    "Then I add sixteen to that number to find Tammy's catches: 14 + 16 = 30.",
    "So, Tammy caught the ball 30 times."

  "solution": "30"
