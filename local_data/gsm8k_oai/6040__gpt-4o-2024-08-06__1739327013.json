  "query": "Jack and Rose want to start a dog-walking business after school. They made 1,236 flyers to hand out around their neighborhood. Jack handed 120 flyers while Rose handed 320 flyers. How many flyers are left to be handed out around?",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine the total number of flyers already handed out by Jack and Rose.",
    "Jack handed out 120 flyers.",
    "Rose handed out 320 flyers.",
    "To find the total number of flyers handed out, we add the flyers distributed by Jack and Rose.",
    "120 flyers (handed by Jack) + 320 flyers (handed by Rose) = 440 total flyers handed out.",
    "Now, we need to find out how many flyers are left.",
    "We start with the total number of flyers they made, which is 1,236.",
    "We subtract the total number of flyers handed out from the total number of flyers made.",
    "1,236 total flyers - 440 flyers handed out = 796 flyers remaining."

  "solution": "796"
