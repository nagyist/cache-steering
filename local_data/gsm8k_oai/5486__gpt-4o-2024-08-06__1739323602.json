  "query": "Half of all the people in Nantucket will attend a planned meeting for a bowl game. There are 300 people in Nantucket, and the number of males going to the meeting is twice the number of females. How many females are going to the meeting?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many people in total will attend the meeting.",
    "The problem states that half of the people in Nantucket will attend the meeting.",
    "There are 300 people in Nantucket.",
    "Half of 300 is 300 / 2 = 150.",
    "Therefore, 150 people will attend the meeting.",
    "Now, I need to use the information that the number of males is twice the number of females attending.",
    "Let the number of females be F.",
    "Then the number of males would be 2F.",
    "According to the problem, the total number of attendees, which includes both males and females, is 150.",
    "I can set up the equation: F + 2F = 150.",
    "Combine like terms to get 3F = 150.",
    "Solve for F by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "F = 150 / 3.",
    "Calculating this gives F = 50."
