  "query": "Gina is participating in a neighborhood clean-up filling bags with litter. She was able to collect two bags of litter herself. The rest of the neighborhood together collected 82 times as much as Gina did by herself. Each bag of litter weighs 4 pounds. How many pounds was all the litter they collected?",
  "steps": [
    "Gina collected 2 bags of litter by herself.",
    "The rest of the neighborhood collected 82 times as much as Gina.",
    "To find out how many bags the rest of the neighborhood collected, I need to multiply Gina's 2 bags by 82.",
    "82 times 2 bags equals 164 bags collected by the neighborhood.",
    "Now, I add Gina's 2 bags to the 164 bags collected by the neighborhood.",
    "2 bags by Gina + 164 bags by the neighborhood equals a total of 166 bags of litter.",
    "Each bag of litter weighs 4 pounds.",
    "To find the total weight, I multiply 166 bags by 4 pounds per bag.",
    "166 times 4 equals 664 pounds."

  "solution": "664"
