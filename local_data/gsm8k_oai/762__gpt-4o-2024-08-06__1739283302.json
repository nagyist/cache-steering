  "query": "Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens. Each box contained  5 pens. She gave 40% of the pens to her close friends and one-fourth of what's left to her classmates. How many pens were left for Lenny?",
  "steps": [
    "Lenny bought 20 boxes of pens. I want to find the total number of pens she bought.",
    "Each box contains 5 pens, so the total number of pens is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pens per box.",
    "20 boxes * 5 pens per box = 100 pens.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pens she gave to her close friends. She gave away 40% of the pens.",
    "40% of 100 pens is calculated as 0.40 * 100 = 40 pens.",
    "Now I need to find out how many pens were left after giving pens to her close friends.",
    "Subtract the number of pens given to close friends from the total number of pens: 100 - 40 = 60 pens.",
    "Next, Lenny gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates.",
    "One-fourth of 60 pens is calculated as (1/4) * 60 = 15 pens.",
    "I need to find out how many pens were left for Lenny after giving some to her classmates.",
    "Subtract the number of pens given to classmates from the remaining number of pens: 60 - 15 = 45 pens."
