  "query": "There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note the initial number of oysters and crabs. There are 50 oysters and 72 crabs on the first day.",
    "On the second day, Eric counts half the number of oysters compared to the first day, so he sees 50 / 2 = 25 oysters.",
    "On the second day, Eric counts 2/3 the number of crabs compared to the first day, so he sees 72 * (2/3) = 48 crabs.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of oysters counted over the two days. On the first day, he counted 50 oysters, and on the second day, 25 oysters. So, 50 + 25 = 75 oysters.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of crabs counted over the two days. On the first day, he counted 72 crabs, and on the second day, 48 crabs. So, 72 + 48 = 120 crabs.",
    "The overall total of oysters and crabs counted over the two days is 75 oysters + 120 crabs."
