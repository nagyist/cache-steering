  "query": "Aniyah has 6 times as many birthday candles as Ambika. If Ambika has four birthday candles, how many birthday candles will they have if they put the birthday candles together and shared them equally between themselves?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of birthday candles Ambika has. Ambika has 4 candles.",
    "Aniyah has 6 times as many candles as Ambika.",
    "To find out how many candles Aniyah has, I multiply Ambika's candles by 6.",
    "Calculation: 6 * 4 = 24. So, Aniyah has 24 candles.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of candles when they put their candles together.",
    "Add Ambika's candles (4) to Aniyah's candles (24).",
    "Calculation: 4 + 24 = 28. So, together they have 28 candles.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many candles each person would have if they shared them equally.",
    "There are 2 people (Aniyah and Ambika), so I need to divide the total number of candles by 2.",
    "Calculation: 28 \u00f7 2 = 14. So, each person will have 14 candles if shared equally."

  "solution": "14"
