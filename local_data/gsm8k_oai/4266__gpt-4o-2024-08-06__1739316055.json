  "query": "Matilda had 20 chocolate bars and shared them evenly amongst herself and her 4 sisters. When her father got home from work, he was upset that they did not put aside any chocolates for him. They felt bad, so they each gave up half of their chocolate bars for their father. Their father then gave 3 chocolate bars to their mother and ate 2. How many chocolate bars did Matilda's father have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Matilda had 20 chocolate bars to start with.",
    "She has 4 sisters, making a total of 5 people, including herself.",
    "Matilda shared the 20 chocolate bars equally among the 5 people.",
    "20 divided by 5 equals 4.",
    "Each person, including Matilda, received 4 chocolate bars.",
    "Matilda and her sisters decided to give half of their chocolate bars to their father.",
    "Half of 4 is 2.",
    "Each person gave 2 chocolate bars to their father.",
    "There are 5 people, and each gave 2 chocolate bars.",
    "5 people times 2 bars each equals 10 chocolate bars given to the father.",
    "Matilda's father received 10 chocolate bars from his daughters.",
    "He then gave 3 chocolate bars to their mother.",
    "He also ate 2 chocolate bars.",
    "3 bars given to mother and 2 bars eaten equals 5 bars used by their father.",
    "Subtracting the 5 bars used from the 10 bars he initially received gives 5 bars remaining."
