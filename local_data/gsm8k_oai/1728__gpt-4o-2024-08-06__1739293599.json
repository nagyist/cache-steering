  "query": "Jana is 5 inches taller than Kelly, and Kelly is 3 inches shorter than Jess. If Jess is 72 inches tall, how tall is Jana?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Jess is 72 inches tall.",
    "Next, I understand that Kelly is 3 inches shorter than Jess.",
    "So, I subtract 3 inches from Jess's height to find Kelly's height: 72 - 3 = 69 inches.",
    "Now, Jana is 5 inches taller than Kelly.",
    "I add 5 inches to Kelly's height to find Jana's height: 69 + 5 = 74 inches.",
    "Jana's height is 74 inches."

  "solution": "74"
