  "query": "Dabbie bought 3 turkeys for thanksgiving, the first turkey is 6 kilograms, the second turkey is 9 kilograms, and the weight of the third turkey is twice the weight of the second turkey. If the cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2, how much does Dabbie spent on all the turkeys?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the weight of the third turkey. The problem states that the weight of the third turkey is twice the weight of the second turkey.",
    "The second turkey weighs 9 kilograms. So, twice that weight would be 9 kg * 2 = 18 kg.",
    "Now, I need to find the total weight of all the turkeys. I have the first turkey which is 6 kilograms, the second turkey which is 9 kilograms, and the third turkey which is 18 kilograms.",
    "To find the total weight, I will add these weights together: 6 kg + 9 kg + 18 kg = 33 kg.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost. The cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2.",
    "To find the total cost, I will multiply the total weight of the turkeys by the cost per kilogram: 33 kg * $2/kg = $66.",
    "Thus, Dabbie spent a total of $66 on all the turkeys."
