  "query": "Meghan had money in the following denomination: 2 $100 bills, 5 $50 bills, and 10 $10 bills. How much money did he have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total amount of money from the $100 bills.",
    "Meghan has 2 $100 bills.",
    "To find the total from the $100 bills, I multiply 2 by 100.",
    "2 * 100 = 200",
    "So, Meghan has $200 from the $100 bills.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total amount of money from the $50 bills.",
    "Meghan has 5 $50 bills.",
    "To find the total from the $50 bills, I multiply 5 by 50.",
    "5 * 50 = 250",
    "So, Meghan has $250 from the $50 bills.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total amount of money from the $10 bills.",
    "Meghan has 10 $10 bills.",
    "To find the total from the $10 bills, I multiply 10 by 10.",
    "10 * 10 = 100",
    "So, Meghan has $100 from the $10 bills.",
    "Finally, I need to add up all the amounts to find out how much money Meghan had altogether.",
    "I'll add the amounts from each bill denomination: $200 from $100 bills, $250 from $50 bills, and $100 from $10 bills.",
    "200 + 250 + 100 = 550"
