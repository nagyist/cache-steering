  "query": "Jason's dog has a tail that's half the length of its body, and a head that's 1/6 the length of its body. If the dog is 30 inches long overall, how long is its tail?",
  "steps": [
    "Jason's dog is 30 inches long overall.",
    "The tail is half the length of the dog's body.",
    "We need to determine how long the dog's body is to find the tail length.",
    "The dog's body includes the length of the head and the tail.",
    "The head is 1/6 the length of the body.",
    "To find the length of the tail, we need to set up an equation where the total length (body + head + tail) equals 30 inches.",
    "Let's assign the length of the body as B.",
    "The length of the tail is half of B, which is B/2.",
    "The length of the head is 1/6 of B, which is B/6.",
    "The total length is the sum of the body, the head, and the tail: B + B/6 + B/2 = 30.",
    "To solve this equation, we start by finding a common denominator for the fractions B/6 and B/2, which is 6.",
    "Rewrite B/2 as 3B/6.",
    "The equation becomes: B + B/6 + 3B/6 = 30.",
    "Combine the fractions: B + 4B/6 = 30.",
    "Rewrite 4B/6 as 2B/3.",
    "The equation is now: B + 2B/3 = 30.",
    "Convert B to a fraction with a common denominator: 3B/3 + 2B/3 = 30.",
    "Combine: (3B + 2B)/3 = 30.",
    "This simplifies to 5B/3 = 30.",
    "Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction: 5B = 90.",
    "Divide both sides by 5 to solve for B: B = 18.",
    "Now we know the body length, B, is 18 inches.",
    "The length of the tail is half of the body length, so it is 18/2.",
    "Calculate 18/2 to find the tail length: 9 inches."
