  "query": "Carly is making burgers for a neighborhood BBQ. Each burger needs to be cooked for 4 minutes on each side. Carly can fit 5 burgers on the grill at once. If half her 30 guests want 2 burgers and the other half each want 1, how long will it take Carly to cook all the burgers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many total burgers Carly needs to cook.",
    "There are 30 guests in total.",
    "Half of the guests, which is 30 divided by 2, equals 15 guests, want 2 burgers each.",
    "The other half, also 15 guests, want 1 burger each.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of burgers for the guests who want 2 burgers each: 15 guests times 2 burgers equals 30 burgers.",
    "Then, calculate the total number of burgers for the guests who want 1 burger each: 15 guests times 1 burger equals 15 burgers.",
    "Adding these together gives the total number of burgers Carly needs to make: 30 burgers plus 15 burgers equals 45 burgers.",
    "Now, determine how many batches Carly needs to cook.",
    "Carly can fit 5 burgers on the grill at once.",
    "Divide the total number of burgers by the number she can cook at once: 45 burgers divided by 5 burgers per batch equals 9 batches.",
    "Next, determine the time it takes to cook each batch.",
    "Each burger needs to be cooked for 4 minutes on each side, so a total of 8 minutes per burger.",
    "Since each batch is cooked simultaneously, 1 batch takes 8 minutes.",
    "Finally, calculate the total cooking time.",
    "Multiply the number of batches by the time per batch: 9 batches times 8 minutes equals 72 minutes."

  "solution": "72"
