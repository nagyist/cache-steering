  "query": "Twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts. Doug, Betty's friend, is 40 years old. If the sum of their ages is 90, and Betty wants to buy 20 packs of the nuts, calculate the amount of money she'll pay for the packs of nuts.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define Betty's age as \\( B \\).",
    "We know Doug's age is 40 years. So, \\( D = 40 \\).",
    "The sum of Betty's and Doug's ages is given as 90.",
    "From this, we can write the equation: \\( B + D = 90 \\).",
    "Substitute Doug's age into the equation: \\( B + 40 = 90 \\).",
    "Subtract 40 from both sides to find Betty's age: \\( B = 90 - 40 \\).",
    "Calculating, we get \\( B = 50 \\).",
    "The cost of a pack of nuts is twice Betty's age.",
    "So, the cost of a pack of nuts is \\( 2 \\times B \\).",
    "Substituting Betty's age, we get \\( 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\).",
    "Betty wants to buy 20 packs of nuts.",
    "The total cost will be \\( 20 \\times \\text{(cost of one pack of nuts)} \\).",
    "Substituting the cost of one pack, the total cost is \\( 20 \\times 100 \\).",
    "Calculating, we get \\( 2000 \\)."
