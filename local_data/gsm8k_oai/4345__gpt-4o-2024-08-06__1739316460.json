  "query": "A family went out to see a movie. The regular ticket costs $9 and the ticket for children is $2 less. They gave the cashier two $20 bills and they received a $1 change. How many children are there if there are 2 adults in the family?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states the regular ticket price for adults is $9.",
    "The children's ticket costs $2 less than the regular ticket, so it costs $9 - $2 = $7.",
    "The family paid with two $20 bills, which totals $40.",
    "They received $1 in change, so they must have spent $40 - $1 = $39 on tickets.",
    "There are 2 adults, and each adult ticket costs $9.",
    "So, the total cost for adult tickets is 2 * $9 = $18.",
    "The total cost for the children's tickets must then be $39 - $18 = $21.",
    "Each child ticket costs $7. Therefore, the number of children is $21 / $7 = 3."

  "solution": "3"
