  "query": "Bob and Jim decide to skip rocks.  Bob can skip a rock 12 times.  Jim can skip a rock 15 times.  If they each skipped 10 rocks how many total skips did they get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many skips Bob gets in total.",
    "Bob skips a rock 12 times and he skips 10 rocks.",
    "To find the total skips for Bob, I need to multiply 12 by 10.",
    "12 times 10 is 120.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many skips Jim gets in total.",
    "Jim skips a rock 15 times and he skips 10 rocks.",
    "To find the total skips for Jim, I need to multiply 15 by 10.",
    "15 times 10 is 150.",
    "Now, I need to find the total skips for both Bob and Jim together.",
    "I add Bob's total skips (120) to Jim's total skips (150).",
    "120 plus 150 equals 270."

  "solution": "270"
