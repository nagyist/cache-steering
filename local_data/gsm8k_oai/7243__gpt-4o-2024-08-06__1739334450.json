  "query": "After a trip, Mrs. Nalani took the students to the restaurant and told them they could order either a burger or a hot dog. If the number of students who ordered burgers was 30, twice the number of students who called for a hot dog, calculate the number of students at the restaurant.",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many students ordered hot dogs.",
    "The number of students who ordered burgers is given as 30.",
    "I know that the number of students who ordered burgers is twice the number of students who ordered hot dogs.",
    "Let's represent the number of students who ordered hot dogs as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the information given, 30 (students who ordered burgers) = 2 * \\( x \\) (students who ordered hot dogs).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I'll solve the equation 30 = 2x.",
    "Dividing both sides by 2 gives \\( x = \\frac{30}{2} \\).",
    "So, \\( x = 15 \\).",
    "Therefore, 15 students ordered hot dogs.",
    "To find the total number of students at the restaurant, I need to add the number of students who ordered burgers to the number of students who ordered hot dogs.",
    "The number of students who ordered burgers is 30.",
    "The number of students who ordered hot dogs is 15.",
    "Therefore, the total number of students is 30 + 15.",
    "30 + 15 equals 45."

  "solution": "45"
