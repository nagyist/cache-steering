  "query": "Jerry bought 48 firecrackers for the 4th of July. A police officer discovered and confiscated 12 of them. 1/6 of the remaining ones were defective. If Jerry set off half the good firecrackers, how many firecrackers did he set off?",
  "steps": [
    "Jerry originally had 48 firecrackers.",
    "A police officer confiscated 12 firecrackers.",
    "To find the remaining number of firecrackers after the confiscation, I need to subtract 12 from 48.",
    "48 - 12 equals 36 firecrackers remaining.",
    "Next, 1/6 of the remaining firecrackers were defective.",
    "To find out how many were defective, I calculate 1/6 of 36.",
    "36 divided by 6 equals 6 defective firecrackers.",
    "To find out how many good firecrackers remain, I subtract the 6 defective ones from the 36 remaining firecrackers.",
    "36 - 6 equals 30 good firecrackers remaining.",
    "Half of these good firecrackers were set off by Jerry.",
    "To find out how many he set off, I need to calculate half of 30.",
    "30 divided by 2 equals 15 firecrackers set off."
