  "query": "Sherry is making banana bread for a bake sale. She wants to make 99 loaves. Her recipe makes enough batter for 3 loaves. The recipe calls for 1 banana. How many bananas does Sherry need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many batches of the recipe Sherry needs to make 99 loaves.",
    "Since each batch makes 3 loaves, I divide 99 by 3.",
    "99 divided by 3 is 33. So, Sherry needs to make 33 batches.",
    "The recipe calls for 1 banana per batch.",
    "Sherry needs 1 banana for each of the 33 batches.",
    "Therefore, Sherry needs 33 bananas in total."

  "solution": "33"
