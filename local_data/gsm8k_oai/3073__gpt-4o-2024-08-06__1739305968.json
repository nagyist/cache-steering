  "query": "Bailey bought 8 dog treats and an additional 2 chew toys. She also got 10 more rawhide bones. Sadly, she forgot her money and had to split the charges equally across 4 credit cards. How many items were included in each charge?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of items Bailey bought.",
    "Bailey bought 8 dog treats.",
    "Bailey also bought 2 chew toys.",
    "Additionally, she got 10 rawhide bones.",
    "To find the total number of items, I will add these quantities together: 8 dog treats + 2 chew toys + 10 rawhide bones.",
    "8 + 2 = 10.",
    "10 + 10 = 20.",
    "So, Bailey bought a total of 20 items.",
    "Now, to find how many items were included in each charge, I will divide the total number of items by the number of credit cards, which is 4.",
    "20 \u00f7 4 = 5."
  ],
  "solution": "5"
