  "query": "Jemma saw 7 grasshoppers on her African daisy plant.  Then, hopping on the grass under the plant, she found 2 dozen baby grasshoppers.  How many grasshoppers did  Jemma find altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many baby grasshoppers Jemma found.",
    "A dozen is equal to 12. Therefore, 2 dozen is 2 multiplied by 12.",
    "Calculating 2 multiplied by 12 gives me 24.",
    "Jemma found 24 baby grasshoppers.",
    "Now, I need to combine the number of grasshoppers Jemma found on the African daisy plant and the baby grasshoppers she found.",
    "Jemma saw 7 grasshoppers on the African daisy plant.",
    "Adding the 7 grasshoppers from the plant to the 24 baby grasshoppers gives 7 plus 24.",
    "Calculating 7 plus 24 equals 31."

  "solution": "31"
