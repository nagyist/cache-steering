  "query": "Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "Carl's goal is to sell 96 cupcakes in total over 2 days.",
    "Carl must also give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment.",
    "This means that Carl needs to sell enough cupcakes to cover both his goal and the payment to Bonnie.",
    "So, the total number of cupcakes Carl needs to sell is 96 (goal) + 24 (payment) = 120 cupcakes.",
    "Carl has 2 days to sell these 120 cupcakes.",
    "To find out how many cupcakes Carl needs to sell per day, divide the total by the number of days.",
    "120 cupcakes \u00f7 2 days = 60 cupcakes per day."

  "solution": "60"
