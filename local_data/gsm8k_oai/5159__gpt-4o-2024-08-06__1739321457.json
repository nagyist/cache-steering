  "query": "There are 20 hands in Peter\u2019s class, not including his. Assume every student in the class has 2 arms and 2 hands. How many students are in Peter\u2019s class including him?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students contribute to the 20 hands mentioned.",
    "Since each student has 2 hands, I need to divide the total number of hands by the number of hands each student has.",
    "20 hands divided by 2 hands per student equals 10 students.",
    "These 10 students represent the number of students other than Peter, since the problem states the 20 hands do not include Peter\u2019s.",
    "Now, I need to add Peter to the total number of students to find the total class size.",
    "10 students (from the 20 hands) plus 1 student (Peter) equals 11 students."
  ],
  "solution": "11"
