  "query": "To eat to when she gets full, Michaela needs 20 oranges. Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela to eat until she gets full. If they picked 90 oranges from the farm today, how many oranges would remain after they've both eaten until they were full?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many oranges Cassandra needs to eat to get full.",
    "Michaela needs 20 oranges to get full.",
    "Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela.",
    "Twice of 20 is 40.",
    "So, Cassandra needs 40 oranges to get full.",
    "Now I need to figure out how many oranges they eat in total.",
    "Michaela eats 20 oranges, and Cassandra eats 40 oranges.",
    "The total number of oranges they eat is 20 + 40.",
    "20 + 40 equals 60.",
    "They eat a total of 60 oranges.",
    "Now I need to find out how many oranges remain after they've both eaten.",
    "They picked 90 oranges from the farm.",
    "If they eat 60, the number of oranges remaining would be 90 - 60.",
    "90 - 60 equals 30."
