    "Penelope has a ratio of 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies.",
    "The total number of M&M candies Penelope has is 25.",
    "I need to determine how many groups of 5 M&M candies are in 25 M&M candies.",
    "Divide the total number of M&M candies (25) by the number of M&M candies per group (5).",
    "25 \u00f7 5 = 5",
    "There are 5 groups of 5 M&M candies in 25 M&M candies.",
    "Since the ratio is 5 M&M candies to 3 Starbursts, each group consists of 3 Starbursts candies.",
    "Multiply the number of groups (5) by the Starbursts per group (3) to find the total number of Starbursts candies.",
    "5 \u00d7 3 = 15"
