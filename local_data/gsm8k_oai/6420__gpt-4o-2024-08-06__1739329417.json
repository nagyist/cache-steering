  "query": "Rich likes to take long walks through town.  First he walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.  Then he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.  Then he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far until he reaches the next intersection.  Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, before turning around and walking the same path all the way back home.  How many feet did Rich walk?",
  "steps": [
    "Rich starts by walking 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.",
    "Then, he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.",
    "The total distance so far is 20 + 200 = 220 feet.",
    "Next, he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far. Double of 220 feet is 220 * 2 = 440 feet.",
    "The total distance he has walked now is 220 + 440 = 660 feet.",
    "Then, he walks half the total distance up to this point. Half of 660 feet is 660 / 2 = 330 feet.",
    "Now, the total distance he has walked is 660 + 330 = 990 feet.",
    "Rich then turns around and walks back the same path to his home. The distance back home is the same as the distance walked to the end: 990 feet.",
    "Therefore, the total distance Rich walked, including the return trip, is 990 feet (to the end) + 990 feet (back) = 1980 feet."

  "solution": "1980"
