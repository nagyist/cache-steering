  "query": "Jonas is a book collector.  He has so many books he is converting his third bedroom into a library.  This room has 400 square feet of space.  He plans to put several bookshelves in the room and each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space.  If he reserves 160 square feet of space to use for a desk and some walking space, how many shelves can he put in the room?",
  "steps": [
    "Jonas has a room that is 400 square feet in total.",
    "He reserves 160 square feet for a desk and walking space.",
    "To find the space available for bookshelves, I subtract the reserved space from the total space.",
    "400 square feet (total space) - 160 square feet (reserved space) = 240 square feet available for bookshelves.",
    "Each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space.",
    "I need to determine how many 80 square foot bookshelves can fit into the 240 square feet available.",
    "To find the number of bookshelves, I'll divide the space available for bookshelves by the space each bookshelf takes.",
    "240 square feet / 80 square feet per bookshelf = 3 bookshelves."
