  "query": "In two years, Ophelia will be four times as old as Lennon. If Lennon is currently eight years old, how old is Ophelia?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how old Lennon will be in two years.",
    "Lennon is currently eight years old.",
    "In two years, Lennon will be 8 + 2 = 10 years old.",
    "According to the problem, in two years, Ophelia will be four times as old as Lennon.",
    "So, in two years, Ophelia will be 4 times 10 = 40 years old.",
    "If we want to find out how old Ophelia is right now, we need to subtract two years from her age in two years.",
    "Ophelia's current age is 40 - 2 = 38 years old."
