  "steps": [
    "Nate starts with 70 matches.",
    "He drops 10 matches in a creek.",
    "70 matches - 10 matches = 60 matches remaining after dropping some in the creek.",
    "His dog eats twice as many matches as he dropped in the creek.",
    "Twice as many as 10 matches is 10 matches * 2 = 20 matches.",
    "He had 60 matches after the creek incident.",
    "He loses 20 more matches because his dog ate them.",
    "60 matches - 20 matches = 40 matches remaining."
