  "query": "Miggy's mom brought home 3 bags of birthday hats. Each bag has 15 hats. Miggy accidentally tore off 5 hats. During the party, only 25 hats were used. How many hats were unused?",
  "steps": [
    "Determine the total number of hats that Miggy's mom brought home.",
    "There are 3 bags of hats, and each bag has 15 hats.",
    "Multiply the number of bags by the number of hats per bag: 3 bags * 15 hats per bag.",
    "3 * 15 = 45 hats in total.",
    "Miggy tore off 5 hats, so we need to subtract these from the total number of hats.",
    "45 hats - 5 torn hats = 40 hats.",
    "During the party, 25 hats were used.",
    "Subtract the number of hats used from the remaining hats: 40 hats - 25 used hats.",
    "40 - 25 = 15 hats."
