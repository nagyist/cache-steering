  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the given information. John and Yasmin's dad has a total of six grandkids.",
    "John has twice the number of children as his sister Yasmin.",
    "Let Yasmin's number of children be \\( y \\).",
    "Then, John's number of children can be represented as \\( 2y \\).",
    "Together, John and Yasmin's children add up to six, Gabriel's total number of grandchildren.",
    "The equation representing the total number of grandkids is \\( y + 2y = 6 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 3y = 6 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( y \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "\\( y = 2 \\).",
    "So, Yasmin has 2 children."
