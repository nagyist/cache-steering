    "Josie received $50 as a gift.",
    "She plans to buy two cassette tapes.",
    "Each cassette tape costs $9.",
    "The total cost for the two cassette tapes is 2 times $9.",
    "Calculate 2 times $9 to find the cost of the cassette tapes.",
    "2 x $9 = $18.",
    "Next, she plans to buy a headphone set that costs $25.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total cost of the two cassette tapes and the headphone set.",
    "Add the cost of the cassette tapes ($18) and the cost of the headphones ($25).",
    "$18 + $25 = $43.",
    "Now, I will determine how much money Josie will have left after her purchases.",
    "She starts with $50.",
    "Subtract the total cost of her purchases ($43) from the amount she received ($50).",
    "$50 - $43 = $7."
