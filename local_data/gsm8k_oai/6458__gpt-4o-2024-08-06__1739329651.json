  "query": "Frank went to a shop to buy some food for his breakfast. He bought 10 buns for $0.1 each, two bottles of milk, for $2 each, and a carton of eggs, which was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk. How much did Frank pay for his breakfast shopping?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total cost of the buns. He bought 10 buns, each costing $0.1.",
    "The cost for the buns is 10 buns * $0.1/bun = $1.",
    "Next, calculate the cost of the milk. He bought two bottles of milk, each costing $2.",
    "The cost for the milk is 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4.",
    "Now, calculate the cost of the carton of eggs. The carton of eggs was three times more expensive than one bottle of milk.",
    "One bottle of milk costs $2, so the carton of eggs costs 3 * $2 = $6.",
    "Add up the costs of all the items: buns, milk, and eggs.",
    "The total cost is $1 (buns) + $4 (milk) + $6 (eggs) = $11."

  "solution": "11"
