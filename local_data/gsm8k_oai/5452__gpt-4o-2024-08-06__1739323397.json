  "query": "On a monthly basis, Esperanza pays $600 in rent, 3/5 as much money on food as she pays on rent and her mortgage bill costs three times the amount of money she spends on food. If she saves $2000 and also pays the equivalent of 2/5 of her savings in taxes, calculate her gross monthly salary.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Esperanza spends on food. She spends 3/5 as much on food as she pays on rent.",
    "Rent is $600. Therefore, spending on food is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 600 = 360 \\) dollars.",
    "Next, calculate her mortgage payment. Her mortgage costs three times the amount she spends on food.",
    "So, the mortgage cost is \\( 3 \\times 360 = 1080 \\) dollars.",
    "Now, add up all her expenses: rent, food, and mortgage.",
    "Total expenses are \\( 600 + 360 + 1080 = 2040 \\) dollars.",
    "She saves $2000 monthly. Therefore, savings are $2000.",
    "Next, calculate her taxes, which is 2/5 of her savings.",
    "Taxes are \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 2000 = 800 \\) dollars.",
    "Now, calculate her total monthly expenses by adding expenses, savings, and taxes.",
    "Total monthly expenses = \\( 2040 + 2000 + 800 = 4840 \\) dollars."

  "solution": "4840"
