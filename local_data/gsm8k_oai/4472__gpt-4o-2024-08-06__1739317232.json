  "query": "Crackers contain 15 calories each and cookies contain 50 calories each. If Jimmy eats 7 cookies, how many crackers does he need to eat to have consumed a total of 500 calories?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total calories consumed by eating 7 cookies.",
    "Multiply the number of cookies (7) by the calories per cookie (50).",
    "7 cookies * 50 calories/cookie = 350 calories.",
    "Now, subtract the calories from the cookies from the total desired calories (500 calories).",
    "500 calories - 350 calories = 150 calories.",
    "Next, determine how many crackers are needed to consume the remaining 150 calories.",
    "Since each cracker contains 15 calories, divide the remaining calories (150) by the calories per cracker (15).",
    "150 calories / 15 calories/cracker = 10 crackers."

  "solution": "10"
