  "query": "Howard is taking his kindergarten class to the museum on a school trip. He splits the class equally into 3 groups and then each of the groups goes through the museum one student at a time. If the class has 18 students in total and each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum, then how long, in minutes, does it take each group to go through the museum?",
  "steps": [
    "Howard has a total of 18 students in his class.",
    "He splits the class equally into 3 groups.",
    "18 students divided by 3 groups equals 6 students per group.",
    "Each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum.",
    "One group has 6 students, and each takes 4 minutes.",
    "To find the time it takes for one group to go through, multiply the number of students in the group by the time per student: 6 students * 4 minutes per student.",
    "6 * 4 equals 24 minutes."

  "solution": "24"
