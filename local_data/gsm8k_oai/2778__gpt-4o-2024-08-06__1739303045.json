  "steps": [
    "Lexi wants to run a total of three and one-fourth miles in distance.",
    "One lap around the track measures a quarter of a mile.",
    "To determine how many laps Lexi needs to run, I should divide the total distance she wants to run by the distance of one lap.",
    "First, I convert the total distance Lexi wants to run into an improper fraction to make division easier. Three and one-fourth miles is the same as \\(3 \\frac{1}{4}\\).",
    "To convert this mixed number into an improper fraction, I multiply the whole number 3 by 4 (the denominator) and add the numerator 1, resulting in \\( 3 \\times 4 + 1 = 13\\).",
    "So, \\(3 \\frac{1}{4}\\) miles is equivalent to \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\) miles.",
    "Now, I need to convert the lap distance into a fraction as well to perform the division. One lap is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) mile.",
    "Next, I divide the total distance Lexi wishes to run (\\(\\frac{13}{4}\\)) by the distance of one lap (\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)).",
    "Dividing fractions is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. I write the division as \\( \\frac{13}{4} \\div \\frac{1}{4} \\).",
    "The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{1}\\).",
    "Now multiply \\(\\frac{13}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{1}\\).",
    "Multiplying these fractions results in \\(\\frac{13 \\times 4}{4 \\times 1} = \\frac{52}{4}\\).",
    "Next, I simplify \\(\\frac{52}{4}\\). Dividing the numerator by the denominator gives us 52 divided by 4.",
    "52 divided by 4 is 13."
