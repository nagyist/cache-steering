  "query": "Darla has 6 books in her locker.  Katie has half as many books as Darla, and Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.  How many books do the three have total?",
  "steps": [
    "Darla has 6 books.",
    "Katie has half as many books as Darla.",
    "Calculate half of 6, which is 6 / 2 = 3.",
    "Katie has 3 books.",
    "Now add the number of books Darla and Katie have together: 6 (Darla) + 3 (Katie) = 9 books.",
    "Gary has 5 times the number of books Darla and Katie have combined.",
    "Calculate 5 times the combined number: 5 * 9 = 45 books for Gary.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of books the three have by adding all their books together: 6 (Darla) + 3 (Katie) + 45 (Gary).",
    "So, the total number of books is 6 + 3 + 45 = 54."
