  "query": "Adrianna has 10 pieces of gum to share with her friends. There wasn't enough gum for all her friends, so she went to the store to get 3 more pieces of gum. She gave out gum to 11 friends. How many pieces of gum does Adrianna have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Adrianna initially has 10 pieces of gum.",
    "She goes to the store and gets 3 more pieces of gum.",
    "Now, Adrianna has 10 + 3 = 13 pieces of gum.",
    "She gave out gum to 11 friends.",
    "Assuming she gave 1 piece of gum to each friend, she would have given out 11 pieces.",
    "Subtract the gum given out from the total she had: 13 - 11 = 2."
