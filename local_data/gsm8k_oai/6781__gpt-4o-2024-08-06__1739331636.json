  "query": "Papi Calot prepared his garden to plant potatoes. He planned to plant 7 rows of 18 plants each. But he still has a bit of room left, so he\u2019s thinking about adding 15 additional potato plants. How many plants does Papi Calot have to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of plants that Papi Calot initially planned to plant.",
    "He planned to plant 7 rows of 18 plants each.",
    "To find the total number of plants, I multiply the number of rows by the number of plants per row.",
    "7 rows * 18 plants per row = 126 plants.",
    "Now, I know that Papi Calot plans to add 15 additional potato plants.",
    "To find the total number of plants he needs to buy, I add the initial number of plants to the additional plants.",
    "126 + 15 = 141."
