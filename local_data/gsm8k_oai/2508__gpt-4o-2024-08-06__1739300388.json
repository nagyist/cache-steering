  "query": "A company has 1000 employees. There will be three rounds of layoffs. For each round of layoff, 10% of the remaining employees will be laid off. How many employees will be laid off in total?",
  "steps": [
    "The company starts with 1000 employees.",
    "In the first round of layoffs, 10% of 1000 employees are laid off.",
    "Calculate 10% of 1000, which is 0.10 * 1000 = 100 employees.",
    "After the first round, there are 1000 - 100 = 900 employees remaining.",
    "In the second round of layoffs, 10% of 900 employees are laid off.",
    "Calculate 10% of 900, which is 0.10 * 900 = 90 employees.",
    "After the second round, there are 900 - 90 = 810 employees remaining.",
    "In the third round of layoffs, 10% of 810 employees are laid off.",
    "Calculate 10% of 810, which is 0.10 * 810 = 81 employees.",
    "Add the employees laid off in each round: 100 + 90 + 81.",
    "100 + 90 = 190",
    "190 + 81 = 271"
