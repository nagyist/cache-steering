  "query": "Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday, and Alan told seven jokes. If they doubled the number of jokes they told this past Saturday next Saturday, how many jokes would they have told in total together so far?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many jokes Jessy will tell next Saturday.",
    "Jessy told eleven jokes this past Saturday.",
    "Jessy will double that amount next Saturday. So, I calculate \\(11 \\times 2\\).",
    "Jessy will tell 22 jokes next Saturday.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many jokes Alan will tell next Saturday.",
    "Alan told seven jokes this past Saturday.",
    "Alan will double that amount next Saturday. So, I calculate \\(7 \\times 2\\).",
    "Alan will tell 14 jokes next Saturday.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many jokes Jessy has told in total so far (including both Saturdays).",
    "Jessy told 11 jokes this past Saturday and will tell 22 jokes next Saturday.",
    "Add those amounts together: \\(11 + 22\\).",
    "Jessy will have told 33 jokes in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many jokes Alan has told in total so far (including both Saturdays).",
    "Alan told 7 jokes this past Saturday and will tell 14 jokes next Saturday.",
    "Add those amounts together: \\(7 + 14\\).",
    "Alan will have told 21 jokes in total.",
    "Finally, I need to find the total number of jokes they will have told together.",
    "Jessy will have told 33 jokes and Alan will have told 21 jokes.",
    "Add those amounts together: \\(33 + 21\\).",
    "The total number of jokes they will have told together is 54."
