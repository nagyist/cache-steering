  "query": "Carla's brush is 12 inches long. If Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush, how long is Carmen's brush in centimeters? (There are 2.5 centimeters per inch.)",
  "steps": [
    "Carla's brush is 12 inches long.",
    "Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush.",
    "To find out how much longer Carmen's brush is, calculate 50% of 12 inches.",
    "50% of 12 inches is 0.5 * 12 = 6 inches.",
    "To find the total length of Carmen's brush, add the additional length to Carla's brush length.",
    "Carmen's brush is 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches long.",
    "Now convert the length of Carmen's brush from inches to centimeters.",
    "There are 2.5 centimeters in an inch.",
    "Multiply 18 inches by 2.5 centimeters per inch to convert to centimeters.",
    "18 * 2.5 = 45 centimeters."
