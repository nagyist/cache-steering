  "query": "Hot dog buns come in packages of 8. For the school picnic, Mr. Gates bought 30 packages of hot dog buns. He has four classes with 30 students in each class. How many hot dog buns can each of Mr. Gates' students get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of hot dog buns Mr. Gates bought. Each package contains 8 buns, and he bought 30 packages.",
    "I multiply 30 packages by 8 buns per package to find the total number of buns.",
    "30 packages * 8 buns per package = 240 buns.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of students. Each class has 30 students, and there are four classes.",
    "I multiply 4 classes by 30 students per class to find the total number of students.",
    "4 classes * 30 students per class = 120 students.",
    "Now, I need to divide the total number of buns by the total number of students to find out how many buns each student can get.",
    "Divide 240 buns by 120 students.",
    "240 buns / 120 students = 2 buns per student."
