  "query": "A farm has 100 chickens.  20 percent are Black Copper Marans, and 80 percent of the Black Copper Marans are hens.  How many BCM hens are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many Black Copper Marans (BCM) there are on the farm.",
    "The farm has 100 chickens, and 20 percent of them are Black Copper Marans.",
    "To find 20 percent of 100, I multiply 100 by 0.20.",
    "100 multiplied by 0.20 equals 20.",
    "So, there are 20 Black Copper Marans.",
    "I now need to determine how many of these Black Copper Marans are hens.",
    "80 percent of the Black Copper Marans are hens.",
    "To find 80 percent of 20, I multiply 20 by 0.80.",
    "20 multiplied by 0.80 equals 16.",
    "Therefore, there are 16 BCM hens."
