    "Emily starts with 6 marbles.",
    "Megan gives Emily double the number she has. Double of 6 is 12.",
    "Now, Emily has the original 6 marbles plus the 12 she received from Megan. That adds up to 18 marbles.",
    "Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total, plus 1. Half of 18 is 9.",
    "Adding 1 to 9 gives us 10.",
    "Emily gives back 10 marbles to Megan.",
    "Emily originally had 18 marbles before giving any back. After giving back 10 marbles, she has 18 - 10 marbles left.",
    "18 minus 10 equals 8."
