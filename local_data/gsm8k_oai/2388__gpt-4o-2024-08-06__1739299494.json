  "query": "At Clark's Food Store, apples cost 40 dollars for a dozen, and pears cost 50 dollars for a dozen. If Hank bought 14 dozen of each kind of fruit, how many dollars did he spend?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Hank spent on apples.",
    "The cost of one dozen apples is 40 dollars.",
    "Hank bought 14 dozen apples.",
    "To find the total cost for apples, I multiply 40 dollars by 14.",
    "40 * 14 = 560",
    "Therefore, Hank spent 560 dollars on apples.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Hank spent on pears.",
    "The cost of one dozen pears is 50 dollars.",
    "Hank bought 14 dozen pears.",
    "To find the total cost for pears, I multiply 50 dollars by 14.",
    "50 * 14 = 700",
    "Therefore, Hank spent 700 dollars on pears.",
    "Finally, I add the amounts spent on apples and pears to find the total expenditure.",
    "560 + 700 = 1260"
  ],
  "solution": "1260"
