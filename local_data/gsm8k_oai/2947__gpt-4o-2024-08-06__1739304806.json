  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how far the white rabbit hops in 5 minutes.",
    "The white rabbit hops 15 meters in one minute.",
    "In 5 minutes, the white rabbit will hop 15 meters/minute * 5 minutes.",
    "15 meters/minute * 5 minutes equals 75 meters.",
    "Now, I need to find out how far the brown rabbit hops in 5 minutes.",
    "The brown rabbit hops 12 meters in one minute.",
    "In 5 minutes, the brown rabbit will hop 12 meters/minute * 5 minutes.",
    "12 meters/minute * 5 minutes equals 60 meters.",
    "Now I need to find the total distance both rabbits hop in 5 minutes.",
    "The white rabbit hops 75 meters and the brown rabbit hops 60 meters.",
    "I add these distances together: 75 meters + 60 meters.",
    "75 meters + 60 meters equals 135 meters."
