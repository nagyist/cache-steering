  "query": "Ed and Jacob already had 2 shells in their shell collection. Then they went to the beach to collect even more. Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did. How many shells do the pair have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate how many shells Ed found in total. Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells.",
    "To find the total number of shells Ed found, add the number of limpet shells, oyster shells, and conch shells together: 7 + 2 + 4.",
    "7 + 2 = 9.",
    "9 + 4 = 13. So, Ed found a total of 13 shells.",
    "According to the problem, Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did.",
    "Therefore, Jacob found 13 + 2 shells.",
    "13 + 2 = 15. So, Jacob found 15 shells.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of shells Ed and Jacob collected together by adding Ed's and Jacob's shells: 13 + 15.",
    "13 + 15 = 28. Ed and Jacob collected 28 shells together.",
    "Remember that Ed and Jacob already had 2 shells in their collection before going to the beach.",
    "Add these 2 shells to the total they collected at the beach: 28 + 2.",
    "28 + 2 = 30."
