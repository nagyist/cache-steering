  "query": "A spider has eight legs.  If a group of spiders has 10 more spiders than half as many legs as a single spider has, what is the total number of spider legs in this group of spiders?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many legs a single spider has, which is given as 8 legs.",
    "The problem states that the number of spiders in the group is 10 more than half as many legs as a single spider has.",
    "I know that half of 8 legs is 4.",
    "Now, I need to add 10 to this half. So, 4 + 10 = 14.",
    "Thus, there are 14 spiders in this group.",
    "To find the total number of legs in the group, I multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has.",
    "So, 14 spiders \u00d7 8 legs per spider = 112 legs."

  "solution": "112"
