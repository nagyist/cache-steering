Charlie's head is 9 inches more than half the circumference of Jack's head. Bill's head is 2/3 the circumference of Charlie's head. How many inches in circumference is Bill's head?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the circumference of Charlie's head.",
    "Charlie's head circumference is 9 inches more than half of Jack's head circumference.",
    "Jack's head circumference is 12 inches.",
    "Half of Jack's head circumference is 12 inches divided by 2, which equals 6 inches.",
    "Charlie's head circumference is 6 inches plus 9 inches.",
    "So, Charlie's head circumference is 15 inches.",
    "Next, I need to determine the circumference of Bill's head.",
    "Bill's head circumference is 2/3 the circumference of Charlie's head.",
    "Charlie's head circumference is 15 inches.",
    "2/3 of Charlie's head circumference is 15 inches multiplied by 2/3.",
    "15 times 2/3 equals 10 inches."
