  "query": "Kobe and Pau went to a restaurant. Kobe ordered five pieces of fried chicken, and Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe did. If they order another set of fried chicken, how many pieces of fried chicken will Pau have eaten in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Kobe ordered five pieces of fried chicken.",
    "Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe.",
    "Since Kobe ordered 5 pieces, Pau ordered 2 times 5.",
    "Calculating this gives Pau 2 * 5 = 10 pieces of fried chicken.",
    "They order another set of fried chicken.",
    "The problem doesn't specify how many pieces are in this additional set or if Pau eats any or all of them; let's assume it's like Pau's initial order, which is 10 pieces.",
    "Therefore, Pau's initial order of 10 pieces plus another set of 10 pieces equals 20 pieces in all."
