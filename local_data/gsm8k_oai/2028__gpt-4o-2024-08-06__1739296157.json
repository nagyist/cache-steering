  "query": "Eliza buys 200 ornamental rings to sell in their local shop, twice the number of the remaining stock. After selling 3/4 of the total stock, her mother buys 300 more ornamental rings, and after three days, sells 150. What's the total number of ornamental rings remaining in the store?",
  "steps": [
    "Eliza buys 200 ornamental rings initially.",
    "These 200 rings are said to be twice the number of the remaining stock.",
    "Let's represent the remaining stock before buying the additional rings as X.",
    "Therefore, 200 = 2 * X.",
    "Solving for X, we find X = 100.",
    "This means before buying 200 rings, Eliza had 100 rings remaining.",
    "After purchasing 200 rings, Eliza's total stock becomes 200 + 100 = 300 rings.",
    "Eliza then sells 3/4 of the total stock, which is 3/4 * 300 = 225 rings.",
    "After selling 225 rings, the remaining stock is 300 - 225 = 75 rings.",
    "Then, Eliza's mother buys 300 additional rings for the store.",
    "The new total stock becomes 75 + 300 = 375 rings.",
    "Over the next three days, Eliza's mother sells 150 rings.",
    "After selling these 150 rings, the remaining stock is 375 - 150 = 225 rings."
