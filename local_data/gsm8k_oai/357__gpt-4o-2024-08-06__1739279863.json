  "query": "Catriona has 8 goldfish in her aquarium. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. Also, she has twice as many guppies as angelfish. How many fish does Catriona have in her aquarium?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many goldfish Catriona has. She has 8 goldfish.",
    "Next, determine how many angelfish she has. She has 4 more angelfish than goldfish, which means she has 8 + 4 angelfish.",
    "Calculate the number of angelfish: 8 + 4 = 12 angelfish.",
    "Now, determine how many guppies she has. She has twice as many guppies as angelfish, so calculate 2 times the number of angelfish.",
    "Calculate the number of guppies: 2 * 12 = 24 guppies.",
    "To find the total number of fish, add the number of goldfish, angelfish, and guppies together: 8 goldfish + 12 angelfish + 24 guppies.",
    "Add the numbers: 8 + 12 + 24 = 44."
