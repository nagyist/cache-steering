  "query": "Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie. If Billie has 18 crayons, how many crayons does Lizzie have?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying how many crayons Billie has. Billie has 18 crayons.",
    "Bobbie has three times as many crayons as Billie. Multiply 18 by 3 to determine how many crayons Bobbie has.",
    "Calculate 18 multiplied by 3, which equals 54. So, Bobbie has 54 crayons.",
    "Lizzie has half as many crayons as Bobbie. Divide the number of Bobbie's crayons (54) by 2 to find out how many crayons Lizzie has.",
    "Calculate 54 divided by 2, which equals 27. So, Lizzie has 27 crayons."

  "solution": "27"
