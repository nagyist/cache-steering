  "query": "Gail has some bills in her wallet which amount to $100. She has four $5 bills and three $20 bills, and the rest are $10 bills. How many $10 bills are in her wallet?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Gail has a total of $100 in her wallet.",
    "She has four $5 bills. The value of these bills is 4 times $5.",
    "Calculating the total value of the $5 bills: 4 * $5 = $20.",
    "She also has three $20 bills. The value of these bills is 3 times $20.",
    "Calculating the total value of the $20 bills: 3 * $20 = $60.",
    "Now, I will add the total value of the $5 bills and the $20 bills together.",
    "$20 (from $5 bills) + $60 (from $20 bills) = $80.",
    "The total value of the $5 and $20 bills is $80. The total amount in the wallet is $100.",
    "Therefore, the remaining amount must be accounted for by the $10 bills: $100 - $80 = $20.",
    "Each $10 bill has a value of $10, so I need to calculate how many $10 bills are in $20.",
    "$20 divided by $10 equals 2."

  "solution": "2"
