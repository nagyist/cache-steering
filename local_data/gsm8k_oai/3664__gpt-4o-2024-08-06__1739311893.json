  "query": "Bob's school track is 400 meters. If Bob ran the first lap in 70 seconds, the second and third lap in 85 seconds each, what was his average speed in (m/s) for his entire run?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total distance Bob ran.",
    "Each lap is 400 meters. Bob ran three laps.",
    "Total distance = 400 meters/lap \u00d7 3 laps = 1200 meters.",
    "Next, I need to find out the total time he took to run these laps.",
    "The first lap took 70 seconds.",
    "The second lap took 85 seconds.",
    "The third lap also took 85 seconds.",
    "Total time = 70 seconds + 85 seconds + 85 seconds.",
    "Calculate the total time: 70 + 85 + 85 = 240 seconds.",
    "Now, I can calculate his average speed.",
    "Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.",
    "Average speed = 1200 meters / 240 seconds.",
    "Perform the division: 1200 / 240 = 5."

  "solution": "5"
