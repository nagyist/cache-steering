  "query": "In one day, Ella's dog eats 4 pounds of food for every one pound of food that Ella eats. How much food do Ella and her dog in 10 days if Ella eat 20 pounds of food each day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify how much food Ella eats in one day.",
    "According to the problem, Ella eats 20 pounds of food each day.",
    "Now, calculate how much food Ella eats in 10 days.",
    "Ella eats 20 pounds per day, so in 10 days she eats 20 pounds/day * 10 days = 200 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much food Ella's dog eats in a day.",
    "The problem states that the dog eats 4 pounds of food for every one pound that Ella eats.",
    "Since Ella eats 20 pounds a day, her dog eats 4 times that amount each day.",
    "Calculate the amount of food the dog eats in a day: 4 * 20 = 80 pounds.",
    "Now, calculate how much food the dog eats in 10 days.",
    "The dog eats 80 pounds per day, so in 10 days it eats 80 pounds/day * 10 days = 800 pounds.",
    "To find the total amount of food eaten by both Ella and her dog, I add the amounts they consume over 10 days.",
    "Add Ella\u2019s total consumption (200 pounds) to the dog's total consumption (800 pounds).",
    "200 pounds (Ella) + 800 pounds (Dog) = 1000 pounds."
