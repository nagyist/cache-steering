  "query": "Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris. Kris has one fourth the turtles Kristen has. How many turtles are there altogether if Kristen has 12?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many turtles Kris has.",
    "Kristen has 12 turtles. Kris has one fourth of Kristen's turtles.",
    "One fourth of 12 is 12 / 4.",
    "12 divided by 4 equals 3.",
    "So, Kris has 3 turtles.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many turtles Trey has.",
    "Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris.",
    "5 times 3 is 5 * 3.",
    "5 times 3 equals 15.",
    "So, Trey has 15 turtles.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of turtles by adding the turtles each person has.",
    "Kristen has 12 turtles, Kris has 3 turtles, and Trey has 15 turtles.",
    "The total number of turtles is 12 + 3 + 15.",
    "12 + 3 is 15. Then add 15.",
    "15 + 15 equals 30."

  "solution": "30"
