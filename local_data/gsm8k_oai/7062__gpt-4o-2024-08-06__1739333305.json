  "query": "Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between the number of fish each person caught.",
    "I know Jeffery caught 60 fish.",
    "Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught.",
    "If Jeffery caught 60 fish, and this is twice the number that Ryan caught, then Ryan caught 60 / 2 fish.",
    "Calculating that, 60 divided by 2 is 30.",
    "Therefore, Ryan caught 30 fish.",
    "Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught.",
    "If Ryan caught 30 fish, and this is three times what Jason caught, then Jason caught 30 / 3 fish.",
    "Calculating that, 30 divided by 3 is 10.",
    "Therefore, Jason caught 10 fish.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of fish caught by Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery.",
    "Jason caught 10 fish, Ryan caught 30 fish, and Jeffery caught 60 fish.",
    "Adding these together gives the total: 10 + 30 + 60.",
    "Calculating that, 10 + 30 is 40, and 40 + 60 is 100."

  "solution": "100"
