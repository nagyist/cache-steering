  "query": "Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. How many yards did the 3 athletes run in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total yards Malik rushed for in the 4 games.",
    "Malik rushed for 18 yards in each game.",
    "So, for 4 games, Malik rushed a total of 18 yards/game * 4 games = 72 yards.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total yards Josiah rushed for in the 4 games.",
    "Josiah ran for 22 yards in each game.",
    "So, for 4 games, Josiah ran a total of 22 yards/game * 4 games = 88 yards.",
    "Now, I need to find out the total yards Darnell ran for in the 4 games.",
    "Darnell had an average of 11 yards per game.",
    "So, for 4 games, Darnell ran a total of 11 yards/game * 4 games = 44 yards.",
    "Now, I have the yards for each athlete: Malik = 72 yards, Josiah = 88 yards, Darnell = 44 yards.",
    "I need to add these totals together to find the total yards run by all athletes.",
    "Total yards = 72 yards + 88 yards + 44 yards.",
    "Adding them gives 72 + 88 + 44 = 204 yards."

  "solution": "204"
