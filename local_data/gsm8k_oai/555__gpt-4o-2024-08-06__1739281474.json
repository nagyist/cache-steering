  "query": "Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has. If Brian has 22 pairs of shoes, how many pairs of shoes do they have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pairs of shoes Brian has. The question states Brian has 22 pairs of shoes.",
    "Now, I need to calculate Edward's number of shoes. Edward has 3 times the number of shoes Brian has.",
    "Since Brian has 22 pairs, Edward must have 3 times 22.",
    "3 times 22 is 66, so Edward has 66 pairs of shoes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jacob has. Jacob has half the number of shoes Edward has.",
    "Half of Edward's 66 pairs is calculated by dividing 66 by 2.",
    "66 divided by 2 is 33, so Jacob has 33 pairs of shoes.",
    "Now, I should sum up the pairs of shoes each person has to find the total. Jacob has 33 pairs, Edward has 66 pairs, and Brian has 22 pairs.",
    "Adding these together, 33 + 66 + 22 will give the total number of pairs of shoes.",
    "33 + 66 gives 99.",
    "99 + 22 gives 121."

  "solution": "121"
