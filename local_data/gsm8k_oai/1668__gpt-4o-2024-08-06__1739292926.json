  "query": "Jim has a pail with rocks in it. The average weight of a rock is 1.5 pounds. A local rock collector agrees to pay him $4 for every pound of rocks. If he makes $60 off the sale, how many rocks were in the bucket?",
  "steps": [
    "Jim is selling rocks, and he gets $4 for every pound of rocks.",
    "He makes $60 from the sale of these rocks.",
    "To find out the total weight of the rocks, I need to divide the total money he made by the price per pound.",
    "So, $60 \u00f7 $4 per pound will give me the total pounds of rocks Jim sold.",
    "Calculating this, $60 \u00f7 $4 = 15 pounds.",
    "The total weight of the rocks Jim sold is 15 pounds.",
    "I'm told that the average weight of a single rock is 1.5 pounds.",
    "To find the number of rocks, I need to divide the total weight of rocks by the average weight per rock.",
    "So, 15 pounds \u00f7 1.5 pounds/rock will give me the number of rocks.",
    "Calculating this, 15 \u00f7 1.5 = 10.",
    "Therefore, there were 10 rocks in the bucket."
