  "query": "At Rainbow Preschool, there are 80 students.  25% of them are half-day students and get picked up at noon, while the rest are full-day students. How many are full-day students?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the total number of students at Rainbow Preschool, which is given as 80.",
    "Next, determine the fraction of students who are half-day. The problem states that 25% of them are half-day students.",
    "To find the number of half-day students, calculate 25% of 80.",
    "25% as a fraction is 0.25. Multiply 0.25 by 80 to find the number of half-day students.",
    "0.25 times 80 equals 20. So, there are 20 half-day students.",
    "Now, subtract the number of half-day students from the total number of students to find the number of full-day students.",
    "80 total students minus 20 half-day students leaves 60 full-day students."

  "solution": "60"
