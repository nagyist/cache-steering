  "query": "Eighteen hours ago, Beth and I took 100 photographs of our project. Today, Beth and I will take 20% fewer photographs of the same project. If we were to take 300 photographs of the project, how many photographs would we take to reach the target?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I understand that 18 hours ago, Beth and I took 100 photographs.",
    "Today, we plan to take 20% fewer photographs than we took 18 hours ago.",
    "To find 20% of 100, I calculate 20/100 * 100.",
    "20/100 * 100 equals 20.",
    "So, 20% of 100 is 20.",
    "Since we plan to take 20% fewer photographs today, I subtract 20 from 100.",
    "100 - 20 equals 80.",
    "Therefore, today we plan to take 80 photographs.",
    "Next, the problem states that we want to reach 300 photographs.",
    "I calculate how many more photographs we need to reach the target of 300.",
    "Since we previously took 100 photographs and plan to take 80 today, I've determined that by today, we will have taken a total of 100 + 80 photographs.",
    "100 + 80 equals 180.",
    "The target is 300 photographs, so I subtract 180 from 300 to find how many more photographs we need to take.",
    "300 - 180 equals 120."

  "solution": "120"
