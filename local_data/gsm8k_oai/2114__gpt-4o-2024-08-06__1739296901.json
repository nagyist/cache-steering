  "query": "Miles and Daphne are comparing their reading collection and want to figure out who has more pages. They are about to count each page, but their parents suggest that they see whose collection is taller. Mile's collection is taller, but then Daphne notices that Miles reads board books, and so the pages are thicker. After some more measuring, they figure out that for Miles, 1 inch equals 5 pages, but for Daphne 1 inch equals 50 pages. If Miles's books are 240 inches tall and Daphne's collection is 25 inches tall, how many pages are in the longest collection?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many pages are in Miles's collection first.",
    "Miles's collection is 240 inches tall.",
    "Each inch in Miles's collection equates to 5 pages.",
    "To find the total number of pages in Miles's collection, I will multiply the height of the collection by the number of pages per inch.",
    "240 inches * 5 pages/inch = 1200 pages.",
    "So, Miles's collection has 1200 pages.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pages are in Daphne's collection.",
    "Daphne's collection is 25 inches tall.",
    "Each inch in Daphne's collection equates to 50 pages.",
    "To find the total number of pages in Daphne's collection, I will multiply the height of the collection by the number of pages per inch.",
    "25 inches * 50 pages/inch = 1250 pages.",
    "So, Daphne's collection has 1250 pages.",
    "Now, I will compare the total number of pages in both collections.",
    "Miles has 1200 pages, and Daphne has 1250 pages.",
    "Since 1250 pages is greater than 1200 pages, Daphne has the longest collection in terms of pages."

  "solution": "1250"
