  "query": "The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50. The right side of the triangle is 2 cm longer than the left side. Find the value of the triangle base if the left side has a value of 12 cm.",
  "steps": [
    "We are given that the sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50 cm.",
    "We know that the left side is 12 cm.",
    "The right side is 2 cm longer than the left side. So, we add 2 cm to the left side's length.",
    "The right side is 12 cm + 2 cm = 14 cm.",
    "Now, we can find the base of the triangle. We subtract the left side and right side from the total perimeter.",
    "The total perimeter minus the sum of the left and right sides is 50 cm - (12 cm + 14 cm).",
    "Perform the calculation: 50 cm - 26 cm = 24 cm.",
    "So, the base of the triangle is 24 cm."
