  "query": "Oliver has 4 friends that he is inviting to a party at the arcade. Game tokens cost 30 for $1. Each game costs 2 tokens. If he wants all his friends to get to play 60 games each, how much will it cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total number of games each friend will play. Since Oliver has 4 friends and each will play 60 games, calculate the total number of games: 60 games per friend multiplied by 4 friends.",
    "60 games per friend * 4 friends = 240 games total.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of tokens needed to play 240 games. Each game requires 2 tokens. Multiply the total games by tokens per game: 240 games times 2 tokens per game.",
    "240 games * 2 tokens per game = 480 tokens needed.",
    "Determine how much it costs to purchase the needed tokens. Tokens are sold at a rate of 30 tokens for $1. Divide the total tokens required (480) by the number of tokens per dollar (30).",
    "480 tokens \u00f7 30 tokens per dollar = 16 dollars."
