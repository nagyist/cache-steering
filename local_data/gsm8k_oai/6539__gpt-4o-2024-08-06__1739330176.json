  "query": "American carmakers produce 5 650 000 cars each year. Then they distribute it to 5 car suppliers. The first supplier receives 1 000 000 cars each. The second supplier receives 500 000 cars more while the third car supplier receives the same number as the first and second suppliers combined. The fourth and the fifth supplier receive an equal number of cars. How many cars do the fourth and fourth suppliers each receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to establish how many cars are given to the first supplier. According to the problem, the first supplier receives 1,000,000 cars.",
    "Next, I need to see how many cars the second supplier receives. The problem states that the second supplier receives 500,000 cars more than the first supplier. So I will add 500,000 to the 1,000,000 cars the first supplier receives.",
    "1,000,000 (first supplier) + 500,000 = 1,500,000 cars for the second supplier.",
    "Now, I need to figure out how many cars the third supplier receives. The problem states that the third supplier gets the same number as the first and second suppliers combined.",
    "To find this, I will sum the number of cars received by the first supplier and the second supplier.",
    "1,000,000 (first supplier) + 1,500,000 (second supplier) = 2,500,000 cars for the third supplier.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cars are left for the fourth and fifth suppliers combined. I start by adding up the cars given to the first, second, and third suppliers.",
    "1,000,000 (first) + 1,500,000 (second) + 2,500,000 (third) = 5,000,000 cars distributed so far.",
    "The total production is 5,650,000 cars. I need to subtract the cars already distributed to find out how many remain for the fourth and fifth suppliers.",
    "5,650,000 total cars - 5,000,000 cars already distributed = 650,000 cars remaining for both the fourth and fifth suppliers.",
    "The problem states that the fourth and fifth suppliers receive an equal number of cars. I need to divide the remaining cars equally between them.",
    "650,000 cars divided by 2 supplies each of the fourth and fifth suppliers.",
    "650,000 / 2 = 325,000 cars for each of the fourth and fifth suppliers."
