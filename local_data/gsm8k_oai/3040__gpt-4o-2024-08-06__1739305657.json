  "steps": [
    "Tim is 5 years old.",
    "Rommel is thrice as old as Tim.",
    "To find Rommel's age, I need to multiply Tim's age by 3.",
    "Rommel's age = 5 years * 3 = 15 years.",
    "Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel.",
    "To find Jenny's age, I need to add 2 years to Rommel's age.",
    "Jenny's age = 15 years + 2 years = 17 years.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many years younger Tim is than Jenny.",
    "I subtract Tim's age from Jenny's age to find the difference.",
    "Difference = Jenny's age - Tim's age = 17 years - 5 years.",
    "Calculation: 17 - 5 = 12."
