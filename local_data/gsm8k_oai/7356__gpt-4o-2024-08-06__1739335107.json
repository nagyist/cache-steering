  "query": "Denmark wants to order pizza.  For toppings, he has 3 cheese, 4 meat and 5 vegetable options, one of which is peppers. He can have only one selection from each topping category (one cheese, one meat and one vegetable). However, if he chooses to have pepperoni, he cannot have peppers. How many topping combinations does he have total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the total combinations without considering the restriction. There are 3 cheese options, 4 meat options, and 5 vegetable options.",
    "Calculate the total combinations by multiplying the number of options for each topping category: \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 5\\).",
    "The total unrestricted combinations are \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60\\).",
    "Now, consider the restriction: if the meat choice is pepperoni, then peppers cannot be chosen as a vegetable.",
    "First, calculate how many combinations involve choosing pepperoni. There is 1 way to choose pepperoni from meat options. With pepperoni, there are 3 cheese options and 5 vegetable options.",
    "The total combinations that include pepperoni are \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 15\\).",
    "Next, I need to determine how many of these 15 combinations involve choosing peppers.",
    "Since peppers are one of the 5 vegetable options, and there are 3 cheese options, the combinations with pepperoni and peppers are \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 3\\).",
    "Now, subtract the invalid combinations (combinations with both pepperoni and peppers) from the total combinations.",
    "There are 60 total combinations without restrictions, and 3 invalid combinations with both pepperoni and peppers.",
    "Therefore, the valid combinations are \\(60 - 3 = 57\\)."
