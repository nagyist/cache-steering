    "Let's start by determining Suri's current age.",
    "It is given that in 3 years, Suri's age will be 16.",
    "To find Suri's current age, we subtract 3 from 16.",
    "16 - 3 = 13",
    "So, Suri's current age is 13.",
    "Ral is twice as old as Suri.",
    "To find Ral's current age, we multiply Suri's age by 2.",
