  "query": "Every day in a week, Siena bookmarks 30 website pages from the research she does on her browser. If Siena has 400 bookmarked pages on her bookmarks library now, how many pages will she have in her bookmarks library at the end of March?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many days are left in March.",
    "March has 31 days in total.",
    "I assume today is March 1st since the specific start date is not provided.",
    "If today is March 1st, then there are 31 days left in March including today.",
    "Siena bookmarks 30 pages every day.",
    "I will calculate the total number of pages she will bookmark by the end of March.",
    "To find the total number of bookmarks by the end of March, I multiply the number of pages she bookmarks daily by the number of days in March.",
    "30 pages/day * 31 days = 930 pages.",
    "Currently, she has 400 pages bookmarked.",
    "I add the current bookmarks to the number of new bookmarks.",
    "400 current bookmarks + 930 new bookmarks = 1330 total bookmarks."

  "solution": "1330"
