  "query": "Mrs. Gable\u2019s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gable\u2019s students?",
  "steps": [
    "Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches, each with a pack of animal crackers.",
    "Each pack of animal crackers contains 10 crackers.",
    "In total, there are 20 packs of animal crackers for the 20 students.",
    "Since each pack has 10 crackers, the total number of crackers is 20 packs multiplied by 10 crackers per pack.",
    "20 packs * 10 crackers/pack = 200 crackers.",
    "However, 2 students did not eat their animal crackers.",
    "The 2 students who didn\u2019t eat their crackers mean 2 packs were not consumed.",
    "2 packs * 10 crackers/pack = 20 crackers were not eaten.",
    "To find out how many crackers were eaten, subtract the number of uneaten crackers from the total number of crackers.",
    "200 crackers (total) - 20 crackers (not eaten) = 180 crackers eaten."

  "solution": "180"
