  "query": "Forest and his friends have prepared a birthday cake for their friend Juelz having 240 cake pieces. After singing the birthday song, they ate 60% of the cake's pieces, and later, Juelz divided the remaining pieces among his three sisters. What is the number of pieces of cake each sister received?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many pieces of cake the friends ate after singing the birthday song.",
    "To find out how many pieces 60% of the cake is, I multiply 240 pieces by 60%.",
    "Calculating 60% of 240: 240 * 0.60 = 144 pieces.",
    "This means Forest and his friends ate 144 pieces of the cake.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pieces are left after they ate.",
    "Subtract the eaten pieces from the total pieces: 240 - 144 = 96 pieces.",
    "There are 96 pieces of cake remaining.",
    "Juelz divided these remaining 96 pieces among his three sisters.",
    "To find out how many pieces each sister received, I divide the remaining pieces by 3.",
    "Calculate 96 divided by 3: 96 / 3 = 32 pieces.",
    "Each sister received 32 pieces of cake."
