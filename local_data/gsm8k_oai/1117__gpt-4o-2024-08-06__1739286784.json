  "query": "The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys who is 30 years old now. How old will Lucas be three years from now?",
  "steps": [
    "Gladys is currently 30 years old.",
    "Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys.",
    "Being 3 times younger means Billy's age is Gladys's age divided by 3.",
    "So, Billy's current age is 30 divided by 3.",
    "Billy is 10 years old now.",
    "The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas.",
    "Let Lucas's current age be L.",
    "According to the problem, 30 = 2 * (10 + L).",
    "Simplify the equation: 30 = 20 + 2L.",
    "Subtract 20 from both sides: 10 = 2L.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for L: L = 5.",
    "Lucas is currently 5 years old.",
    "The problem asks for Lucas's age three years from now.",
    "Three years from now, Lucas will be 5 + 3.",
    "Lucas will be 8 years old in three years."
