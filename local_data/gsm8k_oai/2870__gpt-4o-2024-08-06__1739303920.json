  "query": "Hanna has $300. She wants to buy roses at $2 each and give some of the roses to her friends, Jenna and Imma. Jenna will receive  1/3 of the roses, and  Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses. How many roses does Hanna give to her friends?",
  "steps": [
    "Hanna has $300 and the price for each rose is $2.",
    "I need to determine how many roses Hanna can buy with her money.",
    "I divide the total amount of money Hanna has ($300) by the cost per rose ($2) to find out how many roses she can buy.",
    "$300 \u00f7 $2 = 150 roses.",
    "Hanna can buy 150 roses.",
    "Jenna receives 1/3 of the roses.",
    "I calculate 1/3 of 150.",
    "150 \u00d7 1/3 = 50 roses.",
    "Imma receives 1/2 of the roses.",
    "I calculate 1/2 of 150.",
    "150 \u00d7 1/2 = 75 roses.",
    "Now, I add the number of roses given to Jenna and Imma to determine how many roses Hanna gives to her friends in total.",
    "50 roses (Jenna) + 75 roses (Imma) = 125 roses."
