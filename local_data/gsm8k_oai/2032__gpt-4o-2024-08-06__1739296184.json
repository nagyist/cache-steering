    "Initially, there are 250 books in the library.",
    "On Tuesday, 120 books are taken out of the library by children.",
    "I subtract 120 from 250 to find out how many books remain inside the library after Tuesday: 250 - 120 = 130 books remain.",
    "On Wednesday, 35 books are returned to the library.",
    "I add the 35 returned books to the remaining 130 books: 130 + 35 = 165 books in the library after Wednesday.",
    "On Thursday, another 15 books are withdrawn from the library.",
    "I subtract the 15 withdrawn books from the 165 books currently in the library: 165 - 15 = 150 books."
