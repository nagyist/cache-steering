  "query": "Samson is going to another town which is 140 km away. He will use his car that uses ten liters of gasoline for a distance of 70 km. How many liters of gasoline will Samson need for a one-way trip?",
  "steps": [
    "The town is 140 km away, so Samson needs to calculate how much gasoline is needed for this distance.",
    "Samson's car uses 10 liters of gasoline for every 70 km.",
    "To find out how much gasoline is needed for 140 km, Samson can use a proportion.",
    "If 10 liters are needed for 70 km, then for 140 km, the amount of gasoline would be twice as much because 140 km is twice 70 km.",
    "Calculating twice 10 liters gives us 20 liters."

  "solution": "20"
