  "query": "A car traveled 360 miles in 4 hours and 30 minutes. What was its speed in miles per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time of travel in hours. The car traveled for 4 hours and 30 minutes.",
    "30 minutes is half an hour. So, 4 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 4.5 hours.",
    "Now, I have the distance traveled, which is 360 miles.",
    "I also have the time taken, which is 4.5 hours.",
    "To find the speed, I need to divide the total distance by the total time.",
    "So, I will divide 360 miles by 4.5 hours.",
    "360 divided by 4.5 equals 80.",
    "Therefore, the speed of the car is 80 miles per hour."

  "solution": "80"
