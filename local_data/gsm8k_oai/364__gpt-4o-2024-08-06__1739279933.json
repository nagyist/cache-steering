  "steps": [
    "Stu has 9 books.",
    "Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.",
    "To find out how many books Albert has, I need to multiply the number of books Stu has by 4.",
    "Albert has 9 books * 4 = 36 books.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of books that Stu and Albert have together.",
    "Total number of books is the sum of the books both Stu and Albert have.",
    "Total books = Stu's books + Albert's books = 9 + 36.",
    "Calculating the sum: 9 + 36 = 45."
