  "query": "Kim has 12 nail polishes. Heidi has 5 more nail polishes than Kim, and Karen has 4 fewer nail polishes than Kim. How many nail polishes does Karen and Heidi have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine how many nail polishes Heidi has.",
    "Heidi has 5 more nail polishes than Kim.",
    "Kim has 12 nail polishes.",
    "So, Heidi has 12 (Kim's nail polishes) + 5 = 17 nail polishes.",
    "Next, I'll determine how many nail polishes Karen has.",
    "Karen has 4 fewer nail polishes than Kim.",
    "Kim has 12 nail polishes.",
    "So, Karen has 12 (Kim's nail polishes) - 4 = 8 nail polishes.",
    "Now, I'll find the total number of nail polishes Karen and Heidi have together.",
    "Heidi has 17 nail polishes, and Karen has 8 nail polishes.",
    "Together, they have 17 + 8 = 25 nail polishes."
