  "query": "Ronald and his friend Max want to buy a new video game that was just released. The game costs $60. To earn money, they started selling ice cream in their yard, and they sell each ice cream for $5. How many ice creams will they need to sell for both to be able to afford to buy the game?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of money needed. Both Ronald and Max want to buy the game, which means they need to buy two copies.",
    "Each game costs $60, and since there are two games to be bought, I need to multiply: 2 games \u00d7 $60 per game.",
    "2 games \u00d7 $60 = $120",
    "So, they need a total of $120 to be able to afford both games.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many ice creams need to be sold to make $120.",
    "Each ice cream is sold for $5, so I need to divide the total amount needed by the price of each ice cream: $120 \u00f7 $5.",
    "$120 \u00f7 $5 = 24",
    "So, Ronald and Max need to sell 24 ice creams to afford the two games."

  "solution": "24"
