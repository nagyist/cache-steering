  "query": "To get admission into a school party, each football team member must pay $40. If there are 60 players on the football team and the entire team attends 8 such parties in a year, calculate the total amount of money collected in the 8 parties.",
  "steps": [
    "Each football team member must pay $40 for admission to one party.",
    "There are 60 players on the football team.",
    "To calculate the total amount collected for one party, we multiply the number of players by the fee per player: 60 players * $40 per player.",
    "60 * $40 = $2400.",
    "So, for one party, $2400 is collected from the entire team.",
    "The entire team attends 8 such parties in a year.",
    "To find the total amount collected in all 8 parties, we multiply the amount collected for one party by the number of parties: $2400 * 8.",
    "$2400 * 8 = $19200."
