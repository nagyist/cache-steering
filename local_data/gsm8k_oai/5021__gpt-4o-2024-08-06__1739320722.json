  "query": "Jesse received $50 as a gift to buy what she wants. She goes to the mall and falls in love with a novel that costs her $7. Then she went to lunch because she was very hungry and spent twice as much as the novel cost her. How much money did Jesse have left after going to the mall?",
  "steps": [
    "Jesse received $50 as a gift.",
    "She bought a novel for $7.",
    "I need to subtract the cost of the novel from the $50.",
    "$50 - $7 = $43",
    "She went to lunch and spent twice as much as the novel cost.",
    "I need to calculate twice the cost of the novel.",
    "2 x $7 = $14",
    "Now I subtract the amount spent on lunch from the remaining amount.",
    "$43 - $14 = $29"
