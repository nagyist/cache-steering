  "query": "Four runners ran a combined total of 195 miles last week. Katarina ran 51 miles. Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet all ran the same distance. How many miles did Harriet run?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know the total distance run by all four runners is 195 miles.",
    "Katarina ran 51 miles.",
    "I subtract Katarina's distance from the total to find out how many miles were run by Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet combined.",
    "195 miles - 51 miles = 144 miles.",
    "Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet all ran the same distance.",
    "There are 3 runners (Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet) who ran 144 miles in total.",
    "To find out how many miles each of them ran, I need to divide 144 miles by 3.",
    "144 miles \u00f7 3 = 48 miles.",
    "This means that Harriet ran 48 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "48"
