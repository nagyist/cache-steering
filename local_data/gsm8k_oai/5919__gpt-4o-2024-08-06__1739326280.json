  "query": "Every day Janet spends 8 minutes looking for her keys and another 3 minutes complaining after she finds them. If Janet stops losing her keys, how many minutes will she save every week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many minutes Janet spends each day looking for her keys and then complaining.",
    "She spends 8 minutes looking for her keys.",
    "She also spends 3 minutes complaining about losing them.",
    "In total each day, Janet spends 8 + 3 = 11 minutes related to losing her keys.",
    "Next, I calculate how many minutes she spends in a week.",
    "There are 7 days in a week.",
    "So, the total minutes spent per week is 11 minutes per day * 7 days = 77 minutes.",
    "If Janet stops losing her keys, she would save these 77 minutes every week."
