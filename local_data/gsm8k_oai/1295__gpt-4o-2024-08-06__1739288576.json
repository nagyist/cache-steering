  "query": "Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?",
  "steps": [
    "Lilia had 15 peaches initially.",
    "She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each.",
    "To find out how much she made from her friends, I need to multiply 10 peaches by $2.",
    "10 peaches * $2/peach = $20.",
    "She then sold 4 peaches to her relatives for $1.25 each.",
    "To find out how much she made from her relatives, I need to multiply 4 peaches by $1.25.",
    "4 peaches * $1.25/peach = $5.",
    "Now, I add the money she made from friends and relatives to find the total earnings.",
    "$20 + $5 = $25.",
    "Lilia left one peach for herself, and this does not affect her earnings.",
    "Thus, her total earnings after selling 14 peaches is $25."
