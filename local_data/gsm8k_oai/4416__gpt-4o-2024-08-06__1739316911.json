  "query": "The car-rental agency charges $30/day for a car, or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?",
  "steps": [
    "Jennie rented the car for 11 days.",
    "The car-rental agency offers a rate of $190 for the first week.",
    "The first week consists of 7 days.",
    "Jennie uses the weekly rate for the first 7 days, costing her $190.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost for the remaining days. Jennie rented the car for a total of 11 days, so after the first 7 days, she has 11 - 7 = 4 days remaining.",
    "The car-rental agency charges $30 per day for each additional day past the first week.",
    "For the remaining 4 days, the cost at $30 per day would be 4 * $30 = $120.",
    "To find the total cost of the rental, I add the cost of the first week to the cost of the additional days: $190 + $120 = $310."

  "solution": "310"
