  "query": "Sofia went to the department store to buy a pair of shoes and 2 shirts. A shirt costs $7 while a pair of shoes is $3 more than the shirt. If she decides to buy a bag which costs half the total price of the 2 shirts and a pair of shoes, how much will she pay for all those items?",
  "steps": [
    "The cost of one shirt is given as $7.",
    "Sofia buys 2 shirts. Therefore, the total cost for the shirts is 2 shirts \u00d7 $7/shirt = $14.",
    "A pair of shoes costs $3 more than a shirt.",
    "Therefore, the cost of the shoes is $7 (cost of a shirt) + $3 = $10.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total cost of the two shirts and the pair of shoes. This is $14 (cost of shirts) + $10 (cost of shoes) = $24.",
    "Sofia decides to buy a bag which costs half the total price of the 2 shirts and a pair of shoes.",
    "The cost of the bag is half of $24, which is $24 / 2 = $12.",
    "Now, we calculate the total price Sofia will pay for all the items: 2 shirts, 1 pair of shoes, and 1 bag.",
    "Total cost is $14 (shirts) + $10 (shoes) + $12 (bag) = $36."
