  "query": "Marjorie works as a baker. Every day, she makes twice as many cakes as she did the day before. On the sixth day, she makes 320 cakes. How many cakes did Marjorie make on the first day?",
  "steps": [
    "Marjorie makes twice as many cakes each day compared to the previous day.",
    "On the sixth day, she made 320 cakes.",
    "To find out how many cakes she made on the fifth day, I need to divide the number of cakes on the sixth day by 2.",
    "320 cakes on the sixth day divided by 2 equals 160 cakes on the fifth day.",
    "Now, to find out how many cakes she made on the fourth day, I divide the number of cakes on the fifth day by 2.",
    "160 cakes on the fifth day divided by 2 equals 80 cakes on the fourth day.",
    "Continuing the process, to find the number of cakes made on the third day, I divide the number on the fourth day by 2.",
    "80 cakes on the fourth day divided by 2 equals 40 cakes on the third day.",
    "To find out how many cakes Marjorie made on the second day, I divide the number of cakes on the third day by 2.",
    "40 cakes on the third day divided by 2 equals 20 cakes on the second day.",
    "Finally, to find out how many cakes Marjorie made on the first day, I divide the number of cakes on the second day by 2.",
    "20 cakes on the second day divided by 2 equals 10 cakes on the first day."
