  "query": "Paityn has 20 red hats and 24 blue hats. Her friend Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as she has and twice the number of blue hats. If they combine all the hats together and share them equally between themselves, calculate the number of hats each gets.",
  "steps": [
    "Paityn has 20 red hats.",
    "Paityn has 24 blue hats.",
    "Zola has 4/5 times as many red hats as Paityn.",
    "To find the number of red hats Zola has, multiply 20 (the number of red hats Paityn has) by 4/5.",
    "20 multiplied by 4/5 equals \\( 20 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 16 \\). So, Zola has 16 red hats.",
    "Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn.",
    "To find the number of blue hats Zola has, multiply 24 (the number of blue hats Paityn has) by 2.",
    "24 multiplied by 2 equals 48. So, Zola has 48 blue hats.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of red hats they both have by adding Paityn's 20 red hats and Zola's 16 red hats.",
    "20 red hats (Paityn) plus 16 red hats (Zola) equals 36 red hats.",
    "Calculate the total number of blue hats they both have by adding Paityn's 24 blue hats and Zola's 48 blue hats.",
    "24 blue hats (Paityn) plus 48 blue hats (Zola) equals 72 blue hats.",
    "Find the total number of hats by adding the total number of red hats and the total number of blue hats.",
    "36 red hats plus 72 blue hats equals 108 hats.",
    "To share the hats equally between Paityn and Zola, divide the total number of hats (108) by 2.",
    "108 divided by 2 equals 54."
