  "query": "During the most recent voyage of the Starship Conundrum, the spacecraft traveled from Planet X to Planet Y in eight hours less than twice the number of hours in a typical earth day.  If the distance between these two planets is 4,000 parsecs, what was the average speed, in parsecs per hour, of the Starship Conundrum during this most recent voyage?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem. It says the spacecraft traveled from Planet X to Planet Y in eight hours less than twice the number of hours in a typical Earth day.",
    "A typical Earth day has 24 hours.",
    "Twice the number of hours in a typical Earth day is 2 times 24.",
    "2 times 24 is 48 hours.",
    "The spacecraft traveled in 8 hours less than 48 hours.",
    "48 hours minus 8 hours is 40 hours.",
    "Therefore, the spacecraft traveled for a total of 40 hours.",
    "Now I need to calculate the average speed, given that the distance between the two planets is 4,000 parsecs.",
    "The formula for average speed is total distance divided by total time.",
    "The total distance is 4,000 parsecs and the total travel time is 40 hours.",
    "Divide 4,000 parsecs by 40 hours to find the average speed.",
    "4,000 parsecs divided by 40 hours equals 100 parsecs per hour."

  "solution": "100"
