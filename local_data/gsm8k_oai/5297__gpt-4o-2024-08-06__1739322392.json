  "query": "A soccer team has 24 players. They have scored 150 goals on the season. There have been 15 games played. 1/3 of the players have averaged 1 goal each per game. How many total goals have the other players scored?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many players have averaged 1 goal each per game.",
    "There are 24 players total on the team.",
    "Let\u2019s calculate 1/3 of 24 players.",
    "1/3 of 24 is 24 / 3 = 8 players.",
    "These 8 players have averaged 1 goal each per game.",
    "The team has played 15 games.",
    "Each of the 8 players has scored 1 goal per game for 15 games.",
    "So each of these 8 players has scored 15 goals in total.",
    "Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by these 8 players together.",
    "Total goals by these 8 players is 8 players * 15 goals = 120 goals.",
    "The team has scored a total of 150 goals in the season.",
    "To find out how many goals the other players have scored, subtract the goals scored by the 8 players from the total goals scored by the team.",
    "The other players must have scored 150 - 120 = 30 goals.",
    "I have verified each calculation and all seems logical and correct."

  "solution": "30"
