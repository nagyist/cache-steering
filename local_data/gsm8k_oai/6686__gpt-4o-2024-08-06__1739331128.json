  "query": "Ashley wants a champagne toast at her wedding.  She wants to serve 2 glasses of champagne to each of her 120 wedding guests.  1 bottle of champagne has 6 servings.  How many bottles of champagne will she need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of champagne glasses required.",
    "Ashley wants to serve 2 glasses to each of her 120 guests.",
    "So, I multiply the number of guests by the number of glasses per guest: 120 guests * 2 glasses/guest = 240 glasses total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many bottles of champagne are needed for 240 glasses.",
    "I know that 1 bottle provides 6 servings, or glasses, of champagne.",
    "To find the number of bottles needed, I divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per bottle: 240 glasses \u00f7 6 glasses/bottle = 40 bottles."
