  "query": "Mia has 4 times as many shells as David. Ava has 20 more shells than Mia. Alice has half the number of shells Ava has. If David has 15 shells, what the total number of conch shells they all have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many shells David has. I'm given that David has 15 shells.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many shells Mia has. Mia has 4 times as many shells as David.",
    "So I calculate Mia's shells: 4 times 15 equals 60. Mia has 60 shells.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many shells Ava has. Ava has 20 more shells than Mia.",
    "I add 20 to Mia's 60 shells to find Ava's total: 60 plus 20 equals 80. Ava has 80 shells.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many shells Alice has. Alice has half the number of shells that Ava has.",
    "I divide Ava's 80 shells by 2 to find Alice's total: 80 divided by 2 equals 40. Alice has 40 shells.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of shells that they all have together.",
    "I add the number of shells each of them has: David's 15 shells, Mia's 60 shells, Ava's 80 shells, and Alice's 40 shells.",
    "I calculate the sum: 15 plus 60 plus 80 plus 40 equals 195."
