  "steps": [
    "Morgan orders a hamburger for $4.",
    "He also orders onion rings for $2.",
    "Additionally, he orders a smoothie for $3.",
    "I need to find out the total cost of Morgan's order.",
    "I add the cost of the hamburger, which is $4.",
    "Next, I add the cost of the onion rings, which is $2.",
    "Finally, I add the cost of the smoothie, which is $3.",
    "The total cost is calculated as $4 + $2 + $3.",
    "This sums up to $9.",
    "Morgan pays with a $20 bill.",
    "I need to determine how much change Morgan will receive.",
    "I subtract the total cost of the order, $9, from the amount Morgan paid, which is $20.",
    "The calculation is $20 - $9.",
    "The result of this subtraction is $11."
