  "query": "As a child, Bobby was able to jump rope 30 times per minute. Now that he is an adult, he can jump 1 jump per second. How many more jumps than when he was a child is Bobby able to jump now that he is an adult?",
  "steps": [
    "As a child, Bobby could jump rope 30 times in a minute.",
    "As an adult, Bobby can jump 1 jump per second.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "Therefore, as an adult, Bobby can jump 60 jumps in a minute.",
    "To find how many more jumps Bobby can do now, we subtract the child's jumps from the adult's jumps.",
    "Adult jumps per minute (60) minus child jumps per minute (30) equals 30."
