  "query": "A farm is growing corn in 2 fields. One of the fields has 13 full rows of corn cobs, and the other field has 16 full rows of corn cobs. If each row contains 4 corn cobs, how many corn cobs has the farm grown?",
  "steps": [
    "The farm has 2 fields, each with a different number of rows of corn.",
    "The first field has 13 rows of corn cobs.",
    "The second field has 16 rows of corn cobs.",
    "Each row in both fields contains 4 corn cobs.",
    "To find the total number of corn cobs in the first field, multiply the number of rows (13) by the number of corn cobs per row (4).",
    "13 rows * 4 corn cobs per row = 52 corn cobs in the first field.",
    "To find the total number of corn cobs in the second field, multiply the number of rows (16) by the number of corn cobs per row (4).",
    "16 rows * 4 corn cobs per row = 64 corn cobs in the second field.",
    "Add the total corn cobs from both fields to get the total number of corn cobs grown on the farm.",
    "52 corn cobs from the first field + 64 corn cobs from the second field = 116 total corn cobs."
