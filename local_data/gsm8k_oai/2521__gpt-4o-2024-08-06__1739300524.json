  "query": "Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many cards Mara has. We know Mara has 40 cards less than 150.",
    "Calculate 150 - 40 to find out how many cards Mara has.",
    "150 - 40 = 110, so Mara has 110 cards.",
    "Next, we know Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. Let's use J to represent the number of cards Janet has.",
    "Since Mara has twice as many cards as Janet, we have the equation: 2J = 110.",
    "Solve for J by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.",
    "110 / 2 = 55, so Janet has 55 cards.",
    "Brenda has 9 cards less than Janet. Let's use B to represent the number of cards Brenda has.",
    "Brenda's number of cards is 55 - 9.",
    "55 - 9 = 46, so Brenda has 46 cards.",
    "To find out how many cards they have in total, add the cards each person has together: Brenda's 46 cards, Janet's 55 cards, and Mara's 110 cards.",
    "Calculate the total: 46 + 55 + 110.",
    "46 + 55 = 101",
    "101 + 110 = 211"
  ],
  "solution": "211"
