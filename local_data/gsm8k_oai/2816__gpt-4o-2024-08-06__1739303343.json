  "query": "A frog lays 800 eggs a year.  10 percent dry up, and 70 percent are eaten.  1/4 of the remaining eggs end up hatching, how many frogs hatch out of the 800?",
  "steps": [
    "The frog lays 800 eggs in total.",
    "First, I need to calculate how many eggs dry up. 10% of 800 eggs dry up.",
    "10% of 800 is 0.10 * 800 = 80 eggs.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many eggs are eaten. 70% of 800 eggs are eaten.",
    "70% of 800 is 0.70 * 800 = 560 eggs.",
    "I need to find out how many eggs remain after some have dried up or been eaten.",
    "The total number of eggs that do not dry up or get eaten is 800 - 80 - 560.",
    "800 - 80 - 560 = 160 eggs.",
    "1/4 of the remaining eggs hatch.",
    "1/4 of 160 is 160 / 4 = 40.",
    "The final answer, which is the number of frogs that hatch, is 40."
