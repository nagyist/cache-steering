  "query": "Dorothy spent $53 to buy doughnut ingredients. If she made 25 doughnuts and sells each for $3, how much was her profit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the revenue from selling the doughnuts.",
    "Dorothy made 25 doughnuts and sells each for $3.",
    "To find the revenue, I multiply the number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut: 25 doughnuts x $3 per doughnut.",
    "The calculation gives me: 25 x 3 = $75.",
    "So, the total revenue from selling the doughnuts is $75.",
    "Next, I need to determine the profit.",
    "Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "Dorothy's total cost for the doughnut ingredients was $53.",
    "Therefore, I need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $75 - $53.",
    "The calculation gives me: $75 - $53 = $22."

  "solution": "22"
