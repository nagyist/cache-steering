  "query": "On Monday Elisa paints 30 square feet of her house's walls. On Tuesday she paints twice that amount. On Wednesday she finishes up by painting half as many square feet as she painted on Monday. How many square feet total does Elisa paint in her house?",
  "steps": [
    "On Monday, Elisa paints 30 square feet.",
    "On Tuesday, she paints twice the amount she painted on Monday.",
    "Twice 30 square feet is 30 * 2 = 60 square feet.",
    "On Wednesday, she paints half the amount she painted on Monday.",
    "Half of 30 square feet is 30 / 2 = 15 square feet.",
    "To find the total amount of square feet Elisa paints, I need to add the square feet painted on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.",
    "The total square feet is 30 (Monday) + 60 (Tuesday) + 15 (Wednesday).",
    "Adding them up gives 30 + 60 + 15 = 105 square feet."
