  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many packages of flour are needed for one cake.",
    "It is given that two packages of flour are required for making one cake.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many cakes Claire wants to make.",
    "Claire wants to make two cakes.",
    "I will calculate the total number of flour packages needed for two cakes.",
    "If 2 packages are needed per cake, for 2 cakes, Claire will need 2 * 2 = 4 packages of flour.",
    "Next, I need to determine the cost of one package of flour.",
    "It is given that 1 package of flour costs $3.",
    "To find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of packages by the cost per package.",
    "The total cost for the flour is 4 packages * $3/package = $12."
