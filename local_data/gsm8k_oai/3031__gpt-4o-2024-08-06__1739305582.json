  "steps": [
    "It's given that Jerk Tuna has 144 fish.",
    "Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna.",
    "To find the number of fish Tall Tuna has, I need to calculate 2 times the number of fish Jerk Tuna has.",
    "Calculating: 2 * 144 = 288.",
    "So, Tall Tuna has 288 fish.",
    "To find the total number of fish Tall Tuna and Jerk Tuna have together, I need to add the number of fish each has.",
    "Adding the fish: 144 (Jerk Tuna) + 288 (Tall Tuna) = 432.",
    "I have calculated the total number of fish they have together."
