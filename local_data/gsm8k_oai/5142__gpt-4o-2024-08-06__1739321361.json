  "query": "Christine figures it would take a pint of paint to paint the front and back of 1 door in her house.  She has 8 doors to paint.  At the paint store, she can either buy 8 separate pints of paint for $8.00 a pint or a gallon of paint (which is the same as 8 pints) for a flat $55.00  How much money will she save if she buys the gallon of paint instead of 8 pints?",
  "steps": [
    "Christine needs to paint 8 doors.",
    "She figures it takes 1 pint of paint to paint the front and back of one door.",
    "Therefore, for 8 doors, she needs 8 pints of paint.",
    "The cost of buying one pint is $8.00.",
    "If she buys 8 separate pints, it would cost 8 pints * $8.00/pint.",
    "8 * 8 = 64",
    "Buying 8 separate pints would cost her $64.00.",
    "Alternatively, she can buy a gallon of paint, which is equivalent to 8 pints, for a flat $55.00.",
    "Now, we need to find out how much money she will save by buying the gallon instead of the 8 pints.",
    "Calculate the difference between the cost of 8 pints and the cost of a gallon: $64.00 - $55.00.",
    "64 - 55 = 9"

  "solution": "9"
