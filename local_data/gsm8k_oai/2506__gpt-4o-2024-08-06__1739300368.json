  "query": "Tom has only been getting 6 hours of sleep a day.  He increases that by 1/3.  How many hours of sleep does he get per night?",
  "steps": [
    "Tom is currently getting 6 hours of sleep per night.",
    "He is increasing his sleep by 1/3 of his current sleep hours.",
    "To find 1/3 of 6 hours, I calculate 6 divided by 3.",
    "6 divided by 3 equals 2.",
    "Therefore, the increase in sleep is 2 hours.",
    "Tom's new sleep duration is his current 6 hours plus the 2 extra hours.",
