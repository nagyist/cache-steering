  "query": "A store transports fresh vegetables in crates and cartons using its delivery truck. One crate of vegetables weighs 4 kilograms and one carton 3 kilograms. How much will a load of 12 crates, and 16 cartons of vegetables weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know each crate weighs 4 kilograms.",
    "There are 12 crates in the load.",
    "To find the total weight of the crates, I need to multiply the number of crates by the weight of each crate.",
    "12 crates multiplied by 4 kilograms per crate equals 48 kilograms.",
    "Next, consider the cartons. Each carton weighs 3 kilograms.",
    "There are 16 cartons in the load.",
    "To find the total weight of the cartons, I need to multiply the number of cartons by the weight of each carton.",
    "16 cartons multiplied by 3 kilograms per carton equals 48 kilograms.",
    "Now, I have the total weight of the crates and the total weight of the cartons.",
    "The total weight of the crates is 48 kilograms, and the total weight of the cartons is 48 kilograms.",
    "To find the total weight of the load, I need to add the weight of the crates and the cartons.",
    "48 kilograms (crates) plus 48 kilograms (cartons) equals 96 kilograms."
