  "query": "Carl is taking a class where the whole grade is based on four tests that are graded out of 100. He got an 80, a 75 and a 90 on his first three tests. If he wants an 85 average for the class, what is the minimum grade he needs to get on his last test?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total score Carl needs for all four tests to achieve an 85 average.",
    "If the average score is 85 and there are four tests, the total score he needs is \\( 85 \\times 4 = 340 \\).",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total score Carl has from his first three tests.",
    "Carl scored 80 on the first test, 75 on the second test, and 90 on the third test.",
    "The total score for these three tests is \\( 80 + 75 + 90 = 245 \\).",
    "To find out what Carl needs on the fourth test, I'll subtract the total of his first three tests from the total score required.",
    "Using the total score needed: \\( 340 - 245 = 95 \\).",
    "Therefore, Carl needs to score at least 95 on his last test to achieve an 85 average."

  "solution": "95"
