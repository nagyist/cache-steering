  "query": "Mabel is counting sharks in the ocean. She knows that of the fish that she sees, 25% will be sharks and 75% will be another type of fish. On day one she counts 15 fish. On day 2 she counts three times as many. How many sharks did she count over those two days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many fish Mabel counted on day one.",
    "On day one, Mabel counted 15 fish.",
    "Now, calculate how many fish Mabel counted on day two.",
    "On day two, Mabel counts three times as many fish as on day one, so she counts 15 * 3 = 45 fish.",
    "Next, find the total number of fish Mabel counted over both days.",
    "Total fish counted is 15 (day one) + 45 (day two) = 60 fish.",
    "Now, calculate how many of these fish were sharks, given that 25% of the fish are sharks.",
    "To find the number of sharks, calculate 25% of the total fish counted: 25% of 60.",
    "25% of 60 is (25/100) * 60 = 15."
