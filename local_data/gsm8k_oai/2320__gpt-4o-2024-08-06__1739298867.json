  "query": "Harry is ordering pizza. A large pizza is 14. It costs $2 per topping. He orders 2 large pizzas, each with 3 toppings. He then adds a 25% tip. What is the total cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of one large pizza with 3 toppings.",
    "The base cost of one large pizza is $14.",
    "Each topping costs $2, and there are 3 toppings, so the cost for toppings is 3 * $2 = $6.",
    "Therefore, the total cost for one large pizza with 3 toppings is $14 + $6 = $20.",
    "Harry orders 2 large pizzas, so I need to calculate the cost for 2 pizzas.",
    "The cost for 2 pizzas is 2 * $20 = $40.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the tip. Harry is adding a 25% tip on the total cost of the pizzas.",
    "A 25% tip on $40 is 0.25 * $40 = $10.",
    "Finally, I need to calculate the total cost including the tip.",
    "The total cost is $40 + $10 = $50."

  "solution": "50"
