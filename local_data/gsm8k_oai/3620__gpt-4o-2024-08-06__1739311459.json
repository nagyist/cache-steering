  "query": "The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much water represents 1/3 of the tank's capacity.",
    "Let's assume the total capacity of the tank when full is 'x' gallons.",
    "Since the tank is 1/3 full, it currently holds (1/3)x gallons of water.",
    "Additional 16 gallons of water are added to fill the tank completely.",
    "The equation representing this situation is (1/3)x + 16 = x.",
    "To solve for x, I will subtract (1/3)x from both sides of the equation.",
    "This gives me: 16 = x - (1/3)x.",
    "Simplifying the right side, x - (1/3)x is equal to (2/3)x.",
    "The equation now is 16 = (2/3)x.",
    "To solve for x, I will multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2).",
    "Multiplying both sides by (3/2) gives me x = 16 * (3/2).",
    "Calculating this, 16 * (3/2) equals 24."
