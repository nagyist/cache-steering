  "query": "Mitchell is trying to chew as many pieces of gum at once as he can. He has 8 packets of gum, There are 7 pieces in each. If he chews all the gum except for 2 pieces, how many pieces does he chew at once?",
  "steps": [
    "Mitchell has 8 packets of gum.",
    "Each packet contains 7 pieces of gum.",
    "To find out the total number of pieces of gum Mitchell has, I need to multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet.",
    "8 packets \u00d7 7 pieces per packet = 56 pieces of gum.",
    "Mitchell chews all the gum except for 2 pieces.",
    "To find out how many pieces he chews, I need to subtract the 2 pieces he doesn\u2019t chew from the total number of pieces.",
    "56 pieces - 2 pieces = 54 pieces."
