  "query": "Gina is considered a bad tipper because she tipped 5%. If good tippers tip at least 20%, how many more cents than normal would Gina have to tip on a bill of $26 to be considered a good tipper?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the amount Gina tipped at 5% on a bill of $26.",
    "To find 5% of $26, I multiply 26 by 0.05.",
    "Calculating, 26 * 0.05 equals 1.30. So, Gina tipped $1.30.",
    "Next, I need to calculate what a 20% tip on the same bill would be.",
    "To find 20% of $26, I multiply 26 by 0.20.",
    "Calculating, 26 * 0.20 equals 5.20. So, a 20% tip would be $5.20.",
    "Now, I determine the difference between a 20% tip and the 5% tip Gina gave.",
    "Subtracting the 5% tip ($1.30) from the 20% tip ($5.20), I get 5.20 - 1.30.",
    "The difference is 3.90. Thus, Gina would need to tip an additional $3.90 to be considered a good tipper.",
    "I need to convert $3.90 into cents because the question asks for the amount in cents.",
    "There are 100 cents in a dollar, so I multiply 3.90 by 100.",
    "Calculating, 3.90 * 100 equals 390 cents."

  "solution": "390"
