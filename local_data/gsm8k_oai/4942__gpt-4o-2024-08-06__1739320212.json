  "steps": [
    "The total number of points scored by the Lady Eagles team in 5 games is 311.",
    "Out of the total 311 points, some players combined for 188 points.",
    "To find out the points scored by Lisa, Jessie, and Devin, I subtract the points scored by other players from the total points: 311 - 188.",
    "311 - 188 equals 123 points. So, Lisa, Jessie, and Devin scored a combined total of 123 points.",
    "It is stated that Lisa, Jessie, and Devin scored equally.",
    "To find out how many points each of them scored, I need to divide the 123 points equally among the three players: 123 \u00f7 3.",
    "123 divided by 3 equals 41.",
    "Therefore, each player, including Jessie, scored 41 points."
