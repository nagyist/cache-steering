  "query": "Michael has a lot of matchsticks at home and decides to use them to make miniature models. As he is about to start crafting, he has second thoughts and decides to only use half of his pile of matchsticks. He creates 30 matchsticks houses. If he has now used all of the matchsticks he intended to and each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, how many matchsticks did Michael have originally?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many matchsticks were used to make the houses.",
    "Michael creates 30 matchstick houses.",
    "Each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks.",
    "The total number of matchsticks used is 30 houses multiplied by 10 matchsticks per house.",
    "30 times 10 equals 300 matchsticks.",
    "Michael uses 300 matchsticks for the houses, and this is half of his original pile.",
    "To find the total original number of matchsticks, I need to double the amount he used.",
    "300 matchsticks times 2 equals 600.",
    "So, Michael originally had 600 matchsticks."

  "solution": "600"
