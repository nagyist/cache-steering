  "steps": [
    "Cooper makes 7 apple pies each day.",
    "He does this for 12 days.",
    "To find the total number of apple pies Cooper makes, I need to multiply the number of pies he makes a day by the number of days he makes them.",
    "7 pies/day * 12 days = 84 pies.",
    "Cooper made a total of 84 pies in 12 days.",
    "Ashley eats 50 of his pies.",
    "I need to subtract the number of pies Ashley ate from the total number of pies Cooper made to find out how many pies remain.",
    "84 pies - 50 pies = 34 pies."
