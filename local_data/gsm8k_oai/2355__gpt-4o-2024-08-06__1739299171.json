  "query": "Debbie works at a post office packing boxes to mail. Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I calculate the total tape needed for sealing each type of box.",
    "For the large boxes, each one requires 4 feet of tape for sealing.",
    "Debbie packed 2 large boxes.",
    "So, the sealing tape needed for large boxes is 2 boxes * 4 feet/box = 8 feet.",
    "Next, I calculate the sealing tape needed for the medium boxes.",
    "Each medium box requires 2 feet of tape for sealing.",
    "Debbie packed 8 medium boxes.",
    "So, the sealing tape needed for medium boxes is 8 boxes * 2 feet/box = 16 feet.",
    "Now, I calculate the sealing tape needed for the small boxes.",
    "Each small box requires 1 foot of tape for sealing.",
    "Debbie packed 5 small boxes.",
    "So, the sealing tape needed for small boxes is 5 boxes * 1 foot/box = 5 feet.",
    "Next, I calculate the tape needed for sticking the address labels, which is 1 foot for each box.",
    "The total number of boxes packed is 2 large + 8 medium + 5 small = 15 boxes.",
    "So, the tape used for sticking labels is 15 boxes * 1 foot/box = 15 feet.",
    "Now, I sum up all the tape used for sealing and labeling.",
    "Sealing tape: Large boxes = 8 feet, Medium boxes = 16 feet, Small boxes = 5 feet.",
    "Total sealing tape = 8 + 16 + 5 = 29 feet.",
    "Adding the tape for labels gives: 29 feet (sealing) + 15 feet (labeling) = 44 feet."
