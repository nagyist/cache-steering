  "query": "Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, while Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana. If Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips and Susana 25 chocolate chips, calculate the total number of chips they have together.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to clarify the given information regarding chips. Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, and Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana does.",
    "I'm given that Viviana has 20 vanilla chips.",
    "Now, according to the question, Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana.",
    "Since Susana has 3/4 the amount of vanilla chips that Viviana has, I need to calculate 3/4 of 20.",
    "3/4 of 20 vanilla chips is calculated as follows: \n(3/4) * 20 = 15.",
    "Therefore, Susana has 15 vanilla chips.",
    "Next, I know that Susana has 25 chocolate chips.",
    "Since Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, I need to add 5 to Susana's number of chocolate chips to find out how many Viviana has.",
    "Viviana's chocolate chips are 25 + 5 = 30.",
    "Now I need to sum up the total number of chips.",
    "Viviana's total chips are 20 (vanilla) + 30 (chocolate) = 50.",
    "Susana's total chips are 15 (vanilla) + 25 (chocolate) = 40.",
    "The total number of chips between Viviana and Susana is 50 + 40."
