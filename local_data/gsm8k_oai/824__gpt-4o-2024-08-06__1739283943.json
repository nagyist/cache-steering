  "query": "A school has 15 classrooms. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks in each classroom and the rest have 25 desks in each classroom. Only one student can sit at one desk. How many students can this school accommodate so that everyone has their own desk?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many classrooms have 30 desks.",
    "One-third of the 15 classrooms have 30 desks.",
    "To calculate one-third of 15, I perform the division: 15 / 3 = 5.",
    "So, there are 5 classrooms with 30 desks each.",
    "Next, I must calculate the number of classrooms with 25 desks.",
    "Since there are 15 classrooms in total and 5 have 30 desks, the remaining classrooms must have 25 desks.",
    "Subtracting the 5 classrooms with 30 desks from the total of 15 classrooms gives me: 15 - 5 = 10 classrooms.",
    "So, there are 10 classrooms with 25 desks each.",
    "Now, I calculate the total number of desks in the classrooms with 30 desks.",
    "Each of those 5 classrooms has 30 desks, so: 5 * 30 = 150 desks.",
    "I then calculate the total number of desks in the classrooms with 25 desks.",
    "Each of those 10 classrooms has 25 desks, so: 10 * 25 = 250 desks.",
    "Now, I add the total number of desks from both types of classrooms.",
    "150 desks + 250 desks = 400 desks.",
    "Since each desk can accommodate one student, the school can accommodate 400 students."
