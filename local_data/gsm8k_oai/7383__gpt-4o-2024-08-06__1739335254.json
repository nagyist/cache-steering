  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students in the class. There are 9 boys and 12 girls.",
    "Add the number of boys and girls together: 9 + 12.",
    "9 + 12 = 21. So there are 21 students in total.",
    "The teacher wants to create groups with 3 members.",
    "To find out how many groups can be created, divide the total number of students by the group size: 21 \u00f7 3.",
    "21 \u00f7 3 = 7. So, 7 groups can be formed."
