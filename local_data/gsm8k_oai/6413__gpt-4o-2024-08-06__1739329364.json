  "query": "If there were 200 students who passed an English course three years ago, and each subsequent year until the current one that number increased by 50% of the previous year's number, how many students will pass the course this year?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, there were 200 students who passed the English course three years ago.",
    "Let's calculate the number of students who passed the course two years ago.",
    "Two years ago, the number of students who passed increased by 50% from 200.",
    "To find 50% of 200, I calculate 0.5 * 200 = 100.",
    "Adding this to the original number: 200 + 100 = 300 students passed two years ago.",
    "Now, let's calculate the number of students who passed the course last year.",
    "Last year, the number increased by 50% from 300.",
    "To find 50% of 300, I calculate 0.5 * 300 = 150.",
    "Adding this to the number from two years ago: 300 + 150 = 450 students passed last year.",
    "Finally, I'll calculate the number of students who will pass the course this year.",
    "This year, the number increases by 50% from last year's 450.",
    "To find 50% of 450, I calculate 0.5 * 450 = 225.",
    "Adding this to the number from last year: 450 + 225 = 675 students will pass this year."
