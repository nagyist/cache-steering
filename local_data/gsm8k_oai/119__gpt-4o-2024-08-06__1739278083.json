  "query": "Jessa needs to make cupcakes for 3 fourth-grade classes that each have 30 students and a P.E. class with 50 students. How many cupcakes does she need to make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students in the three fourth-grade classes.",
    "Each fourth-grade class has 30 students.",
    "There are 3 fourth-grade classes.",
    "To find the total number of students in the fourth-grade classes, I multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class: 3 classes \u00d7 30 students/class = 90 students.",
    "Next, I need to consider the P.E. class.",
    "The P.E. class has 50 students.",
    "Now, I add the number of students in the fourth-grade classes to the number of students in the P.E. class to find the total number of students that need cupcakes: 90 students (fourth-grade) + 50 students (P.E.) = 140 students.",
    "Each student needs one cupcake.",
    "Therefore, Jessa needs to make 140 cupcakes."

  "solution": "140"
