  "query": "Pirate Rick sailed his ship to a tropical island in search of a site to bury his treasure.  After finding the perfect site, it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand under which to bury the treasure.  Once the treasure was buried, he left the island.  Then, a tropical storm came and washed away half of the sand from on top of the treasure.  Next, a giant tsunami wave poured over the island, adding 2 feet of new sand back onto the site of his treasure. When Pirate Rick returned, how long did it take for him to dig up his treasure?",
  "steps": [
    "Pirate Rick initially dug up 8 feet of sand to bury his treasure.",
    "It took him 4 hours to dig up these 8 feet of sand.",
    "The rate at which Pirate Rick digs is 8 feet / 4 hours = 2 feet per hour.",
    "After Rick left, a tropical storm washed away half of the sand from on top of the treasure.",
    "Half of the original 8 feet of sand is 8 feet / 2 = 4 feet.",
    "So, after the storm, there are 8 feet - 4 feet = 4 feet of sand left on top of the treasure.",
    "A giant tsunami wave then added 2 feet of new sand back onto the site.",
    "After the tsunami, there are 4 feet + 2 feet = 6 feet of sand on top of the treasure.",
    "Rick returned and needs to dig up 6 feet of sand to reach the treasure.",
    "At his digging rate of 2 feet per hour, it will take Rick 6 feet / 2 feet per hour = 3 hours to dig up the treasure."
