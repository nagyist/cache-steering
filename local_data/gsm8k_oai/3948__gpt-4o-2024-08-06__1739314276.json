  "query": "John started weightlifting when he was 16.  When he first started he could Clean & Jerk 80 kg and he could Snatch 50 kg.  He manages to double his clean and jerk and increase his snatch by 80%.  What is his new combined total lifting capacity?",
  "steps": [
    "John started with a Clean & Jerk of 80 kg.",
    "John's Snatch was initially 50 kg.",
    "John doubles his Clean & Jerk capacity, so I need to calculate what double of 80 kg is.",
    "Double of 80 kg is 80 kg * 2 = 160 kg.",
    "Next, I need to determine the increased Snatch capacity.",
    "The Snatch is increased by 80%, so I need to calculate 80% of 50 kg.",
    "To find 80% of 50 kg, I calculate 0.8 * 50 kg = 40 kg.",
    "John's new Snatch capacity is the original 50 kg plus the increase of 40 kg.",
    "50 kg + 40 kg = 90 kg.",
    "Now I have John's new Clean & Jerk capacity, which is 160 kg, and his new Snatch capacity, which is 90 kg.",
    "To find the combined total lifting capacity, I need to add the new Clean & Jerk and Snatch capacities.",
    "160 kg + 90 kg = 250 kg."
