  "query": "Calvin and Paislee played a pool game where points were awarded for winning a round. If Calvin had scored 500 points and Paislee 3/4 times as many points as Calvin, how many points was Paislee required to achieve to have a chance of tying the game?",
  "steps": [
    "Calvin scored 500 points in the game.",
    "Paislee scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.",
    "To find out how many points Paislee scored, I need to calculate 3/4 of 500.",
    "Calculating 3/4 of 500: (3/4) * 500 = 375.",
    "Paislee scored 375 points.",
    "To have a chance of tying the game, Paislee needs as many points as Calvin's total, which is 500 points.",
    "Since Paislee already has 375 points, I need to calculate how many more points she needs to reach 500 points.",
    "500 (points needed to tie) - 375 (current points) = 125.",
    "Paislee needs an additional 125 points to tie the game with Calvin."

  "solution": "125"
