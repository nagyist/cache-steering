  "query": "Frank wants to buy a new lamp for his bedroom. The cost of the cheapest lamp is $20, and the most expensive in the store is 3 times more expensive. How much money would Frank have remaining, if he currently has $90, and he buys the most expensive lamp available?",
  "steps": [
    "Frank has $90 to spend on a lamp.",
    "The cheapest lamp costs $20.",
    "The most expensive lamp is 3 times more expensive than the cheapest lamp.",
    "To find the cost of the most expensive lamp, I multiply the cost of the cheapest lamp ($20) by 3.",
    "$20 * 3 equals $60.",
    "So, the most expensive lamp in the store costs $60.",
    "Frank buys the most expensive lamp, which costs him $60.",
    "To find out how much money Frank has remaining, I subtract the cost of the lamp ($60) from the money he has initially ($90).",
    "$90 - $60 equals $30."
