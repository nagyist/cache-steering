  "query": "Lefty scores 20 points in a game and his teammate Righty scores half as many as Lefty does.  Their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty does.  What are the average points scored per player on the team?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that Lefty scores 20 points.",
    "Righty scores half as many points as Lefty. So, I need to calculate half of 20.",
    "Half of 20 is 10. Therefore, Righty scores 10 points.",
    "Now, I know that their other teammate scores 6 times as much as Righty.",
    "Since Righty scores 10 points, I need to calculate 6 times 10.",
    "6 times 10 is 60. So, their other teammate scores 60 points.",
    "To find the average points scored per player, I need to add up all the points scored by the team and divide by the number of players.",
    "The total points scored by the team is Lefty's 20 points, Righty's 10 points, and the other teammate's 60 points.",
    "20 + 10 + 60 equals 90. So, the team scored 90 points in total.",
    "There are three players on the team: Lefty, Righty, and the other teammate.",
    "To find the average, I need to divide the total points of 90 by the 3 players.",
    "90 divided by 3 is 30."
