  "query": "3 families of 4 people shared a vacation rental for 7 days.  Everyone uses 1 oversized beach towel a day before getting a new one.  The washing machine can hold 14 oversized beach towels per load.  How many loads of laundry will it take to wash all the oversized beach towels?",
  "steps": [
    "First, find the total number of people sharing the vacation rental. There are 3 families, each with 4 people.",
    "Multiply the number of families by the number of people in each family: 3 families * 4 people per family = 12 people.",
    "Each person uses 1 oversized beach towel per day, so find the total number of towels used per day by all people.",
    "Multiply the total number of people by the number of towels each person uses per day: 12 people * 1 towel per person = 12 towels per day.",
    "The vacation lasted for 7 days, so calculate the total number of towels used over the entire vacation.",
    "Multiply the number of towels used per day by the number of days: 12 towels per day * 7 days = 84 towels.",
    "The washing machine can hold 14 towels per load. Calculate how many loads of laundry are needed.",
    "Divide the total number of towels by the capacity of the washing machine: 84 towels \u00f7 14 towels/load = 6 loads."
