  "query": "Whenever Katie and her family eat donuts, they need some coffee to dunk them in. She notices that for each donut they need 2 ounces of coffee. Every pot of coffee she makes contains 12 ounces and costs $3 to make. If her family finishes 3 dozen donuts, how much do they spend on coffee?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many donuts are in 3 dozen.",
    "1 dozen is equal to 12 donuts.",
    "Therefore, 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 donuts.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much coffee is needed for 36 donuts.",
    "Each donut requires 2 ounces of coffee.",
    "So, for 36 donuts, they need 36 x 2 = 72 ounces of coffee.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many pots of coffee are needed to get 72 ounces.",
    "Each pot contains 12 ounces of coffee.",
    "72 ounces divided by 12 ounces per pot is 72 / 12 = 6 pots.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of 6 pots of coffee.",
    "Each pot costs $3 to make.",
    "So, the cost for 6 pots is 6 x $3 = $18."

  "solution": "18"
