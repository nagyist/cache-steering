  "query": "Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "The initial weight of the box is 2 pounds of jelly beans.",
    "Ken adds enough brownies to triple the weight of the box. Triple means multiplying by 3, so this is 2 pounds x 3 = 6 pounds.",
    "He then adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Adding this to the current weight of 6 pounds results in 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.",
    "Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the current weight of 8 pounds. Doubling means multiplying by 2, so this is 8 pounds x 2 = 16 pounds."

  "solution": "16"
