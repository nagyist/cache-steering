  "query": "Edmund is buying a new computer and needs to save up $75 before he has enough. He convinces his parents to pay him for extra chores. He normally has to do 12 chores a week. His parents agree to pay him $2 for every extra chore he does during the week. If he does 4 chores a day for two weeks, how much does he earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many chores Edmund does in one day.",
    "He does 4 chores a day.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of chores he does in two weeks.",
    "In one week, there are 7 days.",
    "So in two weeks, there are 14 days.",
    "If he does 4 chores each day for 14 days, that\u2019s 4 * 14.",
    "4 * 14 equals 56 chores.",
    "Now I need to consider how many of these chores are extra chores.",
    "He normally does 12 chores a week. In two weeks, his normal chores would be 12 * 2.",
    "12 * 2 equals 24 normal chores.",
    "The extra chores are the total chores minus the normal chores: 56 - 24.",
    "56 - 24 equals 32 extra chores.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much money he earns from these extra chores.",
    "His parents pay him $2 for every extra chore.",
    "So, for 32 extra chores, he earns 32 * $2.",
    "32 * $2 equals $64."

  "solution": "64"
