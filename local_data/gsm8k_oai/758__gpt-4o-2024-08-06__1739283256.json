  "query": "Faith went to a baking shop and bought flour that cost $5 and a cake stand that costs $28. She then gave the cashier two $20 bills and $3 in loose coins. How much change will she receive?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total cost of the items that Faith bought.",
    "The cost of the flour is $5.",
    "The cost of the cake stand is $28.",
    "Now, I'll add the cost of the flour and the cake stand: $5 + $28 = $33.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much money Faith gave to the cashier.",
    "Faith gave two $20 bills, which totals $20 * 2 = $40.",
    "Additionally, Faith gave $3 in loose coins.",
    "I need to add up all the money Faith gave: $40 (bills) + $3 (coins) = $43.",
    "Now, I have to calculate the change Faith will receive.",
    "To find the change, I'll subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money Faith gave: $43 - $33 = $10.",
    "Therefore, the change Faith will receive is $10."
