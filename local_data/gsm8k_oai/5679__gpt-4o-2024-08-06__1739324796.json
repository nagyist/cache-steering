  "query": "Kelly puts string cheeses in her kids lunches 5 days per week.  Her oldest wants 2 every day and her youngest will only eat 1.  The packages come with 30 string cheeses per pack.  How many packages of string cheese will Kelly need to fill her kids lunches for 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of string cheeses needed per day.",
    "Kelly's oldest wants 2 string cheeses per day.",
    "Kelly's youngest wants 1 string cheese per day.",
    "In total, Kelly needs 2 + 1 = 3 string cheeses per day for both kids.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total string cheeses needed per week.",
    "The children need string cheese for 5 days per week.",
    "So, Kelly needs 3 string cheeses per day \u00d7 5 days = 15 string cheeses per week.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total string cheeses needed for 4 weeks.",
    "The calculation is 15 string cheeses per week \u00d7 4 weeks = 60 string cheeses for 4 weeks.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many packages of string cheese Kelly needs.",
    "Each package contains 30 string cheeses.",
    "I need to calculate the number of packages by dividing the total needed by the number in each package: 60 string cheeses \u00f7 30 string cheeses per package = 2 packages."
