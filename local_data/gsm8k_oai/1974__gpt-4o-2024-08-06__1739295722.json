  "query": "Kathleen receives a weekly allowance for completing all of her chores. During middle school, her allowance was $2 more than $8 but during her senior year,  her allowance was $5 more than twice her middle school allowance. What is the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find Kathleen's allowance during middle school.",
    "The problem states that her middle school allowance was $2 more than $8.",
    "So, her middle school allowance is $8 + $2 = $10.",
    "Next, I need to find her allowance during her senior year.",
    "It is given that her senior year's allowance was $5 more than twice her middle school allowance.",
    "Twice her middle school allowance is 2 * $10 = $20.",
    "Adding $5 more gives us her senior year's allowance, which is $20 + $5 = $25.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the percentage increase from her middle school allowance to her senior year allowance.",
    "The increase in allowance is $25 (senior year) - $10 (middle school) = $15.",
    "The percentage increase is calculated as (increase/original amount) * 100.",
    "So, the percentage increase is ($15 / $10) * 100 = 150%."

  "solution": "150"
