  "query": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tubes of lip gloss Marcy has in total.",
    "Each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss. Marcy is bringing 6 tubs.",
    "To find the total number of tubes, I multiply the number of tubs by the number of tubes per tub: 6 tubs * 2 tubes/tub = 12 tubes.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people can have their makeup done with those 12 tubes of lip gloss.",
    "Each tube can serve 3 people, so I multiply the number of tubes by the number of people per tube: 12 tubes * 3 people/tube.",
    "12 * 3 equals 36, so Marcy will be doing makeup for 36 people."
  ],
  "solution": "36"
