    "The bakery makes 3 batches of baguettes a day.",

    "First, I need to calculate the total number of baguettes made in a day.",
    "The total number of baguettes is 3 batches * 48 baguettes per batch = 144 baguettes.",
    "After the first batch came out, 37 baguettes were sold.",

    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of baguettes sold.",
    "The total number of baguettes sold is 37 + 52 + 49.",
    "I need to add 37 and 52 first.",
    "37 + 52 = 89.",
    "Now add 49 to 89.",

    "The total number of baguettes sold is 138.",
    "Now, I need to subtract the total number of baguettes sold from the total number of baguettes made to find out how many are left.",
    "144 baguettes made - 138 baguettes sold = 6 baguettes left."
