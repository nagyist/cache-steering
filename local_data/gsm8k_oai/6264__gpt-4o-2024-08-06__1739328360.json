  "steps": [
    "First, I need to express the number of boys and girls in terms of one variable. Let's consider the number of girls as G.",
    "According to the problem, there are 33 more boys than girls. Therefore, the number of boys can be expressed as G + 33.",
    "The total number of people at the camp is given as 133.",
    "The equation representing the total number of people is: G (girls) + (G + 33) (boys) = 133.",
    "Simplifying this equation gives: G + G + 33 = 133.",
    "Combining the G terms results in: 2G + 33 = 133.",
    "Subtracting 33 from both sides gives: 2G = 100.",
    "Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for G, I get: G = 50."
