  "query": "Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team. If 8 people quit, but 13 new people got in, how many people are there now on the team?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining the initial number of people on the dance team.",
    "The initial number of people on the dance team is 25.",
    "Eight people quit the team.",
    "Subtract the number of people who quit from the initial number: 25 - 8.",
    "25 - 8 equals 17. So, now there are 17 people on the team.",
    "Thirteen new people join the team.",
    "Add the number of new people to the current number on the team: 17 + 13.",
    "17 + 13 equals 30.",
    "Therefore, the final number of people on the dance team is 30."
