  "query": "Julie is making caesar salad for a family picnic. At the market, she spends $8 on green lettuce and $6 on red lettuce. If each type of lettuce costs $2 per pound, how many total pounds of lettuce did she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Julie spent $8 on green lettuce.",
    "The price of green lettuce is $2 per pound.",
    "To find the pounds of green lettuce, divide the total cost by the price per pound: $8 / $2 per pound.",
    "$8 / $2 = 4 pounds of green lettuce.",
    "Julie spent $6 on red lettuce.",
    "The price of red lettuce is also $2 per pound.",
    "To find the pounds of red lettuce, divide the total cost by the price per pound: $6 / $2 per pound.",
    "$6 / $2 = 3 pounds of red lettuce.",
    "Julie bought 4 pounds of green lettuce and 3 pounds of red lettuce.",
    "To find the total pounds of lettuce, add the pounds of green and red lettuce: 4 pounds + 3 pounds.",
    "4 + 3 = 7 pounds of lettuce in total."
