  "query": "Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each. She also bought spoons at $1.50 each. How many spoons did Chenny buy if she paid a total of $24 for the plates and spoon?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the plates.",
    "Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each.",
    "The cost of the plates is 9 plates * $2/plate = $18.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the spoons.",
    "Chenny paid a total of $24 for both plates and spoons.",
    "So, the total cost for the spoons is $24 - $18 = $6.",
    "Each spoon costs $1.50.",
    "To find out how many spoons Chenny bought, I divide the total cost of spoons by the cost per spoon: $6 / $1.50/spoon.",
    "$6 / $1.50 equals 4.",
    "Therefore, Chenny bought 4 spoons."
