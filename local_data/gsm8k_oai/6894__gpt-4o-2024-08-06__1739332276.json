  "query": "Ben makes a sandwich that has 1250 calories total that has two strips of bacon with 125 calories each. What percentage of the sandwich's total calories come from bacon?",
  "steps": [
    "The total calories in the sandwich are 1250.",
    "Each strip of bacon has 125 calories.",
    "There are two strips of bacon on the sandwich.",
    "I need to calculate the total calories from bacon by adding the calories in both strips.",
    "Total calories from bacon = 125 calories/strip * 2 strips = 250 calories.",
    "Now, I need to find what percentage 250 calories is of the total 1250 calories.",
    "To find this percentage, divide the bacon calories by the total sandwich calories and multiply by 100.",
    "Percentage of calories from bacon = (250 / 1250) * 100",
    "Calculating the division: 250 / 1250 = 0.2",
    "Now, multiply by 100 to convert to percentage: 0.2 * 100 = 20"
  ],
  "solution": "20"
