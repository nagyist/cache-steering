  "query": "Nathaniel has 11 tickets to a basketball game. He gives away 2 tickets each to his best friends, until he only has 3 tickets left. How many best friends does Nathaniel have?",
  "steps": [
    "Nathaniel starts with 11 tickets.",
    "He wants to give away tickets two at a time to his best friends.",
    "He gives away 2 tickets to each friend until he only has 3 tickets left.",
    "If he has 3 tickets left, this means he has given away 11 - 3 = 8 tickets.",
    "Since he gives 2 tickets to each friend, I need to divide the 8 tickets by 2.",
    "8 divided by 2 equals 4.",
    "This means Nathaniel has 4 best friends."
