  "query": "The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180. If the boys are given $3900 to share, how much money does each boy receive?",
  "steps": [
    "The ratio of boys to girls is given as 5:7.",
    "Let's denote the number of boys as 5x and the number of girls as 7x.",
    "The total number of children is the sum of boys and girls: 5x + 7x = 12x.",
    "We know that the total number of children is 180, so we can set up the equation 12x = 180.",
    "To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 12: x = 180 / 12.",
    "Calculating 180 / 12 gives us x = 15.",
    "Now, we calculate the number of boys: 5x = 5 * 15 = 75.",
    "The boys are given a total of $3900 to share.",
    "To find out how much money each boy receives, we divide the total amount by the number of boys: $3900 / 75.",
    "Calculating $3900 / 75 gives us $52."
