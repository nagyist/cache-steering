  "query": "Tom uses 10 weight plates each weighing 30 pounds on an exercise machine.  This exercise machine uses special technology to make the weights 20% heavier on the lowering portion.  How heavy did the weights feel when being lowered?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total weight of the 10 weight plates.",
    "Each weight plate weighs 30 pounds, so 10 plates would weigh 10 x 30 pounds.",
    "10 x 30 = 300 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to account for the special technology that makes the weights feel 20% heavier on the lowering portion.",
    "I need to calculate 20% of 300 pounds.",
    "20% of 300 is calculated as (20/100) x 300.",
    "(20/100) x 300 = 60 pounds.",
    "The weights feel 20% heavier on the lowering portion, so I add the extra 60 pounds to the original weight of 300 pounds.",
    "300 pounds + 60 pounds = 360 pounds."

  "solution": "360"
