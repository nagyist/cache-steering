  "query": "John is laying the foundation for 3 homes. Each home needs a slab of concrete that is 100 feet by 100 feet by .5 feet. Concrete has a density of 150 pounds per cubic foot. A pound of concrete cost $.02 per pound. How much does the foundation cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the volume of concrete needed for a single home.",
    "The dimensions given for the concrete slab are 100 feet by 100 feet by 0.5 feet.",
    "I calculate the volume of one slab by multiplying these dimensions together: 100 * 100 * 0.5.",
    "Multiplying these values gives 5000 cubic feet.",
    "Now, to find the total volume needed for 3 homes, I multiply the volume of one slab by the number of homes: 5000 cubic feet * 3 homes.",
    "This gives a total volume of 15000 cubic feet of concrete.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much the concrete weighs.",
    "The problem states that the density of concrete is 150 pounds per cubic foot.",
    "To find the total weight of the concrete, I multiply the total volume by the density: 15000 cubic feet * 150 pounds/cubic foot.",
    "This calculation gives 2,250,000 pounds of concrete.",
    "The cost of concrete is given as $0.02 per pound.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the total weight of the concrete by the cost per pound: 2,250,000 pounds * $0.02/pound.",
    "This calculation results in a cost of $45,000."

  "solution": "45000"
