  "query": "On a school trip to the seashore, Alan and his friends collected shells. Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. Ben got a late start and only collected a third of what Laurie did. If Laurie collected 36 shells how many did Alan collect?",
  "steps": [
    "I start with the information about Laurie. Laurie collected 36 shells.",
    "Next, Ben collected a third of the amount Laurie collected.",
    "To find out how many shells Ben collected, I calculate one-third of Laurie's 36 shells.",
    "One-third of 36 is calculated as 36 divided by 3.",
    "36 divided by 3 equals 12.",
    "So, Ben collected 12 shells.",
    "Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did.",
    "To find out how many shells Alan collected, I calculate four times Ben's 12 shells.",
    "Four times 12 is calculated as 4 multiplied by 12.",
    "4 multiplied by 12 equals 48."

  "solution": "48"
