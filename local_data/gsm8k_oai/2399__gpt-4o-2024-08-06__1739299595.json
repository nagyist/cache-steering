  "query": "Rob has 24 baseball cards, and a few are doubles. One third of Rob's cards are doubles, and Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob. How many doubles baseball cards does Jess have?",
  "steps": [
    "Rob has 24 baseball cards in total.",
    "We are told that one third of Rob's cards are doubles.",
    "To find how many of Rob's cards are doubles, we need to calculate one third of 24.",
    "One third of 24 is calculated as 24 divided by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 equals 8.",
    "So, Rob has 8 doubles in his collection.",
    "Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob.",
    "If Rob has 8 doubles, then Jess has 5 times 8 doubles.",
    "5 times 8 equals 40."

  "solution": "40"
