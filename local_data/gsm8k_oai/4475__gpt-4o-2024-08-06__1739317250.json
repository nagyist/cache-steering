  "query": "If a vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, 18 miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday. What is the average distance traveled per day?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the average distance traveled per day, I need to know the total distance traveled.",
    "The distance traveled on Monday is 12 miles.",
    "The distance traveled on Tuesday is 18 miles.",
    "The distance traveled on Wednesday is 21 miles.",
    "Now, I add these distances together: 12 + 18 + 21.",
    "12 + 18 equals 30.",
    "30 + 21 equals 51.",
    "So, the total distance traveled over the three days is 51 miles.",
    "To find the average, I need to divide the total distance by the number of days.",
    "There are 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.",
    "So, I divide 51 miles by 3 days.",
    "51 divided by 3 equals 17."

  "solution": "17"
