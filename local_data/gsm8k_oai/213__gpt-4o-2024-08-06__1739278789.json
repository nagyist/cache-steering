  "query": "Mike and Ted planted tomatoes.  In the morning, Mike planted 50 tomato seeds while Ted planted twice as much as Mike.  In the afternoon, Mike planted 60 tomato seeds while Ted planted 20 fewer tomato seeds than Mike. How many tomato seeds did they plant altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tomato seeds Mike planted in the morning.",
    "According to the information, Mike planted 50 tomato seeds in the morning.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tomato seeds Ted planted in the morning.",
    "Ted planted twice as many tomato seeds as Mike in the morning.",
    "Since Mike planted 50 seeds, Ted planted 2 times 50, which is 100 seeds in the morning.",
    "I will now calculate the total number of seeds planted by both in the morning.",
    "Mike planted 50 seeds, and Ted planted 100 seeds in the morning. Together, that's 50 + 100 = 150 seeds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many seeds Mike planted in the afternoon.",
    "The information tells me that Mike planted 60 tomato seeds in the afternoon.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many seeds Ted planted in the afternoon.",
    "Ted planted 20 fewer seeds than Mike in the afternoon.",
    "Since Mike planted 60 seeds, Ted planted 60 - 20 = 40 seeds in the afternoon.",
    "I will calculate the total number of seeds planted by both in the afternoon.",
    "Mike planted 60 seeds, and Ted planted 40 seeds in the afternoon. Together, that's 60 + 40 = 100 seeds.",
    "Finally, I will determine the total number of seeds planted altogether by adding the morning and afternoon totals.",
    "In the morning, 150 seeds were planted, and in the afternoon, 100 seeds were planted.",
    "The total number of seeds planted altogether is 150 + 100 = 250 seeds."
