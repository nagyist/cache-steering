  "query": "Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago. This is half the number of nephews Alden has now. If Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now, how many nephews do the two have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago.",
    "Currently, Alden has twice the number of nephews he had ten years ago.",
    "Doubling 50 gives us 100 nephews.",
    "Now, Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden does right now.",
    "Since Alden has 100 nephews, Vihaan has 100 + 60 nephews.",
    "Adding 60 to 100 gives Vihaan 160 nephews.",
    "To find the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have together, add Alden's and Vihaan's current numbers of nephews.",
    "Alden has 100 nephews and Vihaan has 160 nephews.",
    "Adding 100 and 160 gives us the total number of nephews.",
    "100 + 160 equals 260."
