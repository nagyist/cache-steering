  "query": "John with his five friends ordered 3 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. If they all finished and ate the same amount of pizzas, how many slices did each person eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices in all the pizzas.",
    "Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 3 pizzas ordered.",
    "I multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 3 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 24 slices in total.",
    "John and his five friends make up a total of 6 people sharing the pizza.",
    "I need to find out how many slices each person ate by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people.",
    "I divide 24 slices by 6 people: 24 slices \u00f7 6 people = 4 slices per person."
