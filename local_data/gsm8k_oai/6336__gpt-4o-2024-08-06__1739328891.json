  "query": "Marco loves trading cards. He has a total of 500 cards on hand, and a fourth of them are duplicates. Marco decides to trade one-fifth of these duplicates for completely new cards to his friend Josh. How many new cards did Marco get?",
  "steps": [
    "Marco has a total of 500 cards.",
    "A fourth of the 500 cards are duplicates.",
    "To find how many duplicate cards Marco has, I need to calculate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of 500.",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125 \\). So, Marco has 125 duplicate cards.",
    "Marco trades one-fifth of these duplicates with Josh for new cards.",
    "To find how many duplicate cards Marco trades, I need to calculate \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of 125.",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 125 = 25 \\). So, Marco trades 25 duplicate cards.",
    "Therefore, Marco gets 25 new cards from his trade with Josh."
