  "query": "Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead.  One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?",
  "steps": [
    "Let \\( x \\) represent the number of geese in the first formation Albert noticed.",
    "Half of the geese from this initial formation broke off and landed in some trees, leaving half in the formation.",
    "The number of geese remaining in the formation in the air after half broke off is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).",
    "Then, 4 geese flew out of the trees to join those in the air.",
    "This means the number of geese in the new formation is \\( \\frac{x}{2} + 4 \\).",
    "We know that this new formation has 12 geese in it.",
    "Set up the equation: \\(\\frac{x}{2} + 4 = 12\\).",
    "Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\): \\(\\frac{x}{2} = 8\\).",
    "Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 16 \\).",
    "Therefore, the initial number of geese in the formation was 16."
