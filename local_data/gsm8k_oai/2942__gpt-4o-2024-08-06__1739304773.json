  "query": "Gunther just financed a John Deere tractor through the dealership.  If his monthly payment is $150.00 a month, for 5 years, with no interest, how much did he finance the tractor for?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many months are in 5 years.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "So, for 5 years, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year.",
    "Calculating this gives me 5 * 12 = 60 months.",
    "Gunther's monthly payment is $150.00.",
    "Since he makes this payment for 60 months, I need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months.",
    "Calculating this gives me $150.00 * 60.",
    "Performing the multiplication: 150 * 60 = 9000.",
    "Therefore, Gunther financed the tractor for a total of $9000."
  ],
  "solution": "9000"
