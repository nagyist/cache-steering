  "query": "James decides to bulk up.  He weighs 120 kg and gains 20% of his body weight in muscle and 1 quarter that much in fat.  How much does he weigh now?",
  "steps": [
    "James initially weighs 120 kg.",
    "He gains 20% of his body weight in muscle.",
    "20% of 120 kg is calculated as (20/100) * 120 = 24 kg.",
    "James gains 24 kg in muscle.",
    "He also gains 1 quarter of the muscle gain in fat.",
    "1 quarter of 24 kg is calculated as 24 / 4 = 6 kg.",
    "James gains 6 kg in fat.",
    "To find out how much James weighs now, add the original weight, muscle gain, and fat gain together.",
    "120 kg (initial weight) + 24 kg (muscle gain) + 6 kg (fat gain) = 150 kg."
