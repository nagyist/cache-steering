  "query": "A luxury perfume costs $1200. The store owner decided to increase its price by 10% so that he could earn more profit. Few weeks had past but the perfume was still not sold. So, the owner decided to lower the price by 15%. By how much was the final price lower than the original price?",
  "steps": [
    "The original price of the perfume is $1200.",
    "The owner first decided to increase the price by 10%.",
    "To calculate a 10% increase, I need to find 10% of $1200.",
    "10% of $1200 is calculated as \\( 0.10 \\times 1200 = 120 \\).",
    "Adding the $120 increase, the new price becomes \\( 1200 + 120 = 1320 \\).",
    "The owner then decided to reduce the price by 15%.",
    "To calculate a 15% reduction, I need to find 15% of the increased price, $1320.",
    "15% of $1320 is calculated as \\( 0.15 \\times 1320 = 198 \\).",
    "Subtracting the $198 decrease, the final price becomes \\( 1320 - 198 = 1122 \\).",
    "Now I need to compare the final price of $1122 to the original price of $1200.",
    "The difference between the original price and the final price is calculated as \\( 1200 - 1122 = 78 \\).",
    "The final price is lower than the original price by $78."
