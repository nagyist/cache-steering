    "Oprah currently has 3500 cars in her collection.",
    "She wants to reduce her collection to 500 cars.",
    "To find out how many cars she needs to give away, subtract 500 from 3500.",
    "3500 - 500 = 3000. Oprah needs to give away 3000 cars.",
    "She gives away an average of 50 cars per year.",
    "To find out how many years it will take to give away 3000 cars at a rate of 50 cars per year, divide 3000 by 50.",
    "3000 \u00f7 50 = 60. It will take 60 years."
