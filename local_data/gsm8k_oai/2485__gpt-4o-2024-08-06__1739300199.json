  "query": "Carly practices her butterfly stroke for 3 hours a day, 4 days a week, and her backstroke for 2 hours a day, six days a week. How much time does she spend practicing swimming in a month with 4 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total hours Carly spends practicing her butterfly stroke in a week.",
    "She practices her butterfly stroke for 3 hours a day.",
    "She practices this stroke 4 days a week.",
    "So, in one week, she spends 3 hours/day * 4 days/week = 12 hours/week on the butterfly stroke.",
    "Next, I calculate the total hours Carly spends practicing her backstroke in a week.",
    "She practices her backstroke for 2 hours a day.",
    "She practices this stroke 6 days a week.",
    "So, in one week, she spends 2 hours/day * 6 days/week = 12 hours/week on the backstroke.",
    "Now, I sum the total hours spent on both strokes in a week.",
    "She spends 12 hours/week on the butterfly stroke and 12 hours/week on the backstroke.",
    "Total swimming practice per week = 12 hours/week + 12 hours/week = 24 hours/week.",
    "I need to find out the total time she spends practicing in a month with 4 weeks.",
    "Total monthly practice time = 24 hours/week * 4 weeks/month.",
    "Multiply to find the total: 24 hours/week * 4 weeks = 96 hours."

  "solution": "96"
