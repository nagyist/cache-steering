  "query": "At Peanut Emporium, peanuts cost $3 per pound with a 15-pound minimum. If Baxter spent $105 on peanuts, how many pounds over the minimum did he purchase?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many pounds of peanuts Baxter bought in total.",
    "I know that peanuts cost $3 per pound.",
    "Baxter spent $105 on peanuts.",
    "I will divide the total amount spent by the cost per pound: $105 \u00f7 $3 = 35 pounds.",
    "Baxter bought a total of 35 pounds of peanuts.",
    "Now I need to determine how many pounds over the 15-pound minimum Baxter purchased.",
    "I will subtract the minimum pounds from the total pounds purchased: 35 pounds - 15 pounds = 20 pounds."

  "solution": "20"
