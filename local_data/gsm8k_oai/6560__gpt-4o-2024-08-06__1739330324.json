  "query": "Three friends ate a total of 8 pounds of fruit. Mario had 8 ounces of oranges, while Lydia ate 24 ounces of apples. Nicolai ate peaches. How many pounds of peaches did Nicolai eat?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total weight of fruit eaten by Mario and Lydia.",
    "Mario ate 8 ounces of oranges.",
    "Lydia ate 24 ounces of apples.",
    "I need to convert these weights into pounds because the question asks for the weight in pounds.",
    "There are 16 ounces in a pound. So, I will convert Mario's and Lydia's fruit weights from ounces to pounds.",
    "Mario's fruit: 8 ounces = 8 / 16 = 0.5 pounds.",
    "Lydia's fruit: 24 ounces = 24 / 16 = 1.5 pounds.",
    "Now, I will add the weights of the fruit Mario and Lydia ate.",
    "Total weight of fruit Mario and Lydia ate = 0.5 pounds + 1.5 pounds = 2 pounds.",
    "The total weight of all the fruit eaten by the friends is 8 pounds.",
    "To find how many pounds of peaches Nicolai ate, I will subtract the total weight Mario and Lydia ate from the total weight.",
    "Total weight of peaches eaten by Nicolai = 8 pounds - 2 pounds = 6 pounds."
