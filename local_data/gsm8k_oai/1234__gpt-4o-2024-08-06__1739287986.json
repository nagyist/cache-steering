  "query": "A bag of pistachios has 80 pistachios in it.  95 percent have shells, and 75 percent of those have shells that are opened.  How many pistachios in the bag have shells and have an opened shell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pistachios have shells.",
    "95 percent of the 80 pistachios in the bag have shells.",
    "I calculate 95 percent of 80 by multiplying 80 by 0.95.",
    "80 multiplied by 0.95 equals 76.",
    "Therefore, there are 76 pistachios with shells.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many of these pistachios with shells have opened shells.",
    "I know that 75 percent of the pistachios with shells have opened shells.",
    "I need to calculate 75 percent of 76.",
    "I multiply 76 by 0.75.",
    "76 multiplied by 0.75 equals 57.",
    "So, there are 57 pistachios with shells that have opened shells."
