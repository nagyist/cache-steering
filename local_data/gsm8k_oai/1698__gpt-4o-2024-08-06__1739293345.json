  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many clothes Cally has.",
    "Cally has 10 white shirts.",
    "Cally also has 5 colored shirts.",
    "In addition, Cally has 7 pairs of shorts.",

    "To find out the total number of clothes Cally has, I add up all the items: 10 + 5 + 7 + 6.",
    "10 + 5 is 15.",
    "15 + 7 is 22.",
    "22 + 6 is 28.",

    "So, Danny has a total of 30 pieces of clothing.",
    "To find the total number of clothes washed by both Cally and Danny, I add up their totals: 28 + 30.",
    "28 + 30 is 58."
