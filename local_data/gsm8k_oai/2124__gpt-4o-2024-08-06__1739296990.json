  "steps": [
    "James earns $10 per week as allowance.",
    "He saves all his money for four weeks.",
    "In four weeks, James earns 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.",
    "James spends half of his $40 on a new video game.",
    "Half of $40 is $40 / 2 = $20.",
    "After spending on the video game, James has $40 - $20 = $20 left.",
    "James spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book.",
    "A quarter of $20 is $20 / 4 = $5.",
    "After spending on the book, James has $20 - $5 = $15 left."
