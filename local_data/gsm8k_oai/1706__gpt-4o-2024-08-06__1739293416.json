  "query": "There are 400 students in the senior class at East High School. 52% of the students play sports. Of the students that play sports, 12.5% play soccer. How many students play soccer?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many students play sports.",
    "There are 400 students in total.",
    "52% of the students play sports.",
    "To find the number of students who play sports, I will calculate 52% of 400.",
    "52% as a decimal is 0.52.",
    "Multiply 400 by 0.52.",
    "400 * 0.52 = 208.",
    "So, 208 students play sports.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these sports-playing students play soccer.",
    "12.5% of the students who play sports also play soccer.",
    "12.5% as a decimal is 0.125.",
    "Multiply 208 by 0.125 to find the number of students who play soccer.",
    "208 * 0.125 = 26."
