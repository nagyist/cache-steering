  "query": "A book costs $4 more than a CD. The CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album. How much does the book cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of the CD. I know that the CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album.",
    "To find the discount amount on the album, I calculate 30% of $20.",
    "30% of $20 is calculated as (30/100) * 20 = $6.",
    "Now, I subtract the $6 discount from the album price to find the cost of the CD.",
    "The cost of the CD is $20 - $6 = $14.",
    "Next, I need to find the cost of the book. I know the book costs $4 more than the CD.",
    "I add $4 to the CD's cost to find the cost of the book.",
    "The book costs $14 + $4 = $18."
