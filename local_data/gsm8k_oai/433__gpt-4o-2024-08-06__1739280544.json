  "query": "Michael loves to paint and sells his creations. He charges $100 for a large painting and $80 for a small painting. At his last art show, he sold 5 large paintings and 8 small paintings. How much did he earn in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine the total earnings from the large paintings.",
    "Michael sold 5 large paintings.",
    "Each large painting sells for $100.",
    "The total earnings from the large paintings is calculated by multiplying the number of large paintings by the price per large painting: 5 paintings * $100/painting.",
    "5 * 100 = $500",
    "Next, I will calculate the total earnings from the small paintings.",
    "Michael sold 8 small paintings.",
    "Each small painting sells for $80.",
    "The total earnings from the small paintings is calculated by multiplying the number of small paintings by the price per small painting: 8 paintings * $80/painting.",
    "8 * 80 = $640",
    "Now I will add the earnings from the large paintings and the earnings from the small paintings to find the total earnings.",
    "Total earnings = $500 (from large paintings) + $640 (from small paintings)",
    "500 + 640 = $1140"
