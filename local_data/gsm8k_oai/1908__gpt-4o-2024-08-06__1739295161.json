  "query": "Taylor and his friends decide to bring their pets together for a walk. 3 of his friends come first, each having twice as many pets as Taylor has. Another two of his friends have 2 pets each. If Taylor has 4 pets, what's the total number of pets they have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pets Taylor has. The question states that Taylor has 4 pets.",
    "Next, I need to consider the number of pets each of his first 3 friends has. Each friend has twice as many pets as Taylor.",
    "Since Taylor has 4 pets, each of these friends has 2 times 4 pets, which is 8 pets.",
    "There are 3 friends, so the total number of pets that these 3 friends have is 3 times 8 pets, which is 24 pets.",
    "Then, I consider the two other friends who each have 2 pets.",
    "The total number of pets these two friends have is 2 times 2, which equals 4 pets.",
    "Now, I have all the individual counts: Taylor has 4 pets, the first 3 friends have 24 pets, and the last 2 friends have 4 pets together.",
    "I add up all these numbers to find the total number of pets. 4 (Taylor) + 24 (first 3 friends) + 4 (last 2 friends) = 32."

  "solution": "32"
