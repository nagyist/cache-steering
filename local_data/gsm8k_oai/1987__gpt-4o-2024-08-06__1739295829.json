  "query": "There are 120 cards in a box. If 2/5 of the cards are red, exactly 5/9 of the remainder are black, and the rest are green, calculate the number of green cards in the box?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate 2/5 of the total 120 cards to find the number of red cards.",
    "2/5 of 120 equals 2/5 * 120.",
    "2/5 of 120 equals 48.",
    "So, there are 48 red cards.",
    "Next, subtract the number of red cards from the total number of cards to determine the remainder.",
    "120 - 48 equals 72.",
    "There are 72 cards remaining after removing the red cards.",
    "Now, calculate 5/9 of this remainder of 72 cards to find the number of black cards.",
    "5/9 of 72 equals 5/9 * 72.",
    "5/9 of 72 equals 40.",
    "So, there are 40 black cards.",
    "Now, calculate the number of green cards by subtracting the number of red and black cards from the total.",
    "Subtract the red and black cards: 120 - 48 - 40.",
    "120 - 48 - 40 equals 32.",
    "Thus, there are 32 green cards."
