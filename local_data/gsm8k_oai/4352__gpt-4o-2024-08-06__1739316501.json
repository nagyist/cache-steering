  "query": "Nathan is buying decorations for his wedding reception. The reception hall will have 20 tables. Each table needs a linen tablecloth ($25 to rent), 4 place settings ($10 each to rent), and a centerpiece. Each centerpiece will have 10 roses ($5 each) and 15 lilies ($4 each). How much will the decorations cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost for linen tablecloths for all the tables.",
    "There are 20 tables, and each tablecloth costs $25 to rent.",
    "The total cost for the linen tablecloths is 20 tables * $25 = $500.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of place settings for all the tables.",
    "Each table needs 4 place settings, and each costs $10.",
    "So, the cost for place settings for one table is 4 * $10 = $40.",
    "The total cost for place settings across 20 tables is 20 tables * $40 = $800.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the cost of centerpieces for all the tables.",
    "Each centerpiece has 10 roses and 15 lilies.",
    "Roses cost $5 each, so the cost per centerpiece for roses is 10 * $5 = $50.",
    "Lilies cost $4 each, so the cost per centerpiece for lilies is 15 * $4 = $60.",
    "The total cost per centerpiece is $50 (roses) + $60 (lilies) = $110.",
    "The total cost for centerpieces across 20 tables is 20 tables * $110 = $2200.",
    "Finally, I need to add up the costs for tablecloths, place settings, and centerpieces to get the total decoration cost.",
    "The total cost for decorations is $500 (tablecloths) + $800 (place settings) + $2200 (centerpieces).",
    "Adding these amounts gives $500 + $800 + $2200 = $3500."

  "solution": "3500"
