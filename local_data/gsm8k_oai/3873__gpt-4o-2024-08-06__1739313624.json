  "query": "Moses and Tiffany want to see who is faster. But instead of a race, they just start running down the block. Tiffany runs 6 blocks in 3 minutes. Moses runs 12 blocks in 8 minutes. What is the speed (defined as blocks per minute) of the runner with the higher average speed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the speed of Tiffany in blocks per minute.",
    "Tiffany runs 6 blocks in 3 minutes.",
    "To find Tiffany's speed, I divide the number of blocks she runs by the number of minutes it takes her. That's 6 blocks divided by 3 minutes.",
    "6 divided by 3 equals 2.",
    "Therefore, Tiffany's speed is 2 blocks per minute.",
    "Next, I need to calculate Moses's speed in blocks per minute.",
    "Moses runs 12 blocks in 8 minutes.",
    "To find Moses's speed, I divide the number of blocks he runs by the number of minutes it takes him. That's 12 blocks divided by 8 minutes.",
    "12 divided by 8 equals 1.5.",
    "Therefore, Moses's speed is 1.5 blocks per minute.",
    "To find out who is faster, I need to compare their speeds.",
    "Tiffany's speed is 2 blocks per minute, and Moses's speed is 1.5 blocks per minute.",
    "2 is greater than 1.5, so Tiffany is the faster runner.",
    "The speed of the runner with the higher average speed, Tiffany, is 2 blocks per minute."
