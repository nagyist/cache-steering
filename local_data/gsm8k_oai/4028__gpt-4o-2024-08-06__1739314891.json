  "query": "Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?",
  "steps": [
    "Lucas currently has 12 pet beds.",
    "He manages to fit another 8 pet beds.",
    "I add the number of existing pet beds to the additional ones that Lucas can fit: 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds.",
    "His parents argue that each pet needs 2 pet beds to feel comfortable.",
    "To find out how many pets Lucas can have, I need to divide the total number of pet beds by the number of beds each pet requires: 20 / 2.",
    "Performing the division: 20 divided by 2 equals 10."

  "solution": "10"
