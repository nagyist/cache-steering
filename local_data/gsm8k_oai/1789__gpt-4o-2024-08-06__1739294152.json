  "query": "Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the number of cards Padma and Robert traded between each other.",
    "First, I'll check how many cards Padma traded. She traded 2 of her valuable ones and then traded another 15 of her cards.",
    "The total number of cards Padma traded is 2 (in the first trade) + 15 (in the second trade).",
    "Padma traded a total of 17 cards (2 + 15).",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many cards Robert traded. He first traded 10 cards to Padma in exchange for her 2 valuable ones.",
    "He then traded another 8 cards for 15 of Padma\u2019s cards.",
    "The total number of cards Robert traded is 10 (in the first trade) + 8 (in the second trade).",
    "Robert traded a total of 18 cards (10 + 8).",
    "Now I need to add the total number of cards traded by both Padma and Robert.",
    "The sum is 17 cards (by Padma) + 18 cards (by Robert).",
    "Therefore, the total number of cards traded between Padma and Robert is 35."
