  "query": "Sarah is planning to do some baking. She buys 5 pounds of rye flour, 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour, and 3 pounds of chickpea flour. Sarah already had 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour at home. How many pounds of flour does she now have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to add up the pounds of rye flour Sarah bought. She bought 5 pounds.",
    "Next, I add the amount of whole-wheat bread flour. She bought 10 pounds.",
    "Now, I add the amount of chickpea flour she purchased. She bought 3 pounds.",
    "Sarah also has some flour at home already: 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour.",
    "I will sum up all the flour she bought and had: 5 pounds of rye flour + 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour + 3 pounds of chickpea flour + 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour.",
    "Add 5 + 10 = 15 pounds.",
    "Add the result to the chickpea flour: 15 + 3 = 18 pounds.",
    "Finally, add the amount she already had at home: 18 + 2 = 20 pounds."
