  "query": "Johannes owns a vegetable shop, he sells cabbage for $2 per kilogram. If Johannes was able to earn $30 last Wednesday, $24 last Friday, and $42 today, how many kilograms of cabbage was he able to sell?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total earnings from cabbage sales over Wednesday, Friday, and today.",
    "Johannes earned $30 on Wednesday.",
    "Johannes earned $24 on Friday.",
    "Johannes earned $42 today.",
    "To find the total earnings, I need to add up these amounts: $30 + $24 + $42.",
    "$30 + $24 equals $54.",
    "$54 + $42 equals $96.",
    "The total earnings from selling cabbage is $96.",
    "Each kilogram of cabbage sells for $2.",
    "To find the number of kilograms sold, I need to divide the total earnings by the price per kilogram: $96 \u00f7 $2.",
    "$96 \u00f7 $2 equals 48.",
    "Johannes sold 48 kilograms of cabbage in total."
