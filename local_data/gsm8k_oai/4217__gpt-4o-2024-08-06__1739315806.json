  "query": "A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?",
  "steps": [
    "The initial number of tourists is 30.",
    "Two tourists are eaten by anacondas. So, subtract 2 from 30, which gives 28 remaining tourists.",
    "Half of the remaining 28 tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs. Half of 28 is 14.",
    "14 tourists are poisoned by the dart frogs. Subtract these 14 from the remaining 28 to find out how many are not poisoned. 28 - 14 = 14 tourists are not poisoned.",
    "1/7 of the 14 poisoned tourists recover. Calculate 1/7 of 14, which is 2.",
    "Add the 2 tourists who recovered to the 14 tourists who were not poisoned. 14 + 2 = 16 tourists."
