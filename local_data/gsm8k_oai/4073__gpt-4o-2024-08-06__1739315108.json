  "query": "Brogan has two apple trees and goes to harvest them. The first tree is 40% red and 60% green. The second tree is 50% red and 50% green. If they each produce 20 apples, how many red apples does he get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many apples Brogan gets from each tree.",
    "Each tree produces 20 apples.",
    "Now I will calculate how many red apples Brogan gets from the first tree.",
    "The first tree has 40% red apples.",
    "40% of 20 apples is calculated as (40/100) * 20.",
    "(40/100) * 20 equals 8.",
    "Brogan gets 8 red apples from the first tree.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many red apples Brogan gets from the second tree.",
    "The second tree has 50% red apples.",
    "50% of 20 apples is calculated as (50/100) * 20.",
    "(50/100) * 20 equals 10.",
    "Brogan gets 10 red apples from the second tree.",
    "Now I add the number of red apples from both trees.",
    "8 red apples from the first tree plus 10 red apples from the second tree equals 18 red apples."
