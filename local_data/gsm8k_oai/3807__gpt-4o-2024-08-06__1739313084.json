  "query": "As a special treat, Georgia makes muffins and brings them to her students on the first day of every month.  Her muffin recipe only makes 6 muffins and she has 24 students.  How many batches of muffins does Georgia make in 9 months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many muffins Georgia makes per batch. The problem states that a single muffin recipe makes 6 muffins.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many muffins Georgia needs for all of her students. She has 24 students.",
    "If each student receives one muffin, Georgia needs 24 muffins every month.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many batches are needed to make 24 muffins.",
    "One batch makes 6 muffins. To find out how many batches make 24 muffins, I divide the number of muffins needed (24) by the number of muffins per batch (6).",
    "24 muffins \u00f7 6 muffins per batch = 4 batches.",
    "Georgia makes 4 batches of muffins each month.",
    "The question asks for the total number of batches Georgia makes in 9 months.",
    "I multiply the number of batches per month (4) times the number of months (9).",
    "4 batches per month \u00d7 9 months = 36 batches."

  "solution": "36"
