  "query": "Connie redeemed all her arcade tickets today. She spent half of them on a stuffed koala bear. She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds. She spent another 15 tickets on glow bracelets. How many tickets did Connie redeem today?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today be \\( T \\).",
    "She spent half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear. Thus, the tickets spent on the koala bear is \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\).",
    "She also spent 10 tickets on earbuds.",
    "Additionally, she spent 15 tickets on glow bracelets.",
    "The sum of all tickets spent is the total number of tickets, so we have the equation: \\( \\frac{T}{2} + 10 + 15 = T \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( \\frac{T}{2} + 25 = T \\).",
    "To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2: \\( T + 50 = 2T \\).",
    "Rearrange the equation: \\( 50 = 2T - T \\).",
    "Combine like terms on the right side: \\( 50 = T \\)."
