  "query": "Celina enjoys hiking in the mountains. Due to a lack of proper equipment, she decided to order a new pair of boots, a flashlight, and a special hoodie. The hoodie cost $80 and the flashlight was only 20% of that price. The pair of boots cost was $110, but due to a special promotion, Celina was able to buy them 10% cheaper. How much did Celina spend in total on the above-mentioned equipment?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the cost of the flashlight. The flashlight cost is 20% of the hoodie price.",
    "The hoodie cost $80. So the flashlight costs 20% of $80.",
    "Calculate 20% of $80: (20/100) * $80 = $16.",
    "The flashlight cost $16.",
    "Now, calculate the actual cost of the boots after the 10% discount.",
    "The original price of the boots is $110. The discount is 10%.",
    "Calculate 10% of $110: (10/100) * $110 = $11.",
    "Subtract the discount from the original price: $110 - $11 = $99.",
    "The discounted price of the boots is $99.",
    "Add up the costs for the hoodie, flashlight, and discounted boots to find the total spent.",
    "The hoodie costs $80, the flashlight costs $16, and the boots cost $99.",
    "Calculate the total: $80 + $16 + $99 = $195."

  "solution": "195"
