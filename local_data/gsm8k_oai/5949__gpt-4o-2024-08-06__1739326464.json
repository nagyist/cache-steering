  "query": "Logan's father receives 50 cartons delivery for his milk business, each carton having 20 jars of milk. On a particular week, he received 20 cartons less when the delivery was done, and during offloading, he realized 3 jars in 5 cartons each was damaged, and one carton was totally damaged. How many jars of milk were good for sale that week?",
  "steps": [
    "Logan's father typically receives 50 cartons, each containing 20 jars of milk.",
    "The total number of jars normally received is 50 cartons * 20 jars/carton = 1000 jars.",
    "This week, he received 20 cartons less than the normal receipt: 50 - 20 = 30 cartons.",
    "Thus, he actually received 30 cartons * 20 jars/carton = 600 jars this week.",
    "During offloading, 3 jars in 5 cartons each were damaged.",
    "The total number of damaged jars from the 5 cartons is 3 jars/carton * 5 cartons = 15 jars.",
    "Additionally, one entire carton was totally damaged, meaning 20 more jars were lost.",
    "In total, the damage accounts for 15 jars + 20 jars = 35 jars.",
    "To find the number of jars good for sale, subtract the damaged jars from the jars received: 600 jars - 35 jars = 565 jars."
