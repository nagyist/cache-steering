  "query": "Kendra baked cookies for her family. Each batch contains 12 cookies. His family has 4 total people. She made three batches. Each cookie contains 2 chocolate chips. How many chips does each family member eat if they all get the same number of cookies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of cookies Kendra baked. Each batch contains 12 cookies, and she made three batches.",
    "To find the total number of cookies, I multiply the number of batches by the number of cookies per batch: 3 batches * 12 cookies per batch.",
    "3 * 12 = 36, so there are 36 cookies in total.",
    "Next, I need to divide these 36 cookies among the 4 family members so that everyone gets the same number of cookies.",
    "To find how many cookies each family member gets, I divide the total number of cookies by the number of family members: 36 cookies / 4 family members.",
    "36 / 4 = 9, so each family member gets 9 cookies.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many chocolate chips are in each family member\u2019s cookies. Each cookie contains 2 chocolate chips.",
    "To find the total number of chocolate chips each family member eats, I multiply the number of cookies each member gets by the number of chocolate chips per cookie: 9 cookies * 2 chips per cookie.",
    "9 * 2 = 18, so each family member eats 18 chocolate chips."

  "solution": "18"
