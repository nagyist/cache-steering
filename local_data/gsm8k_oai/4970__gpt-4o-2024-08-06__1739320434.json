    "Let's start with the mother's current age. She is 41 years old now.",
    "Five years ago, the mother was 41 - 5 = 36 years old.",
    "According to the problem, five years ago, the mother was twice as old as her daughter.",
    "Let's denote the daughter's age five years ago as x.",
    "The problem states that the mother was twice as old as the daughter five years ago, so we can set up the equation: 36 = 2 * x.",
    "Solve for x: x = 36 / 2 = 18.",
    "So the daughter was 18 years old five years ago.",
    "To find the daughter's current age, we add 5 years to her age from five years ago: 18 + 5 = 23.",
    "Now we need to find out how old the daughter will be in 3 years.",
    "Add 3 years to the daughter's current age: 23 + 3 = 26."
