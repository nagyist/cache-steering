  "query": "Melly's two cats each have litters of kittens at the same time. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens and 7 brown-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens and 6 brown-eyed kittens. What percentage of all the kittens have blue eyes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of blue-eyed kittens from both litters.",
    "The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens.",
    "The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens.",
    "The total number of blue-eyed kittens is 3 + 4 = 7.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of kittens from both litters.",
    "The first cat has 3 blue-eyed and 7 brown-eyed kittens, making a total of 3 + 7 = 10 kittens.",
    "The second cat has 4 blue-eyed and 6 brown-eyed kittens, making a total of 4 + 6 = 10 kittens.",
    "The total number of kittens is 10 + 10 = 20.",
    "I need to calculate the percentage of kittens that have blue eyes.",
    "The percentage is calculated as (number of blue-eyed kittens / total number of kittens) \u00d7 100.",
    "Substituting the values, the calculation is (7 / 20) \u00d7 100.",
    "Dividing 7 by 20 equals 0.35.",
    "Multiplying 0.35 by 100 gives 35."
