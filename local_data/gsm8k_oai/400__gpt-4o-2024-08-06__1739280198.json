  "query": "Karen is packing her backpack for a long-distance hike. She packs 20 pounds of water, 10 pounds of food, and 20 pounds of gear. During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?",
  "steps": [
    "Karen starts with 20 pounds of water.",
    "Karen starts with 10 pounds of food.",
    "Karen starts with 20 pounds of gear.",
    "Initially, the total weight Karen is carrying is 20 (water) + 10 (food) + 20 (gear) = 50 pounds.",
    "Karen drinks 2 pounds of water per hour.",
    "Over 6 hours, she will drink 6 * 2 = 12 pounds of water.",
    "Starting with 20 pounds of water, after 6 hours, she has 20 - 12 = 8 pounds of water left.",
    "Karen eats 1/3 the weight of food per hour as she drinks water per hour.",
    "She drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, so she eats 2 * 1/3 = 2/3 pounds of food per hour.",
    "Over 6 hours, she will eat 6 * 2/3 = 4 pounds of food.",
    "Starting with 10 pounds of food, after 6 hours, she has 10 - 4 = 6 pounds of food left.",
    "Karen's gear weight remains unchanged at 20 pounds.",
    "After 6 hours, the total weight she is carrying is 8 (water) + 6 (food) + 20 (gear) = 34 pounds."
