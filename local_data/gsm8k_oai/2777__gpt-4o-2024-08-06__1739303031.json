  "query": "Ivory and Brayan are doing school projects with a tight deadline and have to stay up late to complete everything. They prepare coffee to help them stay focused. If Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory, and Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour, calculate the total number of cups of coffee they drink together in 5 hours.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much coffee Brayan drinks in 5 hours.",
    "Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour.",
    "In 5 hours, Brayan drinks 4 cups/hour * 5 hours = 20 cups of coffee.",
    "Since Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory, I need to calculate how much coffee Ivory drinks.",
    "If Brayan drinks twice as much as Ivory, then Ivory drinks half of what Brayan drinks.",
    "Brayan drinks 20 cups in total, so Ivory drinks 20 cups / 2 = 10 cups of coffee in 5 hours.",
    "I now need to find the total number of cups of coffee both drink together.",
    "The total number of cups they drink together is Brayan's cups + Ivory's cups.",
    "Total cups = 20 cups (Brayan) + 10 cups (Ivory) = 30 cups."
