  "query": "Amon & Rhonda combined have 215 marbles. If Amon owns 55 marbles more than Rhonda, how many marbles does Rhonda have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of marbles Rhonda has be R.",
    "According to the problem, Amon has 55 more marbles than Rhonda. Therefore, Amon has R + 55 marbles.",
    "The problem states that Amon and Rhonda combined have 215 marbles.",
    "We can write the equation based on the total number of marbles: R (marbles Rhonda has) + (R + 55) (marbles Amon has) = 215.",
    "Simplifying the equation: R + R + 55 = 215.",
    "Combine like terms: 2R + 55 = 215.",
    "Subtract 55 from both sides to isolate the terms with R: 2R = 215 - 55.",
    "Calculate 215 - 55, which equals 160.",
    "Now, the equation is: 2R = 160.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to solve for R: R = 160 / 2.",
    "Calculate 160 / 2, which equals 80."
