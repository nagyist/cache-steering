    "Let the distance Hannah walked be \\( x \\) kilometers.",
    "According to the problem, 2 times \\( x \\) equals 18 kilometers.",
    "Set up the equation: \\( 2x = 18 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 2.",
    "\\( x = \\frac{18}{2} \\).",

    "Hannah walked 9 kilometers.",
    "To find the total kilometers walked by both Nadia and Hannah, add their distances.",

    "Add 18 kilometers and 9 kilometers together.",
    "The sum is 18 + 9 = 27 kilometers."
