    "The total amount to be shared is $50.",
    "Moses is supposed to take 40% of the total amount.",
    "To find 40% of $50, I calculate: 50 * 0.40 = $20.",
    "Moses will take $20.",
    "The remainder of the amount, after Moses takes his share, is $50 - $20 = $30.",
    "The remainder ($30) will be split equally between Tony and Esther.",
