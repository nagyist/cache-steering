  "query": "A baker bought cooking ingredients in the supermarket. She bought 3 boxes of flour that cost $3 each box, 3 trays of eggs that cost $10 for each tray, 7 liters of milk that cost $5 each liter, and 2 boxes of baking soda that cost $3 each box. How much will she have to pay for everything?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total cost of flour.",
    "She bought 3 boxes of flour at $3 each.",
    "The total cost for flour is 3 boxes * $3/box = $9.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total cost of the eggs.",
    "She bought 3 trays of eggs at $10 each.",
    "The total cost for eggs is 3 trays * $10/tray = $30.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total cost of the milk.",
    "She bought 7 liters of milk at $5 each.",
    "The total cost for milk is 7 liters * $5/liter = $35.",
    "Then, I will calculate the total cost of the baking soda.",
    "She bought 2 boxes of baking soda at $3 each.",
    "The total cost for baking soda is 2 boxes * $3/box = $6.",
    "Now I will add up all the total costs.",
    "The sum is $9 (flour) + $30 (eggs) + $35 (milk) + $6 (baking soda).",
    "Adding these values together, $9 + $30 + $35 + $6 = $80."

  "solution": "80"
