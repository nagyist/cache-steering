  "query": "There were 37 jellybeans in a jar. Pat removed 15 of them. Pat then added 5 of the removed jellybeans back in, and then removed 4 more. How many jellybeans are now in the jar?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, the jar contains 37 jellybeans.",
    "Pat removes 15 jellybeans from the jar. To find out how many are left, I subtract 15 from 37.",
    "37 - 15 equals 22. So, there are 22 jellybeans left in the jar after the first removal.",
    "Pat then adds 5 jellybeans back into the jar. I add these 5 jellybeans to the current total of 22 jellybeans.",
    "22 + 5 equals 27. Now there are 27 jellybeans in the jar.",
    "Finally, Pat removes 4 jellybeans from the jar. I need to subtract 4 from 27 to find the remaining number of jellybeans.",
    "27 - 4 equals 23. So there are 23 jellybeans remaining in the jar."

  "solution": "23"
