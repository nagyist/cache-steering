  "query": "During his summer break, Luke catches 2 fish every day for 30 days.  If each fish gives him 2 fillets, then how many fish fillets does he have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of fish Luke catches over the 30 days.",
    "Luke catches 2 fish per day.",
    "He catches fish for 30 days.",
    "To find the total number of fish, I multiply the number of fish caught per day by the total number of days: 2 fish/day * 30 days.",
    "2 fish/day * 30 days = 60 fish.",
    "Now, I know Luke has caught 60 fish in total.",
    "Each fish gives 2 fillets.",
    "To find the total number of fillets, I multiply the total number of fish by the number of fillets per fish: 60 fish * 2 fillets/fish.",
    "60 fish * 2 fillets/fish = 120 fillets."
  ],
  "solution": "120"
