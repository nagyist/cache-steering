  "steps": [
    "Sally sold 20 cups of lemonade last week.",
    "This week, she sold 30% more lemonade than last week.",
    "To find out how many more cups she sold this week, calculate 30% of last week's sales: 30% of 20 cups.",
    "30% as a decimal is 0.30.",
    "0.30 * 20 cups = 6 cups.",
    "This means Sally sold 6 more cups this week compared to last week.",
    "Now, add the additional cups to last week's total: 20 cups + 6 cups = 26 cups.",
    "Sally sold 26 cups of lemonade this week.",
    "Add the number of cups sold this week to the number sold last week to find the total: 20 cups (last week) + 26 cups (this week).",
    "20 cups + 26 cups = 46 cups."
