  "query": "Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's birthday party. If both parties combined had 240 people, how many people were there at Ryan's party?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's define the number of people at Taylor's party as T.",
    "Since Ryan's party is 4 times as huge as Taylor's, we can express the number of people at Ryan's party as 4T.",
    "The problem states that both parties combined had 240 people. So, we can write the equation: T + 4T = 240.",
    "Simplify the equation: 5T = 240.",
    "To find the value of T, divide both sides by 5: T = 240 / 5.",
    "Calculating the division gives us T = 48.",
    "Now, we know the number of people at Taylor's party is 48.",
    "To find the number of people at Ryan's party, we calculate 4 times this number.",
    "4 times 48 is 192."

  "solution": "192"
