  "query": "A tiger shark has 180 teeth.  A hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth that a tiger shark has.  A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark. How many teeth does a great white shark have?",
  "steps": [
    "A tiger shark has 180 teeth. That's given in the problem.",
    "A hammerhead shark has 1/6 the number of teeth that a tiger shark has.",
    "To find the number of teeth a hammerhead shark has, I need to calculate 1/6 of 180.",
    "I divide 180 by 6 to find 1/6 of 180.",
    "180 divided by 6 equals 30.",
    "So, a hammerhead shark has 30 teeth.",
    "I need to find the sum of the number of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark.",
    "The tiger shark has 180 teeth, and the hammerhead shark has 30 teeth.",
    "180 plus 30 equals 210.",
    "A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark.",
    "I need to multiply 210 by 2 to find how many teeth a great white shark has.",
    "210 multiplied by 2 equals 420."
