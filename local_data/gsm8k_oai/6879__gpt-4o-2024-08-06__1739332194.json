  "steps": [
    "Louise already has 28 toys in her cart.",
    "Each of these toys is worth $10.",
    "The total cost of the 28 toys is 28 x $10.",
    "Calculate 28 x $10 = $280.",
    "Louise adds 20 teddy bears to the cart.",
    "I need to find out how much these teddy bears cost each.",
    "The total amount of money Louise has is $580.",
    "She will spend this $580 on both the toys and the teddy bears.",
    "I need to subtract the cost of the 28 toys from the total amount of money to find out how much is spent on the teddy bears.",
    "So, $580 - $280 will give the total cost of the 20 teddy bears.",
    "Calculate $580 - $280 = $300.",
    "The 20 teddy bears cost $300 in total.",
    "To find out how much each teddy bear costs, divide $300 by 20.",
    "Calculate $300 \u00f7 20.",
    "$300 \u00f7 20 = $15."
