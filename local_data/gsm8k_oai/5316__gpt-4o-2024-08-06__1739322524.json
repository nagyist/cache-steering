  "query": "Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices of bread Shane bought.",
    "Shane bought 2 packages of sliced bread, with each package containing 20 slices.",
    "To find out the total number of slices of bread, I multiply the number of packages by the number of slices per package: 2 packages * 20 slices/package = 40 slices of bread.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total number of slices of ham Shane bought.",
    "Shane bought 2 packages of sliced ham, with each package containing 8 slices.",
    "To find out the total number of slices of ham, I multiply the number of packages by the number of slices per package: 2 packages * 8 slices/package = 16 slices of ham.",
    "Each sandwich requires 1 slice of ham, meaning Shane can make as many sandwiches as he has slices of ham.",
    "Since Shane has 16 slices of ham, he can make 16 sandwiches.",
    "Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so I need to calculate the number of slices of bread used in making the sandwiches: 16 sandwiches * 2 slices of bread/sandwich = 32 slices of bread used.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many slices of bread Shane will have leftover.",
    "Shane started with 40 slices of bread, and he used 32 slices of bread for the sandwiches.",
    "To find the leftover slices, I subtract the number of used slices from the initial number of slices: 40 slices - 32 slices = 8 slices of bread leftover."
