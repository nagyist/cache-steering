  "query": "Uncle Lou was given four bags of peanuts to eat on his 2-hour plane flight.  Each bag contains 30 peanuts.  If he eats all of the peanuts during the flight, one at a time, consumed at equally spaced intervals, what is the length of time, in minutes, between eating each peanut?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many peanuts Uncle Lou has in total.",
    "He has four bags of peanuts, and each bag contains 30 peanuts.",
    "To find the total number of peanuts, I multiply 4 bags by 30 peanuts per bag.",
    "4 \u00d7 30 = 120",
    "Uncle Lou has 120 peanuts in total.",
    "He will eat all 120 peanuts during the 2-hour flight.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total time of the flight in minutes, since I want the intervals in minutes.",
    "2 hours is equal to 2 \u00d7 60 minutes.",
    "2 \u00d7 60 = 120",
    "The total flight time is 120 minutes.",
    "Uncle Lou eats 120 peanuts over 120 minutes.",
    "To find the interval between each peanut, I divide the total flight time in minutes by the total number of peanuts.",
    "120 minutes \u00f7 120 peanuts = 1 minute per peanut"
  ],
  "solution": "1"
