  "query": "Mr. Mayer bought Corgi dogs for $1000 each. He plans to sell them with a 30% profit. If one of his friends wants to buy two dogs, how much should his friend pay?",
  "steps": [
    "Mr. Mayer bought each Corgi dog for $1000.",
    "He wants to sell them with a 30% profit.",
    "To find the selling price, I need to calculate 30% of the purchase price ($1000).",
    "30% of $1000 is calculated as 0.30 * 1000 = $300.",
    "Therefore, the profit on each dog is $300.",
    "The selling price of each dog will be the original cost plus the profit.",
    "So, the selling price for each dog is $1000 + $300 = $1300.",
    "Mr. Mayer's friend wants to buy two dogs.",
    "To find the total cost for two dogs, I need to multiply the selling price of one dog by two.",
    "The total cost for two dogs is 2 * $1300 = $2600."

  "solution": "2600"
