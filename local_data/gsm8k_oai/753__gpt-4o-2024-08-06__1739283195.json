  "query": "A shop sold 29 bags of potatoes in the morning. In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags of potatoes. If each bag of potatoes weighs 7kg, how many kilograms of potatoes did the shop sell for the whole day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total number of bags of potatoes sold during the day.",
    "In the morning, the shop sold 29 bags.",
    "In the afternoon, the shop sold 17 bags.",
    "To find the total number of bags sold in the entire day, I can add the number of bags sold in the morning and the afternoon.",
    "Total number of bags = 29 bags (morning) + 17 bags (afternoon).",
    "29 + 17 is 46.",
    "So, the shop sold 46 bags of potatoes in total.",
    "Next, each bag weighs 7 kg, so I need to calculate the total weight in kilograms.",
    "Total weight of potatoes = Total number of bags \u00d7 Weight per bag.",
    "Total weight = 46 bags \u00d7 7 kg/bag.",
    "46 times 7 is 322.",
    "Check the calculation again: Multiply 46 by 7.",
    "46 \u00d7 7 = 322, which is correct."
  ],
  "solution": "322"
