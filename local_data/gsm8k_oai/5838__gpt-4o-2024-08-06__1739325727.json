  "query": "Mark and Peter dug ponds in their backyards. Mark\u2019s pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter\u2019s pond. If Mark\u2019s pond is 19 feet deep, what is the depth of Peter\u2019s pond?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the depth of Peter\u2019s pond as \\( x \\) feet.",
    "Mark\u2019s pond is 19 feet deep.",
    "According to the problem, Mark\u2019s pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter\u2019s pond.",
    "We can express this as an equation: Mark's depth = 3 times Peter's depth + 4. Mathematically, this is \\( 19 = 3x + 4 \\).",
    "To find the value of \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation \\( 19 = 3x + 4 \\).",
    "First, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\) on one side: \\( 19 - 4 = 3x \\).",
    "Perform the subtraction: \\( 19 - 4 = 15 \\), so the equation simplifies to \\( 15 = 3x \\).",
    "Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 15 / 3 \\).",
    "Perform the division: \\( 15 / 3 = 5 \\).",
    "Thus, the depth of Peter\u2019s pond is 5 feet."
