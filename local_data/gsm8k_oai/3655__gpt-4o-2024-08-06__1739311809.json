  "steps": [
    "Martha needs 1.5 kg of cheese.",
    "The cheese costs $6 per kilogram.",
    "To find the cost of the cheese, multiply the quantity by the cost per kilogram: 1.5 kg * $6/kg.",
    "1.5 * 6 equals 9.",
    "Martha needs 500 grams of meat, which is equivalent to 0.5 kg (since 1000 grams is 1 kilogram).",
    "The meat costs $8 per kilogram.",
    "To find the cost of the meat, multiply the quantity by the cost per kilogram: 0.5 kg * $8/kg.",
    "0.5 * 8 equals 4.",
    "Now, add the cost of the cheese and the cost of the meat to find the total cost.",
    "9 (cost of cheese) + 4 (cost of meat) equals 13."
