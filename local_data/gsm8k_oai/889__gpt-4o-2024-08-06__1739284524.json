  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Carrie will have to pay for the iPhone after trading in her Samsung Galaxy.",
    "The iPhone costs $800 and the trade-in value of her Samsung Galaxy is $240.",
    "I subtract the trade-in value from the cost of the iPhone: $800 - $240 = $560.",
    "Carrie needs to come up with $560 to buy the iPhone after the trade-in.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many weeks Carrie has to work to make $560.",
    "Carrie makes $80 per week babysitting.",
    "I divide the total amount Carrie needs by her weekly earnings: $560 \u00f7 $80 = 7.",
