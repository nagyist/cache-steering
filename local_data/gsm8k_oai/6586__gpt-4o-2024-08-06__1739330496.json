  "query": "If the sum of two numbers is 33, and if the second number is twice the first number, what is the second number?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to express the two numbers in terms of algebraic expressions.",
    "Let's call the first number x.",
    "According to the problem, the second number is twice the first number.",
    "Therefore, the second number can be expressed as 2x.",
    "The problem states that the sum of the two numbers is 33.",
    "Therefore, I can set up the equation x + 2x = 33.",
    "Combining the terms on the left side, I get 3x = 33.",
    "To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.",
    "After dividing, I get x = 11.",
    "Now that I know the value of the first number (x), I can find the value of the second number.",
    "The second number is 2x, which means 2 times 11.",
    "Calculating this gives me 2 * 11 = 22.",
    "Therefore, the second number is 22."
