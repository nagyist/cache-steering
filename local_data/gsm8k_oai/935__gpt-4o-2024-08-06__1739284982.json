  "query": "Jim is baking loaves of bread. He has 200g of flour in the cupboard, 100g of flour on the kitchen counter, and 100g in the pantry. If one loaf of bread requires 200g of flour, how many loaves can Jim bake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total amount of flour Jim has.",
    "Jim has 200g of flour in the cupboard.",
    "Jim also has 100g of flour on the kitchen counter.",
    "Additionally, there is 100g of flour in the pantry.",
    "Now I'll add these amounts together: 200g + 100g + 100g.",
    "The total amount of flour Jim has is 400g.",
    "One loaf of bread requires 200g of flour.",
    "To find out how many loaves Jim can bake, I divide the total flour by the amount needed for one loaf: 400g / 200g.",
    "400g divided by 200g equals 2."

  "solution": "2"
