  "query": "Greta received 10 more letters in the mail than her brother. Greta's mother received twice the total number of letters Greta and her brother received. Calculate the total number of letters the three received if Greta's brother received 40 letters.",
  "steps": [
    "Greta's brother received 40 letters.",
    "Greta received 10 more letters than her brother.",
    "Since Greta's brother received 40 letters, Greta received 40 + 10 = 50 letters.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of letters received by Greta and her brother together.",
    "Greta and her brother together received 40 (brother) + 50 (Greta) = 90 letters.",
    "Greta's mother received twice the total number of letters Greta and her brother received.",
    "Therefore, Greta's mother received 2 * 90 = 180 letters.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total number of letters received by the three of them.",
    "The total number of letters is 40 (brother) + 50 (Greta) + 180 (mother) = 270 letters."

  "solution": "270"
