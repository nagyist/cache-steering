  "query": "Levi and his brother were playing basketball. Levi had scored 8 times and his brother had scored 12 times. Levi was determined to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets. How many more times does Levi have to score in order to reach his goal if his brother scores another 3 times?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the current scores of Levi and his brother.",
    "Levi has scored 8 times.",
    "His brother has scored 12 times.",
    "Now I need to account for the additional points his brother is projected to score.",
    "His brother will score 3 more times, so his total score becomes 12 + 3 = 15.",
    "Levi has to beat his brother by at least 5 baskets.",
    "Therefore, Levi needs to score at least 15 + 5 = 20 times in total to achieve his goal.",
    "Levi has already scored 8 times.",
    "The additional times Levi needs to score is 20 - 8 = 12."

  "solution": "12"
