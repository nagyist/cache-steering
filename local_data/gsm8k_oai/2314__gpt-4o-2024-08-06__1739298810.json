  "steps": [
    "Peter weighs half as much as Tyler.",

    "I calculate Tyler's weight as 65 pounds times 2, which equals 130 pounds.",
    "Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam.",
    "To find Sam's weight, I need to subtract 25 pounds from Tyler's weight.",
    "I calculate Sam's weight as 130 pounds minus 25 pounds, which equals 105 pounds."
