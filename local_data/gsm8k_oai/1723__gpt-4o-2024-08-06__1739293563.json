  "steps": [
    "Emani has $150.",
    "Emani has $30 more than Howard.",
    "To find out how much money Howard has, I subtract $30 from Emani's amount.",
    "Howard has $150 - $30 = $120.",
    "Now, I determine the total money Emani and Howard have together.",
    "Total money = Emani's money + Howard's money.",
    "Total money = $150 + $120 = $270.",
    "They decide to combine and share the money equally.",
    "To find out how much each gets, I divide the total money by 2.",
    "Each gets $270 / 2 = $135."
