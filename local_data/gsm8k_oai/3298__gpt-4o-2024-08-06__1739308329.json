  "query": "Bill has played 200 games of poker and won 63% of them. If he plays 100 more games and loses 43 of them, what is his new win percentage?",
  "steps": [
    "Bill has currently played 200 games and won 63% of them.",
    "To calculate the number of games Bill has won so far, multiply 200 by 63%.",
    "0.63 * 200 = 126. So, Bill has won 126 games out of 200.",
    "Bill will play 100 more games, which means the total number of games he will play is now 200 + 100.",
    "200 + 100 = 300. So, Bill will have played a total of 300 games.",
    "In the additional 100 games, Bill loses 43 games.",
    "If Bill lost 43 games, he must have won 100 - 43 in those 100 additional games.",
    "100 - 43 = 57. Bill won 57 out of the 100 additional games.",
    "To find out the total number of games Bill won, add the games he initially won to the games he won in the additional set: 126 (initial wins) + 57 (additional wins).",
    "126 + 57 = 183. Bill has won 183 games in total out of 300 games.",
    "Now, calculate the new win percentage: (Number of wins / Total games) * 100%.",
    "(183 / 300) * 100 = 61%."

  "solution": "61"
