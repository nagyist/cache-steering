  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of people who attended the class.",
    "Initially, 45 people attended the class.",
    "Afterward, an additional 15 people joined the class.",
    "I add the initial 45 people to the additional 15 people to calculate the total number of people.",
    "45 + 15 = 60, so a total of 60 people attended the class.",
    "The teacher gives out one lollipop for every 5 people.",
    "To find out how many groups of 5 people are in 60, I divide 60 by 5.",
    "60 \u00f7 5 = 12",
    "This means there are 12 groups of 5 people.",
    "Therefore, the teacher gives out 12 lollipops."
