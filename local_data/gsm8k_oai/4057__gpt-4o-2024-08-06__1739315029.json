  "query": "Violet has 3 more than twice as many nails as Tickletoe. If Violet has 27 nails, how many nails do they have together?",
  "steps": [
    "Let T denote the number of nails Tickletoe has.",
    "According to the problem, Violet has 3 more than twice as many nails as Tickletoe.",
    "Therefore, the equation is: 2T + 3 = 27.",
    "To find T, I need to solve the equation 2T + 3 = 27.",
    "Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get: 2T = 24.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to find T: T = 12.",
    "Now I know Tickletoe has 12 nails.",
    "Violet has 27 nails.",
    "Add the number of nails Violet and Tickletoe have together: 27 + 12.",
    "27 + 12 = 39."

  "solution": "39"
