  "query": "Tony has to run several errands in a day.  He needs to drive 10 miles to get groceries, 15 miles to get a haircut and 5 miles to go to a doctor's appointment.  How many miles will Tony have driven when he is halfway through driving around for his errands?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total distance that Tony needs to drive for all his errands.",
    "He drives 10 miles for groceries.",
    "He drives 15 miles for a haircut.",
    "He drives 5 miles for a doctor's appointment.",
    "Adding these distances gives me 10 + 15 + 5 = 30 miles.",
    "Now, I need to determine what \"halfway through driving around for his errands\" means.",
    "Halfway through the total errands would be driving half of the total distance.",
    "Half of 30 miles equals 30 / 2 = 15 miles."
  ],
  "solution": "15"
