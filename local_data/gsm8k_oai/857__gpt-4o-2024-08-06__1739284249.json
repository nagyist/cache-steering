  "steps": [
    "Sarah bought 6 paperback books.",
    "Sarah bought 4 hardback books.",
    "Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah bought.",
    "One-third of 6 paperback books is 6 / 3 = 2.",
    "Her brother bought 2 paperback books.",
    "Her brother bought two times the number of hardback books that Sarah bought.",
    "Two times 4 hardback books is 4 * 2 = 8.",
    "Her brother bought 8 hardback books.",
    "To find out how many books her brother bought in total, I need to add the number of paperback and hardback books he purchased.",
    "Her brother bought 2 paperback books + 8 hardback books = 10 books in total."
