  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the bananas.",
    "Ted needs to buy 5 bananas.",
    "Each banana costs $2.",
    "The total cost for the bananas is 5 bananas times $2 per banana.",
    "5 times 2 equals 10.",

    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the oranges.",
    "Ted needs to buy 10 oranges.",
    "Each orange costs $1.50.",
    "The total cost for the oranges is 10 oranges times $1.50 per orange.",
    "10 times 1.50 equals 15.",
    "So, Ted needs $15 for the oranges.",
    "Now, I need to add the total costs of the bananas and oranges to find the total amount of money Ted needs.",
    "The total cost for the bananas is $10 and the total cost for the oranges is $15.",
    "10 plus 15 equals 25."
