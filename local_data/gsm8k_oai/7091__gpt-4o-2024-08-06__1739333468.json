  "query": "A bicycle store is running a promotion. Every time a customer buys a bicycle, they will receive 2 bike clamps free with it. If the store sells 19 bikes in the morning and 27 bikes in the afternoon, how many bike clamps has the store given to customers?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll determine the total number of bikes sold during the day.",
    "The store sells 19 bikes in the morning and 27 bikes in the afternoon.",
    "Total bikes sold = 19 (morning) + 27 (afternoon)",
    "19 + 27 equals 46.",
    "The store sold 46 bikes in total.",
    "According to the promotion, each bike sold comes with 2 free bike clamps.",
    "I'll calculate the total number of bike clamps given away.",
    "The number of bike clamps per bike is 2.",
    "Total bike clamps given = 46 bikes \u00d7 2 clamps per bike.",
    "46 \u00d7 2 equals 92."
