  "query": "Abigail spent 60% of her money on food, and 25% of the remainder on her phone bill. After spending $20 on entertainment, she is left with $40. How much money did Abigail have initially?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the initial amount of money Abigail had as X.",
    "Abigail spent 60% of her money on food. That means she spent 0.6 * X on food.",
    "The remainder after spending on food would be X - 0.6 * X = 0.4 * X.",
    "Then, she spent 25% of the remainder on her phone bill. The amount spent on the phone bill is 0.25 * 0.4 * X.",
    "The remaining money after the phone bill is 0.4 * X - 0.25 * 0.4 * X.",
    "Let's simplify the remaining money: 0.4 * X - 0.1 * X = 0.3 * X.",
    "After the phone bill, she spent $20 on entertainment.",
    "Let's calculate the remaining money: 0.3 * X - 20.",
    "According to the problem, after all the spending, she is left with $40.",
    "Therefore, we set up the equation: 0.3 * X - 20 = 40.",
    "To solve for X, add 20 to both sides of the equation: 0.3 * X = 40 + 20.",
    "0.3 * X = 60.",
    "Divide both sides by 0.3 to find X: X = 60 / 0.3.",
    "Calculating the division: 60 / 0.3 = 200."
