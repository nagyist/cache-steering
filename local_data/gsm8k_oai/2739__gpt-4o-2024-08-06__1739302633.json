  "query": "Legacy has 5 bars of gold she received from her father. Her friend Aleena has 2 bars fewer than she has. If a bar of gold is worth $2200, calculate the total value of gold the three have together.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many bars of gold Aleena has.",
    "Legacy has 5 bars of gold, and Aleena has 2 bars fewer than Legacy.",
    "Therefore, Aleena has 5 - 2 = 3 bars of gold.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of bars they have together: Legacy's 5 bars and Aleena's 3 bars.",
    "The total number of bars together is 5 + 3 = 8 bars.",
    "I know that each bar is worth $2200.",
    "To find the total value of the gold, I need to multiply the number of bars by the value of each bar.",
    "The total value is 8 bars * $2200 per bar = $17,600."

  "solution": "17600"
