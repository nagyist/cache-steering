  "query": "On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw. When the draw was done, she was declared the winner of the 5th prize of $90. Excited, she quickly dashed to play slots at one of the casinos in Atlantic City. Unfortunately, she lost $50 at the first slot machine, $10 at the second and $5 at the last one.  Dejected, she decided to take a long walk. She soon grew thirsty and entered the first gas station she saw. She picked a $1 bottle of water and while paying for it, she bought a $1 lottery ticket. To her utter delight, she won an instant prize of $65. How much money did Renata end up having?",
  "steps": [
    "Renata started with $10.",
    "She made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw.",
    "After the donation, she had $10 - $4 = $6.",
    "Renata won the 5th prize of $90 in the draw.",
    "After winning, her total was $6 + $90 = $96.",
    "At the first slot machine, she lost $50.",
    "After this loss, she had $96 - $50 = $46.",
    "At the second slot machine, she lost $10.",
    "After this loss, she had $46 - $10 = $36.",
    "At the last slot machine, she lost $5.",
    "After this loss, she had $36 - $5 = $31.",
    "Renata bought a $1 bottle of water.",
    "After this purchase, she had $31 - $1 = $30.",
    "She also bought a $1 lottery ticket.",
    "After buying the ticket, she had $30 - $1 = $29.",
    "Renata won an instant prize of $65 from the lottery ticket.",
    "Adding the prize, Renata's total was $29 + $65 = $94."
