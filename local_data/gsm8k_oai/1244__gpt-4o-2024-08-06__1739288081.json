  "query": "A singer is planning on releasing 3 songs in a month. If he worked on one song for 10 hours a day, and each song took 10 days to be completed, calculate the total number of hours he took to complete the 3 songs.",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out the total number of hours taken for each song.",
    "The singer worked on one song for 10 hours a day.",
    "Each song took 10 days to be completed.",
    "So, the total number of hours per song is 10 hours/day * 10 days.",
    "10 hours/day * 10 days = 100 hours per song.",
    "The singer has 3 songs to complete.",
    "To find the total number of hours for 3 songs, I multiply 100 hours/song by 3 songs.",
    "100 hours/song * 3 songs = 300 hours.",
    "I found that the total number of hours to complete the 3 songs is 300 hours."
