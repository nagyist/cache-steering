  "query": "Micah picks 2 dozen strawberries from the field.  He eats 6 and saves the rest for his mom.  How many strawberries are there for his mom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know how many strawberries Micah picks in total. The problem states Micah picks 2 dozen strawberries.",
    "I know one dozen is equal to 12. Therefore, 2 dozen equals 2 times 12.",
    "Calculating that, 2 times 12 is 24. So Micah picks 24 strawberries in total.",
    "Next, the problem states Micah eats 6 strawberries.",
    "To find out how many strawberries are left for his mom, I subtract the 6 strawberries that Micah eats from the total of 24 strawberries he picked.",
    "Calculating 24 minus 6 gives me 18 strawberries."

  "solution": "18"
