  "query": "Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry's hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the normal water pumping rate with the hose.",
    "The normal rate is 6 gallons per minute.",
    "Next, find the restricted water pumping rate due to the drought.",
    "During the drought, the hose pumps at 2/3rds of the normal rate.",
    "Calculate 2/3rds of 6 gallons per minute.",
    "2/3 of 6 is 4 gallons per minute.",
    "Now, determine how many gallons the pond can hold.",
    "The pond can hold 200 gallons of water.",
    "Finally, calculate how many minutes it will take to fill the pond.",
    "Divide the total number of gallons (200) by the restricted pumping rate (4 gallons per minute).",
    "200 divided by 4 is 50."

  "solution": "50"
