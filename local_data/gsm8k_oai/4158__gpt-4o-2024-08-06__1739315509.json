  "query": "Reyna had 20 lamps with seven light bulbs in each lamp. If 1/4 of them have 2 burnt-out light bulbs each, how many light bulbs are working?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of light bulbs Reyna has.",
    "Each lamp has 7 light bulbs, and there are 20 lamps.",
    "I multiply the number of lamps by the number of light bulbs per lamp: 20 lamps * 7 light bulbs/lamp = 140 light bulbs.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many lamps have burnt-out light bulbs.",
    "According to the problem, 1/4 of the lamps have 2 burnt-out light bulbs each.",
    "So, I calculate 1/4 of 20 lamps: 20 lamps * 1/4 = 5 lamps.",
    "Each of these 5 lamps has 2 burnt-out light bulbs.",
    "Thus, the total number of burnt-out light bulbs is: 5 lamps * 2 burnt-out light bulbs/lamp = 10 burnt-out light bulbs.",
    "To find out how many light bulbs are working, I subtract the burnt-out light bulbs from the total number of light bulbs.",
    "140 total light bulbs - 10 burnt-out light bulbs = 130 working light bulbs."

  "solution": "130"
