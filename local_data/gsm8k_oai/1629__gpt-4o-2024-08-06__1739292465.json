  "query": "The zoo has 50 new visitors entering the zoo every hour. The zoo is open for 8 hours in one day. If 80% of the total visitors go to the gorilla exhibit, how many visitors go to the gorilla exhibit in one day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many new visitors enter the zoo in one day.",
    "The zoo has 50 new visitors every hour.",
    "The zoo is open for 8 hours each day.",
    "To find the total number of visitors in one day, I multiply the number of visitors per hour by the number of hours the zoo is open.",
    "50 visitors/hour * 8 hours = 400 visitors.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many of these visitors go to the gorilla exhibit.",
    "According to the problem, 80% of the visitors go to the gorilla exhibit.",
    "To find 80% of the total visitors, I multiply the total number of visitors by 0.80.",
    "400 visitors * 0.80 = 320 visitors.",
    "This means 320 visitors go to the gorilla exhibit in one day."
