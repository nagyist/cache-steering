  "query": "Before Cameron broke his right arm, he was able to type 10 words per minute on his phone. After he broke his arm, he had to use his left hand for a while, and he could only type 8 words per minute. What is the difference between the number of words he could type in 5 minutes before and after he broke his arm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes before he broke his arm.",
    "Before breaking his arm, Cameron typed 10 words per minute.",
    "In 5 minutes, he would type 10 words per minute * 5 minutes = 50 words.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of words Cameron could type in 5 minutes after he broke his arm.",
    "After breaking his arm, Cameron typed 8 words per minute.",
    "In 5 minutes, he would type 8 words per minute * 5 minutes = 40 words.",
    "Now, I need to find the difference in the number of words he could type before and after breaking his arm in 5 minutes.",
    "The difference is 50 words - 40 words = 10 words."
