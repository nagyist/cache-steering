  "query": "There are 15 cats in a shelter. One-third were adopted, and were replaced with twice the amount that were adopted. Later on, twice as many dogs showed up as there are cats. How many total animals are there in the shelter?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cats were adopted. There are 15 cats initially.",
    "One-third of 15 cats were adopted. Calculate 1/3 of 15.",
    "1/3 of 15 is 5.",
    "So, 5 cats were adopted.",
    "Those 5 adopted cats were replaced with twice the amount of cats.",
    "Twice the number of adopted cats (5) is 10.",
    "Therefore, 10 new cats came into the shelter.",
    "Calculate the new total number of cats in the shelter.",
    "After adopting 5 and adding 10 new cats, the number of cats is 15 - 5 + 10.",
    "15 - 5 + 10 equals 20 cats.",
    "Now, twice as many dogs showed up as there are cats.",
    "Twice 20 is 40.",
    "Therefore, 40 dogs showed up.",
    "Now add the number of cats and dogs together to find the total number of animals in the shelter.",
    "20 cats + 40 dogs equals 60 animals in total."

  "solution": "60"
