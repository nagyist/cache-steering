  "query": "If Clover goes for a 1.5-mile walk in the morning and another 1.5-mile walk in the evening, every day, how many miles does he walk in 30 days?",
  "steps": [
    "Clover walks 1.5 miles in the morning.",
    "Clover walks another 1.5 miles in the evening.",
    "So, in one day, Clover walks 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles.",
    "Adding the distances, Clover walks a total of 3 miles in one day.",
    "Clover repeats this walking routine every day for 30 days.",
    "To find the total miles walked in 30 days, I need to multiply the miles he walks in one day by the number of days.",
    "3 miles/day * 30 days = 90 miles.",
    "Therefore, Clover walks a total of 90 miles in 30 days."
