  "query": "Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the time it takes for each route.",
    "Time is calculated as distance divided by speed.",
    "For the first route, the distance is 1500 miles and the speed is 75 MPH.",
    "Time for the first route = 1500 miles / 75 MPH = 20 hours.",
    "For the second route, the distance is 750 miles and the speed is 25 MPH.",
    "Time for the second route = 750 miles / 25 MPH = 30 hours.",
    "The fastest route is the one that takes the least time.",
    "Comparing the times, the first route takes 20 hours and the second takes 30 hours.",
    "The fastest route is the first one, taking 20 hours."
