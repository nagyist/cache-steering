  "steps": [
    "Ben spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car. This means his car payment is 20% of his after-tax income.",
    "We know his car payment is $400.",
    "I'm going to set his after-tax income as \\( x \\).",
    "20% of his after-tax income, \\( 0.2x \\), is equal to his car payment of $400.",
    "I can set up the equation: \\( 0.2x = 400 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.2: \\( x = \\frac{400}{0.2} \\).",
    "Dividing 400 by 0.2 gives 2000.",
    "So, Ben's after-tax income is $2,000.",
    "Now, I know he pays 1/3 of his gross income in taxes.",
    "This means his after-tax income is 2/3 of his gross income.",
    "Let\u2019s set his gross income before taxes as \\( y \\).",
    "According to the problem, \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of his gross income, \\( y \\), is equal to his after-tax income of $2,000.",
    "I can set up the equation: \\( \\frac{2}{3}y = 2000 \\).",
    "To find \\( y \\), I need to divide both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).",
    "Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so \\( y = 2000 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\).",
    "Calculating that gives \\( y = 3000 \\)."
