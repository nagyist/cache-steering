  "query": "There was some money in the cookie jar. Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar. Martha spent half as much as Doris. If there were $15 left in the cookie jar, how much money, in dollars, was there in the cookie jar at first?",
  "steps": [
    "First, acknowledge that Doris spent $6 from the cookie jar.",
    "Martha spent half as much as Doris.",
    "Calculate half of the amount Doris spent: $6 / 2 = $3.",
    "So Martha spent $3.",
    "Add the amounts that Doris and Martha spent together to find the total spent.",
    "The total amount spent is $6 (Doris) + $3 (Martha) = $9.",
    "There is $15 left in the cookie jar after both spent money.",
    "Add the total amount spent to the amount left to find the original amount in the jar.",
    "Original amount in the cookie jar = $9 (spent) + $15 (left) = $24."
