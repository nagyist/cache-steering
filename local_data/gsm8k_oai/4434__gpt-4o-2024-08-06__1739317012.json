  "query": "Jamestown has 20 theme parks. If Venice has 25 more theme parks than Jamestown, and Marina Del Ray has 50 more theme parks than Jamestown, calculate the number of theme parks present in the three towns.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify how many theme parks Jamestown has. It is stated that Jamestown has 20 theme parks.",
    "Next, determine how many theme parks Venice has. Venice has 25 more theme parks than Jamestown. So, I need to add 25 to the number of theme parks that Jamestown has.",
    "Calculate the number of theme parks in Venice: 20 (Jamestown) + 25 = 45.",
    "Now, find out how many theme parks Marina Del Ray has. Marina Del Ray has 50 more theme parks than Jamestown. So, I need to add 50 to the number of theme parks that Jamestown has.",
    "Calculate the number of theme parks in Marina Del Ray: 20 (Jamestown) + 50 = 70.",
    "Add the number of theme parks in each town to find the total number of theme parks.",
    "Add Jamestown's theme parks: 20.",
    "Add Venice's theme parks: 45.",
    "Add Marina Del Ray's theme parks: 70.",
    "Calculate the total number of theme parks: 20 (Jamestown) + 45 (Venice) + 70 (Marina Del Ray) = 135."
