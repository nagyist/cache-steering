  "query": "Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the total number of days Terese runs.",
    "I see that Terese runs on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.",
    "I count 4 days of running.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total distance Terese runs over these 4 days.",
    "I add the distances: 4.2 miles on Monday, 3.8 miles on Tuesday, 3.6 miles on Wednesday, and 4.4 miles on Thursday.",
    "Adding these values together: 4.2 + 3.8 = 8.0 (total after Monday and Tuesday).",
    "Adding Wednesday's distance: 8.0 + 3.6 = 11.6 (total after Wednesday).",
    "Finally, adding Thursday's distance: 11.6 + 4.4 = 16.0.",
    "Now, I know Terese runs a total of 16 miles over these 4 days.",
    "To find the average distance run per day, I divide the total distance by the number of days ran.",
    "I divide 16 miles by 4 days.",
    "16 divided by 4 equals 4."

  "solution": "4"
