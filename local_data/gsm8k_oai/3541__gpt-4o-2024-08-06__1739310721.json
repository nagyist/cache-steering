  "query": "There are 10 cars parked in a mall\u2019s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the total number of customers since each customer makes one purchase.",
    "The sports store makes 20 sales, so there are 20 customers there.",
    "The music store makes 30 sales, which means there are 30 customers there.",
    "To find the total number of customers, I add the number from the sports store and the music store together.",
    "20 (sports store sales) + 30 (music store sales) = 50 customers in total.",
    "There are 10 cars, and each car has the same number of customers.",
    "I need to find how many customers are in each car, so I divide the total number of customers by the number of cars.",
    "50 customers \u00f7 10 cars = 5 customers per car."
