  "query": "It takes 50 large jelly beans to fill up a large drinking glass.  It takes half that amount to fill up a small drinking glass.  If there are 5 large drinking glasses and 3 small ones, how many jellybeans will it take to fill them up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many large jelly beans are needed to fill one small drinking glass.",
    "Since it takes 50 jelly beans to fill a large drinking glass, and it takes half that amount for a small one, a small glass requires 50 / 2 = 25 jelly beans.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of jelly beans needed for the large drinking glasses.",
    "There are 5 large drinking glasses, and each requires 50 jelly beans.",
    "So, the total jelly beans for the large glasses is 5 * 50 = 250 jelly beans.",
    "Now, calculate the total jelly beans needed for the small drinking glasses.",
    "There are 3 small drinking glasses, and each requires 25 jelly beans.",
    "So, the total jelly beans for the small glasses is 3 * 25 = 75 jelly beans.",
    "Add the jelly beans needed for the large glasses to the jelly beans needed for the small glasses to find the total number of jelly beans.",
    "The total number of jelly beans is 250 + 75 = 325 jelly beans."
