  "query": "The chicken crossed the road to get to the other side twice for the thrill of it. The first time, it had to dodge 23 speeding cars. The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings. How many feathers did it have afterward?",
  "steps": [
    "The chicken initially had 5263 feathers.",
    "The chicken dodged 23 cars on its first crossing.",
    "The second time, a person pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars dodged.",
    "Twice 23 is calculated as 2 * 23 = 46.",
    "Therefore, the person pulled out 46 feathers.",
    "To find the number of feathers left, subtract the feathers pulled from the initial count.",
    "5263 - 46 = 5217"

  "solution": "5217"
