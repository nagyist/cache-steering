  "query": "Calvin has been saving his hair clippings after each haircut to make a wig for his dog. He has gotten 8 haircuts and knows that he needs 2 more to reach his goal. What percentage towards his goal is he?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of haircuts Calvin needs for his goal.",
    "Calvin needs 8 haircuts already taken plus 2 more to reach his goal.",
    "This means the total number of haircuts needed is 8 + 2 = 10.",
    "Next, I need to determine the percentage of his goal that Calvin has completed.",
    "He has already had 8 haircuts.",
    "The percentage towards his goal is (number of haircuts completed / total number of haircuts needed) * 100.",
    "This can be calculated as (8 / 10) * 100.",
    "8 divided by 10 is 0.8.",
    "Multiply 0.8 by 100 to convert it into a percentage.",
    "0.8 * 100 is 80."

  "solution": "80"
