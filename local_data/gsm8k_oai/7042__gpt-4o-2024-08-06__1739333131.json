  "query": "A school bus traveled for 42 minutes at a speed of 50 mph. What is the distance the bus traveled in miles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how to calculate distance based on speed and time.",
    "The formula to find distance is: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.",
    "The speed of the bus is given as 50 mph (miles per hour).",
    "The time the bus traveled is 42 minutes.",
    "Before applying the formula, I need to convert the time into hours since the speed is in miles per hour.",
    "There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 42 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 0.7 hours.",
    "Now that I have the time in hours, I can use the formula to calculate the distance.",
    "Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 50 mph \u00d7 0.7 hours.",
    "Calculating the product: 50 \u00d7 0.7 = 35."

  "solution": "35"
