  "query": "Peter has 15 birds. 1/3 are ducks. The rest are chickens and require special feed that costs $2 per bird. How much does it cost to feed the chickens?",
  "steps": [
    "Peter has 15 birds in total.",
    "1/3 of the birds are ducks.",
    "To find out how many ducks there are, calculate 1/3 of 15.",
    "1/3 of 15 equals 5.",
    "So, there are 5 ducks.",
    "The rest of the birds are chickens.",
    "The number of chickens is 15 - 5.",
    "15 - 5 equals 10.",
    "So, there are 10 chickens.",
    "Each chicken requires special feed that costs $2 per bird.",
    "The cost to feed one chicken is $2.",
    "Multiply the number of chickens by the cost per chicken to find the total cost.",
    "10 chickens times $2 per chicken equals $20."
