  "query": "Steve finds 100 gold bars while visiting Oregon. He wants to distribute his gold bars evenly to his 4 friends. If 20 gold bars were lost on the way back to San Diego, how many gold bars will each of his 4 friends get when he returns?",
  "steps": [
    "Steve originally finds 100 gold bars.",
    "20 gold bars are lost on the way back to San Diego.",
    "To find out how many gold bars are left, subtract the lost bars from the original total: 100 - 20.",
    "100 - 20 equals 80 gold bars left.",
    "Steve wants to distribute these remaining gold bars evenly among his 4 friends.",
    "To find out how many bars each friend will get, divide 80 by 4.",
    "80 divided by 4 equals 20 gold bars per friend."
