  "query": "Miranda is stuffing feather pillows. She needs two pounds of feathers for each pillow. A pound of goose feathers is approximately 300 feathers. Her goose has approximately 3600 feathers. How many pillows can she stuff after she plucks the goose?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pounds of feathers Miranda can get from the goose.",
    "I know that 1 pound of goose feathers is approximately 300 feathers.",
    "The goose has approximately 3600 feathers.",
    "To find the number of pounds of feathers, I divide the total number of feathers by the number of feathers per pound: 3600 feathers \u00f7 300 feathers/pound.",
    "3600 \u00f7 300 equals 12 pounds of feathers.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pillows Miranda can stuff with 12 pounds of feathers.",
    "It takes 2 pounds of feathers to stuff one pillow.",
    "I divide the total pounds of feathers by the pounds needed per pillow: 12 pounds \u00f7 2 pounds/pillow.",
    "12 \u00f7 2 equals 6 pillows."
