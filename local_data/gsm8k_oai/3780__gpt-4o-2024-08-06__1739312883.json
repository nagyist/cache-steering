  "query": "Janet counts 30 crows on the powerlines and 60% more hawks than crows. How many birds does she count total?",
  "steps": [
    "Janet counts 30 crows on the powerlines.",
    "She counts 60% more hawks than crows.",
    "First, calculate 60% of the number of crows.",
    "60% of 30 crows is calculated as 0.60 * 30.",
    "0.60 * 30 = 18 hawks.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of hawks by adding the 60% more to the number of crows.",
    "The number of hawks is 30 crows + 18 (additional hawks).",
    "So, Janet counts 48 hawks.",
    "Next, find the total number of birds by adding the number of crows and the number of hawks together.",
    "The total number of birds is 30 crows + 48 hawks."
