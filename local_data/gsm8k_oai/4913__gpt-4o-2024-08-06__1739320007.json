  "query": "In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the number of participants in 2018 was 150.",
    "I need to find the number of participants in 2019, which is 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018.",
    "Twice the number of participants in 2018 is 2 * 150 = 300.",
    "Adding 20 to 300 gives me the number of participants in 2019: 300 + 20 = 320.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of participants in 2020.",
    "The number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019.",
    "Half the number of participants in 2019 is 320 / 2 = 160.",
    "Subtracting 40 from 160 gives me the number of participants in 2020: 160 - 40 = 120.",
    "Now I need to find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020.",
    "Subtracting the number of participants in 2020 from the number of participants in 2019 gives 320 - 120.",
    "Calculating the difference: 320 - 120 = 200."
