  "query": "Robin wants to buy jelly bracelets for her friends. She decides to buy one bracelet for each letter of the first name of her friends. Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily and Patrice. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to count the number of letters in each friend's first name.",
    "Jessica has 7 letters in her name.",
    "Tori has 4 letters in her name.",
    "Lily has 4 letters in her name.",
    "Patrice has 7 letters in her name.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total number of bracelets she needs to buy by adding up these numbers.",
    "7 (Jessica) + 4 (Tori) + 4 (Lily) + 7 (Patrice) equals 22.",
    "Robin needs to buy 22 bracelets in total.",
    "Each bracelet costs $2, so I will multiply the total number of bracelets by the cost per bracelet.",
    "22 bracelets x $2 per bracelet equals $44."
