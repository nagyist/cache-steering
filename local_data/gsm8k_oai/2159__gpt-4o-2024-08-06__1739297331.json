  "query": "Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long Marla spends driving one way to her son's school. The information tells me that it is 20 minutes.",
    "Next, Marla spends 70 minutes attending the parent-teacher night.",
    "After the parent-teacher night, Marla will spend the same amount of time driving back home as she did going to the school, which is another 20 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to add up all the minutes: 20 minutes driving to the school, 70 minutes at the event, and 20 minutes driving back home.",
    "I will calculate the total time by summing these numbers: 20 + 70 + 20.",
    "20 + 70 equals 90.",
    "90 + 20 equals 110."

  "solution": "110"
