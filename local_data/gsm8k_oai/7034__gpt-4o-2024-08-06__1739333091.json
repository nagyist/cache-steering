  "query": "Emily goes fishing and has a very busy day. She catches 4 trout, 3 catfish, and 5 bluegills. If the trout weigh 2 pounds each, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and the bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, how many total pounds of fish did she catch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total weight of the trout Emily caught.",
    "Emily caught 4 trout, and each trout weighs 2 pounds.",
    "To find the total weight of the trout, I multiply the number of trout (4) by the weight of each trout (2 pounds).",
    "4 trout * 2 pounds/trout = 8 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total weight of the catfish.",
    "Emily caught 3 catfish, and each catfish weighs 1.5 pounds.",
    "To find the total weight of the catfish, I multiply the number of catfish (3) by the weight of each catfish (1.5 pounds).",
    "3 catfish * 1.5 pounds/catfish = 4.5 pounds.",
    "Now, I need to determine the total weight of the bluegills.",
    "Emily caught 5 bluegills, and each bluegill weighs 2.5 pounds.",
    "To find the total weight of the bluegills, I multiply the number of bluegills (5) by the weight of each bluegill (2.5 pounds).",
    "5 bluegills * 2.5 pounds/bluegill = 12.5 pounds.",
    "Finally, I add up the total weights of all the fish to find the overall total weight.",
    "Total weight = weight of trout + weight of catfish + weight of bluegills = 8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds.",
    "8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds."
