  "query": "A mother is serving pizza at her son's birthday party.  After buying 5 pizzas, she must decide how many slices to divide each pizza into so that everyone at the party ends up with an equal number of slices.  There are a total of 20 children at the party, and she can choose to divide each pizza into either 6, 8, or 10 slices.  Assuming she does not want to throw away any pizza, how should many slices should she choose to divide the pizzas into to make sure everyone receives an equal amount?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of slices needed so that the 20 children each receive the same number of slices.",
    "She has 5 pizzas and can cut each into 6, 8, or 10 slices, so I should calculate the total slices for each option.",
    "If each pizza is divided into 6 slices, then 5 pizzas will give 5 * 6 = 30 slices.",
    "If each pizza is divided into 8 slices, then 5 pizzas will give 5 * 8 = 40 slices.",
    "If each pizza is divided into 10 slices, then 5 pizzas will give 5 * 10 = 50 slices.",
    "I need to see if any of these total slice amounts can be evenly divided among 20 children.",
    "30 slices divided by 20 children equals 1.5 slices per child, which is not an integer.",
    "40 slices divided by 20 children equals 2 slices per child, which is an integer.",
    "50 slices divided by 20 children equals 2.5 slices per child, which is not an integer.",
    "The only option that allows equal distribution without wasting slices is 40 slices total, which corresponds to cutting each pizza into 8 slices."

  "solution": "8"
