  "query": "Allison went to the craft store with her friend Marie to buy some glue sticks and construction paper. Allison bought 8 more glue sticks than Marie, but Marie bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison. If Marie bought 15 glue sticks and 30 packs of construction paper how many craft supply items did Allison buy all together?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many glue sticks Allison bought.",
    "It is given that Allison bought 8 more glue sticks than Marie.",
    "Marie bought 15 glue sticks.",
    "Allison bought 15 + 8 = 23 glue sticks.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many packs of construction paper Allison bought.",
    "Marie bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison.",
    "Marie bought 30 packs of construction paper.",
    "If Marie bought six times as many, then Allison bought 30 / 6 = 5 packs of construction paper.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of craft supply items Allison bought.",
    "Allison bought 23 glue sticks and 5 packs of construction paper.",
    "The total number of craft supply items Allison bought is 23 + 5 = 28."
