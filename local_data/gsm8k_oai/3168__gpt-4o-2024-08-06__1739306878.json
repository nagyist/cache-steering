  "query": "As soon as you enter the taxi, you pay a ride fee of $2. Michelle rode a taxi from her office to her home, which constitutes 4 miles. If the taxi charge per mile is $2.5, how much did pay Michelle pay in total for her ride?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the base fee for the taxi ride, which is given as $2.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost for the distance traveled. Michelle rode for 4 miles and the charge per mile is $2.5.",
    "To calculate the distance cost, I multiply the number of miles (4) by the cost per mile ($2.5).",
    "4 miles * $2.5/mile = $10. This is the cost for the 4-mile distance traveled.",
    "Now, I add the base fee of $2 to the distance cost of $10 to find the total cost.",
    "$2 (base fee) + $10 (distance cost) = $12."

  "solution": "12"
