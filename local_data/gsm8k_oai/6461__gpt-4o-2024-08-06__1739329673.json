    "\\( \\frac{3}{8} \\times 200 = 75 \\). So, he gave $75 to his mother.",

    "\\( \\frac{3}{10} \\times 200 = 60 \\). So, he gave $60 to his father.",
    "To find out how much John has left, we need to subtract the total amount he gave away from his initial amount.",
    "First, we find the total amount given away: \\( 75 + 60 = 135 \\).",
    "Now, subtract the total amount given away from the initial amount: \\( 200 - 135 \\).",
    "\\( 200 - 135 = 65 \\)."
