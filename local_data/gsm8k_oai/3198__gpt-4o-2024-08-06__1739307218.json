  "query": "In a spelling contest held in her school, Drew got 20 questions correct, winning her the competition. She got six questions wrong, and her competitor Carla got 14 questions correct, and twice as many questions wrong as the number of questions Drew got wrong. If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will determine the total number of questions asked to Drew.",
    "Drew got 20 questions correct and 6 questions wrong.",
    "Therefore, the total number of questions asked to Drew is 20 + 6 = 26.",
    "Next, I will determine the total number of questions asked to Carla.",
    "Carla got 14 questions correct.",
    "Carla got twice as many questions wrong as the number Drew got wrong.",
    "Drew got 6 questions wrong, so Carla got 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong.",
    "Therefore, the total number of questions asked to Carla is 14 + 12 = 26.",
    "Since each competitor was asked different questions, the total number of questions asked in the competition is the sum of questions asked to Drew and Carla.",
    "Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the competition is 26 + 26 = 52."

  "solution": "52"
