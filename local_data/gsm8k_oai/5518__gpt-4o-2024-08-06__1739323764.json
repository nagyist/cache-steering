  "query": "Aaron has some brothers. Bennett has 6 brothers. If the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers, what is the number of Aaron's brothers?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of Aaron's brothers be represented by the variable A.",
    "According to the problem, Bennett has 6 brothers.",
    "Bennett's number of brothers is given to be two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers.",
    "This relationship can be expressed with the equation: 6 = 2A - 2.",
    "Now, solve for A. Start by adding 2 to both sides of the equation: 6 + 2 = 2A.",
    "This simplifies to 8 = 2A.",
    "To find A, divide both sides of the equation by 2. Thus, A = 8 \u00f7 2.",
    "Perform the division: A = 4."
