  "query": "James gets 3 parking tickets.  The first 2 cost $150 each and the third cost 1/3 as much as one of these.  His roommate agrees to pay half the cost.  How much money does he have left if he had $500 in the bank?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the cost of the first two parking tickets.",
    "Each of the first two parking tickets costs $150.",
    "The cost for the first two tickets combined is 2 * $150.",
    "2 * $150 = $300.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the third parking ticket.",
    "The third ticket costs 1/3 as much as one of the first two tickets.",
    "1/3 of $150 is calculated as follows: $150 / 3.",
    "$150 / 3 = $50.",
    "Now, I will find the total cost of all three parking tickets.",
    "The total cost is the sum of the first two tickets and the third ticket: $300 + $50.",
    "$300 + $50 = $350.",
    "James' roommate agreed to pay half of this total cost.",
    "Half of the total cost $350 is: $350 / 2.",
    "$350 / 2 = $175.",
    "James is responsible for paying the other half of the total, which is also $175.",
    "James initially had $500 in the bank.",
    "I will subtract the amount James is responsible for paying from his initial amount: $500 - $175.",
    "$500 - $175 = $325."

  "solution": "325"
