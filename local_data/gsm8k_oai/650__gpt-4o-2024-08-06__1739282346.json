  "query": "Josh had 100 gummy bear candies. He decided to give his 3 siblings 10 candies each. Then he gave half of the remaining candies to his best friend. If he only wants to eat 16 gummy bear candies, how many candies are left to be shared with others?",
  "steps": [
    "Josh started with 100 gummy bear candies.",
    "He gave 10 candies each to 3 siblings, which is a total of 3 x 10 = 30 candies.",
    "Subtracting the 30 candies given to his siblings from his initial 100 candies, Josh has 100 - 30 = 70 candies left.",
    "He then gave half of these remaining candies to his best friend. Half of 70 candies is 70 / 2 = 35 candies.",
    "After giving candies to his best friend, Josh has 70 - 35 = 35 candies left.",
    "Josh wants to eat 16 gummy bear candies himself.",
    "If Josh eats 16 candies, the number of candies left is 35 - 16 = 19 candies."
