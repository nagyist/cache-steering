  "query": "Bert's golden retriever has grown tremendously since it was a puppy.  At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds, but doubled in weight by week 9.  It doubled in weight again at 3 months old, and doubled again at 5 months old.  Finally, the dog reached its final adult weight by adding another 30 pounds by the time it was one year old.  What is the dog's full adult weight, in pounds?",
  "steps": [
    "The puppy weighed 6 pounds at 7 weeks old.",
    "At 9 weeks old, the puppy doubled in weight from 6 pounds. Doubling means multiplying by 2.",
    "6 pounds * 2 = 12 pounds. So, at 9 weeks old, the puppy weighed 12 pounds.",
    "At 3 months old, the puppy doubled its weight again. 3 months is approximately 12 weeks.",
    "12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds. So, at 3 months old, the puppy weighed 24 pounds.",
    "At 5 months old, the puppy doubled its weight again. 5 months is approximately 20 weeks.",
    "24 pounds * 2 = 48 pounds. So, at 5 months old, the puppy weighed 48 pounds.",
    "Finally, by the time the dog was one year old, it added another 30 pounds to its weight.",
    "48 pounds + 30 pounds = 78 pounds. So, the dog's full adult weight is 78 pounds."

  "solution": "78"
