  "query": "Martha met Ellen in the grocery store alone and asked her age. Martha realized she was twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. If Ellen is 10 years old now, calculate Martha's age now.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Ellen will be in six years.",
    "Ellen is currently 10 years old.",
    "In six years, Ellen will be 10 + 6 = 16 years old.",
    "Martha realized she was twice as old as Ellen will be in six years.",
    "Twice Ellen's age in six years is 2 \u00d7 16 = 32.",
    "So, Martha is currently 32 years old."

  "solution": "32"
