  "steps": [
    "Let's start by finding out how many dolls Sophie has. Since Sophie has twice as many dolls as Vera, and Vera has 20 dolls, we calculate: 2 * 20 = 40.",
    "Now, we need to determine how many dolls Aida has. Aida has twice as many dolls as Sophie. Since Sophie has 40 dolls, we calculate: 2 * 40 = 80.",
    "We know that Vera has 20 dolls, Sophie has 40 dolls, and Aida has 80 dolls.",
    "To find the total number of dolls, we add the number of dolls each person has: 20 (Vera) + 40 (Sophie) + 80 (Aida).",
    "Calculating the sum: 20 + 40 = 60, and then 60 + 80 = 140."
