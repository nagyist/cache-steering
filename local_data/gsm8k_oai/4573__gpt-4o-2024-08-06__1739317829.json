  "steps": [
    "The ratio of boys to girls is given as 3:5.",
    "This means for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls.",
    "Let's express the number of boys as 3x and the number of girls as 5x, where x is a common factor.",
    "According to the problem, there are 4 more girls than boys.",
    "So, we can write the equation: 5x = 3x + 4.",
    "Subtract 3x from both sides to solve for x: 5x - 3x = 4.",
    "This simplifies to: 2x = 4.",
    "Divide both sides by 2 to isolate x: x = 2.",
    "Now that we have x = 2, we can find the number of boys by substituting back into 3x: number of boys = 3 * 2 = 6.",
    "Similarly, substitute back into 5x to find the number of girls: number of girls = 5 * 2 = 10.",
    "The total number of students in the classroom is the sum of boys and girls: 6 + 10."
