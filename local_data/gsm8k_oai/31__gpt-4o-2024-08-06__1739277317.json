  "query": "Noah is a painter. He paints pictures and sells them at the park. He charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting. Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Noah earned from his paintings last month.",
    "He sold eight large paintings at $60 each.",
    "The income from large paintings last month is \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) dollars.",
    "He also sold four small paintings at $30 each.",
    "The income from small paintings last month is \\(4 \\times 30 = 120\\) dollars.",
    "The total sales last month are obtained by adding the income from large and small paintings.",
    "Total sales last month is \\(480 + 120 = 600\\) dollars.",
    "Noah sold twice as much this month compared to last month.",
    "Thus, total sales for this month would be twice the total sales of last month.",
    "Total sales this month is \\(600 \\times 2 = 1200\\) dollars."
