  "query": "Janet works as an exterminator and she also sells molten metal casts of fire ant nests on the Internet. Janet gets paid $70 an hour for exterminator work and makes $20/pound on her ant nest sculptures. If she does 20 hours of exterminator work and sells a 5-pound sculpture and a 7-pound sculpture, how much money does she make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Janet earns from her exterminator work.",
    "She works as an exterminator for 20 hours.",
    "Janet gets paid $70 per hour for exterminator work.",
    "She will earn 20 hours * $70/hour = $1400 from her exterminator work.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how much Janet earns from selling molten metal casts of fire ant nests.",
    "Janet sells a 5-pound sculpture and a 7-pound sculpture.",
    "She makes $20 per pound on her ant nest sculptures.",
    "The total weight of the sculptures sold is 5 pounds + 7 pounds = 12 pounds.",
    "The earnings from the sculptures is 12 pounds * $20/pound = $240.",
    "Now, I will add the earnings from both her exterminator work and sculpture sales to find the total amount of money she makes.",
    "The total earnings are $1400 (exterminator work) + $240 (sculpture sales) = $1640."

  "solution": "1640"
