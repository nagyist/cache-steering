  "query": "To keep himself busy in class, Michael makes rubber-band balls. He makes two sizes, large and small. A small ball uses 50 rubber bands. A large ball requires 300 rubber bands. Michael brought a 5,000 pack to class and already made 22 small balls. How many large balls can he make with the remaining rubber bands?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many rubber bands Michael has used to make the small balls.",
    "Michael made 22 small balls. Each small ball uses 50 rubber bands.",
    "I will calculate the total number of rubber bands used for the small balls: 22 small balls * 50 rubber bands/ball = 1,100 rubber bands.",
    "Now, I should determine how many rubber bands are remaining.",
    "Michael started with a 5,000 pack of rubber bands. He used 1,100 for the small balls.",
    "To find the remaining rubber bands: 5,000 - 1,100 = 3,900 rubber bands are left.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many large balls Michael can make with the remaining rubber bands.",
    "Each large ball requires 300 rubber bands.",
    "I will calculate the number of large balls Michael can make: 3,900 rubber bands / 300 rubber bands/large ball = 13 large balls.",
    "The division results in a whole number, so there's no need for adjustments."

  "solution": "13"
