  "query": "In her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.",
    "Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Therefore, Governor Hawkins gave half the number that Governor Sandoval did.",
    "To find the number of addresses Governor Hawkins gave, I need to divide the number given by Governor Sandoval by 2.",
    "12 divided by 2 is 6. So Governor Hawkins gave 6 commencement addresses.",
    "Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval.",
    "If Governor Sandoval gave 12 addresses, then Governor Sloan gave 12 plus 10 addresses.",
    "12 plus 10 equals 22. So Governor Sloan gave 22 commencement addresses.",
    "Now, to find the total number of commencement addresses given by all three governors, I need to add the numbers from each governor.",
    "Governor Hawkins gave 6, Governor Sandoval gave 12, and Governor Sloan gave 22.",
    "Adding these together, 6 plus 12 plus 22 equals 40."

  "solution": "40"
