  "query": "Quinn catches twice the amount of frogs as Alster who caught 2.  Bret catches three times the amount of frogs as Quinn.  How many frogs did Bret catch?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many frogs Alster caught. We are given that Alster caught 2 frogs.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many frogs Quinn caught. It's stated that Quinn catches twice the amount of frogs as Alster.",
    "Since Alster caught 2 frogs, I need to multiply this by 2 to find out how many frogs Quinn caught.",
    "2 frogs (Alster) * 2 = 4 frogs. So, Quinn caught 4 frogs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many frogs Bret caught. Bret catches three times the amount of frogs as Quinn.",
    "Since Quinn caught 4 frogs, I need to multiply this by 3 to determine how many frogs Bret caught.",
    "4 frogs (Quinn) * 3 = 12 frogs. So, Bret caught 12 frogs."
