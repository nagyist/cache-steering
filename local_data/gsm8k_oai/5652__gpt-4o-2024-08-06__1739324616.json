  "query": "A mathematician is working on two projects. He has one week to write 518 maths questions for one project and 476 questions for another project. If he completes the same number of questions every day, how many should he aim to complete each day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of questions the mathematician needs to complete for both projects.",
    "For the first project, he needs to write 518 questions.",
    "For the second project, he needs to write 476 questions.",
    "To find the total number of questions, I add the questions for both projects together.",
    "518 + 476 = 994",
    "The mathematician has one week to complete these questions. Typically, a week has 7 days.",
    "To find out how many questions he should complete each day, I divide the total number of questions by the number of days in the week.",
    "994 \u00f7 7 = 142",
    "I've calculated the number of questions he should complete each day to be 142."
