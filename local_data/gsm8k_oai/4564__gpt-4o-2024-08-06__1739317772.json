  "query": "Fiona and Casey share the hoodies they own. Between the two of them, they own eight hoodies. Casey owns two more than Fiona. How many hoodies does Fiona own?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number of hoodies Fiona owns as F.",
    "According to the problem, Casey owns 2 more hoodies than Fiona, so we can express the number of hoodies Casey owns as F + 2.",
    "Together, they own a total of 8 hoodies. Therefore, the sum of the hoodies owned by both Fiona and Casey is F + (F + 2) = 8.",
    "Simplifying the expression, we get 2F + 2 = 8.",
    "To solve for F, we first subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms with F. That gives us 2F = 6.",
    "Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for F, resulting in F = 3."
