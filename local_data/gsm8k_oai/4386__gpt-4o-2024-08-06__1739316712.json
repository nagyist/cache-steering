  "query": "Jolene wants to raise some money to buy a bicycle.  She babysits for 4 families for $30 each.  She also washes 5 neighbors\u2019 cars for $12 each.  How much did she raise so far?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much Jolene earns from babysitting.",
    "She babysits for 4 families, and each family pays her $30.",
    "I calculate her babysitting earnings by multiplying 4 families by $30 each.",
    "4 families * $30 per family = $120.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much she earns from washing cars.",
    "She washes 5 neighbors' cars, and each car earns her $12.",
    "I calculate her car washing earnings by multiplying 5 cars by $12 each.",
    "5 cars * $12 per car = $60.",
    "Now, I add the earnings from babysitting and car washing to find the total amount she raised.",
    "$120 (babysitting) + $60 (car washing) = $180."
