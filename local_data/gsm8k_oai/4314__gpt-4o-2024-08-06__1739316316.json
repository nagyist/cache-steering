  "query": "Carla needs to dry-clean 80 pieces of laundry by noon. If she starts work at 8 AM, how many pieces of laundry does she need to clean per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time Carla has to complete her task.",
    "Carla starts work at 8 AM and needs to finish by noon.",
    "The time from 8 AM to noon is 4 hours.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pieces of laundry Carla needs to clean per hour.",
    "Carla has 80 pieces of laundry to clean in total.",
    "I will divide the total number of pieces of laundry by the total number of hours to find the rate per hour.",
    "80 pieces of laundry \u00f7 4 hours = 20 pieces of laundry per hour.",
    "I have calculated the number correctly; Carla needs to clean 20 pieces each hour."
