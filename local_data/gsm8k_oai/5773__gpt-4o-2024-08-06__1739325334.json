  "query": "The Ravenswood forest has four times as many gnomes as the Westerville woods. If there are 20 gnomes in Westerville woods, how many gnomes would remain in Ravenswood forest if 40% of the gnomes are taken for use by the forest owner?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many gnomes are in Ravenswood forest initially.",
    "According to the problem, Ravenswood forest has four times as many gnomes as Westerville woods.",
    "There are 20 gnomes in Westerville woods.",
    "To find the number of gnomes in Ravenswood forest, I multiply the number of gnomes in Westerville woods by 4.",
    "So, 20 gnomes times 4 equals 80 gnomes in Ravenswood forest.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many gnomes would remain in Ravenswood forest if 40% of them are taken by the forest owner.",
    "To find 40% of the 80 gnomes, I calculate 0.4 times 80.",
    "0.4 times 80 is 32.",
    "This means 32 gnomes are taken by the forest owner.",
    "Finally, to find how many gnomes remain, I subtract the 32 gnomes taken from the original 80 gnomes.",
    "80 gnomes minus 32 gnomes equals 48 gnomes."

  "solution": "48"
