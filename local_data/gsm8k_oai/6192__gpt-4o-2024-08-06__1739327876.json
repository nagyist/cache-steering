  "query": "Greg and Sarah have 18 apples that they are going to split evenly. Susan has twice as many apples as Greg will end up with. Mark has 5 fewer apples than Susan. Their mom needs 40 apples to make an apple pie. How many will she have left over?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many apples Greg and Sarah will each get.",
    "Greg and Sarah have 18 apples in total to split evenly.",
    "18 divided by 2 is 9, so Greg will get 9 apples and Sarah will get 9 apples.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many apples Susan has.",
    "Susan has twice as many apples as Greg, who has 9 apples.",
    "Twice 9 is 18, so Susan has 18 apples.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many apples Mark has.",
    "Mark has 5 fewer apples than Susan.",
    "Susan has 18 apples, so 18 minus 5 is 13.",
    "Mark has 13 apples.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of apples available for the pie.",
    "Greg has 9 apples, and Sarah has 9 apples.",
    "Susan has 18 apples, and Mark has 13 apples.",
    "Adding these together gives: 9 + 9 + 18 + 13.",
    "9 + 9 is 18.",
    "18 + 18 is 36.",
    "36 + 13 is 49.",
    "There are a total of 49 apples.",
    "Their mom needs 40 apples to make an apple pie.",
    "To find out how many apples will be left over, subtract 40 from the total 49.",
    "49 minus 40 is 9."
