  "query": "John buys a box of 40 light bulbs.  He uses 16 of them and then gives half of what is left to a friend.  How many does he have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know John starts with 40 light bulbs.",
    "John uses 16 light bulbs.",
    "To find out how many light bulbs he has left after using some, I subtract 16 from 40.",
    "40 - 16 = 24. So, John has 24 light bulbs left after using some.",
    "Next, John gives half of the remaining light bulbs to a friend.",
    "To find out half of the 24 light bulbs, I divide 24 by 2.",
    "24 / 2 = 12. John gives 12 light bulbs to his friend.",
    "I need to find out how many light bulbs John has left after giving some away.",
    "I subtract the 12 light bulbs he gave away from the 24 light bulbs he had.",
    "24 - 12 = 12."
