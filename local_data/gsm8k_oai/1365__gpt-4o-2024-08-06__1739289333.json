  "query": "A portable computer drive has enough kilobytes of storage space to store 2000 photos. Each photo is 1.5 kilobytes in size. How many 200-kilobyte videos can it store if it already has 400 photos on it?",
  "steps": [
    "The portable computer drive can store 2000 photos initially.",
    "Each photo is 1.5 kilobytes.",
    "To find the total kilobytes the drive can store, I multiply the number of photos by the size of each photo.",
    "2000 photos * 1.5 kilobytes/photo = 3000 kilobytes.",
    "The total storage capacity of the drive is 3000 kilobytes.",
    "The drive already has 400 photos on it.",
    "To find out how many kilobytes these 400 photos take up, I multiply the number of photos by the size of each photo.",
    "400 photos * 1.5 kilobytes/photo = 600 kilobytes.",
    "The remaining storage on the drive is the total capacity minus the storage used by the 400 photos.",
    "Remaining storage = 3000 kilobytes - 600 kilobytes = 2400 kilobytes.",
    "Every video is 200 kilobytes in size.",
    "To find out how many videos the remaining storage can accommodate, I divide the remaining storage by the size of each video.",
    "2400 kilobytes / 200 kilobytes/video = 12 videos."
