  "query": "On a farm, there are 2 cows, 3 pigs, and 6 goats. The farmer planned on adding 3 cows, 5 pigs, and 2 goats. How many animals will there be on the farm?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the initial number of cows on the farm. There are 2 cows already.",
    "The farmer plans to add 3 more cows.",
    "The total number of cows will be the initial 2 plus the 3 additional cows.",
    "Calculating: 2 + 3 = 5 cows.",
    "Next, I determine the initial number of pigs on the farm. There are 3 pigs.",
    "The farmer plans to add 5 more pigs.",
    "The total number of pigs will be 3 initial pigs plus 5 additional pigs.",
    "Calculating: 3 + 5 = 8 pigs.",
    "Now, I determine the initial number of goats on the farm. There are 6 goats.",
    "The farmer plans to add 2 more goats.",
    "The total number of goats will be 6 initial goats plus 2 additional goats.",
    "Calculating: 6 + 2 = 8 goats.",
    "To find the total number of animals on the farm, I add together all the cows, pigs, and goats.",
    "The total number of cows is 5.",
    "The total number of pigs is 8.",
    "The total number of goats is 8.",
    "Adding total cows, pigs, and goats: 5 + 8 + 8.",
    "Calculating: 5 + 8 = 13.",
    "Then, 13 + 8 = 21."
