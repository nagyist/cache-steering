  "query": "There are 20 students in the orchestra and twice that number in the band. There are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir. If each student only participates in one group, how many students, in total, are there in the orchestra, the band, and the choir?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will identify the number of students in each group.",
    "There are 20 students in the orchestra.",
    "The problem states that there are twice the number of students in the band compared to the orchestra.",
    "Twice 20 is 40, so there are 40 students in the band.",
    "Next, I will consider the number of students in the choir.",
    "The problem states there are 12 boys and 16 girls in the choir.",
    "12 boys plus 16 girls equals 28 students in the choir.",
    "Now, I will sum the number of students in all three groups to find the total.",
    "The total number of students is 20 (orchestra) + 40 (band) + 28 (choir).",
    "20 + 40 is 60, and 60 + 28 is 88."

  "solution": "88"
