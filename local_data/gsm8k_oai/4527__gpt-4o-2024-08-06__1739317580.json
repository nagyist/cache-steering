  "steps": [
    "Emma spent $58.",
    "Elsa spent twice as much as Emma.",
    "Twice $58 is $58 x 2 = $116.",
    "Therefore, Elsa spent $116.",
    "Elizabeth spent four times as much as Elsa.",
    "Four times $116 is $116 x 4 = $464.",
    "Therefore, Elizabeth spent $464.",
    "Now, I need to find the total amount of money spent by Elizabeth, Emma, and Elsa.",
    "Add the amounts: $58 (Emma) + $116 (Elsa) + $464 (Elizabeth).",
    "$58 + $116 = $174.",
    "$174 + $464 = $638."
