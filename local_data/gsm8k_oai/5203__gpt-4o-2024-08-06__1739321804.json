  "query": "Lucy is listening to her favorite album while jumping rope. She can jump the rope 1 time per second. If the album's songs are all 3.5 minutes long and there are 10 songs, how many times will she jump rope?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total length of the album in minutes.",
    "Each song is 3.5 minutes long, and there are 10 songs on the album.",
    "To find the total length, I multiply the number of songs by the length of each song: 10 songs * 3.5 minutes/song.",
    "10 * 3.5 equals 35 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to convert the total album length from minutes to seconds because Lucy jumps once per second.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I multiply 35 minutes by 60 seconds/minute.",
    "35 * 60 equals 2100 seconds.",
    "Since Lucy jumps once per second, the number of rope jumps equals the total number of seconds.",
    "Therefore, Lucy will jump rope 2100 times while listening to the album."
  ],
  "solution": "2100"
