  "query": "Jessica\u2019s class is going to a farm for a field trip. The school will bring all 35 students in the class plus 4 adult chaperones. The farm entrance fee for students costs $5 and $6 for adults. How much will the school pay for the farm entrance in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of people going on the trip. This includes both students and adult chaperones.",
    "There are 35 students in the class.",
    "There are 4 adult chaperones.",
    "Adding these together gives the total number of people: 35 students + 4 adults = 39 people.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total entrance fee for the students.",
    "The entrance fee for each student is $5.",
    "Therefore, the total entrance fee for all 35 students is 35 students * $5/student = $175.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total entrance fee for the adults.",
    "The entrance fee for each adult is $6.",
    "Therefore, the total entrance fee for all 4 adults is 4 adults * $6/adult = $24.",
    "To find the total entrance cost for the entire group, I need to add the cost for the students and the adults.",
    "Adding these together gives the total entrance fee: $175 (students) + $24 (adults) = $199."

  "solution": "199"
