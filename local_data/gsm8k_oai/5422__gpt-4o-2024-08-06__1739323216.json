  "steps": [
    "Let the three consecutive integers be represented as \\( n \\), \\( n+1 \\), and \\( n+2 \\).",
    "The sum of these three integers is given as 18, so we can write the equation: \\( n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 18 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( n + n + 1 + n + 2 = 18 \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 3n + 3 = 18 \\).",
    "Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( n \\): \\( 3n = 15 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( n \\): \\( n = 5 \\).",
    "The integers are \\( n = 5 \\), \\( n+1 = 6 \\), and \\( n+2 = 7 \\).",
    "The largest of these three numbers is \\( n+2 = 7 \\)."
