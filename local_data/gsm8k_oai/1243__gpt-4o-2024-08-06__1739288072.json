  "query": "A jet travels 580 miles in 2 hours. At this rate, how far could the jet fly in 10 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the rate at which the jet is traveling. Since the jet travels 580 miles in 2 hours, I can find the speed by dividing the distance by the time.",
    "580 miles divided by 2 hours equals 290 miles per hour. So, the jet's speed is 290 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how far the jet could fly in 10 hours at this constant speed.",
    "To find the distance, I need to multiply the speed by the time: 290 miles per hour multiplied by 10 hours.",
    "290 multiplied by 10 equals 2900."
  ],
  "solution": "2900"
