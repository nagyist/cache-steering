    "First, I want to determine how many chairs 1 carpenter can make in 10 days.",
    "8 carpenters can make 50 chairs in 10 days, so 1 carpenter can make 50 / 8 = 6.25 chairs in 10 days.",
    "Next, I want to determine how many carpenters are needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days.",
    "If 1 carpenter can make 6.25 chairs in 10 days, then I need 75 / 6.25 carpenters to make 75 chairs.",
