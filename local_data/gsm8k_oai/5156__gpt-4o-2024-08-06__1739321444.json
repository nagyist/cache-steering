  "query": "A man used to have 39 cows but last year 25 of them died and he sold 6 of them. This year the number of the cows increased by 24 and the man bought 43 more. His friend gave him 8 cows as a gift. How many cows does the man have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, the man had 39 cows.",
    "Last year, 25 cows died.",
    "Therefore, the man had 39 - 25 = 14 cows after the deaths.",
    "He also sold 6 cows last year.",
    "After selling 6 cows, the number of cows left was 14 - 6 = 8 cows.",
    "This year, the number of cows increased by 24.",
    "After the increase, the man had 8 + 24 = 32 cows.",
    "The man bought 43 more cows.",
    "After buying, the total number of cows was 32 + 43 = 75 cows.",
    "His friend gave him 8 cows as a gift.",
    "With the gifted cows, the man now has 75 + 8 = 83 cows."
