  "query": "Carson is refilling his tires. Each tire can hold 500 cubic inches of air. Two of the tires are completely flat and empty. One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. If Carson injects 50 cubic inches of air with each pump, how many pumps will it take him to fill all the tires?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much air is needed to fill each tire to capacity.",
    "Two tires are completely flat, needing 500 cubic inches each to be full.",
    "Another tire is 40% full, so it has 0.40 * 500 = 200 cubic inches of air already.",
    "Thus, 500 - 200 = 300 cubic inches are needed to fill this tire.",
    "The last tire is 70% full, so it has 0.70 * 500 = 350 cubic inches of air already.",
    "Thus, 500 - 350 = 150 cubic inches are needed to fill this tire.",
    "Now, I sum up the amount of air needed for all four tires: 500 + 500 + 300 + 150 = 1450 cubic inches.",
    "Each pump injects 50 cubic inches of air.",
    "Now, I determine how many 50 cubic inch pumps are needed to fill 1450 cubic inches: 1450 / 50 = 29 pumps."

  "solution": "29"
