  "query": "Yanna baked twenty butter cookies and forty biscuits in the morning.  In the afternoon, she baked ten butter cookies and twenty biscuits. How many more biscuits did she bake than butter cookies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many butter cookies Yanna baked in total.",
    "Yanna baked twenty butter cookies in the morning.",
    "She then baked ten butter cookies in the afternoon.",
    "So, in total, Yanna baked 20 + 10 = 30 butter cookies.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many biscuits Yanna baked in total.",
    "Yanna baked forty biscuits in the morning.",
    "She then baked twenty biscuits in the afternoon.",
    "So, in total, Yanna baked 40 + 20 = 60 biscuits.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more biscuits Yanna baked than butter cookies.",
    "I subtract the total number of butter cookies from the total number of biscuits: 60 - 30.",
    "This calculation gives 30."
