  "query": "Aunt Gemma has four dogs. She feeds them with dog food twice a day. Each dog can consume 250 grams of food per meal. If aunt Gemma bought 2 sacks of dog food, each weighing 50 kilograms, how many days will those food last?",
  "steps": [
    "Aunt Gemma has four dogs.",
    "Each dog consumes 250 grams of food per meal.",
    "There are two meals each day.",
    "Therefore, each dog consumes 250 grams/meal * 2 meals/day = 500 grams per day.",
    "All four dogs together consume 500 grams/day/dog * 4 dogs = 2000 grams or 2 kilograms per day.",
    "Aunt Gemma bought 2 sacks of dog food, each weighing 50 kilograms.",
    "Total weight of the dog food is 2 sacks * 50 kilograms/sack = 100 kilograms.",
    "To find out how many days the dog food will last, we divide the total weight of the food by the daily consumption by all dogs.",
    "The total number of days the food will last is 100 kilograms / 2 kilograms per day = 50 days."
