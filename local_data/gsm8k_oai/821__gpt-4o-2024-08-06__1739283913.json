    "I need to find out how many pickle slices Tammy can eat if Sammy can eat 15 slices.",
    "Tammy can eat twice as much as Sammy.",
    "Twice 15 is \\( 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\).",
    "So, Tammy can eat 30 pickle slices.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pickle slices Ron eats.",
    "Ron eats 20% fewer pickle slices than Tammy.",
    "20% of 30 is \\( 30 \\times 0.20 = 6 \\).",
    "To find how many slices Ron eats, I subtract this 6 from Tammy's 30.",
