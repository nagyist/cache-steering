  "query": "A fisherman catches 3 types of fish in his net.  There are 32 bass, 1/4 as many trout as bass, and double the number of blue gill as bass.  How many fish did the fisherman catch total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of trout.",
    "The number of trout is 1/4 the number of bass.",
    "There are 32 bass.",
    "1/4 of 32 is 32 / 4.",
    "32 divided by 4 equals 8.",
    "So, the fisherman caught 8 trout.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of blue gill.",
    "The number of blue gill is double the number of bass.",
    "There are 32 bass.",
    "Double 32 is 32 * 2.",
    "32 times 2 equals 64.",
    "So, the fisherman caught 64 blue gill.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of fish.",
    "The fisherman caught 32 bass, 8 trout, and 64 blue gill.",
    "I will add these numbers together: 32 + 8 + 64.",
    "32 plus 8 equals 40.",
    "40 plus 64 equals 104.",
    "So, the fisherman caught a total of 104 fish."

  "solution": "104"
