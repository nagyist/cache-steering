  "query": "If Aang caught 7 fish, then Sokka caught 5 fish, and then Toph caught 12 fish, what is the average amount of fish that each person caught?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of fish caught by all three people (Aang, Sokka, and Toph).",
    "Aang caught 7 fish, Sokka caught 5 fish, and Toph caught 12 fish.",
    "To find the total number of fish, I add these numbers together: 7 + 5 + 12.",
    "Calculating the sum gives me 24.",
    "Now I know the total number of fish caught is 24.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many people are sharing these fish. There are three people: Aang, Sokka, and Toph.",
    "To find the average, I divide the total number of fish by the number of people: 24 \u00f7 3.",
    "Calculating this division gives me 8.",
    "Thus, the average amount of fish caught by each person is 8."
