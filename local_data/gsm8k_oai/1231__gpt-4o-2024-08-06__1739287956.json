  "query": "Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?",
  "steps": [
    "The first spacecraft traveled 448 miles in 30 minutes.",
    "To find the speed of the first spacecraft, I need to convert 30 minutes into hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.",
    "Speed is distance divided by time, so the speed of the first spacecraft is 448 miles divided by 0.5 hours.",
    "448 divided by 0.5 is 896. So, the first spacecraft traveled at 896 miles per hour.",
    "The second spacecraft traveled the same 448 miles in 60 minutes.",
    "I need to convert 60 minutes into hours. 60 minutes is 1 hour.",
    "The speed of the second spacecraft is 448 miles divided by 1 hour.",
    "448 divided by 1 is 448. So, the second spacecraft traveled at 448 miles per hour.",
    "I need to find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft.",
    "The difference in speed is 896 miles per hour minus 448 miles per hour.",
    "896 minus 448 is 448."

  "solution": "448"
