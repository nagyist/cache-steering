  "query": "You draw a rectangle that is 7 inches wide. It is 4 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the rectangle?",
  "steps": [
    "I start by identifying the width of the rectangle given in the problem, which is 7 inches.",
    "The problem states that the rectangle is 4 times as long as it is wide.",
    "To find the length, I need to multiply the width by 4.",
    "So, I calculate the length as 7 inches * 4 = 28 inches.",
    "Now, I have both the width and the length of the rectangle: 7 inches wide and 28 inches long.",
    "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the width by the length.",
    "I calculate the area as 7 inches * 28 inches.",
    "To calculate this, I perform the multiplication: 7 * 28 = 196.",
    "I have now calculated the area of the rectangle."
  ],
  "solution": "196"
