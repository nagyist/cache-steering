  "query": "Peter and Andrew like to run in the morning.  Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles.  After 5 days, how many miles have they both run?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many miles Peter runs in a day.",
    "Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles.",
    "Therefore, Peter runs 2 miles + 3 miles = 5 miles in a day.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many miles Andrew runs in 5 days.",
    "Andrew runs 2 miles per day.",
    "In 5 days, Andrew runs 2 miles/day * 5 days = 10 miles.",
    "Next, I calculate how many miles Peter runs in 5 days.",
    "Peter runs 5 miles per day.",
    "In 5 days, Peter runs 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles.",
    "Now, I add the miles run by Peter and Andrew together to find the total.",
    "Total miles = Peter's miles + Andrew's miles = 25 miles + 10 miles = 35 miles."

  "solution": "35"
