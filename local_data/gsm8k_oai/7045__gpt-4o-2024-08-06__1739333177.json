  "query": "Jackson wants to go on a shopping spree, so his mom says she will give him some spending money if he does extra chores. She promises $5 per hour spent on chores.  Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and decides to do this twice. He also spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, and three times as long cleaning the bathroom.  How much spending money has Jackson earned?",
  "steps": [
    "Jackson earns $5 for each hour spent on chores.",
    "Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming.",
    "Jackson decides to do vacuuming twice, so in total he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours vacuuming.",
    "Jackson spends 0.5 hours washing dishes.",
    "Jackson spends three times as long cleaning the bathroom as he spends washing dishes.",
    "Three times 0.5 hours is 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours cleaning the bathroom.",
    "Now I add up all the hours Jackson worked: 4 hours vacuuming + 0.5 hours washing dishes + 1.5 hours cleaning the bathroom = 6 hours total.",
    "Jackson earns $5 for each of these 6 hours.",
    "So I multiply the total hours by the hourly rate: 6 * $5 = $30.",
    "I have calculated that Jackson has earned $30 doing chores."

  "solution": "30"
