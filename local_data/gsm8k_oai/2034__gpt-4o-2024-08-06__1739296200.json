  "query": "Luke is planning a trip to London and wants to see how long it will take him to travel there. He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke\u2019s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long each part of Luke's trip takes, except for the bus ride.",
    "Luke walks for 15 minutes to the train center.",
    "He waits twice as long as the 15-minute walk for the train to arrive. So, the waiting time is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.",
    "The train ride takes 6 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the train ride lasts 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.",
    "Now, I add the time taken for walking, waiting, and the train ride to get a total for these parts of the journey.",
    "Walking time: 15 minutes",
    "Waiting time: 30 minutes",
    "Train ride time: 360 minutes",
    "Total time for walking, waiting, and the train ride is 15 + 30 + 360 = 405 minutes.",
    "Luke\u2019s entire trip takes 8 hours, and in minutes, that is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.",
    "The bus ride time is the total trip time minus the sum of the walking, waiting, and train ride times.",
    "Bus ride time = Total trip time - (Walking time + Waiting time + Train ride time)",
    "Bus ride time = 480 - 405 = 75 minutes"
  ],
  "solution": "75"
