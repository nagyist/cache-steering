  "query": "James drives to Canada at 60 mph.  It is a distance of 360 miles.  He has a 1 hour stop along the way.  How long does he take to get to Canada?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes James to drive 360 miles at a speed of 60 mph.",
    "To find the time it takes to drive 360 miles, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "The distance is 360 miles, and the speed is 60 mph.",
    "So the time to drive is 360 miles / 60 mph.",
    "360 divided by 60 is 6.",
    "James spends 6 hours driving.",
    "James has a 1 hour stop along the way.",
    "The total time James takes is the time driving plus the stop time.",
    "6 hours (driving) + 1 hour (stop) = 7 hours in total."

  "solution": "7"
