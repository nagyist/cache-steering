  "query": "Ines had $20 in her purse. She bought 3 pounds of peaches, which are $2 per pound at the local farmers\u2019 market. How much did she have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Ines started with $20 in her purse.",
    "She bought 3 pounds of peaches.",
    "Peaches are $2 per pound.",
    "To find the cost of the peaches, multiply the number of pounds by the price per pound: 3 pounds * $2 per pound.",
    "3 * 2 equals $6, so the peaches cost $6.",
    "Subtract the cost of the peaches from the original amount Ines had: $20 - $6.",
    "$20 - $6 equals $14."

  "solution": "14"
