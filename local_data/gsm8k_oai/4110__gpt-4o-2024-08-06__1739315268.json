  "query": "Michael buys his suit for $430 and shoes for $190. So, if he gets a $100 discount, what was the amount that he paid to the seller?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total cost of the suit and shoes before any discounts.",
    "The cost of the suit is $430.",
    "The cost of the shoes is $190.",
    "To find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the suit and shoes together.",
    "$430 (suit) + $190 (shoes) = $620 is the total cost before the discount.",
    "Michael receives a $100 discount.",
    "To find the final amount Michael paid, subtract the discount from the total cost.",
    "$620 (total cost) - $100 (discount) = $520 is the amount Michael paid."
