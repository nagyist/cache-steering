  "query": "A floral shop had a three day sale on rose bouquets. On Monday, they sold 12 bouquets. On Tuesday, they sold three times that many bouquets. On Wednesday it rained all day and they only sold a third of what they did the day before. How many bouquets did they sell during the three day sale?",
  "steps": [
    "The floral shop sold 12 bouquets on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, they sold three times the number of bouquets they sold on Monday.",
    "Three times 12 is 36. Therefore, they sold 36 bouquets on Tuesday.",
    "On Wednesday, they sold a third of the number of bouquets they sold on Tuesday.",
    "A third of 36 is 12. Therefore, they sold 12 bouquets on Wednesday.",
    "Now, to find the total number of bouquets sold during the three-day sale, I add the bouquets sold on each day.",
    "On Monday, they sold 12; on Tuesday, they sold 36; and on Wednesday, 12.",
    "12 + 36 + 12 = 60."
