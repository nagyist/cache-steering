  "query": "Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day and 5 betta fish who each eat 7 guppies a day. How many guppies per day does she need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many guppies the moray eel eats per day.",
    "The moray eel eats 20 guppies a day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many guppies the betta fish eat per day.",
    "There are 5 betta fish, and each eats 7 guppies a day.",
    "To find the total number of guppies the betta fish eat, I multiply the number of betta fish by the number of guppies each one eats: 5 * 7 = 35.",
    "The betta fish eat a total of 35 guppies per day.",
    "Now, I add the number of guppies the moray eel eats to the number the betta fish eat: 20 (moray eel) + 35 (betta fish) = 55.",
    "Jason needs to buy 55 guppies per day to feed both the moray eel and the betta fish."
