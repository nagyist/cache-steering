  "query": "Phil and Andre decide to order some pizza. They get a small cheese and a large pepperoni. The small pizza has 8 slices, The large has 14 slices. They have both eaten 9 slices already. How many pieces are left per person?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total slices of pizza they started with.",
    "The small pizza has 8 slices, and the large pizza has 14 slices.",
    "Adding these together, 8 slices + 14 slices = 22 slices in total.",
    "I now know they started with 22 slices of pizza.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many slices Phil and Andre have eaten.",
    "They have both eaten 9 slices already.",
    "This means together they have eaten 9 + 9 = 18 slices.",
    "Now, to find out how many slices are left, I subtract the number of slices they've eaten from the total slices.",
    "22 total slices - 18 slices eaten = 4 slices left.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many pieces are left per person.",
    "I divide the 4 remaining slices by the 2 people, Phil and Andre.",
    "4 slices \u00f7 2 people = 2 slices per person."
