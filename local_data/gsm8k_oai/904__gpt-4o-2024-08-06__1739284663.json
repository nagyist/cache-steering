  "query": "Audrey's key lime pie calls for 1/4 cup of key lime juice but she likes to double this amount to make it extra tart.  Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice.  There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup.  How many key limes does Audrey need?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much key lime juice Audrey uses for her tart pie.",
    "The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of key lime juice. Audrey doubles the amount.",
    "To double 1/4 cup, I calculate 2 * 1/4 cup, which equals 1/2 cup.",
    "Now, I convert the 1/2 cup of key lime juice into tablespoons since each key lime yields juice in tablespoons.",
    "There are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup.",
    "Since we need 1/2 cup, I calculate 1/2 of 16 tablespoons.",
    "1/2 of 16 tablespoons is 8 tablespoons.",
    "Audrey needs 8 tablespoons of key lime juice for her extra tart pie.",
    "Each key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice.",
    "To find the number of key limes needed, I divide the total tablespoons of juice by the juice per key lime.",
    "8 tablespoons divided by 1 tablespoon per key lime equals 8 key limes."
