  "query": "To get clean, Michael takes a bath twice a week and a shower once a week. How many total times does he clean himself in 52 weeks, which is about one year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many times Michael takes a bath in one week.",
    "Michael takes a bath twice each week.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many times Michael takes a shower in one week.",
    "Michael takes a shower once each week.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of times Michael cleans himself each week by adding the number of baths and showers.",
    "Michael takes 2 baths + 1 shower = 3 times he cleans himself each week.",
    "Next, I should find out how many weeks are in a year.",
    "There are 52 weeks in a year.",
    "To find the total number of times Michael cleans himself in a year, I need to multiply the number of times he cleans himself each week by the number of weeks in a year.",
    "3 times per week x 52 weeks = 156 times in a year."

  "solution": "156"
