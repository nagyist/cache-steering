  "query": "A boy squirrel gathers 6 walnuts and carries them to his burrow in the tree, adding to the 12 already there, and dropping 1 on the way. The girl squirrel brings 5 more walnuts to their burrow and eats 2.  How many walnuts are left?",
  "steps": [
    "The boy squirrel gathers 6 walnuts and carries them to his burrow.",
    "There are already 12 walnuts in the burrow.",
    "He drops 1 walnut on the way, so he effectively adds 6 - 1 = 5 walnuts.",
    "So, the number of walnuts after the boy squirrel's addition is 12 + 5.",
    "Calculate 12 + 5 = 17. There are 17 walnuts in the burrow now.",
    "The girl squirrel brings 5 more walnuts to the burrow.",
    "Add these 5 walnuts to the existing 17 walnuts: 17 + 5 = 22.",
    "The girl squirrel eats 2 walnuts from the burrow.",
    "Subtract the 2 walnuts she eats from the total: 22 - 2 = 20."
