  "query": "Arthur knows that he needs to finish 800 pages of reading over the summer. He has read 80% of a 500-page book and 1/5 of a 1000 page book. How many more pages does he need to reach to meet his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pages Arthur has already read in each book.",
    "For the first book, Arthur has read 80% of a 500-page book.",
    "To find out how many pages that is, I multiply 500 by 0.8.",
    "500 * 0.8 = 400 pages.",
    "Arthur has read 400 pages of the first book.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pages he has read in the second book.",
    "He has read 1/5 of a 1000-page book.",
    "To find out how many pages that is, I divide 1000 by 5.",
    "1000 / 5 = 200 pages.",
    "Arthur has read 200 pages of the second book.",
    "Now, I will add the pages read from both books to find out the total number of pages he has read so far.",
    "400 pages from the first book + 200 pages from the second book = 600 pages.",
    "Arthur has read a total of 600 pages.",
    "Arthur's goal is to read 800 pages over the summer.",
    "I need to find out how many more pages he needs to read to reach his goal.",
    "I will subtract the number of pages he has already read from his goal.",
    "800 - 600 = 200 pages."
