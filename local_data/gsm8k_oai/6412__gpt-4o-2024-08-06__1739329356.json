  "query": "Diane bakes four trays with 25 gingerbreads in each tray and three trays with 20 gingerbreads in each tray. How many gingerbreads does Diane bake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many gingerbreads are in the four trays with 25 gingerbreads each.",
    "To do that, I multiply 4 trays by 25 gingerbreads per tray.",
    "4 trays * 25 gingerbreads/tray = 100 gingerbreads.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many gingerbreads are in the three trays with 20 gingerbreads each.",
    "To do that, I multiply 3 trays by 20 gingerbreads per tray.",
    "3 trays * 20 gingerbreads/tray = 60 gingerbreads.",
    "I have an amount of gingerbreads from the four trays and an amount from the three trays.",
    "So, I need to add 100 gingerbreads from the first set of trays to 60 gingerbreads from the second.",
    "100 gingerbreads + 60 gingerbreads = 160 gingerbreads."

  "solution": "160"
