  "query": "In the honey shop, the bulk price of honey is $5 per pound and the minimum spend is $40 before tax. The honey is taxed at $1 per pound. If Penny has paid $240 for honey, by how many pounds has Penny\u2019s purchase exceed the minimum spend?",
  "steps": [
    "The total amount Penny paid for honey is $240.",
    "First, I need to determine the effective cost per pound including tax.",
    "The base price of honey is $5 per pound.",
    "The tax on honey is $1 per pound.",
    "So, the total cost including tax is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.",
    "Since Penny paid $240, I need to find out how many pounds of honey she bought.",
    "To find out the number of pounds, divide the total amount paid by the effective cost per pound.",
    "Number of pounds = $240 \u00f7 $6 = 40 pounds.",
    "Next, I determine the number of pounds needed to meet the minimum spend of $40 before tax.",
    "Since the value must be $40 at $5 per pound, calculate the pounds needed before tax only.",
    "Number of pounds needed to meet the minimum spend = $40 \u00f7 $5 = 8 pounds.",
    "Penny bought a total of 40 pounds.",
    "The purchase exceeds the minimum spend pounds, so find the difference.",
    "Pounds purchased exceeding the minimum spend = 40 pounds - 8 pounds = 32 pounds."
