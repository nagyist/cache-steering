  "query": "Kira's cat eats a pound of kibble every 4 hours. Kira fills her cat's bowl with 3 pounds of kibble before going to work. When she returns, Kira weighs the bowl and there is still 1 pound left. How many hours was Kira away from home?",
  "steps": [
    "Kira's cat starts with 3 pounds of kibble in the bowl.",
    "When Kira returns, there is 1 pound of kibble left in the bowl.",
    "The cat has eaten 3 pounds - 1 pound = 2 pounds of kibble.",
    "The cat eats 1 pound of kibble every 4 hours.",
    "To find out how long Kira was away, I need to determine how many 4-hour periods it takes for the cat to eat 2 pounds.",
    "2 pounds / 1 pound per 4 hours = 2 * 4 hours = 8 hours."

  "solution": "8"
