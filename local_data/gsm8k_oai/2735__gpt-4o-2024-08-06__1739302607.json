  "query": "Bob gets paid $5 an hour for the regular hours he works and $6 an hour for any overtime hours he works. All hours over 40 in a week are considered overtime. If Bob works 44  hours in the first week and 48 hours in the second week, how much did he make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how many regular hours and how many overtime hours Bob worked each week.",
    "In the first week, Bob worked 44 hours. Regular hours are the first 40 hours, so he worked 40 regular hours.",
    "For the first week, overtime hours are any hours over 40. Thus, he worked 44 - 40 = 4 overtime hours.",
    "In the second week, Bob worked 48 hours. Regular hours are the first 40 hours, so he worked 40 regular hours as well.",
    "For the second week, overtime hours are any hours over 40. Thus, he worked 48 - 40 = 8 overtime hours.",
    "Next, I will calculate how much Bob made in the first week.",
    "For the first week, he worked 40 regular hours at $5 per hour, so he earned 40 * $5 = $200.",
    "For the first week, he worked 4 overtime hours at $6 per hour, so he earned 4 * $6 = $24.",
    "Therefore, in the first week, Bob made a total of $200 + $24 = $224.",
    "Now, I will calculate how much Bob made in the second week.",
    "For the second week, he worked 40 regular hours at $5 per hour, so he earned 40 * $5 = $200.",
    "For the second week, he worked 8 overtime hours at $6 per hour, so he earned 8 * $6 = $48.",
    "Therefore, in the second week, Bob made a total of $200 + $48 = $248.",
    "To find out how much Bob made altogether, I need to add his earnings from both weeks.",
    "Bob made $224 in the first week and $248 in the second week, so in total he made $224 + $248 = $472."
