  "query": "If 12 bags of oranges weigh 24 pounds, how much do 8 bags weigh?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much one bag of oranges weighs.",
    "Since 12 bags weigh 24 pounds in total, I can divide the total weight by the number of bags to find the weight of one bag.",
    "24 pounds divided by 12 bags equals 2 pounds per bag.",
    "Now that I know one bag weighs 2 pounds, I need to find out how much 8 bags would weigh.",
    "I can do this by multiplying the weight of one bag by the number of bags, which is 8.",
    "2 pounds per bag times 8 bags equals 16 pounds."
