  "query": "Gina can paint six cups an hour with roses and 7 cups an hour with lilies. Her Etsy store gets an order for 6 rose cups and 14 lily cups. If Gina gets paid $90 total for the order, how much does she make per hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes Gina to paint 6 rose cups.",
    "Gina paints 6 rose cups at a rate of 6 cups per hour, so it takes her 1 hour to paint 6 rose cups.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it takes Gina to paint 14 lily cups.",
    "Gina paints 7 lily cups per hour, so to paint 14 lily cups, it takes her 14 / 7 = 2 hours.",
    "Now, I add the time spent on both activities to find the total time Gina spent on the order.",
    "The total time is 1 hour (roses) + 2 hours (lilies) = 3 hours.",
    "Gina is paid $90 total for this order.",
    "To find her earnings per hour, I divide the total payment by the total number of hours worked.",
    "$90 / 3 hours = $30 per hour."

  "solution": "30"
