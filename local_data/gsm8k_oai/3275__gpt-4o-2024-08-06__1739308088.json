  "query": "A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?",
  "steps": [
    "The total weight of the cake is 400 grams.",
    "The cake is divided into eight equal parts.",
    "To find the weight of one part, I divide 400 grams by 8.",
    "400 divided by 8 equals 50 grams.",
    "Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, which is one part.",
    "Therefore, Nathalie eats 50 grams.",
    "Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate.",
    "Double of 50 grams is 50 grams times 2.",
    "50 times 2 equals 100 grams.",
    "Thus, Pierre ate 100 grams."
