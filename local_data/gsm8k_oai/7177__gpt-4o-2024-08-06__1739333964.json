  "query": "5 geckos on the kitchen window eat 6 insects each. 3 lizards eat twice as much as the geckos.  How many total insects were eaten?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many insects each gecko eats.",
    "Each gecko eats 6 insects.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of insects eaten by all the geckos together.",
    "There are 5 geckos, each eating 6 insects.",
    "5 geckos * 6 insects/gecko = 30 insects eaten by the geckos.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many insects each lizard eats.",
    "Each lizard eats twice as much as a gecko.",
    "One gecko eats 6 insects, so one lizard eats 2 * 6 = 12 insects.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of insects eaten by all the lizards together.",
    "There are 3 lizards, each eating 12 insects.",
    "3 lizards * 12 insects/lizard = 36 insects eaten by the lizards.",
    "Finally, I sum up the insects eaten by the geckos and the lizards to get the total number of insects eaten.",
    "30 insects (geckos) + 36 insects (lizards) = 66 insects."

  "solution": "66"
