  "query": "Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as her husband, Randy. Randy has only half as many water balloons as his daughter, Janice. If Janice throws all 6 of her water balloons at her father, how many water balloons does Cynthia have, which she could also choose to throw at Randy?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine how many water balloons Randy has.",
    "I know that Janice has 6 water balloons.",
    "Randy has half as many as Janice, so I need to divide the number of water balloons Janice has by 2.",
    "Randy has \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\) water balloons.",
    "Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as Randy.",
    "I need to multiply the number of water balloons Randy has by 4 to get the number Cynthia has.",
    "Cynthia has \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) water balloons.",
    "I need to double-check my calculations: Janice has 6, Randy has 3 (because \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\)), and Cynthia has \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\). This is consistent with the information given."

  "solution": "12"
