  "query": "Jean is trying to motivate herself to write her final paper. She eats one donut per 2 pages that she writes. If she writes 12 pages and each donut has 150 calories, how many calories does she eat?",
  "steps": [
    "Jean eats one donut for every 2 pages she writes.",
    "She writes 12 pages.",
    "To find the number of donuts she eats, divide the number of pages (12) by the number of pages per donut (2).",
    "12 pages / 2 pages per donut = 6 donuts.",
    "Each donut has 150 calories.",
    "To find the total number of calories, multiply the number of donuts (6) by the calories per donut (150).",
    "6 donuts * 150 calories per donut = 900 calories."
