  "steps": [
    "Megan's grandma initially gave her $125.",
    "She increased this amount by 25% with funds from babysitting.",
    "To find 25% of $125, I calculate 0.25 * 125 = 31.25.",
    "I add this amount to the original $125: 125 + 31.25 = 156.25.",
    "The account decreased by 20% when Megan bought shoes.",
    "To find 20% of $156.25, I calculate 0.20 * 156.25 = 31.25.",
    "I subtract this from $156.25: 156.25 - 31.25 = 125.",
    "After all transactions, Megan's final balance is $125.",
    "I need to find what percentage $125 (the final balance) is of $125 (the starting balance).",
    "Since $125 is equal to the starting balance, it is 100% of the starting balance."
