  "query": "For the gala luncheon planning committee, Margaret wants to serve chicken salad sandwiches using mini croissants.  She wants there to be enough food that each person on the committee can have 2 sandwiches each.  Her bakery offers 12 minis croissants for $8.00.  There are 24 people on the committee. How much will she spend on croissants?",
  "steps": [
    "Margaret wants each of the 24 committee members to have 2 sandwiches each.",
    "To find out the total number of sandwiches needed, multiply the number of sandwiches per person by the number of people: 2 sandwiches/person * 24 people.",
    "2 * 24 = 48 sandwiches needed in total.",
    "Each sandwich uses 1 mini croissant, so Margaret will need 48 mini croissants.",
    "The bakery offers mini croissants in packs of 12 for $8.00.",
    "To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of mini croissants by the number of croissants per pack: 48 mini croissants / 12 croissants/pack.",
    "48 / 12 = 4 packs are needed.",
    "Each pack costs $8.00. To find the total cost, multiply the number of packs by the price per pack: 4 packs * $8.00/pack.",
    "4 * 8 = $32.00"
  ],
  "solution": "32"
