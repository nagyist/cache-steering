  "query": "Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at $20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay. Maddox sold his cameras at $28 each, while Theo sold his cameras at $23 each. How much more profit did Maddox get from the sale of his cameras than Theo?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost for Maddox and Theo. Both bought 3 cameras each at $20 per camera.",
    "Calculate the total cost for Maddox: 3 cameras * $20 per camera = $60.",
    "Calculate the total cost for Theo: 3 cameras * $20 per camera = $60.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the revenue made by Maddox. He sold each camera at $28.",
    "Calculate the revenue for Maddox: 3 cameras * $28 per camera = $84.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the revenue made by Theo. He sold each camera at $23.",
    "Calculate the revenue for Theo: 3 cameras * $23 per camera = $69.",
    "Determine the profit for Maddox by subtracting his total cost from his revenue: $84 (revenue) - $60 (cost) = $24 profit.",
    "Determine the profit for Theo by subtracting his total cost from his revenue: $69 (revenue) - $60 (cost) = $9 profit.",
    "Finally, calculate how much more profit Maddox made compared to Theo: $24 (Maddox's profit) - $9 (Theo's profit) = $15."

  "solution": "15"
