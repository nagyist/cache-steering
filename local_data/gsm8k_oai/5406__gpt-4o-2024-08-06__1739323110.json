  "query": "Mr. and Mrs. Boyden take their 3 children to a leisure park. They buy tickets for the whole family. The cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket. The total cost of the 5 tickets is $77. What is the cost of an adult ticket?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve the problem, I need to set up equations based on the given information.",
    "Let the cost of a child ticket be represented by \\( x \\).",
    "The cost of an adult ticket would then be \\( x + 6 \\) since it is $6 more.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Boyden are 2 adults, and they have 3 children. Thus, there are 2 adult tickets and 3 child tickets.",
    "The equation for the total cost of the tickets would be \\( 2(x + 6) + 3x = 77 \\).",
    "I'll start by expanding the terms in the equation: \\( 2(x + 6) \\) becomes \\( 2x + 12 \\).",
    "Thus, the equation becomes \\( 2x + 12 + 3x = 77 \\).",
    "Combine like terms to get \\( 5x + 12 = 77 \\).",
    "Next, subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \\( x \\): \\( 5x = 65 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 13 \\).",
    "Since \\( x \\) is the cost of a child ticket, and an adult ticket costs \\( x + 6 \\), I calculate \\( x + 6 = 13 + 6 \\).",
    "Thus, the cost of an adult ticket is $19."
