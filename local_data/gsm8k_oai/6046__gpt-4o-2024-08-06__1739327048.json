  "query": "Ellen\u2019s doctor instructed her to eat a 2,200 calorie a day diet. For breakfast, she ate 353 calories. For lunch, she had 885. She had an afternoon snack of 130 calories. How many calories does she have left for dinner?",
  "steps": [
    "Ellen has a total daily calorie budget of 2,200 calories.",
    "For breakfast, she consumed 353 calories.",
    "For lunch, she consumed 885 calories.",
    "For her afternoon snack, she consumed 130 calories.",
    "First, I need to calculate the total calories Ellen has consumed by adding breakfast, lunch, and snack.",
    "353 (breakfast) + 885 (lunch) = 1,238 calories for breakfast and lunch together.",
    "1,238 calories (breakfast and lunch) + 130 calories (snack) = 1,368 total calories consumed so far.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many calories she has left for dinner by subtracting the calories consumed from her daily calorie budget.",
    "2,200 (total daily calorie budget) - 1,368 (calories consumed) = 832 calories remaining for dinner."
