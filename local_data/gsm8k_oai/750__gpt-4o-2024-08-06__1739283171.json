  "query": "Jamal bought 4 half dozen colored crayons at $2 per crayon. What was the total cost of the crayons that she bought?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many crayons are in a half dozen.",
    "A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 12 divided by 2.",
    "Half a dozen is 6 crayons.",
    "Jamal bought 4 half dozen packs.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of crayons Jamal bought.",
    "Multiply the number of crayons in a half dozen (6) by the number of half dozen packs (4).",
    "6 crayons per half dozen times 4 half dozen packs is 24 crayons.",
    "The cost per crayon is $2.",
    "Multiply the total number of crayons (24) by the cost per crayon ($2) to find the total cost.",
    "24 crayons times $2 per crayon is $48."

  "solution": "48"
