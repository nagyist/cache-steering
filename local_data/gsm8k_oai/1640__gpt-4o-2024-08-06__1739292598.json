  "query": "For Halloween, Taquon, Mack and Jafari put their candy together and they had 418 pieces of candy. If Taquon and Mack each had 171 pieces of candy, how many pieces of candy did Jafari start with?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pieces of candy Taquon and Mack combined had.",
    "Taquon had 171 pieces and Mack also had 171 pieces.",
    "If I add the candies of Taquon and Mack, I get: 171 + 171.",
    "171 plus 171 equals 342. So, together, Taquon and Mack had 342 pieces of candy.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many pieces of candy Jafari had by using the total number of candies and subtracting the number of candies Taquon and Mack had.",
    "The total number of candies they all had is 418 pieces.",
    "I subtract the total number of candies Taquon and Mack had (342) from the total number of candies (418).",
    "418 minus 342 equals 76.",
    "Therefore, Jafari started with 76 pieces of candy."
