  "query": "Donald drinks 3 more than twice the number of juice bottles Paul drinks in one day. If Paul drinks 3 bottles of juice per day, how many bottles does Donald drink per day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how many juice bottles Paul drinks in one day, which is given as 3.",
    "Next, I need to calculate twice the number of bottles Paul drinks. Since Paul drinks 3 bottles, twice that amount is 2 * 3.",
    "Calculating 2 * 3 gives me 6.",
    "Since Donald drinks 3 more than twice the number Paul drinks, I need to add 3 to the result obtained from twice the number of Paul's bottles.",
    "Thus, I add 3 to 6, which gives me 6 + 3.",
    "Calculating 6 + 3 gives me 9."
  ],
  "solution": "9"
