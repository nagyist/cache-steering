  "query": "Linda makes and sells necklaces at craft fairs. At her most recent fair she sold 4 necklaces and 8 rings for a total of $80. If each necklace costs $12, how much does each ring cost?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the cost of each ring.",
    "I know that Linda sold 4 necklaces and the total amount made from necklaces and rings was $80.",
    "Each necklace costs $12.",
    "I should calculate the total amount made from the necklaces.",
    "The total from the necklaces is 4 necklaces \u00d7 $12 per necklace.",
    "This amounts to 4 \u00d7 12 = $48 from necklaces.",
    "Now, I find out how much of the $80 was made from the rings.",
    "I subtract the amount made from necklaces from the total amount: $80 - $48.",
    "This calculation gives $80 - $48 = $32.",
    "Linda made $32 from selling the rings.",
    "I know that she sold 8 rings.",
    "To find the cost of each ring, I need to divide the total amount from rings by the number of rings.",
    "This is $32 divided by 8 rings.",
    "So, $32 \u00f7 8 = $4.",
    "Each ring costs $4."
