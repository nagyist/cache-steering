  "query": "Your video streaming subscription costs $14 a month. If you're evenly splitting the cost with your friend, how much do you pay in total after the first year for this service?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of the video streaming subscription for one year without splitting.",
    "The subscription costs $14 per month.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "The annual cost of the subscription without splitting is $14 multiplied by 12.",
    "14 times 12 equals 168.",
    "Now, I need to divide this annual cost by 2 because I'm splitting it with my friend.",
    "168 divided by 2 equals 84."
