  "query": "Jake is from a conservative household so during lunch at school one day, he gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to a hungry friend. If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?",
  "steps": [
    "Jake's feeding allowance is $4.",
    "He gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to a friend.",
    "To find one-quarter of $4, I calculate $4 / 4.",
    "$4 / 4 equals $1.",
    "Jake gave his friend $1.",
    "Candies cost 20 cents apiece.",
    "I need to find out how many candies can be purchased with $1.",
    "First, I convert $1 into cents to make the calculation easier. $1 is equal to 100 cents.",
    "I need to divide 100 cents by the cost of one candy, which is 20 cents.",
    "100 cents / 20 cents equals 5.",
    "Therefore, Jake's friend can purchase 5 candies."

  "solution": "5"
