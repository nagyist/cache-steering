  "query": "In Dana's senior high school class there were 200 students.  60% of the students were female, and 50% of the females were brunettes.  If 50% of the female brunettes were under 5 feet tall, then how many female brunettes in Dana's high school senior class were under 5 feet tall?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the number of female students in Dana's senior high school class.",
    "There are 200 students in total, and 60% of them are female.",
    "To find the number of female students, I will calculate 60% of 200.",
    "60% of 200 is calculated as (60/100) * 200.",
    "(60/100) * 200 = 120. So, there are 120 female students.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of female brunettes.",
    "50% of the females are brunettes.",
    "To find the number of female brunettes, I will calculate 50% of 120.",
    "50% of 120 is calculated as (50/100) * 120.",
    "(50/100) * 120 = 60. So, there are 60 female brunettes.",
    "Next, I need to find how many of these female brunettes are under 5 feet tall.",
    "50% of the female brunettes are under 5 feet tall.",
    "To find the number of female brunettes under 5 feet tall, I will calculate 50% of 60.",
    "50% of 60 is calculated as (50/100) * 60.",
    "(50/100) * 60 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 female brunettes under 5 feet tall."
