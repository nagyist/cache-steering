  "query": "Henry, John and Leo collected some seashells from the beach. Henry collected 11, Paul 24. If they initially collected 59 seashells in total and Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid they met, how many do they have in total now?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many seashells Leo initially collected.",
    "The total number of seashells collected by Henry, John, and Leo is 59.",
    "Henry collected 11 seashells.",
    "John (Paul in the question seems to be the intended reference here; assuming it's the same person as John) collected 24 seashells.",
    "To find how many seashells Leo collected, I need to subtract the number collected by Henry and John from the total number collected.",
    "The total number collected by Henry and John together is 11 + 24 = 35.",
    "So, the number of seashells Leo collected initially is 59 - 35 = 24.",
    "It is stated that Leo gave a quarter of his collection to a younger kid.",
    "A quarter of Leo's initial collection is 24 \u00f7 4 = 6.",
    "Now, to find out how many seashells they have in total after Leo gave away some, I need to subtract the seashells Leo gave away from the initial total of 59 seashells.",
    "The number of seashells remaining with the group is 59 - 6 = 53."
