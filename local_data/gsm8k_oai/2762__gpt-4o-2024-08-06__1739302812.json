  "steps": [
    "Henry drinks 15 bottles of kombucha every month.",
    "There are 12 months in a year.",
    "To find out how many bottles of kombucha Henry drinks in a year, multiply the number of bottles he drinks per month by the number of months in a year.",
    "15 bottles/month * 12 months/year = 180 bottles/year.",
    "Each bottle is eligible for a $0.10 refund.",
    "To find the total refund he receives after 1 year, multiply the number of bottles by the refund per bottle.",
    "180 bottles * $0.10/bottle = $18 refund.",
    "Each new bottle of kombucha costs $3.00.",
    "To find out how many new bottles Henry can buy with the $18 refund, divide the total refund by the cost per bottle.",
    "$18 / $3.00/bottle = 6 bottles."
