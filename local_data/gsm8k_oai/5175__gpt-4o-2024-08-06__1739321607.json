  "steps": [
    "I start by noting the total age of Kaydence's family is 200 years.",
    "Kaydence's father is 60 years old.",
    "Kaydence's mother is 2 years younger than Kaydence's father.",
    "2 years younger than 60 is 58, so Kaydence's mother is 58 years old.",
    "Kaydence's brother is 1/2 the age of Kaydence's father.",
    "1/2 of 60 is 30, so Kaydence's brother is 30 years old.",
    "Kaydence's sister is 40 years old.",
    "Now I calculate the combined age of Kaydence's family except for Kaydence.",
    "Adding Kaydence's father's age: 60.",
    "Adding Kaydence's mother's age: 60 + 58 = 118.",
    "Adding Kaydence's brother's age: 118 + 30 = 148.",
    "Adding Kaydence's sister's age: 148 + 40 = 188.",
    "The total age without Kaydence is 188 years.",
    "Subtracting 188 from the total family age (200) gives Kaydence's age.",
    "200 - 188 = 12"
