  "query": "Tony decided he wanted to be an astronaut.  He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.  He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?",
  "steps": [
    "Tony went to college for 4 years to get his first degree in science.",
    "He then got 2 more degrees, each taking 4 years. So, for these two degrees, he spent a total of 4 + 4 = 8 years.",
    "He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.",
    "Now, I will add all the years spent to find the total. The total is 4 (first degree) + 8 (two more degrees) + 2 (graduate degree).",
    "Calculating the total: 4 + 8 + 2 = 14."
