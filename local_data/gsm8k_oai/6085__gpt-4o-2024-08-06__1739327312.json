  "query": "Carol spends five hours filling up her pool. During the first hour, the pool fills at a rate of 8 gallons of water per hour. For the next two hours, the pool fills at 10 gallons of water per hour. For the fourth hour, the pool fills at a rate of 14 gallons of water per hour. During the fifth hour, the pool develops a leak and loses 8 gallons of water. At the end of five hours, how many gallons of water are still left in the pool?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the amount of water added during each hour.",
    "In the first hour, the pool fills at 8 gallons per hour.",
    "That means 8 gallons are added in the first hour.",
    "For the next two hours, the pool fills at 10 gallons per hour.",
    "So, in the second hour, 10 gallons are added.",
    "In the third hour, another 10 gallons are added.",
    "For the fourth hour, the pool fills at 14 gallons per hour.",
    "That means 14 gallons are added in the fourth hour.",
    "During the fifth hour, there is a leak that results in a loss of 8 gallons.",
    "Now I need to sum up all the gallons added to the pool and subtract the amount lost due to the leak.",
    "First hour: 8 gallons.",
    "Second hour: 10 gallons.",
    "Third hour: 10 gallons.",
    "Fourth hour: 14 gallons.",
    "The total amount of water added in five hours without considering the leak is 8 + 10 + 10 + 14 = 42 gallons.",
    "Now, subtract the 8 gallons lost in the fifth hour due to the leak.",
    "42 gallons - 8 gallons = 34 gallons remaining in the pool."
