  "query": "Alvin owns coconut trees that yield 5 coconuts each. If a coconut can be sold for $3 and Alvin needs $90, how many coconut trees does he have to harvest?",
  "steps": [
    "Alvin's goal is to make $90 from selling coconuts.",
    "Each coconut is sold for $3.",
    "I need to calculate how many coconuts Alvin needs to sell to make $90.",
    "To find this number, I divide $90 by $3 per coconut.",
    "90 divided by 3 equals 30. So, Alvin needs to sell 30 coconuts.",
    "Each coconut tree yields 5 coconuts.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many trees Alvin needs to harvest to get 30 coconuts.",
    "I divide the total number of coconuts needed, which is 30, by the number of coconuts each tree yields, which is 5.",
    "30 divided by 5 equals 6."
