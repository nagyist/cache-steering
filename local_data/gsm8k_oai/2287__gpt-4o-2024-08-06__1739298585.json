  "query": "Jason is counting the number of cars that drive by his window. He counted four times as many green cars as red cars, and 6 more red cars than purple cars. If he counted 312 cars total, how many of them were purple?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining the variables. Let \\( r \\) represent the number of red cars. Then the number of green cars is \\( 4r \\), since there are four times as many green cars as red cars.",
    "We are also told there are 6 more red cars than purple cars. So let \\( p \\) be the number of purple cars. Then \\( r = p + 6 \\).",
    "We know the total number of cars counted by Jason is 312. So, the equation for the total number of cars is:\n\\[ r + 4r + p = 312 \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 5r + p = 312 \\]",
    "We can substitute the expression for \\( p \\) from the equation \\( r = p + 6 \\). This gives us:\n\\[ p = r - 6 \\]",
    "Now, we substitute \\( p = r - 6 \\) into the equation \\( 5r + p = 312 \\):\n\\[ 5r + (r - 6) = 312 \\]",
    "Simplify the equation:\n\\[ 6r - 6 = 312 \\]",
    "Add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( r \\):\n\\[ 6r = 318 \\]",
    "Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[ r = 53 \\]",
    "Now that we have the number of red cars, we need to find the number of purple cars. Recall \\( r = p + 6 \\), so:\n\\[ 53 = p + 6 \\]",
    "Subtract 6 from both sides to solve for \\( p \\):\n\\[ p = 47 \\]"
