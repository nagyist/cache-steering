  "query": "Macy and Piper went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 15 pitches. Macy used 11 tokens and Piper used 17. Macy hit the ball 50 times. Piper hit the ball 55 times. How many pitches did Macy and Piper miss altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of pitches Macy received.",
    "Macy used 11 tokens and each token gets 15 pitches.",
    "11 tokens * 15 pitches per token = 165 pitches for Macy.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of pitches Piper received.",
    "Piper used 17 tokens and each token gets 15 pitches.",
    "17 tokens * 15 pitches per token = 255 pitches for Piper.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many pitches Macy missed.",
    "Macy hit the ball 50 times, so the number of pitches she missed is 165 total pitches - 50 hits.",
    "165 - 50 = 115 pitches missed by Macy.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many pitches Piper missed.",
    "Piper hit the ball 55 times, so the number of pitches she missed is 255 total pitches - 55 hits.",
    "255 - 55 = 200 pitches missed by Piper.",
    "Now, I will add the missed pitches for both Macy and Piper to find the total number of pitches they missed altogether.",
    "115 pitches missed by Macy + 200 pitches missed by Piper = 315 pitches missed altogether."
