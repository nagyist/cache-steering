  "query": "The difference between the number of boys and girls in a tree planting event is 400. If there are 600 boys at the event, and the number of girls is more than the number of boys, what's 60% of the total number of boys and girls at the event?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify how many boys and girls are at the event.",
    "I know there are 600 boys at the event.",
    "The difference between the number of boys and girls is 400 and the number of girls is more than the number of boys.",
    "Let's let the number of girls be G.",
    "Since there are more girls than boys, G = 600 + 400.",
    "G = 1000.",
    "Now, I find the total number of boys and girls at the event: 600 boys + 1000 girls.",
    "The total number of boys and girls is 1600.",
    "The problem asks for 60% of the total number, which is 1600.",
    "To find 60% of 1600, I multiply 1600 by 0.6.",
    "1600 * 0.6 = 960."

  "solution": "960"
