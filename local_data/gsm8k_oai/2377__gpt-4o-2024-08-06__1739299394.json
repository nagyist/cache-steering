  "query": "Tickets to the school play cost $6 for students and $8 for adults. If 20 students and 12 adults bought tickets, how many dollars' worth of tickets were sold?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total ticket sales from the students.",
    "The cost of a ticket for a student is $6.",
    "There are 20 students who bought tickets.",
    "To find the total sales from students, multiply the number of students by the cost per student: 20 students * $6/student.",
    "20 * 6 = 120.",
    "So, the total sales from student tickets is $120.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total ticket sales from the adults.",
    "The cost of a ticket for an adult is $8.",
    "There are 12 adults who bought tickets.",
    "To find the total sales from adults, multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult: 12 adults * $8/adult.",
    "12 * 8 = 96.",
    "So, the total sales from adult tickets is $96.",
    "Now, I need to add the total sales from students and adults to find the total ticket sales overall.",
    "120 (from students) + 96 (from adults) = 216.",
    "The total dollars' worth of tickets sold is $216."

  "solution": "216"
