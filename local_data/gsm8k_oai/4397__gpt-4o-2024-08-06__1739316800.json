  "query": "Max can trade 3 coconuts for a crab and 6 crabs for a goat. If he has 342 coconuts and he wants to convert all of them into goats, how many goats will he have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate how many crabs Max can get for his 342 coconuts.",
    "To find out, divide the total number of coconuts, 342, by the number of coconuts needed to trade for one crab, which is 3.",
    "342 divided by 3 equals 114. Therefore, Max can trade 342 coconuts for 114 crabs.",
    "Next, let's calculate how many goats Max can get for his 114 crabs.",
    "To find out, divide the total number of crabs, 114, by the number of crabs needed to trade for one goat, which is 6.",
    "114 divided by 6 equals 19. Therefore, Max can trade 114 crabs for 19 goats."
