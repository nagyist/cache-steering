  "query": "Princess Daphne bought three necklaces and a set of earrings for a total of $240,000.  If all three necklaces were equal in price, and the earrings were three times as expensive as any one necklace, then how expensive was the cost of a single necklace?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the price of one necklace as \\( x \\).",
    "Since there are three necklaces, the total cost for the necklaces would be \\( 3x \\).",
    "The earrings are three times as expensive as one necklace, so their cost is \\( 3x \\).",
    "Now, the total cost is the sum of the cost of the necklaces and the earrings. So, we have \\( 3x + 3x = 240,000 \\).",
    "Simplifying the equation, \\( 6x = 240,000 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 6.",
    "Performing the division, I get \\( x = 40,000 \\).",
    "This means that the cost of a single necklace is $40,000."

  "solution": "40,000"
