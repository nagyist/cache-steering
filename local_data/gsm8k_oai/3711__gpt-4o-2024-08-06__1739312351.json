  "query": "If Katherine has 4 apples and 3 times as many pears in her fridge, how many bananas does she have if she has a total of 21 pieces of fruit?",
  "steps": [
    "Katherine has 4 apples.",
    "Katherine has 3 times as many pears as apples.",
    "Therefore, Katherine has 3 * 4 = 12 pears.",
    "Katherine has apples and pears totaling 4 + 12 = 16 pieces of fruit.",
    "Katherine's total fruit is 21.",
    "To find the number of bananas, subtract the total of apples and pears from the total fruit.",
    "21 total pieces of fruit - 16 apples and pears = 5 bananas."
