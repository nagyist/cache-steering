  "query": "Marcy can make 3 spears out of a sapling and 9 spears out of a log. How many spears can she make out of 6 saplings and a log?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand how many spears Marcy can make from a single sapling, which is 3 spears.",
    "Next, I calculate how many spears she can make from 6 saplings. Since each sapling makes 3 spears, I multiply 6 saplings by 3 spears per sapling.",
    "6 saplings multiplied by 3 spears per sapling equals 18 spears.",
    "Now, I need to consider how many spears Marcy can make from a log, which is 9 spears.",
    "Finally, I add the number of spears from the saplings to the number of spears from the log: 18 spears from saplings plus 9 spears from the log.",
    "18 spears from the saplings plus 9 spears from the log equals 27 spears."

  "solution": "27"
