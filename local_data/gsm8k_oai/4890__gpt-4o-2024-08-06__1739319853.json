  "query": "Before Marcus went on a road trip to LA, his car had 1728 miles on it. He filled his empty gas tank twice and used up all the gas on the trip. If Marcus's car gets 30 miles per gallon and holds 20 gallons of gas, how many miles does Marcus' car have on it now?",
  "steps": [
    "Marcus initially has 1728 miles on his car.",
    "His car holds 20 gallons of gas.",
    "He filled his gas tank twice, which means he used 2 tanks of gas.",
    "So, the total gallons of gas used for the trip: 2 tanks * 20 gallons per tank = 40 gallons.",
    "His car gets 30 miles per gallon.",
    "Miles driven with 40 gallons of gas: 40 gallons * 30 miles per gallon = 1200 miles.",
    "Miles on the car initially was 1728 miles.",
    "Total miles after the trip = Initial miles + Miles driven = 1728 miles + 1200 miles."

  "solution": "2928"
