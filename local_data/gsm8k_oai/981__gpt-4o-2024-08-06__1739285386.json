  "query": "Olga has three stripes on the side of each of her tennis shoes.  Rick has one less stripe per shoe than does Olga.  But Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga.  In total, what is the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of stripes on each of Olga's shoes. I know from the problem that Olga has three stripes per shoe.",
    "Since each pair of shoes has two shoes, Olga's pair of shoes has a total of 3 stripes per shoe multiplied by 2 shoes, which is 6 stripes per pair.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of stripes on each of Rick's shoes. The problem states that Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga.",
    "Since Olga has 3 stripes per shoe, Rick has 3 - 1 = 2 stripes per shoe.",
    "Therefore, for Rick's pair of shoes, he has 2 stripes per shoe multiplied by 2 shoes, which equals 4 stripes per pair.",
    "Now, I need to determine the number of stripes on each of Hortense's shoes. The problem states that Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as Olga.",
    "Olga has 3 stripes per shoe, so Hortense has 3 x 2 = 6 stripes per shoe.",
    "Therefore, for Hortense's pair of shoes, she has 6 stripes per shoe multiplied by 2 shoes, which equals 12 stripes per pair.",
    "Finally, to find the total number of stripes on all pairs of shoes, I need to add the stripes from Olga\u2019s, Rick\u2019s, and Hortense\u2019s pairs of shoes together.",
    "Olga has 6 stripes per pair, Rick has 4 stripes per pair, and Hortense has 12 stripes per pair.",
    "Adding these together: 6 + 4 + 12 = 22 stripes in total."
