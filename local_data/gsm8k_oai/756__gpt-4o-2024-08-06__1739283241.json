  "query": "Anna, Alison, and Jeff collect stamps. Anna had 37 stamps in her collection, Alison had 28 stamps in her collection, and Jeff had 31 stamps in his collection. Alison gave Anna half of her collection in exchange for a novel, and then Anna traded Jeff two bluebird stamps for one mountain stamp. How many stamps did Anna have in the end?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many stamps Alison gave to Anna.",
    "Alison originally had 28 stamps. She gave Anna half of 28.",
    "Half of 28 is 28 / 2 = 14.",
    "Anna received 14 stamps from Alison. Initially, Anna had 37 stamps.",
    "Adding the 14 stamps she received from Alison to her initial 37 gives her: 37 + 14 = 51 stamps.",
    "Next, Anna traded with Jeff. She gave Jeff two stamps and received one stamp in return.",
    "This means Anna loses 2 stamps and gains 1 stamp.",
    "The net effect of the trade is that Anna loses 1 stamp (2 - 1 = 1).",
    "She originally had 51 stamps after receiving from Alison.",
    "Subtracting the 1 stamp from her collection after the trade leaves her with: 51 - 1 = 50 stamps."
