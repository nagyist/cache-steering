  "query": "There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many jelly beans are red.",
    "There are 4,000 jelly beans in total, and three fourths of them are red.",
    "To find the number of red jelly beans, I calculate 3/4 of 4,000.",
    "3/4 of 4,000 equals (3/4) * 4,000 = 3,000.",
    "So, there are 3,000 red jelly beans.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many of these red jelly beans are coconut flavored.",
    "One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.",
    "I need to calculate 1/4 of 3,000.",
    "1/4 of 3,000 equals (1/4) * 3,000 = 750.",
    "Therefore, there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans."
