  "query": "Harry's birthday was three weeks after the closing of the school. His three friends decided to contribute an equal amount of money to throw him a party. Harry added $30 to the contribution, making the total contribution three times as much as Harry contributed. Calculate the total amount of money that each of Harry's friends contributed.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the variables and relationships. Let \\( x \\) be the amount each friend contributed.",
    "There are three friends contributing, so the total contribution from friends is \\( 3x \\).",
    "Harry contributed $30.",
    "The total contribution is three times what Harry contributed.",
    "Since Harry contributed $30, three times his contribution is \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\).",
    "Therefore, the equation for total contribution is \\( 3x + 30 = 90 \\).",
    "Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to isolate terms with \\( x \\): \n\\[ 3x = 90 - 30 \\]",
    "Now, simplify the right side:\n\\[ 3x = 60 \\]",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 60 / 3 \\]",
    "Calculate the value of \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 20 \\]"

  "solution": "20"
