  "query": "All of the beads in Sue's necklace are either purple, blue, or green. If Sue has 7 purple beads, twice as many blue beads as purple beads, and 11 more green beads than blue beads, how many beads are in the necklace?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the number of blue beads. The problem states that there are twice as many blue beads as purple beads.",
    "Sue has 7 purple beads.",
    "Since there are twice as many blue beads as purple beads, I calculate: 2 * 7 = 14 blue beads.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many green beads Sue has.",
    "The problem states that Sue has 11 more green beads than blue beads.",
    "I know there are 14 blue beads, so to find the green beads, I calculate: 14 + 11 = 25 green beads.",
    "Now, I have the count of all types of beads: 7 purple beads, 14 blue beads, and 25 green beads.",
    "To find the total number of beads, I add up all the beads: 7 + 14 + 25.",
    "Adding these numbers together: 7 + 14 = 21, then 21 + 25 = 46."

  "solution": "46"
