  "query": "If Alice purchased 3600 acorns for nine times the price Bob paid, and Bob paid $6000 for his acorns, how much money did Alice pay for each acorn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Alice paid in total for her acorns. She paid nine times the price Bob paid.",
    "Bob paid $6000 for his acorns.",
    "To find how much Alice paid, I multiply $6000 by 9.",
    "$6000 \u00d7 9 = $54000",
    "Now I know Alice paid $54000 in total.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Alice paid per acorn.",
    "Alice purchased 3600 acorns.",
    "To find the price per acorn, I divide the total amount Alice paid by the number of acorns she bought.",
    "$54000 \u00f7 3600 = $15"

  "solution": "15"
