  "query": "A family bought 1 box of pizza that is cut into 16 slices. Only three-fourths of the pizza was eaten by the family. How many slices of pizza were left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many slices are in the whole box of pizza.",
    "The box of pizza contains 16 slices.",
    "The family ate three-fourths of the pizza.",
    "To find out how many slices were eaten, I need to calculate three-fourths of 16 slices.",
    "Three-fourths of 16 is calculated as (3/4) * 16.",
    "(3/4) * 16 equals 12 slices.",
    "The family ate 12 slices of pizza.",
    "To find out how many slices are left, I need to subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.",
    "So, 16 slices (total) minus 12 slices (eaten) equals 4 slices."

  "solution": "4"
