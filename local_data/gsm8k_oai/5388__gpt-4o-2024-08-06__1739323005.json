  "query": "A small store made 50 posters to advertise their products. Two-fifths of them are small posters while half of them are medium posters. The rest are large posters. How many large posters are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of small posters.",
    "Two-fifths of the posters are small. So, I calculate two-fifths of 50.",
    "To find two-fifths of 50, I calculate \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 50 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 50 = 20 \\).",
    "So, there are 20 small posters.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of medium posters.",
    "Half of the posters are medium. So, I calculate half of 50.",
    "To find half of 50, I calculate \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25 \\).",
    "So, there are 25 medium posters.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many large posters are left.",
    "First, I calculate the total number of small and medium posters combined.",
    "There are 20 small posters and 25 medium posters, so the total is 20 + 25.",
    "20 + 25 = 45.",
    "Subtract the number of small and medium posters from the total number of posters to find the number of large posters.",
    "50 total posters minus 45 small and medium posters equals 5.",
    "So, there are 5 large posters."
