  "query": "On the planet Orbius-5, there are 250 days per year, and each year is equally divided into 5 seasons. If an astronaut from earth lands on planet Orbius-5 and stays there for 3 seasons before returning to earth, what is the number of days the astronaut will spend on Orbius-5?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of days in one season on Orbius-5.",
    "There are 250 days in a year on Orbius-5.",
    "Each year is divided into 5 seasons.",
    "To find the number of days in one season, I need to divide the total number of days in the year by the number of seasons.",
    "250 days per year divided by 5 seasons equals 50 days per season.",
    "The astronaut stays on Orbius-5 for 3 seasons.",
    "To find out the total number of days the astronaut spends on Orbius-5, I multiply the number of days in one season by the number of seasons the astronaut stays.",
    "50 days per season multiplied by 3 seasons equals 150 days."

  "solution": "150"
