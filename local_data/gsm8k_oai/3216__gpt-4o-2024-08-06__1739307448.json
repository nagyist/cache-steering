  "query": "For Mother's Day last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses from his garden, but this year, he was only able to pick half the number of roses. If Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year and the grocery store sells one rose for $3, how much would Kyle have to spend?",
  "steps": [
    "Last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses. A dozen equals 12.",
    "This year, Kyle was only able to pick half the number of roses he picked last year.",
    "Half of 12 is 6. So, Kyle picked 6 roses this year.",
    "Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year.",
    "Twice as many roses as last year means 2 times 12, which equals 24 roses.",
    "Kyle already has 6 roses he picked this year.",
    "To determine how many more roses Kyle needs, subtract the roses he picked this year from the total needed.",
    "24 roses (total needed) - 6 roses (picked this year) = 18 roses needed.",
    "The grocery store sells one rose for $3.",
    "To find out how much Kyle would have to spend, multiply the number of roses needed by the price per rose.",
    "18 roses needed * $3 per rose = $54."

  "solution": "54"
