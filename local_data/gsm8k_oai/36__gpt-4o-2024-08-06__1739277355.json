  "query": "Lisa, Jack, and Tommy earned $60 from washing cars all week. However, half of the $60 was earned by Lisa. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. How much more money did Lisa earn than Tommy?",
  "steps": [
    "The total amount of money earned by all three of them is $60.",
    "Lisa earned half of the total amount. So, Lisa earned $60 / 2.",
    "$60 / 2 equals $30. Therefore, Lisa earned $30.",
    "Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. So, Tommy earned $30 / 2.",
    "$30 / 2 equals $15. Therefore, Tommy earned $15.",
    "To find how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we need to subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings.",
    "Lisa's earnings are $30 and Tommy's earnings are $15.",
    "$30 - $15 equals $15."
