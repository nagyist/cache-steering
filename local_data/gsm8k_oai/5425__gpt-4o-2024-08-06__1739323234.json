  "query": "In Johnstown, the population is 80 and every single person drives by themselves to work. Each car on a road pollutes 10 pounds of carbon a year. A single bus pollutes 100 pounds of carbon a year. A bus can hold 40 people. The town decides to start running a bus and 25% of the people who used to drive now take the bus. How many fewer pounds of carbon are now emitted per year?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of people in Johnstown who take the bus.",
    "The population of Johnstown is 80 people, and 25% of these people now take the bus.",
    "To calculate 25% of 80, I multiply 80 by 0.25.",
    "0.25 multiplied by 80 equals 20. So, 20 people now take the bus.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many people still drive to work.",
    "Originally, all 80 people drove. Now, 20 people take the bus.",
    "80 minus 20 equals 60. So, 60 people still drive to work.",
    "Now, I calculate the amount of carbon emitted by the remaining 60 cars.",
    "Each car emits 10 pounds of carbon per year, so 60 cars will emit 60 multiplied by 10 pounds of carbon.",
    "60 multiplied by 10 equals 600 pounds. So, 600 pounds of carbon are emitted by the remaining cars.",
    "Now, I calculate the carbon emitted by the bus.",
    "A single bus emits 100 pounds of carbon per year.",
    "I will now calculate the total carbon emissions with the bus in use.",
    "The total carbon emissions are 600 pounds from the remaining cars plus 100 pounds from the bus.",
    "600 plus 100 equals 700 pounds. So, 700 pounds of carbon are emitted per year now.",
    "Originally, 80 cars were emitting carbon.",
    "80 cars times 10 pounds of carbon per car equals 800 pounds of carbon originally emitted.",
    "Finally, I determine the reduction in carbon emissions.",
    "Originally, 800 pounds were emitted, and now 700 pounds are emitted.",
    "800 minus 700 equals 100. So, the reduction in carbon emissions is 100 pounds per year."
