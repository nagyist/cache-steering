    "I need to find half of the distance from Anthony's apartment to work.",
    "The distance from Anthony's apartment to work is 10 miles.",
    "Half of 10 miles is calculated as 10 miles / 2.",
    "10 miles / 2 = 5 miles.",

    "I need to add 2 miles to the 5 miles (half the distance) to find the distance to the gym.",
