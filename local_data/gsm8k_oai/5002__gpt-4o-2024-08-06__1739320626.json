  "query": "James has 3 more than 2 times the number of Oreos Jordan has.  If there are 36 Oreos total, how many does Jordan have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the number of Oreos that Jordan has as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, James has 3 more than 2 times the number of Oreos Jordan has.",
    "So, the number of Oreos that James has can be expressed as \\( 2x + 3 \\).",
    "We are also told that the total number of Oreos is 36.",
    "This means that the sum of Oreos James and Jordan have is 36.",
    "We can set up the equation: \\( x + (2x + 3) = 36 \\).",
    "Combine the terms in the equation to get \\( 3x + 3 = 36 \\).",
    "Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\): \\( 3x = 33 \\).",
    "Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 11 \\).",
    "So, Jordan has 11 Oreos."
