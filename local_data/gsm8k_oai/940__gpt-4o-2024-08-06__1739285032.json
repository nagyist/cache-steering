  "query": "Lloyd, Mark, and Michael have their Pokemon cards collection. Currently, Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd but has 10 fewer cards than Michael. If Michael has 100 cards now, how many more cards should they collect so that all three of them will have a total of 300 cards?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Michael has 100 cards now.",
    "Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael, which is 100 - 10.",
    "So, Mark has 90 cards.",
    "Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd.",
    "If Mark has 90 cards, then Lloyd must have 90 / 3 cards.",
    "90 / 3 equals 30.",
    "So, Lloyd has 30 cards.",
    "Now, I will add up the current number of cards each person has.",
    "Lloyd has 30 cards, Mark has 90 cards, and Michael has 100 cards.",
    "30 + 90 + 100 equals 220.",
    "Currently, they have a total of 220 cards.",
    "Their goal is to have 300 cards.",
    "They need 300 - 220 more cards to achieve this goal.",
    "300 - 220 equals 80."
