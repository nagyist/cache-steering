  "query": "Tricia ordered three dozen eggs. She will use 1/4 of them for making crepes, and 2/3 of the remaining for making cupcakes. How many eggs are left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of eggs Tricia ordered. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12.",
    "3 * 12 equals 36 eggs in total.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many eggs Tricia will use to make crepes. She will use 1/4 of the 36 eggs.",
    "1/4 of 36 is calculated as 36 * 1/4.",
    "36 * 1/4 equals 9. So, Tricia will use 9 eggs for making crepes.",
    "After making crepes, Tricia will have 36 - 9 eggs left.",
    "36 - 9 equals 27 eggs remaining after making crepes.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many of these remaining 27 eggs are used for making cupcakes. Tricia will use 2/3 of the remaining eggs.",
    "2/3 of 27 is calculated as 27 * 2/3.",
    "27 * 2/3 equals 18 eggs. So, Tricia will use 18 eggs for making cupcakes.",
    "Finally, I need to determine how many eggs are left after making both crepes and cupcakes. I have 27 remaining eggs after crepes, and she will use 18 of these for cupcakes.",
    "So, 27 - 18 eggs remain.",
    "27 - 18 equals 9 eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast."
