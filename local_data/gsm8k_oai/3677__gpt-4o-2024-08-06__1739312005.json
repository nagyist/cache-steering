  "query": "A pumpkin patch allows people to come pick pumpkins to carve in the fall every year. They charge $3 per person for a pumpkin. The remaining pumpkins get turned into cans of pie filling, 3 pumpkins to a can. They grew 83 pumpkins this year and made $96 selling pumpkins for carving. How many cans of pie filling will the pumpkin patch produce?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to start by determining how many pumpkins were sold for carving.",
    "The pumpkin patch charges $3 per person for a pumpkin.",
    "They made $96 selling pumpkins for carving.",
    "To find the number of pumpkins sold for carving, I need to divide the total earnings by the price per pumpkin.",
    "The calculation is $96 \u00f7 $3 = 32.",
    "So, 32 pumpkins were sold for carving.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pumpkins are left for making pie filling.",
    "The pumpkin patch grew a total of 83 pumpkins.",
    "I subtract the number of pumpkins sold for carving (32) from the total grown (83).",
    "The calculation is 83 - 32 = 51.",
    "Therefore, 51 pumpkins are left to be used for pie filling.",
    "Each can of pie filling requires 3 pumpkins.",
    "I need to divide the remaining number of pumpkins (51) by 3 to find the number of cans produced.",
    "The calculation is 51 \u00f7 3 = 17.",
    "Therefore, the pumpkin patch will produce 17 cans of pie filling."
