  "query": "During the soccer match, The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period and twice that amount in the second period.  The other team, The Spiders, scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period and twice the amount that The Kickers scored in their second period.  What is the total amount of goals both teams scored?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many goals The Kickers scored in the second period.",
    "The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period. They scored twice that amount in the second period.",
    "Calculating twice the first period goals: 2 * 2 = 4.",
    "So, The Kickers scored 4 goals in the second period.",
    "Next, I find out the total number of goals The Kickers scored.",
    "Add the goals from both periods: 2 (first period) + 4 (second period) = 6.",
    "The Kickers scored a total of 6 goals.",
    "Now, I calculate the goals scored by The Spiders.",
    "The Spiders scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period.",
    "Half of 2 (The Kickers' first period goals) is 2 / 2 = 1.",
    "The Spiders scored 1 goal in the first period.",
    "The Spiders also scored twice the amount that The Kickers scored in their second period.",
    "Twice of 4 (The Kickers' second period goals) is 4 * 2 = 8.",
    "So, The Spiders scored 8 goals in the second period.",
    "Now, I find out the total number of goals The Spiders scored.",
    "Add the goals from both periods for The Spiders: 1 (first period) + 8 (second period) = 9.",
    "The Spiders scored a total of 9 goals.",
    "Finally, I calculate the total amount of goals scored by both teams.",
    "Add The Kickers' and The Spiders' total goals: 6 (The Kickers) + 9 (The Spiders) = 15."
