  "query": "Lucy lost one-third of her money. She then spent one-fourth of the remainder, and only left with $15. How much money did Lucy have at the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "First, define the variable for the amount of money Lucy initially had. Let's call it \\( x \\).",
    "Lucy lost one-third of her money, so the amount she lost initially is \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\).",
    "The remainder of her money after losing one-third is \\( x - \\frac{1}{3}x \\).",
    "Simplify the expression: \\( x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{2}{3}x \\).",
    "Next, Lucy spent one-fourth of the remainder. One-fourth of the remainder would be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3}x \\).",
    "Calculate the amount spent: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{2}{12}x = \\frac{1}{6}x \\).",
    "The amount left after she spent that money is: \\( \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{1}{6}x \\).",
    "Find a common denominator for subtraction: \\( \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{4}{6}x \\).",
    "Now subtract: \\( \\frac{4}{6}x - \\frac{1}{6}x = \\frac{3}{6}x = \\frac{1}{2}x \\).",
    "We know this remainder is equal to $15, so set up the equation: \\( \\frac{1}{2}x = 15 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by 2: \\( x = 15 \\times 2 \\).",
    "Calculate the final expression: \\( x = 30 \\)."
