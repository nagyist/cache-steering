  "query": "There are 290 liters of oil in 24 cans. If 10 of the cans are holding 8 liters each, how much oil is each of the remaining cans holding?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how much oil is contained in the 10 cans that hold 8 liters each.",
    "Multiply 10 cans by 8 liters per can to find the total oil in these cans: 10 * 8 = 80 liters.",
    "Now, subtract the 80 liters from the total oil of 290 liters to find out how much oil is in the remaining cans: 290 - 80 = 210 liters.",
    "Determine how many cans are left after accounting for the 10 cans. There are a total of 24 cans, so 24 - 10 = 14 cans remain.",
    "Now, divide the remaining total oil (210 liters) by the number of remaining cans (14 cans) to find out how much oil each of these cans holds: 210 \u00f7 14.",
    "Perform the division: 210 \u00f7 14 = 15 liters."
