  "query": "Caleb and Cynthia are filling up their inflatable pool with water using buckets. They fill their buckets at the spigot and carry them to the pool. Caleb can add 7 gallons from his bucket and Cynthia can add 8 gallons from her bucket each trip. It will take 105 gallons to fill the pool. How many trips will it take for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool with their buckets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much water Caleb and Cynthia can add to the pool in one complete trip. In one trip, Caleb adds 7 gallons, and Cynthia adds 8 gallons.",
    "To find the total amount of water added in one trip, I add Caleb's and Cynthia's contributions together: 7 gallons + 8 gallons = 15 gallons",
    "Now, I want to find the total number of trips needed to fill the pool with 105 gallons of water.",
    "To find the number of trips required, I divide the total gallons needed for the pool by the combined amount they can add per trip: 105 gallons \u00f7 15 gallons/trip.",
    "105 divided by 15 equals 7, so Caleb and Cynthia will need to make 7 trips together to fill the pool with 105 gallons."
