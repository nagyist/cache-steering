  "query": "James is building an army of Warhammer 40k figurines. It takes him 20 minutes to paint a space marine and 70 minutes to paint a dreadnought. If he paints 6 space marines and 2 dreadnoughts, how long does he spend painting total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long it takes to paint 6 space marines.",
    "Each space marine takes 20 minutes to paint.",
    "So, for 6 space marines: 6 space marines * 20 minutes per space marine = 120 minutes.",
    "Next, I need to determine how long it takes to paint 2 dreadnoughts.",
    "Each dreadnought takes 70 minutes to paint.",
    "So, for 2 dreadnoughts: 2 dreadnoughts * 70 minutes per dreadnought = 140 minutes.",
    "Now, I need to find the total painting time by adding the time for space marines and dreadnoughts.",
    "Total painting time = 120 minutes (space marines) + 140 minutes (dreadnoughts) = 260 minutes."

  "solution": "260"
