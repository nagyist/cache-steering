  "query": "Mira jogs every morning. She jogs 5 miles per hour. If she jogs for 2 hours every morning, how many miles can she jog for five days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many miles Mira jogs each day.",
    "Mira jogs at a pace of 5 miles per hour.",
    "She jogs for 2 hours every morning.",
    "The distance she jogs each day is calculated by multiplying her pace by the time she jogs.",
    "5 miles per hour multiplied by 2 hours equals 10 miles.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many miles she jogs over five days.",
    "Since she jogs 10 miles each day, I will multiply the daily distance by the number of days.",
    "10 miles per day multiplied by 5 days equals 50 miles."
