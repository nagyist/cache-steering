  "query": "Jonah decided to set up an aquarium. He started with 14 small fish. He added 2 more, but they ate 6 of his original fish before he could remove them and take them back to the store. He exchanged them for 3 new fish. How many fish does Jonah have now?",
  "steps": [
    "Jonah initially had 14 small fish.",
    "He added 2 more fish, so now he has 14 + 2 = 16 fish.",
    "The 2 new fish ate 6 of the original fish, decreasing the total to 16 - 6 = 10 fish.",
    "Jonah removed the 2 new fish, leaving him with 10 - 2 = 8 fish.",
    "He exchanged these 2 fish for 3 new fish, increasing the total fish count to 8 + 3 = 11 fish."

  "solution": "11"
