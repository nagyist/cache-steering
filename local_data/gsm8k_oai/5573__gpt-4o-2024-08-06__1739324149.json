  "query": "Amy bakes muffins for her friends. On Monday, she brings 1 muffin to school to share. Each day for the rest of the week she brings one more muffin to school than she did the day before. If on Saturday she counts that there are 7 muffins left, how many did she originally bake?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many muffins Amy brought to school each day.",
    "I know that on Monday, she brought 1 muffin.",
    "On Tuesday, she brought one more than that, so 1 + 1 = 2 muffins.",
    "On Wednesday, she brought one more than she did on Tuesday, which is 2 + 1 = 3 muffins.",
    "On Thursday, she brought one more than she did on Wednesday, which is 3 + 1 = 4 muffins.",
    "On Friday, she brought one more than she did on Thursday, which is 4 + 1 = 5 muffins.",
    "Now, I'll total up the muffins she brought to school Monday through Friday.",
    "1 muffin on Monday.",
    "Plus 2 muffins on Tuesday.",
    "Plus 3 muffins on Wednesday.",
    "Plus 4 muffins on Thursday.",
    "Plus 5 muffins on Friday.",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 muffins in total.",
    "She brought 15 muffins to school over the week.",
    "According to the problem, there are 7 muffins left on Saturday.",
    "If there are 7 muffins left, it means she used up some amount of the original muffins to bring 15 to school.",
    "So, she originally baked the total amount she brought to school plus the amount left.",
    "15 muffins brought to school + 7 muffins left = 22 muffins originally baked."
