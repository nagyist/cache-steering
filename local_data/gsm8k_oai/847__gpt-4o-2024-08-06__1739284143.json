  "query": "While cultivating a small farm, a farmer spent $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor. After a successful harvest, he was able to gather 10 bags of corn. How much should he sell each bag, if he wants to make a profit of 10%?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost incurred by the farmer.",
    "The cost of corn seeds is $50.",
    "The cost of fertilizers and pesticides is $35.",
    "The cost of labor is $15.",
    "Adding these costs gives the total cost: $50 + $35 + $15 = $100.",
    "Next, I need to determine the desired profit.",
    "A profit of 10% on the total cost means profit = 10% of $100.",
    "10% of $100 is calculated as (10/100) * $100 = $10.",
    "To find out the total amount the farmer wants to earn, I add the desired profit to the total cost.",
    "So, the total amount to earn = total cost + profit = $100 + $10 = $110.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much to sell each bag of corn for, given he has 10 bags.",
    "The selling price per bag is the total amount to earn divided by the number of bags.",
    "Divide $110 by 10 bags to find the price per bag: $110 / 10 = $11."

  "solution": "11"
