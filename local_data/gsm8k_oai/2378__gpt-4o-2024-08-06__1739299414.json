  "query": "Last week, Tony went to a toy store and bought $250 a set of Lego blocks, a $120 worth toy sword, and a $35 play dough. He bought 3 sets of lego, 7 toy swords, and 10 play doughs. How much did Tony pay in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of the Lego blocks that Tony bought. The cost per set is $250.",
    "Tony bought 3 sets of Lego blocks.",
    "The total cost for the Lego blocks is 3 sets times $250 per set.",
    "3 multiplied by 250 is 750.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the toy swords. The cost per toy sword is $120.",
    "Tony bought 7 toy swords.",
    "The total cost for the toy swords is 7 swords times $120 per sword.",
    "7 multiplied by 120 is 840.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the play dough. The cost per play dough is $35.",
    "Tony bought 10 play doughs.",
    "The total cost for the play dough is 10 play doughs times $35 per play dough.",
    "10 multiplied by 35 is 350.",
    "I now have the total costs: Lego blocks cost $750, toy swords cost $840, and play doughs cost $350.",
    "To find the total amount Tony paid, I need to add all these costs together: $750 + $840 + $350.",
    "750 plus 840 equals 1590.",
    "1590 plus 350 equals 1940.",
    "Therefore, Tony paid a total of $1940."

  "solution": "1940"
