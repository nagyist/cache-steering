  "query": "The central Texas countryside contains many toads that come out at night.  For every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, and one-quarter of the brown toads are spotted.  If there are 50 spotted brown toads per acre, how many green toads are there per acre?",
  "steps": [
    "I am given that for every green toad, there are 25 brown toads.",
    "I am also given that one-quarter of the brown toads are spotted. This means out of every 25 brown toads, \\((1/4) \\times 25 = 6.25\\) brown toads are spotted.",
    "This can't be a decimal in the real situation, so let's reconsider: If for every green toad there are 25 brown toads, then if there is a whole number of green toads, there must be a whole number of brown toads, and consequently, there must be a whole number of spotted brown toads.",
    "Instead of thinking in decimals, if there are 25 brown toads per green toad, then 1 out of 4 brown toads is spotted, so \\(\\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\\), a fraction causes the same logic conundrum; we can't work with decimals when counting individual discrete items (like toads).",
    "Alternatively, we can scale up to larger numbers which allow for logical consistency. So if there are 100 brown toads per acre, then \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 100 is 25 spotted brown toads.",
    "But the problem states there are actually 50 spotted brown toads per acre, so using the proportion of spotted to non-spotted, let's resolve this.",
    "If 50 spotted brown toads correspond to how many brown toads total? If 1 out of every 4 brown toads are spotted, then the total number of brown toads = 4 \\(\\times\\) spotted brown toads = 4 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 200 brown toads.",
    "I'm now working with the correct scale to find the relationship between green and total brown toads.",
    "Since the problem states that for every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, I use the number of brown toads to compute:",
    "Given 200 brown toads per acre, this implies there are \\(\\frac{200}{25} = 8\\) green toads per acre."
