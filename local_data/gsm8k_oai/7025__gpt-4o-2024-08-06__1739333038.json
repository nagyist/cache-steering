  "query": "Voldemort had his dinner and ate a piece of cake that has 110 calories. He also ate 1 pack of chips that contained 310 calories and drank a 500 ml bottle of coke that has 215 calories. His caloric intake for breakfast and lunch is 560 and 780 calories, respectively. If he has a 2500 calorie intake limit per day, how many calories can he still take?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total caloric intake from the dinner.",
    "The cake has 110 calories.",
    "The chips have 310 calories.",
    "The coke has 215 calories.",
    "Adding these together, the caloric intake from dinner is 110 + 310 + 215 = 635 calories.",
    "Next, I'll add the caloric intake from breakfast and lunch.",
    "Breakfast has 560 calories and lunch has 780 calories.",
    "Adding these, the total caloric intake from breakfast and lunch is 560 + 780 = 1340 calories.",
    "Now, I'll find the total caloric intake for the whole day so far.",
    "The intake from breakfast, lunch, and dinner is 1340 + 635 = 1975 calories.",
    "Voldemort's daily calorie intake limit is 2500 calories.",
    "To find out how many calories he can still take, I'll subtract the total caloric intake from the limit.",
    "2500 - 1975 = 525 calories"
  ],
  "solution": "525"
