  "query": "Tricia buys large bottles of iced coffee that have 6 servings per container.  She drinks half a container a day.  The coffee is currently on sale for $3.00 a bottle.  How much will it cost her to buy enough bottles to last for 2 weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many servings Tricia drinks per day.",
    "Tricia drinks half a container a day. Each container has 6 servings.",
    "Half a container would be 6 servings / 2 = 3 servings per day.",
    "Now I need to know how many servings she needs for 2 weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.",
    "She drinks 3 servings per day, so for 14 days she needs 3 servings/day * 14 days = 42 servings.",
    "Each bottle has 6 servings.",
    "I need to determine how many bottles she needs to buy to get 42 servings.",
    "42 servings / 6 servings per bottle = 7 bottles. Thus, she needs to buy 7 bottles.",
    "Each bottle costs $3.00.",
    "The total cost would be 7 bottles * $3.00 per bottle.",
    "Now I multiply: 7 * 3 = 21."
  ],
  "solution": "21"
