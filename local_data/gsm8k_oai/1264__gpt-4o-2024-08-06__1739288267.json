  "query": "A monitor is 21 inches by 12 inches.  There are 100 dots per inch.  How many total pixels are there?",
  "steps": [
    "The monitor has dimensions of 21 inches by 12 inches.",
    "It is mentioned that there are 100 dots per inch on the monitor.",
    "First, I'll calculate the number of dots along the width of the monitor.",
    "The width of the monitor is 21 inches.",
    "Since there are 100 dots per inch, the total number of dots along the width is 21 inches multiplied by 100 dots per inch.",
    "21 inches * 100 dots/inch = 2100 dots along the width.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the number of dots along the height of the monitor.",
    "The height of the monitor is 12 inches.",
    "Similarly, there are 100 dots per inch along the height as well.",
    "12 inches * 100 dots/inch = 1200 dots along the height.",
    "Now, to find the total number of pixels on the monitor, I need to multiply the number of dots along the width by the number of dots along the height.",
    "Total pixels = 2100 pixels (width) * 1200 pixels (height).",
    "Multiplying these values gives 2100 * 1200 = 2,520,000 pixels."
  ],
  "solution": "2,520,000"
