  "query": "Jerry\u2019s two daughters play softball on different teams. They each have 8 games this season. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. If each game lasts for 2 hours, how many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many total games both daughters will play.",
    "Each daughter has 8 games. Since there are two daughters, I multiply 8 games by 2, which equals 16 games.",
    "Next, I calculate the total number of practice hours for these games.",
    "Each game has 4 hours of practice associated with it. So, I multiply 16 games by 4 hours of practice per game.",
    "16 games times 4 hours of practice is 64 hours of practice in total for the two daughters.",
    "Now, I calculate the total hours spent on the games themselves.",
    "Each game lasts for 2 hours. With 16 total games, I multiply 16 games by 2 hours per game.",
    "16 games times 2 hours per game is 32 hours for games.",
    "Finally, I add the practice hours to the game hours to find the total time Jerry will spend at the field.",
    "I add 64 hours of practice to 32 hours of games, resulting in 96 total hours."

  "solution": "96"
