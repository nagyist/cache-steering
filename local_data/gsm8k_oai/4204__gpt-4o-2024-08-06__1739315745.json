  "query": "Alexander was 50 inches on his 8th birthday. If he grows 1/2 a foot a year, how many inches tall will he be on his 12th birthday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how many years there are between Alexander's 8th birthday and his 12th birthday.",
    "12 - 8 equals 4 years.",
    "Alexander grows 1/2 a foot each year.",
    "I need to convert the amount Alexander grows each year into inches, since 1 foot equals 12 inches.",
    "1/2 foot equals 1/2 * 12 inches, which is 6 inches.",
    "I need to calculate how many inches Alexander will grow in 4 years.",
    "Since he grows 6 inches each year, in 4 years he will grow 6 * 4 = 24 inches.",
    "He was 50 inches tall on his 8th birthday.",
    "I need to add the 24 inches he grows over the 4 years to his original height of 50 inches.",
    "50 inches + 24 inches equals 74 inches."

  "solution": "74"
