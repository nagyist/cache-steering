  "query": "Zoe goes to the store to buy soda and pizza for herself and her 5 family members. Each bottle of soda costs half a dollar and each slice of pizza costs $1. Before she leaves her house she takes just enough money to pay for her purchase. How much money did Zoe take?",
  "steps": [
    "Zoe is buying soda and pizza for herself and 5 family members, which means she is buying for 6 people in total.",
    "To calculate the total cost, I'll first think about the number of sodas Zoe needs. Assuming each person gets one soda, Zoe needs 6 bottles of soda.",
    "Each bottle of soda costs half a dollar, so the total cost of the soda is 6 bottles * $0.50 per bottle.",
    "6 * $0.50 equals $3.00, so the total cost for soda is $3.00.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the cost of the pizza. Assuming each person gets one slice of pizza, Zoe needs 6 slices of pizza.",
    "Each slice of pizza costs $1, so the total cost for the pizza is 6 slices * $1 per slice.",
    "6 * $1 equals $6.00, so the total cost for pizza is $6.00.",
    "Finally, I'll add the cost of soda and pizza to find the total amount Zoe needs.",
    "The total cost is $3.00 for soda + $6.00 for pizza.",
    "$3.00 + $6.00 equals $9.00."
