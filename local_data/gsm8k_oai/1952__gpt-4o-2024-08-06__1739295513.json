  "query": "Sol sells candy bars to raise money for her softball team. On the first day, she sells ten candy bars and sells four more candy bars than she sold the previous day each day afterward. If she sells six days a week and each candy bar costs 10 cents, how much will she earn in a week in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of candy bars Sol sells each day of the week.",
    "On the first day, Sol sells 10 candy bars.",
    "On the second day, she sells 10 + 4 = 14 candy bars.",
    "On the third day, she sells 14 + 4 = 18 candy bars.",
    "On the fourth day, she sells 18 + 4 = 22 candy bars.",
    "On the fifth day, she sells 22 + 4 = 26 candy bars.",
    "On the sixth day, she sells 26 + 4 = 30 candy bars.",
    "Now, I need to add up the total number of candy bars sold during the week.",
    "The total number of candy bars sold is 10 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 26 + 30.",
    "I calculate the sum: 10 + 14 = 24.",
    "24 + 18 = 42.",
    "42 + 22 = 64.",
    "64 + 26 = 90.",
    "90 + 30 = 120.",
    "She sells a total of 120 candy bars in one week.",
    "Each candy bar costs 10 cents, so I multiply the number of candy bars by 10 cents.",
    "120 candy bars \u00d7 10 cents = 1200 cents.",
    "Now, I convert 1200 cents into dollars.",
    "There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 1200 cents \u00f7 100 = 12 dollars."

  "solution": "12"
