  "query": "Jan's three-eyed lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes, and seven times more spots than wrinkles. How many fewer eyes does the lizard have than the combined number of spots and wrinkles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to establish how many eyes the lizard has. Jan's lizard has three eyes.",
    "Next, I need to find the number of wrinkles. The lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes. So, the number of wrinkles is 3 times 3, which equals 9 wrinkles.",
    "Then, I find the number of spots. The lizard has seven times more spots than wrinkles. So, the number of spots is 7 times 9, which equals 63 spots.",
    "Now, I need to find the combined number of spots and wrinkles. I add the number of spots (63) to the number of wrinkles (9). This equals 72.",
    "The final step is to find how many fewer eyes the lizard has compared to the combined number of spots and wrinkles. The lizard has 3 eyes and the combined number of spots and wrinkles is 72. I subtract 3 from 72 to find the difference.",
    "72 minus 3 equals 69."

  "solution": "69"
