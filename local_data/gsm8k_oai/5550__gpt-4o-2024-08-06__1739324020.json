  "query": "While driving up a road, Philip passed through 5 intersections. 4 crosswalks marked each intersection with a total of 20 lines per crosswalk. Calculate the total number of lines of the crosswalks in the five intersections.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of lines in a single crosswalk.",
    "Each crosswalk is marked with 20 lines, according to the problem.",
    "I need to determine the number of crosswalks at a single intersection.",
    "The problem states that there are 4 crosswalks at each intersection.",
    "To find the total number of lines at a single intersection, I multiply the number of crosswalks by the number of lines per crosswalk.",
    "This gives me 4 crosswalks * 20 lines per crosswalk = 80 lines at one intersection.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of lines for all five intersections Philip passed through.",
    "I multiply the number of lines at one intersection (80 lines) by the total number of intersections (5).",
    "So, 80 lines * 5 intersections = 400 lines."

  "solution": "400"
