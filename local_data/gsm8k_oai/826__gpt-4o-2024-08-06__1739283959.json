  "query": "James takes 20 units per semester at community college.  If each unit costs $50 how much does he pay for 2 semesters?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much James pays for one semester.",
    "James takes 20 units per semester.",
    "Each unit costs $50.",
    "To find the cost for one semester, I multiply the number of units by the cost per unit: 20 units * $50 per unit.",
    "20 * 50 equals 1000. So, James pays $1000 for one semester.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much he pays for 2 semesters.",
    "Since one semester costs $1000, I multiply this by 2 for the two semesters: $1000 * 2.",
    "1000 * 2 equals 2000."
  ],
  "solution": "2000"
