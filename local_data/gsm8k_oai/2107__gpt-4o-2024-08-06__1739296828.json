  "query": "Rhett has been late on two of his monthly rent payments, but his landlord does not charge late fees and so he will be able to pay their total cost with 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes. If he is currently paid $5000 per month and has to pay 10% tax, calculate his rent expense per month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Rhett's monthly salary after taxes.",
    "Rhett's gross monthly salary is $5000.",
    "The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount per month is $5000 * 0.10 = $500.",
    "Subtracting the tax from the gross salary gives the net salary: $5000 - $500 = $4500.",
    "Rhett's next net salary will be $4500.",
    "He uses 3/5 of his net salary to pay two months of rent.",
    "Calculate 3/5 of $4500: (3/5) * $4500 = $2700.",
    "The total rent for two months is $2700.",
    "To find the monthly rent, divide the total rent for two months by 2: $2700 / 2 = $1350."
  ],
  "solution": "1350"
