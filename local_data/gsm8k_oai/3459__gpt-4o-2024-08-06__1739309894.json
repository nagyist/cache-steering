  "query": "Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn. If Dawn has 10 CDs, how many CDs do they have together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many CDs Kristine has.",
    "Dawn has 10 CDs.",
    "Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn.",
    "So, I will add 7 to the number of CDs Dawn has.",
    "10 + 7 = 17",
    "Kristine has 17 CDs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many CDs Kristine and Dawn have together.",
    "Dawn has 10 CDs.",
    "Kristine has 17 CDs.",
    "I will add the number of CDs Dawn has to the number of CDs Kristine has.",
    "10 + 17 = 27",
    "Therefore, together they have 27 CDs."
