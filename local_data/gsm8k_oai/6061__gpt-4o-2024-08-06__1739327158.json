  "query": "Josh has 85 marbles. There are three times as many blue marbles as red while the rest are yellow. If there are 14 red marbles, how many yellow marbles are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of red marbles. According to the information given, Josh has 14 red marbles.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many blue marbles there are. The problem states that there are three times as many blue marbles as red marbles.",
    "I will calculate the number of blue marbles by multiplying the number of red marbles by three. So, 14 red marbles multiplied by 3 gives us 42 blue marbles.",
    "Now, I will determine the total number of marbles in colors that have been identified, which are red and blue. That would be 14 red marbles plus 42 blue marbles.",
    "Adding 14 red marbles to 42 blue marbles results in 56 marbles accounted for in red and blue.",
    "I need to find out how many yellow marbles there are. Since the total number of marbles is 85 and we have already accounted for 56 marbles, I will subtract 56 from 85.",
    "Subtracting 56 from 85 gives us 29 marbles that are yellow."

  "solution": "29"
