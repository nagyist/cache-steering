  "query": "Keiko sent 111 text messages last week. This week she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week. How many text messages did Keiko send last week and this week combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many text messages Keiko sent this week.",
    "Last week, Keiko sent 111 text messages.",
    "This week, she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week.",
    "Double of 111 messages is 111 * 2.",
    "111 * 2 = 222.",
    "Now, subtract 50 from 222 to find out how many messages she sent this week.",
    "222 - 50 = 172.",
    "Now I have the number of messages sent this week, which is 172.",
    "I need to find out how many messages Keiko sent in total over the two weeks.",
    "Add the number of messages from last week to the number of messages from this week.",
    "111 (last week) + 172 (this week) = 283."
