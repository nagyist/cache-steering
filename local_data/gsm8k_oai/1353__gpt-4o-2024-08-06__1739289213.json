  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how tall the camel is in inches.",
    "The hare is 14 inches tall.",
    "The camel is 24 times taller than the hare.",
    "To find out how tall the camel is in inches, I multiply the height of the hare by 24.",
    "14 inches (hare's height) times 24 equals 336 inches (camel's height).",
    "Now, I need to convert the camel's height from inches to feet.",
