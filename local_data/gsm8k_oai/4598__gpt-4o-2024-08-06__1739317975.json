  "query": "Juan bought T-shirts for his employees. He bought shirts for men and women. Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color. His company has 2 sectors, one in white t-shirts and the other in black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. The 2 sectors have the same number of men and women, with a total of 40 employees. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I want to determine the number of employees in each sector. The problem states that the company is divided into 2 sectors with equal numbers of men and women, making a total of 40 employees.",
    "Given the equal division, each sector consists of 20 employees.",
    "Each sector has the same number of men and women. Therefore, in each sector, there are 10 men and 10 women.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of t-shirts for the white t-shirt sector (20 employees).",
    "Juan paid $20 for each white men's t-shirt. There are 10 men in this sector, so the cost for white men\u2019s t-shirts is 10 men * $20 = $200.",
    "Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts. Therefore, each white women's t-shirt costs $20 - $5 = $15.",
    "For the 10 women in this sector, the cost for white women\u2019s t-shirts is 10 women * $15 = $150.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total cost for the white t-shirt sector: $200 (men) + $150 (women) = $350.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll calculate the cost of t-shirts for the black t-shirt sector (the other 20 employees).",
    "The black men's t-shirts cost $18 each. There are 10 men in this sector, so the cost for black men\u2019s t-shirts is 10 men * $18 = $180.",
    "Each black women's t-shirt is $5 cheaper than a black men's t-shirt, so it costs $18 - $5 = $13.",
    "For the 10 women in this sector, the cost for black women\u2019s t-shirts is 10 women * $13 = $130.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost for the black t-shirt sector: $180 (men) + $130 (women) = $310.",
    "To find the total amount Juan spent on all t-shirts, I add the costs of both sectors: $350 (white t-shirts) + $310 (black t-shirts) = $660."
