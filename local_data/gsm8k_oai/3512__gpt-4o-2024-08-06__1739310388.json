  "query": "Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day. He goes to school 5 days a week. If he missed 2 days within a week, how many hours did he spend on sports in school that week?",
  "steps": [
    "Begin by determining how many days Roy spent at school that week.",
    "He usually goes to school 5 days a week.",
    "However, he missed 2 days within that week.",
    "Therefore, the number of days he attended school is 5 - 2 = 3 days.",
    "Next, calculate the number of hours he spends on sports activities each of those days.",
    "He spends 2 hours on sports activities every day he attends school.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of hours spent on sports in that week.",
    "Multiply the number of days he attended school by the hours spent on sports per day: 3 days * 2 hours/day.",
    "3 days * 2 hours/day = 6 hours."
