  "query": "Robie filled some plastic boxes with hockey cards. There were 10 cards in each box but 5 cards were not placed in a box. He gave away 2 boxes to his friends and he has 5 boxes with him. How many cards did Robie have in the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out the total number of hockey cards Robie had at the beginning.",
    "First, I know from the problem statement that Robie has 5 boxes left with him.",
    "Each of these boxes holds 10 cards.",
    "Therefore, the 5 boxes he still has account for 5 boxes * 10 cards/box = 50 cards.",
    "Robie also gave away 2 boxes.",
    "Each of these 2 boxes also contained 10 cards.",
    "So the 2 boxes he gave away contained 2 boxes * 10 cards/box = 20 cards.",
    "I now know the number of cards that were in all the boxes together.",
    "Robie has kept 50 cards and gave away 20 cards, so the total number of cards that were placed in boxes is 50 + 20 = 70 cards.",
    "According to the problem, there were also 5 cards that were not placed in any box.",
    "So to find the total number of cards Robie started with, I need to add these 5 unboxed cards to the 70 boxed cards.",
    "Therefore, the total number of cards Robie had in the beginning is 70 + 5 = 75 cards."
