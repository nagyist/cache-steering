  "query": "42 raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries were picked in total. If half of all the berries had been raspberries, and a third of the berries were blackberries, how many of them were blueberries?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by determining the number of raspberries. Half of the berries were raspberries.",
    "Calculate half of 42 to find the number of raspberries: \\( \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\).",
    "Next, determine the number of blackberries. A third of the berries were blackberries.",
    "Calculate a third of 42 to find the number of blackberries: \\( \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\).",
    "Now, let's calculate the total number of raspberries and blackberries together.",
    "Add the number of raspberries and blackberries: 21 raspberries + 14 blackberries = 35.",
    "To find the number of blueberries, subtract the sum of raspberries and blackberries from the total number of berries.",
    "Calculate the number of blueberries: 42 total berries - 35 (raspberries + blackberries) = 7."
