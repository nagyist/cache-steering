  "query": "Christina has 3 snakes. 1 snake is 2 feet long. Another snake is 16 inches long. The last snake is 10 inches long. How many inches are all of her snakes combined?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the total length of all the snakes in inches.",
    "The first snake is 2 feet long. I will convert feet to inches.",
    "There are 12 inches in one foot. So, 2 feet is 2 times 12 inches.",
    "2 times 12 equals 24. The first snake is 24 inches long.",
    "The second snake is already measured in inches: 16 inches.",
    "The third snake is also already measured in inches: 10 inches.",
    "Now, I add the lengths of all the snakes in inches.",
    "The lengths are 24 inches, 16 inches, and 10 inches.",
    "24 plus 16 equals 40.",
    "40 plus 10 equals 50."
