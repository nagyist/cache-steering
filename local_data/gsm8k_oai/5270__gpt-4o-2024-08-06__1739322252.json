  "steps": [
    "Cheryl can harvest 16 cups of basil from her farm every week.",
    "She can harvest basil for 8 weeks.",
    "To find the total amount of basil she can harvest in 8 weeks, I multiply the weekly harvest by the number of weeks: \\(16 \\text{ cups/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 128 \\text{ cups}\\).",
    "Cheryl needs 4 cups of basil to make 1 cup of pesto.",
    "To find out how many cups of pesto she can make, I divide the total cups of basil by the number of cups needed per cup of pesto: \\(128 \\text{ cups of basil} \\div 4 \\text{ cups of basil/cup of pesto} = 32 \\text{ cups of pesto}\\)."
