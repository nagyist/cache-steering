  "query": "Adam goes to school every day. On Monday he had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each, and on Tuesday he had 3 lessons of 1 hour each. On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday. How much time in total did Adam spend at school during these 3 days, in hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Monday.",
    "Adam had 6 lessons on Monday, each lasting 30 minutes.",
    "To find the total time for Monday, we multiply the number of lessons by the duration of each lesson: 6 lessons * 30 minutes.",
    "6 lessons * 30 minutes = 180 minutes.",
    "Convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "180 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.",
    "Adam spent 3 hours at school on Monday.",
    "Next, let's calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Tuesday.",
    "Adam had 3 lessons on Tuesday, each lasting 1 hour.",
    "3 lessons * 1 hour = 3 hours.",
    "Adam spent 3 hours at school on Tuesday.",
    "Now, calculate how much time Adam spent at school on Wednesday.",
    "On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time as on Tuesday.",
    "Twice the time on Tuesday is 3 hours * 2 = 6 hours.",
    "Adam spent 6 hours at school on Wednesday.",
    "Finally, let's calculate the total time Adam spent at school over these 3 days.",
    "Add the time spent on each day: Monday 3 hours + Tuesday 3 hours + Wednesday 6 hours.",
    "3 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 12 hours."
