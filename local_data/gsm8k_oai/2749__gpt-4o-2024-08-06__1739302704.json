  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many baskets Sandra made.",
    "Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex.",
    "Alex made 8 baskets, so Sandra made 3 times 8 baskets.",
    "3 times 8 is 24, so Sandra made 24 baskets.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many baskets Hector made.",
    "Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made.",
    "Sandra made 24 baskets, so Hector made 2 times 24 baskets.",
    "2 times 24 is 48, so Hector made 48 baskets.",
    "Finally, I need to find out the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector.",
    "Alex made 8 baskets, Sandra made 24 baskets, and Hector made 48 baskets.",
    "I need to add these numbers together.",
    "8 plus 24 equals 32.",
