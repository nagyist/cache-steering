  "query": "Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together?",
  "steps": [
    "Beatrix has 30 books. Since the problem states that Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix, I add 20 to Beatrix's total.",
    "Therefore, Alannah has 30 + 20 = 50 books.",
    "The problem states that Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. This means Queen has an additional 1/5 of Alannah's total number of books.",
    "To find the additional number of books Queen has, I calculate 1/5 of Alannah's total, which is 50 books.",
    "1/5 of 50 is calculated as follows: 50 / 5 = 10. So, Queen has an additional 10 books over Alannah's 50 books.",
    "Therefore, Queen has 50 + 10 = 60 books.",
    "To find the total number of books that Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen have together, I add their individual totals.",
    "Alannah has 50 books, Beatrix has 30 books, and Queen has 60 books.",
    "The total number of books is 50 + 30 + 60.",
    "Adding these together gives me: 50 + 30 = 80; and 80 + 60 = 140."

  "solution": "140"
