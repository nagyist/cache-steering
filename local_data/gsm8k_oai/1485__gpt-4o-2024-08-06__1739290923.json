  "query": "Adam has 50 balls. 20 balls are red, 10 are blue, and the rest are either pink or orange. If there are 3 times as many pink as orange balls, how many orange balls are there?",
  "steps": [
    "Adam has a total of 50 balls.",
    "Out of these, 20 are red and 10 are blue.",
    "The number of red and blue balls together is 20 + 10 = 30.",
    "So, the remaining balls that are pink or orange is 50 - 30 = 20.",
    "Let the number of orange balls be x.",
    "According to the problem, the number of pink balls is 3 times the number of orange balls.",
    "Therefore, the number of pink balls is 3x.",
    "The total number of pink and orange balls together is x + 3x = 4x.",
    "Since we have determined that there are 20 balls that are either pink or orange, we set up the equation 4x = 20.",
    "Solving for x, we divide both sides by 4, giving x = 20 / 4 = 5.",
    "Therefore, there are 5 orange balls."
