    "First, I need to find the number of sharks at Dana Point beach.",
    "Dana Point beach has four times the number of sharks as Newport Beach.",
    "Newport Beach has 22 sharks.",
    "So, the number of sharks at Dana Point is 4 times 22.",
    "Calculating 4 times 22 gives 88.",

    "Next, I need to find the total number of sharks on both beaches.",
    "Newport Beach has 22 sharks and Dana Point has 88 sharks.",
    "I add the two numbers together: 22 + 88.",
    "22 + 88 equals 110."
