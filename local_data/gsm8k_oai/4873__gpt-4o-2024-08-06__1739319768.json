  "query": "Erik's dog can run 24 miles per hour. It is chasing a rabbit that can run 15 miles per hour. The rabbit has a head start of .6 miles. How many minutes does it take for the dog to catch up to the rabbit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the relative speed of the dog compared to the rabbit.",
    "The dog runs at 24 miles per hour, while the rabbit runs at 15 miles per hour.",
    "The relative speed of the dog compared to the rabbit is 24 - 15 = 9 miles per hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how long it will take for the dog to cover the head start distance of 0.6 miles at this relative speed.",
    "The time it takes to cover a distance at a given speed can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.",
    "Using this formula, the time it takes for the dog to catch up is 0.6 miles divided by 9 miles per hour.",
    "0.6 / 9 = 0.0667 hours.",
    "To convert hours into minutes, I need to multiply the time in hours by 60.",
    "0.0667 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 4 minutes."

  "solution": "4"
