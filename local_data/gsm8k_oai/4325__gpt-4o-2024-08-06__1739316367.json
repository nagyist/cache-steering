  "query": "To get to the library, Jill spends 12 minutes waiting for her first bus, 30 minutes riding on her first bus, and half the combined wait and trip time on her second bus. How many minutes does her second bus ride take?",
  "steps": [
    "Jill waits 12 minutes for her first bus.",
    "She rides the first bus for 30 minutes.",
    "To find the total time spent on the first bus portion, I add the waiting and riding times: 12 minutes + 30 minutes = 42 minutes.",
    "Jill's second bus ride takes half the combined wait and trip time. So, half of 42 minutes is calculated.",
    "Calculating half of 42 minutes: 42 minutes / 2 = 21 minutes."
