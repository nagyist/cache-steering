  "query": "Melisa and Jennifer threw a fiftieth birthday party for their father at a local restaurant. When the bill came, Melisa added a 15% tip of $42. Jennifer said that the service was wonderful and they should leave a 20% tip instead. How much is a 20% tip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Melisa left a 15% tip of $42.",
    "I want to determine the original bill amount before the tip.",
    "To find the original bill, I can set up the equation where 15% of the bill equals $42. In other words, 0.15 times the bill equals $42.",
    "Let B be the original bill amount.",
    "The equation is 0.15 * B = 42.",
    "To solve for B, I divide both sides by 0.15.",
    "B = 42 / 0.15",
    "Let me calculate 42 divided by 0.15.",
    "B = 280",
    "Now I know that the original bill amount is $280.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much a 20% tip would be on this bill.",
    "To calculate a 20% tip, I multiply the original bill amount, $280, by 0.20.",
    "20% of $280 is 0.20 * 280.",
    "Let me calculate 0.20 times 280.",
    "0.20 * 280 = 56",
    "A 20% tip on the original bill amount of $280 is $56."

  "solution": "56"
