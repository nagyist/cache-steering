  "query": "Randy had some money. Smith gave him another $200. Randy then gave Sally $1,200 and kept the rest. If Randy has $2000 left, how much money, in dollars, did Randy have at first?",
  "steps": [
    "Randy has $2000 left after giving Sally $1200.",
    "This means before giving Sally the money, Randy had $2000 + $1200.",
    "Calculating that gives $3200.",
    "Randy had $3200 before giving any money to Sally.",
    "Now, remember Smith gave Randy $200.",
    "So, before Smith gave Randy the $200, Randy must have had $3200 - $200.",
    "Calculating that gives $3000."
