  "query": "Beatrice is shopping for a new TV. First she looks at 8 TVs at one store in person. Then she looks at three times as many TVs at an online store. She looks at more TVs on an auction site online. If Beatrice looked at 42 TVs in all, how many did look at on the auction site?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many TVs Beatrice looked at in person. She saw 8 TVs at the first store.",
    "Next, Beatrice looks at three times as many TVs at an online store. So I calculate the number of TVs she looked at there: 3 times 8 equals 24 TVs.",
    "Now, I know Beatrice looked at a total of 8 TVs in person and 24 TVs at the online store. Adding these together gives me 8 + 24 = 32 TVs.",
    "I am given that Beatrice looked at a total of 42 TVs. I need to determine how many TVs she looked at on the auction site.",
    "To find the number of TVs she looked at on the auction site, I subtract the total number of TVs she already looked at (32) from the total number of TVs she saw (42).",
    "42 - 32 = 10.",
    "Beatrice looked at 10 TVs on the auction site."
