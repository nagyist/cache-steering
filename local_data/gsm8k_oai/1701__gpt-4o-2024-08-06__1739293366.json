  "steps": [
    "Sandra has a box of apples that weighs 120 pounds.",
    "She's going to use half the weight in apples to make applesauce.",
    "Half of 120 pounds is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.",
    "Sandra uses 60 pounds of apples to make applesauce.",
    "The rest of the apples, 60 pounds, will be used to make apple pies.",
    "She needs 4 pounds of apples per pie.",
    "The number of pies she can make is calculated by dividing the weight of apples she has for pies by the pounds needed per pie.",
    "So, 60 pounds / 4 pounds per pie = 60 / 4 = 15 pies."
