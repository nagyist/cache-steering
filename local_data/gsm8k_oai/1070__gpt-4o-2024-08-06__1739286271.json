  "query": "Every morning, Jason eats an omelet made using three eggs.  How many eggs will Jason consume in two weeks?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many days are in two weeks.",
    "There are 7 days in a week. So in two weeks, there are 7 x 2 = 14 days.",
    "Jason eats an omelet made using three eggs every day.",
    "To find out how many eggs Jason will consume in 14 days, I need to multiply the number of eggs he eats per day by the number of days.",
    "Jason consumes 3 eggs per day.",
    "So, in 14 days, he will consume 3 x 14 eggs.",
    "3 x 14 equals 42.",
    "Therefore, Jason will consume 42 eggs in two weeks."
