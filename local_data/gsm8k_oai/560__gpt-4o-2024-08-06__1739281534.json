  "query": "The student council sells scented erasers in the morning before school starts to help raise money for school dances. The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers. There are 24 erasers in each box. If the student council sells the erasers for $0.75 each, how much money will they make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of erasers they have.",
    "The local bookstore donated 48 boxes of erasers.",
    "Each box contains 24 erasers.",
    "To find the total number of erasers, I will multiply the number of boxes by the number of erasers per box.",
    "48 boxes * 24 erasers per box = 1152 erasers.",
    "Now I know they have 1152 erasers to sell.",
    "The student council sells each eraser for $0.75.",
    "To find the total amount of money they will make, I need to multiply the number of erasers by the price per eraser.",
    "1152 erasers * $0.75 per eraser = $864."
