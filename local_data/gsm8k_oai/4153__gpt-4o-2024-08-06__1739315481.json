  "query": "When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July. Now, 20 years later, if July's husband is 2 years older than her, how old is he?",
  "steps": [
    "When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July.",
    "Let's denote July's age at that time as J.",
    "Thus, from the information given: 6 = 2 * J.",
    "To find J, I divide both sides of the equation by 2: J = 6 / 2 = 3.",
    "So when Hannah was 6 years old, July was 3 years old.",
    "Now, it is 20 years later.",
    "Hannah's current age is 6 + 20 = 26 years old.",
    "Since 20 years have passed, July's current age is 3 + 20 = 23 years old.",
    "July's husband is 2 years older than July.",
    "So, July's husband's age is 23 + 2 = 25 years old."

  "solution": "25"
