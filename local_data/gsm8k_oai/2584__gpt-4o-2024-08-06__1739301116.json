  "query": "Belinda\u2019s dog is missing, so she made 200 flyers to distribute around town with the help of her friends. Ryan passed out 42 flyers, Alyssa passed out 67, Scott passed out 51 and Belinda passed out the rest. What percentage of the flyers did Belinda pass out?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott.",
    "Ryan passed out 42 flyers.",
    "Alyssa passed out 67 flyers.",
    "Scott passed out 51 flyers.",
    "Adding these together: 42 + 67 + 51.",
    "42 + 67 = 109.",
    "109 + 51 = 160.",
    "So, Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott collectively passed out 160 flyers.",
    "Now, I will determine how many flyers Belinda passed out by subtracting the total passed out by her friends from the total flyers made.",
    "Belinda made 200 flyers in total.",
    "Subtracting the flyers passed out by her friends: 200 - 160.",
    "200 - 160 = 40.",
    "Belinda passed out 40 flyers.",
    "Next, I will calculate the percentage of the total flyers that Belinda passed out.",
    "The percentage is calculated by the formula: (part/total) x 100.",
    "Substituting in Belinda\u2019s flyers: (40/200) x 100.",
    "40 divided by 200 is 0.2.",
    "0.2 multiplied by 100 is 20."
