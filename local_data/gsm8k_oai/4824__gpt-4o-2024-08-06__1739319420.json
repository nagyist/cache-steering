  "query": "There are 88 dogs in a park. 12 of the dogs are running. Half of them are playing with toys. A fourth of them are barking. How many dogs are not doing anything?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by understanding the total number of dogs in the park: there are 88 dogs in total.",
    "Identify the number of dogs that are running: 12 dogs are running.",
    "Next, calculate how many dogs are playing with toys. Halve the total number: half of 88 is 44. So, 44 dogs are playing with toys.",
    "Now, calculate the number of dogs that are barking. One fourth of 88 is 22. So, 22 dogs are barking.",
    "Add the number of dogs running, playing with toys, and barking to see how many dogs are engaged in activities.",
    "Add 12 (running) + 44 (playing with toys) + 22 (barking) to get the total number of dogs engaged in activities: 12 + 44 + 22 = 78.",
    "Subtract the total number of dogs engaged in activities from the total number of dogs to find out how many are doing nothing: 88 - 78.",
    "Finally, perform the subtraction: 88 - 78 = 10."
