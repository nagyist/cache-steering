  "query": "Jude is trading his bottle cap collection to Arthur for some of Arthur's matchbox vehicles. Arthur charges Jude 5 bottle caps for a car and 6 bottle caps for a truck. Jude has 100 bottle caps. If he buys 10 trucks and spends 75% of his remaining bottle caps on cars, how many total matchbox vehicles does he buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Jude decides to buy 10 trucks first.",
    "Arthur charges 6 bottle caps for each truck.",
    "To find the total number of bottle caps spent on trucks, I multiply 10 trucks by 6 bottle caps per truck.",
    "10 trucks \u00d7 6 bottle caps/truck = 60 bottle caps spent on trucks.",
    "Jude initially has 100 bottle caps.",
    "After buying the trucks, he will have 100 - 60 = 40 bottle caps remaining.",
    "Jude plans to spend 75% of his remaining bottle caps on cars.",
    "To find 75% of 40 bottle caps, I multiply 40 by 0.75.",
    "40 \u00d7 0.75 = 30 bottle caps will be used to buy cars.",
    "Each car costs 5 bottle caps.",
    "To find out how many cars Jude can buy with 30 bottle caps, I divide 30 by 5.",
    "30 bottle caps \u00f7 5 bottle caps/car = 6 cars.",
    "Jude buys 10 trucks and 6 cars.",
    "The total number of matchbox vehicles Jude buys is 10 trucks + 6 cars."
