  "query": "At the Johnson family reunion, there were 45 children and one third as many adults.  One third of the adults wore blue.  How many adults did not wear blue?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many adults were at the reunion.",
    "There were 45 children and one third as many adults.",
    "So, I divide the number of children by 3 to find the number of adults: 45 / 3 = 15.",
    "Now, I know there are 15 adults at the reunion.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many adults wore blue.",
    "One third of the adults wore blue. So I calculate one third of 15: 15 / 3 = 5.",
    "This means 5 adults wore blue.",
    "To find out how many adults did not wear blue, I subtract the number of adults who wore blue from the total number of adults.",
    "I calculate 15 - 5 = 10."
