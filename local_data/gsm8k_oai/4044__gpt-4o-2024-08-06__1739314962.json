  "query": "Janice gets paid $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works each week, and $15 each hour of overtime after that. If Janice works 60 hours one week, how much money does she make?",
  "steps": [
    "Janice works 60 hours in total for the week.",
    "She gets paid $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.",
    "To calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours, I multiply 40 hours by $10/hour.",
    "40 hours * $10/hour = $400.",
    "For the hours over 40, she is paid an overtime rate of $15 per hour.",
    "She worked 60 hours total, so the number of overtime hours is 60 - 40.",
    "60 - 40 = 20 overtime hours.",
    "To find her overtime pay, I multiply 20 hours by $15/hour.",
    "20 hours * $15/hour = $300.",
    "Now, I add her regular pay and her overtime pay to get the total earnings for the week.",
    "$400 + $300 = $700."
  ],
  "solution": "700"
