  "steps": [
    "Tom plans to take 10 dance lessons.",
    "Each lesson costs $10.",
    "Therefore, without any discounts, the total cost would be 10 lessons times $10 per lesson.",
    "I calculate 10 x $10 = $100.",
    "However, Tom gets two lessons for free.",
    "This means he only pays for 10 - 2 = 8 lessons.",
    "I recalculate the cost for 8 paid lessons.",
    "8 lessons times $10 per lesson results in 8 x $10 = $80.",
    "I double-check: paying for 8 lessons at $10 each totals $80."
