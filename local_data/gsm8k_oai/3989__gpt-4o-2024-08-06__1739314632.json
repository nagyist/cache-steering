  "steps": [
    "Ms. Jones received thank you cards from 30% of her class.",
    "Let x be the total number of students in her class.",
    "Then 0.3 * x will be the number of students who gave her thank you cards.",
    "1/3 of these thank you cards contain a gift card for $10.",
    "So, the number of $10 gift cards she received is (1/3) * (0.3 * x).",
    "She received $50 from these gift cards.",
    "Since each gift card is worth $10, the number of gift cards is $50 / $10 = 5.",
    "We can set up the equation: (1/3) * (0.3 * x) = 5.",
    "Solving for x: (0.1 * x) = 5.",
    "Divide both sides by 0.1 to solve for x: x = 5 / 0.1.",
    "x = 50."

  "solution": "50"
