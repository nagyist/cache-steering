  "query": "Trey has 7 times as many turtles as Kris. Kris has 1/4 as many turtles as Kristen has. How many more turtles does Trey have than Kristen, if Kristen has 12?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by finding out how many turtles Kris has.",
    "Kristen has 12 turtles.",
    "Kris has 1/4 as many turtles as Kristen.",
    "So, Kris has \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\) turtles.",
    "Now, calculate how many turtles Trey has.",
    "Trey has 7 times as many turtles as Kris.",
    "So, Trey has \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\) turtles.",
    "Finally, we need to find how many more turtles Trey has than Kristen.",
    "Trey has 21 turtles, and Kristen has 12 turtles.",
    "The difference is \\( 21 - 12 = 9 \\) turtles."
