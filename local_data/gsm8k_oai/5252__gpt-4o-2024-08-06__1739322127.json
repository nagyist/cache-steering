  "query": "A survey was conducted by a school to the parents about their children's online class experience. Fifteen percent of the respondents rated Excellent; 60% rated Very Satisfactory; 80% of the remaining respondents rated Satisfactory and the rest rated Needs Improvement. If 120 parents answered the survey, how many of them rated Needs Improvement?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many parents each percentage represents based on the total number of parents, which is 120.",
    "15% of the respondents rated Excellent.",
    "Calculating 15% of 120, I get 0.15 * 120 = 18 parents rated Excellent.",
    "Next, 60% of the respondents rated Very Satisfactory.",
    "Calculating 60% of 120, I get 0.60 * 120 = 72 parents rated Very Satisfactory.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many parents are left after accounting for those who rated Excellent and Very Satisfactory.",
    "The number of parents that rated either Excellent or Very Satisfactory is 18 + 72 = 90 parents.",
    "The remaining respondents are 120 - 90 = 30 parents.",
    "80% of the remaining respondents rated Satisfactory.",
    "Calculating 80% of 30, I get 0.80 * 30 = 24 parents rated Satisfactory.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many parents rated Needs Improvement.",
    "The rest of the remaining respondents rated Needs Improvement.",
    "Therefore, the number of parents who rated Needs Improvement is 30 - 24 = 6 parents."
