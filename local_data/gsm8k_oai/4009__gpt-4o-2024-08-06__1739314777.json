  "query": "Jim had 365 trading cards. He gives 8 sets of cards to his brother, 5 sets of cards to his sister, and 2 sets of cards to his friend. How many cards did he give away, assuming 1 set has 13 trading cards?",
  "steps": [
    "I know Jim gives 8 sets of cards to his brother.",
    "Each set contains 13 trading cards.",
    "So, Jim gives his brother 8 sets x 13 cards = 104 cards.",
    "Jim gives 5 sets of cards to his sister.",
    "Each set contains 13 trading cards.",
    "So, Jim gives his sister 5 sets x 13 cards = 65 cards.",
    "Jim gives 2 sets of cards to his friend.",
    "Each set contains 13 trading cards.",
    "So, Jim gives his friend 2 sets x 13 cards = 26 cards.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cards Jim gave away.",
    "Add the number of cards given to his brother, sister, and friend: 104 cards + 65 cards + 26 cards.",
    "104 + 65 is equal to 169.",
    "169 + 26 is equal to 195."

  "solution": "195"
