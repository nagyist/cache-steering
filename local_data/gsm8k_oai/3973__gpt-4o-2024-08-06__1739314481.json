  "query": "Jenny has 6 Pokemon cards. Orlando has 2 more cards than Jenny. Richard has three times as many cards as Orlando. How many Pokemon cards do they have in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many cards Orlando has.",
    "Jenny has 6 cards, and Orlando has 2 more cards than Jenny.",
    "So, Orlando has 6 + 2 = 8 cards.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many cards Richard has.",
    "Richard has three times as many cards as Orlando.",
    "Since Orlando has 8 cards, Richard has 3 * 8 = 24 cards.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of cards they all have.",
    "Jenny has 6 cards, Orlando has 8 cards, and Richard has 24 cards.",
    "To find the total, I add their cards together: 6 + 8 + 24.",
    "6 + 8 = 14",
    "14 + 24 = 38"

  "solution": "38"
