  "query": "James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?",
  "steps": [
    "James originally has 500 Legos in his collection.",
    "He uses half of these Legos to build a castle.",
    "Half of 500 Legos is 500 / 2 = 250 Legos.",
    "Therefore, after building, he has 250 unused Legos left.",
    "He is told to put the leftover Legos back in the box, but he can't find 5 pieces.",
    "If he has 250 Legos left but can't find 5, then he can only put back 250 - 5 = 245 Legos.",
    "So, there are 245 Legos in the box at the end."
