  "query": "There are 10 6-ounces of glasses that are only 4/5 full of water. How many ounces of water are needed to fill to the brim all those 10 glasses?",
  "steps": [
    "Each glass has a capacity of 6 ounces.",
    "Each glass is currently 4/5 full.",
    "To find the amount of water currently in one glass, multiply its full capacity by 4/5.",
    "6 ounces (full capacity) * 4/5 = 4.8 ounces.",
    "Currently, each glass contains 4.8 ounces of water.",
    "To find out how much more water is needed to fill one glass to the brim, subtract the current amount from the full capacity.",
    "6 ounces - 4.8 ounces = 1.2 ounces.",
    "Each glass needs an additional 1.2 ounces of water to be full.",
    "There are 10 glasses total.",
    "Multiply the ounces needed for one glass by the total number of glasses.",
    "1.2 ounces * 10 glasses = 12 ounces."
