  "query": "In the beginning, Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey but 2 fewer bands than Ylona. Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's establish some variables. Let B represent the number of rubber bands Bailey had initially.",
    "According to the problem, after Bailey gave away rubber bands, he had 8 left. He gave 2 bands each to Justine and Ylona, so he gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 bands.",
    "This means Bailey originally had B = 8 + 4 = 12 rubber bands.",
    "The problem states that Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey initially. Therefore, Justine had B + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 rubber bands initially.",
    "The problem also states that Justine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona initially. Hence, Ylona had J + 2 rubber bands initially where J is the number of bands Justine had.",
    "We have already calculated Justine's initial number of bands as 22. Therefore, Ylona had 22 + 2 = 24 rubber bands initially."
