  "query": "Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, who with a time of 6 minutes is one-third as fast a runner as Tom.  What are all three of their mile times when added together?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Tom's running time for one mile. Tina's time is 6 minutes, and she runs one-third as fast as Tom. This implies Tom is three times faster than Tina.",
    "Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if Tina is one-third as fast, Tom's time must be one-third of Tina's time.",
    "Tina's time is 6 minutes, so Tom's time is 6 minutes / 3 = 2 minutes per mile.",
    "Next, I need to determine Tony's running time. Tony runs twice as fast as Tina.",
    "Again, since speed is inversely proportional to time, if Tony is twice as fast as Tina, his time must be half of Tina's time.",
    "Tina's time is 6 minutes, so Tony's time is 6 minutes / 2 = 3 minutes per mile.",
    "Now, I have each person's times: Tom's time is 2 minutes, Tina's time is 6 minutes, and Tony's time is 3 minutes.",
    "To find the sum of all three times, I will add them together: 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 3 minutes.",
    "The sum of their times is 11 minutes."

  "solution": "11"
