  "query": "Darren bought 4 boxes of crackers. Each box contained 24 crackers. If Calvin bought one box less than twice as many boxes of crackers as Darren, how many crackers did they buy altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of crackers Darren bought.",
    "Darren bought 4 boxes and each box contained 24 crackers.",
    "Calculate the total number of crackers Darren bought: 4 boxes * 24 crackers/box = 96 crackers.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many boxes Calvin bought.",
    "Calvin bought one box less than twice as many boxes as Darren.",
    "Twice as many boxes as Darren means 2 * 4 boxes = 8 boxes.",
    "One box less than 8 boxes is 8 - 1 = 7 boxes.",
    "Now, calculate the number of crackers Calvin bought.",
    "Calvin bought 7 boxes and each box contained 24 crackers.",
    "Calculate the total number of crackers Calvin bought: 7 boxes * 24 crackers/box = 168 crackers.",
    "Finally, add the total crackers bought by both Darren and Calvin.",
    "Darren bought 96 crackers and Calvin bought 168 crackers.",
    "The total number of crackers they bought altogether is 96 + 168.",
    "Calculate the total: 96 + 168 = 264."

  "solution": "264"
