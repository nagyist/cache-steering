  "query": "OpenAI runs a robotics competition that limits the weight of each robot. Each robot can be no more than twice the minimum weight and no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. The standard robot weighs 100 pounds. What is the maximum weight of a robot in the competition?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that each robot can be no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot.",
    "The standard robot weighs 100 pounds.",
    "To find the minimum weight that is allowed, we add 5 pounds to the standard robot's weight.",
    "100 pounds + 5 pounds = 105 pounds. So, the minimum weight allowed is 105 pounds.",
    "The problem also states that each robot can weigh no more than twice this minimum weight.",
    "Twice the minimum weight of 105 pounds would give us the maximum weight allowed.",
    "2 \u00d7 105 pounds = 210 pounds.",
    "Therefore, the maximum weight a robot in the competition can be is 210 pounds."

  "solution": "210"
