  "steps": [
    "I know that Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number of home runs that Dave Winfield has.",
    "Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs in his career.",
    "I need to set up an equation to represent this information. Let Dave Winfield's home run total be represented by D.",
    "The equation based on the given information would be: 2D - 175 = 755.",
    "I need to solve for D. First, I will add 175 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with D.",
    "After adding 175 to both sides, the equation becomes: 2D = 755 + 175.",
    "Calculating the right side, we get: 755 + 175 = 930.",
    "The equation is now: 2D = 930.",
    "Next, I divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for D.",
    "Performing the division, I get: D = 930 / 2.",
    "The result of the division is: D = 465."
