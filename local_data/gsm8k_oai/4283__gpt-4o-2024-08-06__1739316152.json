  "query": "Eddie can bake 3 pies a day. His sister can bake 6 pies while his mother can bake 8 pies a day. How many pies will they be able to bake in 7 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pies Eddie can bake in one week (7 days).",
    "Eddie bakes 3 pies per day.",
    "In 7 days, Eddie will bake 3 pies/day * 7 days = 21 pies.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many pies Eddie's sister can bake in 7 days.",
    "Eddie's sister bakes 6 pies per day.",
    "In 7 days, she will bake 6 pies/day * 7 days = 42 pies.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many pies Eddie's mother can bake in 7 days.",
    "Eddie's mother bakes 8 pies per day.",
    "In 7 days, she will bake 8 pies/day * 7 days = 56 pies.",
    "Now, I will add up the total number of pies they can bake together in 7 days.",
    "Eddie can bake 21 pies, his sister can bake 42 pies, and his mother can bake 56 pies.",
    "The total number of pies is 21 pies + 42 pies + 56 pies = 119 pies."
