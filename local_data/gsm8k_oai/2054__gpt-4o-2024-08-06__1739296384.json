  "query": "A new book sold 15 copies at the bookstore on Wednesday. On Thursday the book sold three times that many copies. On Friday the book sold one-fifth the number of copies it did on Thursday. How many copies of the book did the bookstore sell by Friday?",
  "steps": [
    "The book sold 15 copies on Wednesday.",
    "On Thursday, the book sold three times as many copies as it did on Wednesday.",
    "To find the number of copies sold on Thursday, I multiply the number of copies sold on Wednesday by 3: \\(15 \\times 3 = 45\\).",
    "The book sold 45 copies on Thursday.",
    "On Friday, the book sold one-fifth the number of copies it did on Thursday.",
    "To find the number of copies sold on Friday, I divide the number of copies sold on Thursday by 5: \\(45 \\div 5 = 9\\).",
    "The book sold 9 copies on Friday.",
    "Now, I add the copies sold on each day to find the total number of copies sold by Friday.",
    "Total copies sold = Wednesday's copies + Thursday's copies + Friday's copies = \\(15 + 45 + 9\\).",
    "Calculate the total: \\(15 + 45 + 9 = 69\\)."

  "solution": "69"
