  "query": "Every 10 seconds, there is a car collision, and every 20 seconds there is a big crash. How many accidents overall will happen in 4 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to convert the time from minutes to seconds because the events are given per second.",
    "4 minutes is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 seconds.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many car collisions occur in 240 seconds.",
    "A car collision occurs every 10 seconds.",
    "To find the number of car collisions, divide the total time by the interval for collisions: 240 seconds / 10 seconds = 24 collisions.",
    "Now, I'll determine how many big crashes occur in 240 seconds.",
    "A big crash occurs every 20 seconds.",
    "To find the number of big crashes, divide the total time by the interval for crashes: 240 seconds / 20 seconds = 12 crashes.",
    "Every crash and collision is counted as an accident.",
    "To find the total number of accidents, sum the number of collisions and big crashes.",
    "I need to verify if there are any overlaps (such as simultaneous incidents) that should be counted, but since these are independent, I simply add them.",
    "Adding the collisions and crashes: 24 (collisions) + 12 (crashes) = 36 accidents."
