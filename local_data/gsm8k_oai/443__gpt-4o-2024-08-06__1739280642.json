  "query": "Sab and Dane sold 6 pairs of shoes that cost $3 each and 18 shirts that cost $2. How much will each of them earn if they divided their total earning?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the shoes.",
    "There are 6 pairs of shoes, each costing $3.",
    "So, the total cost for the shoes is 6 pairs * $3 per pair = $18.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the shirts.",
    "There are 18 shirts, each costing $2.",
    "So, the total cost for the shirts is 18 shirts * $2 per shirt = $36.",
    "Now, I need to add the total costs of shoes and shirts to find the total earnings.",
    "Total earnings = $18 (shoes) + $36 (shirts) = $54.",
    "Sab and Dane are dividing the total earnings equally.",
    "To find how much each of them will earn, I need to divide the total earnings by 2.",
    "So, each of them will earn $54 / 2 = $27."
