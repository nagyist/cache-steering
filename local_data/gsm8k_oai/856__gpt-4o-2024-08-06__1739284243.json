  "query": "Randy has some money in his piggy bank. He spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. He makes 4 trips to the store every month. If he had $104 dollars left in his piggy bank after a year, how much money, in dollars, did he have at first?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how much money Randy spends each month. He spends $2 every time he goes to the store.",
    "Randy goes to the store 4 times a month.",
    "So, he spends 2 dollars/trip multiplied by 4 trips/month, which equals 8 dollars per month.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year.",
    "Randy spends 8 dollars/month times 12 months/year, which equals 96 dollars per year.",
    "I know he has $104 left after a year of spending.",
    "To find out how much he had initially, I need to add the amount he has left to the amount he spent.",
    "$104 (money left) + $96 (money spent) equals $200."

  "solution": "200"
