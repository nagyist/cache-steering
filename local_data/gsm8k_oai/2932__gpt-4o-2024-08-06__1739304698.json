  "query": "Walmart sells a multitool with a screwdriver, 3 knives, and two other tools. Target sells a multitool with a screwdriver, twice as many knives as Walmart, three files and a pair of scissors. How many more tools does the Target multitool have compared to Walmart?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of tools in the Walmart multitool.",
    "Walmart's multitool has 1 screwdriver, 3 knives, and 2 other tools.",
    "Counting these, Walmart's multitool has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 tools in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine the number of tools in the Target multitool.",
    "The Target multitool has a screwdriver, twice as many knives as Walmart, which is 3 * 2 = 6 knives.",
    "Additionally, it includes 3 files and a pair of scissors.",
    "So, the total for Target is 1 screwdriver + 6 knives + 3 files + 1 pair of scissors = 11 tools.",
    "I need to find out how many more tools the Target multitool has compared to Walmart.",
    "Subtract the number of tools in Walmart's multitool from the number of tools in Target's multitool: 11 - 6 = 5."
