  "query": "James can make 4 hats out of one yard of velvet. He needs three yards of velvet to make a cloak. How much velvet does he need to make 6 cloaks and 12 hats?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much velvet is required to make one cloak.",
    "The problem states that James needs three yards of velvet to make one cloak.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much velvet is needed for 6 cloaks.",
    "To do this, I will multiply the amount of velvet needed for one cloak by the number of cloaks: 3 yards/cloak \u00d7 6 cloaks = 18 yards.",
    "Now, I have to calculate how much velvet is necessary to make one hat.",
    "The problem specifies that 4 hats can be made from 1 yard of velvet.",
    "This means 1 hat requires 1/4 of a yard of velvet.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much velvet is needed for 12 hats.",
    "I use the amount of velvet needed for one hat and multiply by the number of hats: (1/4) yards/hat \u00d7 12 hats = 3 yards.",
    "I now have the velvet requirements for both the cloaks and the hats.",
    "The total velvet required is the sum of the velvet needed for the cloaks and the velvet needed for the hats: 18 yards + 3 yards = 21 yards."
