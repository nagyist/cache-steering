  "query": "A library has a collection of 100 historical novels arranged on a shelf. 5 people borrow 2 books each from the shelf on a particular day,  and 20 more books are borrowed from the shelf on the second day. How many books are remaining on the shelf after the second day?",
  "steps": [
    "The library starts with a collection of 100 historical novels.",
    "On the first day, 5 people each borrow 2 books.",
    "5 people times 2 books per person equals 10 books borrowed on the first day.",
    "Subtracting the 10 books borrowed on the first day from the original 100 books results in 90 books remaining after the first day.",
    "On the second day, 20 more books are borrowed from the shelf.",
    "Subtracting these 20 books from the 90 books remaining after the first day gives us the total number of books remaining after the second day.",
    "90 books minus 20 books equals 70 books."

  "solution": "70"
