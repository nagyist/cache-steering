  "query": "A rectangular plot of private property is fenced in by a chain-link fence. The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?",
  "steps": [
    "The total perimeter of the fence is 640 feet.",
    "Let the length of the short side be \\( x \\).",
    "The length of the long side is three times the length of the short side, so it is \\( 3x \\).",
    "A rectangle has two short sides and two long sides.",
    "The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \\( 2 \\times (\\text{short side} + \\text{long side}) \\).",
    "Substitute the known values into the formula: \\( 2(x + 3x) = 640 \\).",
    "Simplify inside the parenthesis: \\( x + 3x = 4x \\).",
    "The equation becomes \\( 2 \\times 4x = 640 \\).",
    "Simplify the equation: \\( 8x = 640 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 8: \\( x = 640 / 8 \\).",
    "Calculate: \\( x = 80 \\).",
    "Each short side is 80 feet long.",
    "The problem states that one short side needs to be replaced."
