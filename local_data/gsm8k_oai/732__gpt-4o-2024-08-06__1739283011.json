  "query": "If a tarantula has eight legs, and one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, how many baby tarantula legs would be in one less than 5 egg sacs?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many tarantulas are in one egg sac. According to the question, one egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of tarantulas in \"one less than 5 egg sacs.\" So, I need to find the number of tarantulas in 4 egg sacs.",
    "If one egg sac contains 1000 tarantulas, then 4 egg sacs contain \\(4 \\times 1000 = 4000\\) tarantulas.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the number of legs in these 4000 tarantulas. Since each tarantula has 8 legs, I multiply the number of tarantulas by the number of legs each has: \\(4000 \\times 8\\).",
    "Calculate the multiplication: \\(4000 \\times 8 = 32000\\)."

  "solution": "32000"
