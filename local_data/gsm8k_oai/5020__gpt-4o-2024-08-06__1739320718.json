  "query": "Alice was able to sell $2500 worth of gadgets. For this month, she expects to receive her monthly basic salary of $240 and a 2% commission from these sales. How much is she going to save this month if she usually saves 10% of her total earnings?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Alice's commission from her sales.",
    "The commission rate is 2%.",
    "The total sales amount is $2500.",
    "To find the commission in dollars, I'll multiply $2500 by 2% (or 0.02).",
    "$2500 * 0.02 equals $50.",
    "So, Alice's commission from sales is $50.",
    "Now, I need to calculate Alice's total earnings for the month.",
    "Alice's monthly basic salary is $240.",
    "I'll add her commission ($50) to her basic salary ($240).",
    "$240 + $50 equals $290.",
    "So, Alice's total earnings for the month is $290.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much Alice saves.",
    "She saves 10% of her total earnings.",
    "I'll multiply her total earnings ($290) by 10% (or 0.10).",
    "$290 * 0.10 equals $29.",
    "Therefore, Alice is going to save $29 this month."
