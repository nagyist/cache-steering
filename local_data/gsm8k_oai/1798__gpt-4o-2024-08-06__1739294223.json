  "query": "John injures his shoulder while lifting weights.  After the injury, his bench press goes down 80%.  After a bit of training, he manages to triple the weight he can bench.  If he started with a 500-pound bench press, what is it now?",
  "steps": [
    "John initially has a 500-pound bench press.",
    "Due to the injury, his bench press goes down 80%.",
    "To calculate the 80% reduction, I need to find 80% of 500 pounds.",
    "80% of 500 pounds is 0.8 * 500 = 400 pounds.",
    "After the injury, his bench press is reduced by 400 pounds.",
    "To find his new bench press weight, I subtract 400 pounds from 500 pounds.",
    "500 - 400 = 100 pounds.",
    "John's bench press is reduced to 100 pounds after the injury.",
    "After some training, John manages to triple the weight he can bench.",
    "To find the new bench press weight after tripling, I multiply 100 pounds by 3.",
    "100 * 3 = 300 pounds.",
    "John's bench press is now 300 pounds after tripling the post-injury weight."
