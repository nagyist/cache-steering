  "query": "A new edition Geometry book has 450 pages which are 230 pages less than twice as many pages as the old edition. How many pages did the old edition Geometry book have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of pages in the old edition be represented as \\( x \\).",
    "According to the problem, twice as many pages as the old edition is \\( 2x \\).",
    "The problem also states that the new edition has 230 pages less than twice the pages of the old edition.",
    "This means the equation can be written as \\( 2x - 230 = 450 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I need to solve this equation for \\( x \\).",
    "First, add 230 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\).",
    "So, \\( 2x = 450 + 230 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 450 + 230 \\).",
    "\\( 450 + 230 = 680 \\).",
    "Now, the equation is \\( 2x = 680 \\).",
    "Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \\( x \\).",
    "\\( x = \\frac{680}{2} \\).",
    "Calculate \\( \\frac{680}{2} \\).",
    "\\( \\frac{680}{2} = 340 \\).",
    "Therefore, the old edition Geometry book had 340 pages."
