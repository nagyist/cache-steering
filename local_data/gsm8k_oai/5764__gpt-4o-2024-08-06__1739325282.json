  "query": "Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the second lady walked four miles.",
    "It also states that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.",
    "To find out how far the first lady walked, multiply the distance the second lady walked by two.",
    "4 miles (second lady's distance) multiplied by 2 equals 8 miles.",
    "The first lady walked 8 miles and the second lady walked 4 miles.",
    "To find the total distance both ladies walked, add the distance each walked together.",
    "8 miles (first lady) plus 4 miles (second lady) equals 12 miles."

  "solution": "12"
