  "query": "A bathroom has 10 6 inch tiles along its width and 20 6 inch tiles along its length.  What is the square footage of the bathroom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the dimensions of the bathroom in inches.",
    "The width of the bathroom is 10 tiles times 6 inches per tile, which equals 60 inches.",
    "Similarly, the length of the bathroom is 20 tiles times 6 inches per tile, which equals 120 inches.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the area of the bathroom in square inches.",
    "The area is the width times the length, so it's 60 inches times 120 inches.",
    "60 times 120 equals 7200 square inches.",
    "Now, I need to convert square inches to square feet.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot, so a square foot is 12 inches by 12 inches, which equals 144 square inches.",
    "To convert square inches to square feet, I need to divide the area in square inches by 144.",
    "7200 divided by 144 equals 50."

  "solution": "50"
