  "query": "10 people attended class on Monday, 15 on Tuesday, and 10 on each day from Wednesday through Friday. What was the average number of people who attended class each day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total number of people who attended class over all the days.",
    "On Monday, 10 people attended.",
    "On Tuesday, 15 people attended.",
    "From Wednesday to Friday, 10 people attended each day.",
    "So, for three days from Wednesday to Friday, a total of 3 days * 10 people = 30 people attended.",
    "Now, I add up the total attendance for all five days: 10 (Monday) + 15 (Tuesday) + 30 (Wednesday to Friday).",
    "10 + 15 + 30 equals 55.",
    "The total number of days is 5.",
    "To find the average, I need to divide the total number of people by the number of days.",
    "55 divided by 5 equals 11."
