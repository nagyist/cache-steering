  "query": "In a town, there is a multi-story parking lot, which has room for 425 cars. The parking lot has 5 levels, each of the same size. How many more cars can one level fit if there are already 23 parked cars on that level?",
  "steps": [
    "The parking lot can hold a total of 425 cars.",
    "There are 5 levels, and each level is the same size.",
    "To find out how many cars can fit on one level, I need to divide the total number of cars by the number of levels.",
    "425 cars divided by 5 levels equals 85 cars per level.",
    "I want to know how many more cars one level can fit, given there are already 23 cars parked on that level.",
    "I need to subtract the number of parked cars (23) from the capacity of one level (85).",
    "85 cars per level minus 23 cars already parked equals 62 additional cars that can be parked on that level."

  "solution": "62"
