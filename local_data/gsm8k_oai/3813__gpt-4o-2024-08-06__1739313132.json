  "query": "Carmen burns a candle for 1 hour every night.  A candle will last her 8 nights.  If she burns the candle for 2 hours a night, how many candles will she use over 24 nights?",
  "steps": [
    "Carmen currently burns a candle for 1 hour every night, and it lasts for 8 nights.",
    "Therefore, the total burn time of one candle is 8 hours.",
    "Now, if Carmen burns the candle for 2 hours each night, I need to determine how long one candle will last in terms of nights.",
    "Since the total burn time of one candle is 8 hours, and she burns it for 2 hours each night, the candle will last 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 nights.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many candles she will use over the course of 24 nights at this rate.",
    "If each candle lasts for 4 nights, then she will use 24 \u00f7 4 candles over 24 nights.",
    "Calculating 24 \u00f7 4 gives 6 candles."

  "solution": "6"
