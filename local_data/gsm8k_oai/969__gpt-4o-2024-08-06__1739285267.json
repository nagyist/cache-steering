  "query": "Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake. If Lassie Lake has forty-five frogs, how many frogs are there in total in the two lakes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many frogs Lassie Lake has.",
    "Lassie Lake has 45 frogs.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many frogs Lake Crystal has.",
    "Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake.",
    "Twenty percent of 45 frogs is calculated as 0.20 * 45.",
    "0.20 * 45 = 9.",
    "Lake Crystal has 9 fewer frogs than Lassie Lake.",
    "Subtract 9 from 45 to find out the number of frogs in Lake Crystal.",
    "45 - 9 = 36.",
    "Lake Crystal has 36 frogs.",
    "Now, add the number of frogs in both lakes together.",
    "45 (Lassie Lake) + 36 (Lake Crystal) = 81.",
    "The total number of frogs in both lakes is 81."

  "solution": "81"
