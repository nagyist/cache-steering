  "query": "There are 7 trucks that have 20 boxes. There are 5 trucks that have 12 boxes. Each box holds 8 containers of oil. If all of the oil is evenly redistributed onto 10 trucks, how many containers of oil will each truck have?",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the first group of trucks: there are 7 trucks, each with 20 boxes.",
    "Calculate the total number of boxes from these 7 trucks: 7 trucks * 20 boxes per truck = 140 boxes.",
    "Consider the second group of trucks: there are 5 trucks, each with 12 boxes.",
    "Calculate the total number of boxes from these 5 trucks: 5 trucks * 12 boxes per truck = 60 boxes.",
    "Add the total number of boxes from both groups of trucks: 140 boxes + 60 boxes = 200 boxes.",
    "Each box holds 8 containers of oil.",
    "Calculate the total number of containers of oil from all boxes: 200 boxes * 8 containers per box = 1600 containers of oil.",
    "The total number of containers of oil needs to be evenly distributed to 10 trucks.",
    "Divide the total number of containers of oil by the number of trucks: 1600 containers / 10 trucks.",
    "1600 containers / 10 trucks = 160 containers."
  ],
  "solution": "160"
