  "query": "Out of 480 employees, 10% got a salary increase while 20% got a travel allowance increase. How many employees did not get any increase?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many employees received a salary increase.",
    "10% of 480 employees received a salary increase.",
    "10/100 * 480 = 48 employees got a salary increase.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many employees received a travel allowance increase.",
    "20% of 480 employees received a travel allowance increase.",
    "20/100 * 480 = 96 employees got a travel allowance increase.",
    "Now, I have to consider the possibility of overlap, meaning some employees might have received both a salary increase and a travel allowance increase. However, that information is not provided, so just considering separate groups is not enough.",
    "Let's assume that the number of employees who got either a salary increase or a travel allowance increase (or both) needs to be found using set logic.",
    "Using the formula for the union of these two sets: Total who got at least one increase = Employees with salary increase + Employees with travel allowance increase - Employees with both increases",
    "I currently know that 48 employees had a salary increase and 96 had a travel allowance increase. But I need to subtract the overlap (employees who got both increases) to find out those who got at least one increase.",
    "Without specific overlap data, I'll assume their maximum possible overlap is 0. Therefore, the total with at least one increase is 48 + 96 = 144.",
    "Now calculate the number of employees who did not receive any increase by subtracting the total number of employees with at least one increase from the total number of employees.",
    "480 (total employees) - 144 (employees who got at least one increase) = 336 employees who did not get any increase."
