  "query": "Alina and her best friend Lucia like to chat a lot. On a particular day, Alina sent 20 fewer messages than her friend Lucia, who sent 120 messages. The next day, Lucia sent 1/3 of the messages she sent the previous day, while Alina doubled the messages she sent on the first day. If they sent the same number of messages on the third day as the first day, what is the total number of messages they sent in those three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many messages Alina sent on the first day.",
    "Lucia sent 120 messages on the first day. Alina sent 20 fewer messages than Lucia.",
    "So, Alina sent 120 - 20 = 100 messages on the first day.",
    "Next, let's calculate the messages for the second day.",
    "Lucia sent 1/3 of the messages she sent on the previous day. So, she sent 120 / 3 = 40 messages on the second day.",
    "Alina doubled the messages she sent on the first day, so she sent 2 * 100 = 200 messages on the second day.",
    "On the third day, both sent the same number of messages as they sent on the first day.",
    "Therefore, Lucia sent 120 messages and Alina sent 100 messages on the third day.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total messages sent over the three days for both Alina and Lucia.",
    "The total number of messages Alina sent over three days is 100 (first day) + 200 (second day) + 100 (third day) = 400.",
    "The total number of messages Lucia sent over three days is 120 (first day) + 40 (second day) + 120 (third day) = 280.",
    "Finally, the total number of messages they both sent over the three days is 400 (Alina) + 280 (Lucia) = 680."
