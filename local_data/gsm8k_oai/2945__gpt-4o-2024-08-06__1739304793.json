  "query": "Polly and Peter play chess. Polly takes an average of 28 seconds per move, while Peter takes an average of 40 seconds per move. The match ends after 30 moves. How many minutes did the match last?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time Polly takes for her moves.",
    "Polly's average time per move is 28 seconds.",
    "Since the match is 30 moves, Polly makes half of these moves, which is 15 moves.",
    "Polly's total time is 15 moves x 28 seconds per move.",
    "15 x 28 = 420 seconds.",
    "Next, I need to determine the total time Peter takes for his moves.",
    "Peter's average time per move is 40 seconds.",
    "Peter also makes 15 moves.",
    "Peter's total time is 15 moves x 40 seconds per move.",
    "15 x 40 = 600 seconds.",
    "Now, I sum Polly's and Peter's total times to find the duration of the match in seconds.",
    "Total time = 420 seconds (Polly) + 600 seconds (Peter).",
    "Total time = 1020 seconds.",
    "Now I need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes.",
    "There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "1020 seconds \u00f7 60 seconds per minute = 17 minutes."

  "solution": "17"
