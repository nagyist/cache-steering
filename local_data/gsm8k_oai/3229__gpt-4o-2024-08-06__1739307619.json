  "query": "Stanley sold 4 cups of lemonade an hour. His brother, Carl, sold 7 cups of lemonade an hour. How many more cups did Carl sell than Stanley in 3 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cups Stanley sold in 3 hours.",
    "Stanley sold 4 cups per hour.",
    "In 3 hours, Stanley sold 4 cups/hour * 3 hours = 12 cups.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many cups Carl sold in 3 hours.",
    "Carl sold 7 cups per hour.",
    "In 3 hours, Carl sold 7 cups/hour * 3 hours = 21 cups.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many more cups Carl sold than Stanley.",
    "I subtract the number of cups Stanley sold from the number Carl sold: 21 cups - 12 cups.",
    "21 cups - 12 cups = 9 cups."
