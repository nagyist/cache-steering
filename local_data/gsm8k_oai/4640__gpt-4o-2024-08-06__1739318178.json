  "query": "Teresa is collecting pencils. She has 14 colored pencils and 35 black pencils. Her three younger siblings need pencils for class and their dad asks her to share all her pencils, giving each an equal number of pencils, regardless of color. He tells her she can keep 10 of them for herself. How many pencils does each sibling get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I should calculate the total number of pencils Teresa has.",
    "She has 14 colored pencils and 35 black pencils.",
    "So, I add those together: 14 + 35 = 49 pencils.",
    "Teresa gets to keep 10 pencils for herself.",
    "Subtract the 10 pencils she keeps from the total: 49 - 10 = 39 pencils.",
    "These 39 pencils need to be divided equally among her three siblings.",
    "To find out how many pencils each sibling gets, I divide 39 by 3.",
    "39 \u00f7 3 = 13.",
    "Each sibling gets 13 pencils."
  ],
  "solution": "13"
