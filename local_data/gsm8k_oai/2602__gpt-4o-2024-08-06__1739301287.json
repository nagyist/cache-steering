  "query": "Marissa is serving her kids lunch. Each kid gets a burger with 400 calories and 5 carrot sticks with 20 calories each, and some cookies with 50 calories each. Marissa wants each kid to eat a total of 750 calories for lunch. How many cookies does each kid get?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total calories from the burger and the carrot sticks.",
    "Each burger has 400 calories.",
    "Each carrot stick has 20 calories, and each kid gets 5 carrot sticks.",
    "So, the calories from the carrot sticks are 5 sticks * 20 calories each = 100 calories.",
    "Now, I will add the calories from the burger and the carrot sticks.",
    "Calories from the burger and carrot sticks together are 400 calories + 100 calories = 500 calories.",
    "Marissa wants each kid to eat a total of 750 calories.",
    "I need to calculate how many calories need to be provided by the cookies.",
    "The total calorie goal per kid is 750 calories, and they already have 500 calories from the burger and carrot sticks.",
    "Calories needed from cookies = 750 calories - 500 calories = 250 calories.",
    "Each cookie has 50 calories.",
    "To find the number of cookies, divide the needed calories by the calories per cookie.",
    "Number of cookies = 250 calories / 50 calories per cookie = 5 cookies."
