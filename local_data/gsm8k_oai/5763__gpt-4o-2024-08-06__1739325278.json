  "query": "In a fundraiser car wash activity, the 5th graders raised $147 on Friday. On Saturday, they made $7 more than twice their Friday earnings. Their earnings on Sunday are $78 more than their earnings on Friday. How much did they earn in three days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much the 5th graders made on Saturday. I know they made $7 more than twice their Friday earnings.",
    "Their earnings on Friday were $147. So, I need to calculate twice the Friday earnings.",
    "Twice $147 is $294 (because 147 * 2 = 294).",
    "Now, I need to figure out $7 more than $294.",
    "Adding $7 to $294 gives $301 (because 294 + 7 = 301).",
    "The 5th graders' earnings on Saturday were $301.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much they earned on Sunday. I know that their Sunday earnings are $78 more than their Friday earnings.",
    "Since their Friday earnings were $147, I will add $78 to this amount.",
    "Adding $78 to $147 gives $225 (because 147 + 78 = 225).",
    "The earnings on Sunday were $225.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total earnings over the three days by adding together the amounts from each day.",
    "The earnings over the three days are $147 on Friday, $301 on Saturday, and $225 on Sunday.",
    "I need to add $147, $301, and $225 together.",
    "$147 + $301 = $448.",
    "Then, $448 + $225 = $673.",
    "The total earnings over the three days are $673."

  "solution": "673"
