  "query": "Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many legos Bruce has. I know that Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent.",
    "Kent has 40 legos.",
    "Therefore, Bruce has 40 + 20 = 60 legos.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many legos Simon has. Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce.",
    "To find 20% of Bruce's legos, I calculate 20% of 60.",
    "20% of 60 is 0.20 * 60 = 12.",
    "Simon has 60 + 12 = 72 legos."
