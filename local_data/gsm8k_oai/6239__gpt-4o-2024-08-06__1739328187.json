  "query": "Vlad is 6 feet, 3 inches tall. His younger sister is 2 feet, 10 inches tall. How many inches taller is Vlad than his sister?",
  "steps": [
    "I understand that Vlad is 6 feet, 3 inches tall.",
    "I need to convert Vlad's height entirely to inches.",
    "There are 12 inches in a foot.",
    "Vlad's height in feet is 6 feet.",
    "6 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot equals 72 inches.",
    "I need to add the extra 3 inches to Vlad's total height in inches.",
    "72 inches plus 3 inches equals 75 inches.",
    "Vlad's total height is 75 inches.",
    "Now, I need to convert his sister's height to inches as well.",
    "His sister's height is 2 feet, 10 inches tall.",
    "2 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot equals 24 inches.",
    "I need to add the extra 10 inches to his sister's total height in inches.",
    "24 inches plus 10 inches equals 34 inches.",
    "His sister's total height is 34 inches.",
    "I need to find the difference in height between Vlad and his sister.",
    "75 inches minus 34 inches equals 41 inches."
