  "query": "Ali, Peter, and Joey were fishing. The fish Ali caught weighed, in sum, twice as much as the fish that Peter caught. Joey caught 1 kg more fish than Peter. Together the three of them caught 25 kg of fish. How many kilograms did Ali catch?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the weight of the fish Ali caught as A, the weight of the fish Peter caught as P, and the weight of the fish Joey caught as J.",
    "According to the problem, Ali's fish weigh twice as much as Peter's fish. This can be written as: A = 2P.",
    "The problem also states that Joey caught 1 kg more than Peter. We can express this as: J = P + 1.",
    "The total weight of fish caught by Ali, Peter, and Joey is 25 kg. Thus, we can write: A + P + J = 25.",
    "Now we have three equations:\n1) A = 2P\n2) J = P + 1\n3) A + P + J = 25",
    "Substitute A = 2P and J = P + 1 into the equation A + P + J = 25.",
    "This gives us: 2P + P + (P + 1) = 25.",
    "Simplify the equation: 4P + 1 = 25.",
    "Subtract 1 from both sides: 4P = 24.",
    "Divide both sides by 4: P = 6.",
    "Since A = 2P, substitute P = 6 into A = 2P: A = 2 * 6 = 12.",
    "Thus, Ali caught 12 kg of fish."
