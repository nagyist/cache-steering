  "query": "Tom is playing a game and gets 10 points for killing an enemy.  If he kills at least 100 enemies he gets a 50% bonus to his score.  What was his total score if he killed 150 enemies?",
  "steps": [
    "I am given that Tom gets 10 points for each enemy he kills.",
    "Tom killed 150 enemies.",
    "First, I need to calculate the score without the bonus.",
    "I will multiply the number of enemies killed by the points per enemy.",
    "150 enemies multiplied by 10 points each equals 1500 points.",
    "I need to determine if Tom gets a bonus.",
    "He gets a bonus if he kills at least 100 enemies.",
    "Tom killed 150 enemies, which is more than 100.",
    "He qualifies for the 50% bonus.",
    "To calculate the bonus, I take 50% of the original score.",
    "50% of 1500 is calculated by multiplying 1500 by 0.5.",
    "1500 multiplied by 0.5 is 750.",
    "Now, I need to add the bonus to the original score to get the total score.",
    "The total score is 1500 plus 750.",
    "1500 plus 750 equals 2250."

  "solution": "2250"
