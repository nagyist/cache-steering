  "query": "A band's members each earn $20 per gig. If there are 4 members and they've earned $400, how many gigs have they played?",
  "steps": [
    "The total amount earned by the band is given as $400.",
    "The band comprises 4 members.",
    "Each member earns $20 per gig.",
    "First, I need to find out how much money the entire band earns per gig. Since each member earns $20 per gig and there are 4 members, the total earnings per gig for the band is 4 members times $20 per member.",
    "4 members times $20 per member equals $80 per gig for the band.",
    "Now, to determine how many gigs they have played, I need to divide the total amount earned by the band, which is $400, by the earnings per gig, which is $80.",
    "$400 divided by $80 equals 5."

  "solution": "5"
