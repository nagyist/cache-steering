  "query": "Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many red erasers Tanya has.",
    "Tanya has 20 erasers and half of them are red.",
    "Half of 20 is 10, so Tanya has 10 red erasers.",
    "Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.",
    "One-half of the number of red erasers Tanya has is 10 divided by 2, which is 5.",
    "Rachel has three less than this amount, so Rachel has 5 - 3 = 2 erasers.",
    "Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.",
    "Twice of 2 is 2 \u00d7 2, which equals 4."

  "solution": "4"
