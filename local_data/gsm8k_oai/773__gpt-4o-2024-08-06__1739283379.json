  "query": "Amoli and Anayet must travel 369 miles together. Amoli drove 42 miles an hour for 3 hours and Anayet drove at 61 miles an hour for 2 hours. How many miles do they still need to travel?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the distance Amoli traveled.",
    "Amoli drove for 3 hours at a speed of 42 miles per hour.",
    "Distance traveled by Amoli = 42 miles/hour * 3 hours = 126 miles.",
    "Next, I will calculate the distance Anayet traveled.",
    "Anayet drove for 2 hours at a speed of 61 miles per hour.",
    "Distance traveled by Anayet = 61 miles/hour * 2 hours = 122 miles.",
    "Now, I will add the distances traveled by both Amoli and Anayet to find the total distance traveled so far.",
    "Total distance traveled = Amoli's distance + Anayet's distance = 126 miles + 122 miles = 248 miles.",
    "The total distance they need to travel is 369 miles.",
    "I will subtract the distance they have already traveled from the total distance to find the remaining distance.",
    "Remaining distance to travel = 369 miles - 248 miles = 121 miles."

  "solution": "121"
