  "query": "Heather helps her neighbour pick weeds out of her garden. She gets paid 5 cents for every weed she picks. On average, how many seconds can she take to pick a weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cents Heather needs to earn in an hour to make $10.",
    "Since 1 dollar equals 100 cents, $10 is equal to 1000 cents.",
    "This means Heather needs to earn 1000 cents in an hour to make $10.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many weeds Heather must pick to earn 1000 cents.",
    "Heather gets paid 5 cents for each weed. Therefore, I need to divide 1000 cents by 5 cents per weed.",
    "1000 divided by 5 equals 200. This means Heather needs to pick 200 weeds in an hour.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "60 multiplied by 60 equals 3600 seconds in an hour.",
    "Next, I want to determine how many seconds Heather can take per weed, knowing she has 3600 seconds total and needs to pick 200 weeds.",
    "I divide 3600 seconds by 200 weeds to find how many seconds she can take per weed.",
    "3600 divided by 200 equals 18."

  "solution": "18"
