  "query": "While chatting in the school cafeteria, Cesar's friend Demi tells him that a new fantasy series was on Netflix and he should watch it. The new series has 12 seasons, and each season has 20 episodes. If Cesar watched 1/3 of the series before the school closed, how many episodes were remaining for him to finish the series?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total number of episodes in the entire series.",
    "The series has 12 seasons and each season has 20 episodes.",
    "To find the total number of episodes, I multiply the number of seasons by the number of episodes per season.",
    "12 seasons \u00d7 20 episodes/season = 240 episodes in total.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many episodes Cesar has already watched.",
    "Cesar watched 1/3 of the series.",
    "To find out how many episodes this is, I need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of episodes.",
    "1/3 \u00d7 240 episodes = 80 episodes.",
    "Cesar has watched 80 episodes, so now I need to determine how many episodes he has left to watch.",
    "To find the remaining episodes, I subtract the number of episodes watched from the total number of episodes.",
    "240 episodes - 80 episodes = 160 episodes remaining."
