  "query": "Lena is making a collage with pictures of all her closest friends and newspaper clippings that are about their interests. She has found three clippings for each friend\u2019s pictures. It takes her six drops of glue to stick down each clipping. Lena has already glued her seven closest friends\u2019 pictures. How many drops of glue will she need for the newspaper clippings for her collage?",
  "steps": [
    "Lena is focusing on her seven closest friends for the collage.",
    "Each friend has three newspaper clippings.",
    "There are 7 friends and 3 clippings per friend, so I need to calculate the total number of clippings.",
    "To find the total number of clippings, I multiply the number of friends by the number of clippings per friend: 7 friends * 3 clippings each = 21 clippings.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many drops of glue are required for each clipping.",
    "It is given that each clipping requires six drops of glue.",
    "To find the total amount of glue needed, I multiply the total number of clippings by the drops of glue needed for each clipping: 21 clippings * 6 drops of glue per clipping.",
    "Calculating 21 * 6 gives 126 drops of glue."

  "solution": "126"
