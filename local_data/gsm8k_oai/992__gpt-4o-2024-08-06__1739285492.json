  "query": "Hannah is making banana bread. She needs to use 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 20 bananas, how many cups of flour should she use?",
  "steps": [
    "Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush.",
    "It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush.",
    "Hannah is using 20 bananas.",
    "First, I need to find out how many cups of mush 20 bananas will make.",
    "Since 4 bananas make 1 cup of mush, I will divide 20 bananas by 4.",
    "20 divided by 4 equals 5.",
    "So, Hannah will have 5 cups of banana mush.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many cups of flour are needed for 5 cups of banana mush.",
    "Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for each cup of banana mush.",
    "Therefore, I need to multiply 5 cups of banana mush by 3 cups of flour per cup of mush.",
    "5 times 3 equals 15.",
    "Hannah should use 15 cups of flour."
