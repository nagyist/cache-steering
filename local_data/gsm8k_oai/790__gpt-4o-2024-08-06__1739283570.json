  "query": "Zion made a triangular-shaped house of cards with the base having a measurement of 40 centimeters and a height of 20 centimeters. If two of his friends also built similar shaped houses, what's the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made (the area of a triangle is 1/2 * width * height)?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the area of the triangular house that Zion built.",
    "The formula for the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height.",
    "For Zion's house, the base is 40 centimeters and the height is 20 centimeters.",
    "Substitute these values into the formula: Area = 1/2 * 40 * 20.",
    "First, calculate 40 * 20, which equals 800.",
    "Next, calculate 1/2 of 800. So, 1/2 * 800 = 400.",
    "The area of Zion's triangular house is 400 square centimeters.",
    "Zion's two friends built similar triangular houses, each with the same base and height.",
    "So each of the friends' houses also has an area of 400 square centimeters.",
    "To find the total area of all three triangular houses, add up the areas: 400 + 400 + 400.",
    "400 + 400 equals 800, then add the last 400 to get 1200."

  "solution": "1200"
