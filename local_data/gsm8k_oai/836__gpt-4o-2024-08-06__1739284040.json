    "First, I know that a coin flip results in either a head (H) or a tail (T).",
    "The problem states that the solver flipped the coin 211 times.",
    "Out of these 211 flips, the solver got 65 heads.",
    "To find the number of tails, I need to subtract the number of heads from the total number of flips.",
    "Subtracting the heads from the total flips: 211 - 65 = 146 tails.",
    "Now, I need to find how many more tails than heads were flipped.",
    "To find this, subtract the number of heads from the number of tails: 146 - 65 = 81 more tails."
