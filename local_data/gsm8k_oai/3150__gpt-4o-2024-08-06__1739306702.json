  "query": "Percy wants to save up for a new PlayStation, which costs $500. He gets $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas. To make the rest of the money, he's going to sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each. How many games does he need to sell to reach his goal?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Percy currently has or will have from gifts before selling any games.",
    "Percy receives $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas. I will add these amounts together.",
    "$200 + $150 = $350",
    "Percy has $350 from the gifts.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much more money Percy needs to save to reach his goal of $500.",
    "$500 (cost of the PlayStation) - $350 (money from gifts) = $150",
    "Percy needs an additional $150.",
    "Next, I will calculate how many games Percy needs to sell to make $150, if each game is sold for $7.5.",
    "To find the number of games, I divide the additional amount needed by the price per game: $150 / $7.5.",
    "$150 / $7.5 = 20",
    "Percy needs to sell 20 games."

  "solution": "20"
