  "query": "Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora, who is 8 inches shorter than Brixton. If Zara is 64 inches tall and has the same height as Brixton, calculate the average height of the four people.",
  "steps": [
    "Zara's height is given as 64 inches.",
    "Brixton has the same height as Zara, which is 64 inches.",
    "Zora is 8 inches shorter than Brixton.",
    "Subtract 8 inches from Brixton's height to find Zora's height: \\( 64 - 8 = 56 \\) inches.",
    "Itzayana is 4 inches taller than Zora.",
    "Add 4 inches to Zora's height to find Itzayana's height: \\( 56 + 4 = 60 \\) inches.",
    "Now we have the heights of all four people: Itzayana (60 inches), Zora (56 inches), Brixton (64 inches), and Zara (64 inches).",
    "To calculate the average height, add up all their heights and divide by the number of people, which is 4.",
    "Add the heights: \\( 60 + 56 + 64 + 64 = 244 \\) inches.",
    "Divide the total height by the number of people: \\( 244 \\div 4 = 61 \\) inches."
