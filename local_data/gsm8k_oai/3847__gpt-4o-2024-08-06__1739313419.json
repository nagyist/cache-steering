  "query": "All people named Barry are nice, while only half of the people named Kevin are nice.  Three-fourths of people named Julie are nice, while 10% of people named Joe are nice.  If a crowd contains 24 people named Barry, 20 people named Kevin, 80 people named Julie, and 50 people named Joe, how many nice people are in the crowd?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how many nice people there are among those named Barry.",
    "All people named Barry are nice. Since there are 24 people named Barry, all 24 are nice.",
    "Next, I calculate the number of nice people named Kevin.",
    "Only half of the people named Kevin are nice. There are 20 people named Kevin.",
    "Half of 20 is 10, so there are 10 nice people named Kevin.",
    "Now, I calculate how many nice people are named Julie.",
    "Three-fourths of the people named Julie are nice. There are 80 people named Julie.",
    "Three-fourths of 80 is 60, so there are 60 nice people named Julie.",
    "Finally, I calculate the number of nice people named Joe.",
    "10% of the people named Joe are nice. There are 50 people named Joe.",
    "10% of 50 is 5, so there are 5 nice people named Joe.",
    "Now, I add up all the nice people: 24 (Barry) + 10 (Kevin) + 60 (Julie) + 5 (Joe).",
    "The total number of nice people is 24 + 10 + 60 + 5 = 99."
