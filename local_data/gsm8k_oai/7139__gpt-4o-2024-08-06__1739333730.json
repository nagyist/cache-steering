  "query": "Rick likes to separate his collection of books into various groups by genre.  He has 400 books in total and proceeds to divide them into two separate equally-sized categories repeatedly until he has each book in a category with 24 other books.  How many times must he break these groups into smaller groups to accomplish this?",
  "steps": [
    "Rick starts with a total of 400 books.",
    "Each time he divides them into equally-sized groups, the number of groups doubles, and the size of each group becomes half.",
    "Initially, the group size is 400 books.",
    "He continues this process until each group contains 25 books (24 other books plus the one).",
    "The number of books in the groups reduces as follows: 400, 200, 100, 50, 25.",
    "I will count the number of steps it takes to reach a group size of 25 books.",
    "Step 1: Divide 400 books into groups of 200.",
    "Step 2: Divide the 200 groups into groups of 100.",
    "Step 3: Divide the 100 groups into groups of 50.",
    "Step 4: Divide the 50 groups into groups of 25.",
    "In total, it took Rick 4 divisions to reach a group size of 25 books."
