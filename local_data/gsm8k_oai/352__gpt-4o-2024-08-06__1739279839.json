  "steps": [
    "Punger buys 60 packs of baseball cards.",
    "Each pack contains 7 cards.",
    "To find the total number of cards, I need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack.",
    "So, the total number of cards is 60 packs * 7 cards per pack.",
    "60 * 7 equals 420.",
    "Punger has 420 cards in total.",
    "Each page can hold 10 cards.",
    "To find out how many pages are needed, I need to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold.",
    "420 cards divided by 10 cards per page equals 42.",
    "Punger needs 42 pages to store all his cards."
