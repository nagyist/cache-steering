  "query": "Julio has four bottles of orange soda and seven bottles of grape soda in his fridge. His friend Mateo has a bottle of orange soda and 3 bottles of grape soda in his fridge. If the amount of beverage in each bottle is 2 liters, how many more liters of soda does Julio have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate the total number of orange soda bottles that Julio has. Julio has 4 bottles of orange soda.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total number of grape soda bottles that Julio has. Julio has 7 bottles of grape soda.",
    "I'll add the number of orange and grape soda bottles Julio has to find the total number of soda bottles he owns. 4 orange + 7 grape = 11 bottles.",
    "Now, I'll find out how many liters of soda Julio has by multiplying the total number of bottles by the amount of soda in each bottle, which is 2 liters. So, 11 bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 22 liters for Julio.",
    "Next, I'll calculate the total number of orange soda bottles that Mateo has. Mateo has 1 bottle of orange soda.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the total number of grape soda bottles that Mateo has. Mateo has 3 bottles of grape soda.",
    "I'll add the number of orange and grape soda bottles Mateo has to find the total number of soda bottles he owns. 1 orange + 3 grape = 4 bottles.",
    "Now, I'll calculate how many liters of soda Mateo has by multiplying the total number of bottles by the amount of soda in each bottle, which is 2 liters. So, 4 bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 8 liters for Mateo.",
    "To find out how many more liters of soda Julio has compared to Mateo, I subtract the liters of soda Mateo has from the liters Julio has. So, 22 liters (Julio) - 8 liters (Mateo) = 14 liters."
