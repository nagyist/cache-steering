  "query": "A teacher purchased some school supplies that cost $13 and $24. She had the remaining $6 budget from last year and for this year, she was given a $50 budget. How much money remains in her budget after purchasing the school supplies?",
  "steps": [
    "The teacher\u2019s total budget for this year is $50.",
    "She also has an additional $6 leftover from the previous year.",
    "First, I will calculate her total available budget by adding the $50 from this year to the $6 from last year.",
    "$50 + $6 = $56",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the school supplies. The school supplies cost $13 and $24.",
    "The total cost of the school supplies is $13 + $24.",
    "$13 + $24 = $37",
    "To find how much money remains after purchasing the school supplies, I will subtract the total cost of the supplies from the total available budget.",
    "$56 - $37 = $19"
  ],
  "solution": "19"
