  "query": "A jar full of marbles is sitting on a table. Half of the marbles are blue, a quarter of them are red, 27 of them are green, and 14 of them are yellow. How many marbles are in the jar?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the total number of marbles in the jar as \\( N \\).",
    "It is given that half of the marbles are blue, so the number of blue marbles is \\( \\frac{N}{2} \\).",
    "A quarter of the marbles are red, so the number of red marbles is \\( \\frac{N}{4} \\).",
    "There are 27 green marbles as given in the problem.",
    "There are 14 yellow marbles as given in the problem.",
    "The sum of blue, red, green, and yellow marbles equals the total number of marbles \\( N \\).",
    "Therefore, we can write the equation: \\( \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{4} + 27 + 14 = N \\).",
    "First, simplify the equation by adding the constants: \\( 27 + 14 = 41 \\).",
    "Substitute back into the equation: \\( \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{N}{4} + 41 = N \\).",
    "To eliminate the fractions, multiply the entire equation by 4: \\( 2N + N + 164 = 4N \\).",
    "Combine like terms: \\( 3N + 164 = 4N \\).",
    "Subtract \\( 3N \\) from both sides: \\( 164 = N \\).",
    "Thus, the total number of marbles in the jar is \\( N = 164 \\)."
