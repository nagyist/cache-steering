  "query": "Albert has to run 99 meters in gym class. The track is 9 meters around. He has already run 6 times around it. Once he finishes, how many more complete laps will he have made around the track?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many meters Albert has run so far. He has run 6 times around a track that is 9 meters long.",
    "I multiply 6 laps by 9 meters per lap to find the total distance he has run: 6 x 9 = 54 meters.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many meters Albert still needs to run to reach the total of 99 meters. So, I subtract the distance he has already run from the total distance he needs to run: 99 meters - 54 meters = 45 meters.",
    "Now, I determine how many complete laps of 9 meters Albert can run with the remaining 45 meters he needs to run.",
    "I divide the remaining 45 meters by the length of the track, 9 meters, to find the number of additional complete laps: 45 \u00f7 9 = 5 laps.",
    "Albert will need to run 5 more complete laps to finish running the total of 99 meters."
