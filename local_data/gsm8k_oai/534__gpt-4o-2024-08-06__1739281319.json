    "Claire will be 20 years old in two years.",
    "To find Claire\u2019s current age, we subtract two years from her future age.",
    "20 years - 2 years = 18 years. So, Claire is currently 18 years old.",
    "Jessica is six years older than Claire.",
    "To find Jessica\u2019s age, we add six years to Claire\u2019s current age.",
    "18 years (Claire's age) + 6 years = 24 years."
