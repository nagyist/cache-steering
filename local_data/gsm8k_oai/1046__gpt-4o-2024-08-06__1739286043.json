  "query": "Susan had a bouquet of 3 dozen roses.  She gave half to her daughter, and then placed the rest in a vase.  The next day, one-third of the flowers in the vase were wilted.  After removing the wilted flowers, how many flowers remained in the vase?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many roses Susan had initially. She had a bouquet of 3 dozen roses.",
    "Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, I multiply 3 by 12 to find the total number of roses.",
    "3 dozen roses equals 3 * 12 = 36 roses.",
    "Next, Susan gave half of the roses to her daughter. So I need to find half of 36.",
    "Half of 36 is 36 / 2 = 18 roses.",
    "Susan placed the remaining roses in a vase. Since she gave away 18, there were 36 - 18 = 18 roses left.",
    "The next day, one-third of the roses in the vase were wilted. I need to calculate one-third of 18.",
    "One-third of 18 is 18 / 3 = 6 roses.",
    "These 6 roses were wilted and removed, so I subtract them from the total number in the vase.",
    "After removing the wilted roses, the number of roses left in the vase is 18 - 6 = 12."

  "solution": "12"
