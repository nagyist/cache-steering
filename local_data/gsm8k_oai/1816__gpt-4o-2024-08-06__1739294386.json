  "query": "Johnny is out walking his two dogs at night, and his son joins him for the walk.  How many legs' worth of organisms are traveling together for this walk?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider how many legs each type of being involved in this scenario has.",
    "Johnny, as a human, has 2 legs.",
    "His son, also a human, has 2 legs.",
    "Each dog typically has 4 legs. Johnny is walking two dogs.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of legs for all the beings together.",
    "First, calculate the total number of legs for the humans: Johnny (2 legs) + his son (2 legs) = 4 legs.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of legs for the dogs: 2 dogs * 4 legs each = 8 legs.",
    "Now, add the number of legs for the humans and the dogs: 4 legs (humans) + 8 legs (dogs) = 12 legs.",
    "I should double-check my calculations: 2 humans = 4 legs, 2 dogs = 8 legs, 4 + 8 = 12 legs."

  "solution": "12"
