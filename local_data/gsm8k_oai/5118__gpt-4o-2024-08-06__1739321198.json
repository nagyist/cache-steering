  "steps": [
    "On the first day, 14 marigolds were sold.",
    "On the second day, 25 more marigolds were sold.",
    "First, I need to find out the total number of marigolds sold in the first two days.",
    "Adding the marigolds sold on the first two days: 14 + 25 = 39 marigolds.",
    "On the third day, the garden center sold two times the number of marigolds as the day before, which was 25 marigolds.",
    "Calculating the number of marigolds sold on the third day: 2 * 25 = 50 marigolds.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of marigolds sold during the entire three-day sale.",
    "Adding up the marigolds sold over the three days: 14 marigolds (first day) + 25 marigolds (second day) + 50 marigolds (third day) = 89 marigolds."
