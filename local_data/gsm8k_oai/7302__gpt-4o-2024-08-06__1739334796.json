  "query": "Linda is painting her bedroom. Her bedroom has 4 walls, with the room being 20 feet wide by 20 feet long by 8 feet tall. One wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway. A second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window. A third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway to a walk-in-closet. And the fourth wall is completely solid. What is the total area of wall space that Linda will have to paint?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total area of each of the four walls.",
    "Each wall is 8 feet tall. Two of the walls are 20 feet wide, and the other two walls are also 20 feet wide, since the room is square (20 feet by 20 feet).",
    "The area of one of the 20 feet wide walls is 20 feet * 8 feet = 160 square feet.",
    "The other wall that is also 20 feet wide will have the same area, which is 160 square feet.",
    "The total area for the two 20 feet wide walls is 160 square feet + 160 square feet = 320 square feet.",
    "The other two walls are also 20 feet long and 8 feet tall.",
    "The area of one of these walls is 20 feet * 8 feet = 160 square feet, just like the previous walls.",
    "Thus, the total area of these two walls is also 160 square feet + 160 square feet = 320 square feet.",
    "The total area of all four walls without deductions for doorways and windows is 320 square feet + 320 square feet = 640 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to account for the areas of the doorways and windows that will not be painted.",
    "The first wall has a 3-foot by 7-foot doorway, which is 3 feet * 7 feet = 21 square feet.",
    "The second wall has a 6-foot by 4-foot window, which is 6 feet * 4 feet = 24 square feet.",
    "The third wall has a 5-foot by 7-foot doorway, which is 5 feet * 7 feet = 35 square feet.",
    "I add up all these areas that will not be painted: 21 square feet + 24 square feet + 35 square feet = 80 square feet.",
    "Finally, I subtract this total non-paintable area from the total wall area: 640 square feet - 80 square feet = 560 square feet."
