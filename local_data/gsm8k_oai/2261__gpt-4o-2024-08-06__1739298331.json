  "query": "Greg and Katie went to Mrs. Scarlet's gold store to have their gold chests opened. They realized Greg had four times less gold than Katie when Mrs. Scarlet opened the chests. If the total amount of gold is 100, how much gold does Greg have?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's assume the amount of gold Greg has is G.",
    "Katie has four times more gold than Greg.",
    "So, Katie has 4G gold.",
    "Together, the total gold they have is 100.",
    "We can write an equation for the total gold: G (Greg's gold) + 4G (Katie's gold) = 100.",
    "Combine the terms: 5G = 100.",
    "Now, solve for G by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:  \nG = 100 / 5.",
    "Calculating the division gives G = 20."

  "solution": "20"
