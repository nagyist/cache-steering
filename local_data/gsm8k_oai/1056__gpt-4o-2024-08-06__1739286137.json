  "query": "Maria is chopping up vegetables for a stew. She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes, twice as many onions as carrots, and 1/3 as many green beans as onions. If she has two potatoes, how many green beans does she need to cut?",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how many carrots Maria needs.",
    "She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes.",
    "She has two potatoes, so she needs 6 times 2 carrots.",
    "6 times 2 is 12, so Maria needs 12 carrots.",
    "Next, determine how many onions Maria needs.",
    "She wants twice as many onions as carrots.",
    "She has 12 carrots, so she needs 2 times 12 onions.",
    "2 times 12 is 24, so Maria needs 24 onions.",
    "Now, calculate the number of green beans Maria needs.",
    "She wants 1/3 as many green beans as onions.",
    "She has 24 onions, so she needs 1/3 of 24 green beans.",
    "1/3 of 24 is 24 divided by 3.",
    "24 divided by 3 is 8, so Maria needs 8 green beans."
