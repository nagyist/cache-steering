  "query": "Tom decides to get a new floor for his room.  It cost $50 to remove the floor.  The new floor costs $1.25 per square foot and Tom's room is 8*7 feet.  How much did it cost to replace the floor?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of Tom's room in square feet.",
    "The dimensions of Tom's room are 8 feet by 7 feet.",
    "To find the area, I multiply the length by the width: 8 * 7.",
    "The area of the room is 56 square feet.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the new floor.",
    "The cost of the new floor is $1.25 per square foot.",
    "I multiply the area of the floor by the cost per square foot: 56 * $1.25.",
    "56 * 1.25 equals $70.",
    "The total cost to replace the floor includes both the removal cost and the new floor cost.",
    "The cost to remove the floor is $50.",
    "I add the removal cost to the cost of the new floor: $50 + $70.",
    "$50 + $70 equals $120."
