  "query": "On Thursday Walmart sold 210 pounds of ground beef. On Friday they sold twice that amount. On Saturday they only sold 150 pounds.  What was the average amount of beef sold per day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much ground beef Walmart sold on Friday.",
    "They sold twice the amount on Friday as they did on Thursday, which was 210 pounds.",
    "Twice 210 pounds is 210 * 2.",
    "210 * 2 equals 420 pounds.",
    "On Friday, Walmart sold 420 pounds of ground beef.",
    "Next, I need to find the total amount of ground beef sold over the three days.",
    "On Thursday, they sold 210 pounds.",
    "On Friday, they sold 420 pounds.",
    "On Saturday, they sold 150 pounds.",
    "The total amount sold is 210 + 420 + 150.",
    "210 + 420 equals 630 pounds.",
    "630 + 150 equals 780 pounds.",
    "The total amount of ground beef sold over three days is 780 pounds.",
    "Now, I will calculate the average amount sold per day.",
    "There are 3 days: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.",
    "I will divide the total amount sold (780 pounds) by the number of days (3).",
    "780 divided by 3 equals 260 pounds."
