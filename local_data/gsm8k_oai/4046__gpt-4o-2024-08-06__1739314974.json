  "query": "Sam earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring. For the first month, he earned $200; and for the second month, he earned $150 more than the first month. How many hours did he spend on tutoring for two months?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Sam earned in the second month.",
    "He earned $150 more in the second month than the first month.",
    "In the first month, he earned $200.",
    "Therefore, in the second month, he earned $200 + $150.",
    "Calculating that, $200 + $150 equals $350.",
    "Now, I know Sam earned $350 in the second month.",
    "Next, I need to find out the number of hours he worked each month.",
    "Since Sam earns $10 an hour, I can divide the total earnings by $10 to find the hours worked.",
    "For the first month, $200 divided by $10 per hour equals 20 hours.",
    "For the second month, $350 divided by $10 per hour equals 35 hours.",
    "Now I add the hours worked for both months.",
    "20 hours in the first month plus 35 hours in the second month equals 55 hours."
