  "query": "There are twenty-two people in a waiting room. If three more people arrive, the number of people in the waiting room becomes five times the number of people inside the interview room. How many people are in the interview room?",
  "steps": [
    "Currently, there are 22 people in the waiting room.",
    "Three more people arrive, increasing the total number of people in the waiting room to 22 + 3 = 25.",
    "The problem statement says that this total (25) is five times the number of people in the interview room.",
    "Let the number of people in the interview room be x.",
    "According to the problem, 5 times the number of people in the interview room is equal to 25.",
    "Thus, the equation is 5 * x = 25.",
    "To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 5.",
    "x = 25 / 5",
    "x = 5"
  ],
  "solution": "5"
