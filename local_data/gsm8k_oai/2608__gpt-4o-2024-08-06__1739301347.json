  "query": "Anna puts three slices of ham in each sandwich. If she has 31 slices of ham, how many more slices of ham does she need to make 50 ham sandwiches?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many slices of ham are required for 50 sandwiches.",
    "For each sandwich, Anna uses 3 slices of ham.",
    "Therefore, for 50 sandwiches, Anna would need 50 * 3 slices of ham.",
    "50 * 3 = 150 slices of ham.",
    "Anna currently has 31 slices of ham.",
    "To find out how many more slices she needs, I subtract the number of slices she has from the total number needed.",
    "150 - 31 = 119 slices of ham.",
    "So, Anna needs 119 more slices of ham to make 50 sandwiches."

  "solution": "119"
