    "The clinic originally had 26 patients.",
    "The clinic has doubled its number of patients.",
    "Doubling 26 gives 26 * 2 = 52. So now there are 52 patients.",
    "The psychologist believes one in every four people has ZYX syndrome.",
    "To find out how many patients are likely to have the syndrome, calculate 1/4 of 52.",
    "52 divided by 4 equals 13."
