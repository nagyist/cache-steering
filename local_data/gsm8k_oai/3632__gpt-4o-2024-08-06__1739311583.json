  "query": "James buys 2 notebooks with 50 pages each.  He pays $5.  How many cents did each page cost?",
  "steps": [
    "James bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook has 50 pages.",
    "To find the total number of pages, I will multiply the number of notebooks by the number of pages each notebook contains.",
    "2 notebooks * 50 pages per notebook = 100 pages total.",
    "James paid $5 for the notebooks.",
    "I need to convert dollars into cents to find the cost per page in cents.",
    "$5 is equivalent to 500 cents.",
    "Now, I will divide the total cost in cents by the total number of pages to find the cost per page.",
    "500 cents / 100 pages = 5 cents per page."
