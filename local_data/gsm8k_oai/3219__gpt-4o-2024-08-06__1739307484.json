    "Cory bought a patio table and 4 chairs for a total cost of $135.",
    "The patio table alone cost $55.",
    "I need to determine the combined cost of the 4 chairs.",
    "I subtract the cost of the table from the total cost to find out how much the 4 chairs cost together.",
    "$135 (total cost) - $55 (table cost) = $80 is the cost for 4 chairs.",
    "Now, I need to find the cost of each individual chair.",
    "To find the cost of one chair, I divide the total chair cost by the number of chairs.",
    "$80 \u00f7 4 = $20 per chair."
