  "query": "Abigail is trying a new recipe for a cold drink. It uses 1/4 of a cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 of a cup of lemonade to make one drink. If she fills a pitcher with 18 total cups of this drink, how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the amount of each ingredient in one drink. For iced tea, it is 1/4 of a cup.",
    "For lemonade, the amount is 1 and 1/4 cups per drink.",
    "Convert the mixed number for lemonade into an improper fraction for easier calculations: 1 and 1/4 equals 5/4.",
    "Determine the total amount of drink per serving by adding the quantities of iced tea and lemonade: 1/4 cup of iced tea plus 5/4 cups of lemonade.",
    "Add the fractions: 1/4 + 5/4 = 6/4.",
    "Simplify 6/4 to get the total amount per drink in simplest form, resulting in 3/2 cups per drink.",
    "Calculate the number of drinks that make up 18 cups of the mixture by dividing the total amount in the pitcher by the amount per drink: 18 divided by 3/2.",
    "To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal: 18 times 2/3.",
    "Perform the multiplication: 18 times 2/3 equals 36/3.",
    "Simplify 36/3 to determine the number of drinks: 36/3 equals 12 drinks.",
    "Each drink contains 5/4 cups of lemonade.",
    "To find the total amount of lemonade, multiply the amount of lemonade per drink (5/4 cups) by the number of drinks (12).",
    "Perform the multiplication: 5/4 times 12 equals 60/4.",
    "Simplify 60/4 to determine the total cups of lemonade: 60/4 equals 15."
