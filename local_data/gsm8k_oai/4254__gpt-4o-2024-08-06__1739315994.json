  "query": "If Tony normally has a temperature of 95 degrees, and he comes down with a sickness that raises his temperature by 10 degrees, how many degrees above the threshold of fever is his temperature if a fever is anything over 100 degrees?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Tony's new temperature after his sickness raise.",
    "Tony's normal temperature is 95 degrees.",
    "The sickness raises his temperature by 10 degrees.",
    "Add the increase to his normal temperature: 95 degrees + 10 degrees = 105 degrees.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much 105 degrees is above the fever threshold.",
    "The fever threshold is anything over 100 degrees.",
    "Subtract the fever threshold from Tony's new temperature: 105 degrees - 100 degrees = 5 degrees.",
    "Tony's temperature is 5 degrees above the fever threshold."
