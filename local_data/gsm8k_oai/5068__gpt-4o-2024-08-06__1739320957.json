  "query": "Emma bought a loaf of bread that had a certain number of slices. Her little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the bread at two different points in time, and then Emma decided she would make toast with the remaining slices. If she uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast bread, how many slices were in the original loaf if she was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread and had 1 slice of bread left?",
  "steps": [
    "Emma was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread.",
    "Since she needs 2 slices to make 1 piece of toast, she used 10 x 2 = 20 slices of bread for toast.",
    "She had 1 slice of bread left after making the toast.",
    "So, before making the toast, she must have had 20 slices + 1 slice = 21 slices.",
    "Her cousin Andy ate 3 slices at two different points, so Andy ate a total of 3 x 2 = 6 slices.",
    "Adding the slices Andy ate to the slices left before making toast gives 21 + 6 = 27 slices.",
    "This means the original loaf had 27 slices."

  "solution": "27"
