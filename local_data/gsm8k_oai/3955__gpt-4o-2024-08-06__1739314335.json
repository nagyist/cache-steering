  "query": "Sandra had 2 different bags of candy.  Each of her bags had 6 pieces of candy left.  Her brother, Roger, also had 2 bags of candy.  One of his bags of candy had 11 pieces left and the other had 3 pieces left.  How much more candy did Roger have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pieces of candy Sandra had in total.",
    "Sandra had 2 bags of candy, each with 6 pieces left.",
    "So, the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had is 6 pieces per bag times 2 bags.",
    "6 pieces/bag * 2 bags = 12 pieces.",
    "Next, I need to find out how many pieces of candy Roger had in total.",
    "Roger had one bag with 11 pieces and another with 3 pieces.",
    "The total number of pieces of candy Roger had is 11 pieces + 3 pieces.",
    "11 pieces + 3 pieces = 14 pieces.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much more candy Roger had compared to Sandra.",
    "Roger had 14 pieces, and Sandra had 12 pieces.",
    "The difference in candy is 14 pieces - 12 pieces.",
    "14 pieces - 12 pieces = 2 pieces."
