  "query": "A movie theater has 6 screens which show movies back-to-back all day. If the movie theater is open for 8 hours, and each movie lasts 2 hours, how many movies are shown in total throughout the day?",
  "steps": [
    "The first thing to determine is how many movies each screen can show in one day.",
    "The movie theater operates for 8 hours each day.",
    "Each movie lasts for 2 hours.",
    "To find the number of movies each screen can show, divide the total hours the theater is open by the duration of each movie.",
    "8 hours / 2 hours per movie = 4 movies per screen",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many movies are shown on all screens combined.",
    "There are 6 screens in the theater.",
    "Each screen shows 4 movies in a day.",
    "Multiply the number of screens by the number of movies each screen shows.",
    "6 screens * 4 movies per screen = 24 movies"

  "solution": "24"
