  "query": "To finish the task assigned to her by the work supervisor in the stipulated deadline, Anie needs 5 hours extra aside from the normal work schedule each day.  If each day her work schedule requires her to be productive for 10 hours, and the project is estimated to take 1500 hours, calculate the number of days it would take Anie to finish the job.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the total hours Anie is expected to work each day considering the extra hours she needs.",
    "Anie's normal work schedule is 10 hours per day.",
    "Anie needs an additional 5 hours extra each day.",
    "So, the total hours Anie will work each day is 10 hours + 5 hours.",
    "This means Anie works 15 hours each day.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many days it will take Anie to complete the project.",
    "The total project time is estimated to be 1500 hours.",
    "Anie works 15 hours each day.",
    "To find the number of days, I will divide the total project hours by the hours Anie works each day.",
    "1500 hours \u00f7 15 hours per day = 100 days.",
    "Therefore, it will take Anie 100 days to finish the job."
