  "query": "Marcus takes a deck of standard playing cards and takes out all the face cards and the 8's. Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times. How many times should he expect to pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out how many cards are in a standard deck and then remove the face cards and the 8's.",
    "A standard deck has 52 cards. There are 12 face cards (King, Queen, Jack for each of the 4 suits) and 4 cards with the number 8 (one for each suit).",
    "By removing the face cards and 8's, we have 52 - 12 - 4 = 36 cards left.",
    "Next, I need to identify which cards are both red and have a number divisible by 3.",
    "The red suits are hearts and diamonds. The numbers divisible by 3 in each suit are 3, 6, 9.",
    "For hearts, the cards that are red and divisible by 3 are: 3 of hearts, 6 of hearts, 9 of hearts.",
    "For diamonds, the cards that are red and divisible by 3 are: 3 of diamonds, 6 of diamonds, 9 of diamonds.",
    "In total, there are 3 red cards divisible by 3 in hearts and 3 in diamonds, making a total of 3 + 3 = 6 such cards.",
    "Now I calculate the probability of picking a red card with a number divisible by 3.",
    "The probability of picking one of these cards is the number of favorable outcomes (6) divided by the total number of available cards (36).",
    "The probability is therefore 6/36 = 1/6.",
    "Mark picks a card 36 times with replacement. I need to find the expected number of times he picks the cards that are both red and have a number divisible by 3.",
    "The expected number of times is the probability of success (1/6) multiplied by the number of trials (36).",
    "So, the expected number is 36 * (1/6) = 6."
