  "query": "Stoney Hollow Middle School is taking a field trip to the zoo. There are 109 fifth graders, 115 sixth graders, and 118 seventh graders. There are 4 teachers and 2 parents from each grade coming along to chaperone on the trip. There are 72 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed for the field trip?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of students going on the trip.",
    "There are 109 fifth graders, 115 sixth graders, and 118 seventh graders.",
    "I will calculate the total number of students by adding these numbers together: 109 + 115 + 118.",
    "109 + 115 = 224.",
    "224 + 118 = 342. So there are 342 students total.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of chaperones (teachers and parents) going on the trip.",
    "There are 4 teachers in total.",
    "There are 2 parents coming from each grade, so there are 3 grades in total: fifth, sixth, and seventh.",
    "There are 2 parents per grade \u00d7 3 grades = 6 total parents.",
    "Now, add the number of teachers and parents: 4 teachers + 6 parents = 10 chaperones.",
    "Now I determine the total number of people going on the trip, including students and chaperones.",
    "There are 342 students and 10 chaperones.",
    "Add these numbers: 342 + 10 = 352 people in total.",
    "Each bus has 72 seats.",
    "To find out how many buses are needed, divide the total number of people (352) by the number of seats on each bus (72).",
    "352 \u00f7 72 = 4 buses with a remainder. I need to check the division.",
    "Divide 352 by 72: 352 divided by 72 is approximately 4.8889, which means it doesn't divide evenly.",
    "Since I can\u2019t have a fraction of a bus, and each bus can only hold 72 people, I need to round 4.8889 up to the next whole number.",
    "Rounding 4.8889 up gives us 5 buses."
