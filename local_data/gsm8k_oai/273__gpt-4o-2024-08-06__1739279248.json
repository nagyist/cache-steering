  "query": "Ursula is working at a marketing firm. She created a 30-second long commercial. Her boss told her that this commercial is too long to air and told her to shorten the commercial by 30%. How long will this commercial be after Ursula makes the desired changes?",
  "steps": [
    "The original length of the commercial is 30 seconds.",
    "Ursula needs to shorten the commercial by 30%.",
    "To find out how much time 30% of the 30-second commercial is, I need to calculate 30% of 30 seconds.",
    "30% can be calculated by multiplying 30 by 0.30.",
    "30 * 0.30 is 9. This means Ursula needs to remove 9 seconds from the commercial.",
    "The new length of the commercial after shortening is 30 seconds minus 9 seconds.",
    "30 - 9 equals 21."
  ],
  "solution": "21"
