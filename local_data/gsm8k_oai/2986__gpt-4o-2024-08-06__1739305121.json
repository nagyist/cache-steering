  "query": "Miley bought two cellphones for her parents. Each cellphone costs $800 but, since she is buying two units, she will receive a 5% discount for the total cost. How much did Miley pay?",
  "steps": [
    "Miley bought two cellphones, and each costs $800.",
    "To find the total cost without discount, multiply the cost of one cellphone by the number of cellphones.",
    "$800 per cellphone * 2 cellphones = $1600.",
    "Now, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 5% of the total cost.",
    "To find 5% of $1600, multiply $1600 by 0.05.",
    "$1600 * 0.05 = $80.",
    "To find the discounted total cost, subtract the discount amount from the original total cost.",
    "$1600 - $80 = $1520."
  ],
  "solution": "1520"
