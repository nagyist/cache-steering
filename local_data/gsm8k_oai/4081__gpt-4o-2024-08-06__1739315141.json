  "query": "Mandy bought 3 packs of black shirts and 3 packs of yellow shirts for her tennis team. The black shirts come in packs of 5, and the yellow shirts come in packs of 2. How many shirts did Mandy buy in all?",
  "steps": [
    "Mandy bought 3 packs of black shirts.",
    "Each pack of black shirts contains 5 shirts.",
    "To find out how many black shirts Mandy bought, I need to multiply the number of packs by the number of shirts in each pack: 3 packs * 5 shirts/pack.",
    "3 * 5 equals 15. So Mandy bought 15 black shirts.",
    "Mandy also bought 3 packs of yellow shirts.",
    "Each pack of yellow shirts contains 2 shirts.",
    "To find out how many yellow shirts Mandy bought, I need to multiply the number of packs by the number of shirts in each pack: 3 packs * 2 shirts/pack.",
    "3 * 2 equals 6. So Mandy bought 6 yellow shirts.",
    "To find the total number of shirts she bought, I need to add the number of black shirts to the number of yellow shirts: 15 black shirts + 6 yellow shirts.",
    "15 + 6 equals 21."

  "solution": "21"
