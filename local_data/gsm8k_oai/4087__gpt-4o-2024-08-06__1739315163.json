  "query": "Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total amount Mitch needs to reserve for the license and registration.\nHe needs to keep $500 for license and registration.",
    "Next, calculate the amount needed for docking fees, which is three times the $500 reserved for license and registration.\n3 times $500 is $1500.",
    "Add the amounts for the license and registration and for the docking fees to find the total amount Mitch needs to reserve.\n$500 + $1500 = $2000.",
    "Subtract the reserved amount from the total savings Mitch has to find how much he can spend on the boat.\n$20000 - $2000 = $18000.",
    "Now, we need to determine how many feet in length Mitch can afford for the boat. A boat costs $1500 per foot.",
    "Divide the amount available for the boat by the cost per foot to find the maximum length of the boat.\n$18000 \u00f7 $1500 = 12 feet."
