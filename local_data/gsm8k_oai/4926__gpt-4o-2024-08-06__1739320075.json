  "query": "Heath spent his weekend helping at his uncle\u2019s farm planting carrots. He planted 400 rows of carrots with 300 plants in each row. He used a machine to get the planting done and it took him 20 hours. How many carrots did he plant each hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total number of carrot plants Heath planted.",
    "He planted 400 rows of carrots.",
    "Each row has 300 plants.",
    "To find the total number of carrot plants, I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of plants per row.",
    "400 rows * 300 plants/row = 120,000 plants",
    "Now, I need to find out how many carrots he planted each hour.",
    "He spent 20 hours planting.",
    "I need to divide the total number of plants by the total number of hours to find out how many he planted per hour.",
    "120,000 plants / 20 hours = 6,000 plants/hour"
  ],
  "solution": "6,000"
