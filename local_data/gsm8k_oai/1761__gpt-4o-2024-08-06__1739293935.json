  "query": "Kevin is a fruit vendor. He always sells a total of 50 crates of fruit per week. Last week he sold 13 crates of grapes, 20 crates of mangoes, and the rest were passion fruits. How many passion fruit crates did he sell?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to know the total number of crates Kevin sold last week.",
    "According to the problem, Kevin sells a total of 50 crates of fruit per week.",
    "Next, I should add the number of crates of grapes and mangoes because the remaining crates will be passion fruit.",
    "He sold 13 crates of grapes and 20 crates of mangoes.",
    "Now, I will add the crates of grapes and mangoes together: 13 crates of grapes + 20 crates of mangoes.",
    "The sum of grape and mango crates is 33.",
    "To find out how many crates of passion fruits he sold, I need to subtract the number of grape and mango crates from the total crates.",
    "I will subtract 33 crates (grapes and mangoes) from 50 crates (total).",
    "50 - 33 equals 17.",
    "So, the number of passion fruit crates he sold is 17."
