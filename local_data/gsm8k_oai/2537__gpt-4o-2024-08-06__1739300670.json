  "query": "James buys a jar of hot sauce.   Each serving is .5 ounces.  He uses 3 servings every day.  if the container is 2 ounces less than 1 quart how many days will it last?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what 1 quart is in ounces. There are 32 ounces in 1 quart.",
    "The container is 2 ounces less than 1 quart. So, I subtract 2 from 32.",
    "32 - 2 equals 30. The container holds 30 ounces of hot sauce.",
    "Each serving of hot sauce is 0.5 ounces. James uses 3 servings every day.",
    "To find out how many ounces James uses per day, I multiply the number of servings by the ounces per serving.",
    "3 servings per day multiplied by 0.5 ounces per serving equals 1.5 ounces per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many days the hot sauce will last. I do this by dividing the total amount of hot sauce by the amount used per day.",
    "30 ounces divided by 1.5 ounces per day equals 20 days."

  "solution": "20"
