  "query": "Hadley wore his cowboy boots everywhere.  He walked 2 miles to the grocery store in his boots.  Then he walked 1 less than two miles to the pet store in his boots.  Then, he walked one less than four miles back home in his boots.  How far, in miles, did Hadley walk in his boots?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many miles Hadley walked to the grocery store.",
    "Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many miles Hadley walked to the pet store.",
    "He walked 1 mile less than 2 miles to the pet store.",
    "2 - 1 equals 1, so Hadley walked 1 mile to the pet store.",
    "Now, I need to determine how far Hadley walked back home.",
    "He walked 1 mile less than 4 miles back home.",
    "4 - 1 equals 3, so Hadley walked 3 miles back home.",
    "To find the total distance walked, I should add up all the distances.",
    "First, I add 2 miles (to the grocery store) and 1 mile (to the pet store).",
    "2 + 1 equals 3 miles.",
    "Then, I add the 3 miles Hadley walked back home.",
    "3 + 3 equals 6 miles.",
    "This means Hadley walked a total of 6 miles."
