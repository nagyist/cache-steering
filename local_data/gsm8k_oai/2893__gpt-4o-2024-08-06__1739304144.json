  "query": "Raine's house is just a walking distance from her school. It takes her 150 steps to walk to the school. How many steps does she take walking to and from school in five days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many steps Raine takes for a round trip to and from school in one day.",
    "Raine takes 150 steps to walk to school.",
    "Since the walk back home would take the same number of steps, she takes another 150 steps to return home.",
    "So, in one day, Raine takes 150 (to school) + 150 (back home) = 300 steps.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total number of steps Raine takes in five days.",
    "In one day, she takes 300 steps for a round trip. Therefore, in five days, she would take 5 times that amount of steps.",
    "300 steps/day * 5 days = 1500 steps."
  ],
  "solution": "1500"
