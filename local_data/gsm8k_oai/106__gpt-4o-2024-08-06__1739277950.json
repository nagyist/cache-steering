    "John buys 10 packs of magic cards.",
    "Each pack has 20 cards.",
    "First, I need to determine how many cards John buys in total.",
    "10 packs * 20 cards per pack = 200 cards.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many of these cards are uncommon.",
    "1/4 of the cards are uncommon.",
    "To find the number of uncommon cards, calculate 1/4 of 200 cards.",
