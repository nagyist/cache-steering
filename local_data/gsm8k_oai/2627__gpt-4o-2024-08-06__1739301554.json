  "query": "A child is making a 5-level pyramid by stacking some blocks. In the first row, he has 9 blocks. For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?",
  "steps": [
    "I recognize that the pyramid has a total of 5 levels.",
    "The first row has 9 blocks. This is the bottom row of the pyramid.",
    "For each subsequent row, there are 2 fewer blocks than the row beneath it.",
    "So, for the second row, there are 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.",
    "The third row will have 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.",
    "The fourth row will have 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.",
    "The fifth row will have 3 - 2 = 1 block.",
    "Now, I need to sum up the blocks in each row.",
    "The total number of blocks used is 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1.",
