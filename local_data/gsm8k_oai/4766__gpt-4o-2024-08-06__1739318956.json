  "query": "A swarm of ants discovered a pile of sugar that spilled from a dropped bag. They begin to harvest it and carry it off to their anthill. Every hour, the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar. The bag of sugar held 24 ounces before it was dropped. After three hours, how many more hours will the ants need to harvest the remaining sugar?",
  "steps": [
    "The bag initially held 24 ounces of sugar.",
    "The ants remove 4 ounces of sugar every hour.",
    "In the first three hours, the ants remove 3 hours \u00d7 4 ounces/hour = 12 ounces of sugar.",
    "After three hours, the amount of sugar left is 24 ounces - 12 ounces = 12 ounces.",
    "The remaining sugar is 12 ounces, and the ants remove 4 ounces per hour.",
    "To find out how many more hours the ants need, divide the remaining sugar by the rate of removal: 12 ounces \u00f7 4 ounces/hour = 3 hours."
