  "query": "Katy participated in a summer reading program at her local library. She read 8 books in June, twice as many in July and three fewer in August than she did in July. How many books did Katy read during the summer?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's figure out how many books Katy read in July. She read twice as many books in July as she did in June.",
    "Katy read 8 books in June. So, in July, she read 2 times 8, which is 16 books.",
    "Next, we need to calculate how many books she read in August. She read three fewer books in August than she did in July.",
    "In July, Katy read 16 books. Three fewer than 16 is 16 - 3, which equals 13 books.",
    "Now, add up the total number of books she read during the summer: June's books, July's books, and August's books.",
    "She read 8 books in June, 16 books in July, and 13 books in August.",
    "Adding these numbers together: 8 + 16 + 13.",
    "8 + 16 equals 24.",
    "24 + 13 equals 37."

  "solution": "37"
