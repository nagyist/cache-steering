  "query": "Vince owns a hair salon and he earns $18 per head. His monthly expenses are $280 for rent and electricity and 20% of his earnings are allocated for recreation and relaxation. He will save the rest. How much does he save if he serves 80 customers a month?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate Vince's total earnings from serving 80 customers.",
    "Since Vince earns $18 per head, and he serves 80 customers, I multiply 18 by 80.",
    "18 multiplied by 80 equals 1440. So, his earnings are $1440.",
    "Next, I need to account for his monthly expenses for rent and electricity, which are $280.",
    "I subtract $280 from his earnings of $1440 to find how much he has left after expenses.",
    "1440 minus 280 equals 1160. So, he has $1160 left after expenses.",
    "Then, I need to calculate the amount allocated for recreation and relaxation, which is 20% of his earnings.",
    "20% of $1440 can be calculated by multiplying 0.20 by 1440.",
    "0.20 multiplied by 1440 equals 288.",
    "So, $288 is allocated for recreation and relaxation.",
    "To find out how much Vince saves, I subtract the amount allocated for recreation and relaxation from the amount left after expenses.",
    "1160 minus 288 equals 872."

  "solution": "872"
