  "query": "Wanda has 62 crayons. Dina has 28 and Jacob has two fewer crayons than Dina. How many crayons do they have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many crayons Jacob has.",
    "Jacob has two fewer crayons than Dina, who has 28 crayons.",
    "I subtract 2 from 28 to find the number of crayons Jacob has.",
    "28 - 2 = 26. Jacob has 26 crayons.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of crayons Wanda, Dina, and Jacob have together.",
    "Wanda has 62 crayons, Dina has 28 crayons, and Jacob has 26 crayons.",
    "I add the number of crayons each person has to get the total.",
    "62 + 28 + 26.",
    "First, I add Wanda's and Dina's crayons: 62 + 28 = 90.",
    "Next, I add Jacob's crayons to the result: 90 + 26.",
    "90 + 26 = 116."
