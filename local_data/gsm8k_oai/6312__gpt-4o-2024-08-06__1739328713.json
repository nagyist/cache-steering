  "query": "Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?",
  "steps": [
    "We need to find how many apples Tom has. To do this, I first need to know how many apples Ben has.",
    "I am told that Ben has 8 more apples than Phillip.",
    "Phillip has 40 apples.",
    "So, Ben will have 40 apples plus 8 more apples.",
    "Calculation: 40 + 8 = 48.",
    "Ben has 48 apples.",
    "Next, I need to find how many apples Tom has, given that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben.",
    "Since Ben has 48 apples, I will calculate three eighths of 48 to find out how many apples Tom has.",
    "To calculate three eighths of 48, I multiply 48 by 3/8.",
    "48 times 3 equals 144.",
    "Now, divide 144 by 8.",
    "144 divided by 8 equals 18.",
    "Therefore, Tom has 18 apples."
