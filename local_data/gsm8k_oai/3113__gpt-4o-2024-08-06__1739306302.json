  "query": "Jordan picked 54 mangoes from his tree. One-third of the mangoes were ripe while the other two-thirds were not yet ripe. Jordan kept 16 unripe mangoes and gave the remainder to his sister who pickled them in glass jars. If it takes 4 mangoes to fill a jar, how many jars of pickled mangoes can Jordan's sister make?",
  "steps": [
    "Jordan picked a total of 54 mangoes from his tree.",
    "According to the problem, one-third of these mangoes were ripe.",
    "To find the number of ripe mangoes, we calculate one-third of 54.",
    "One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18 ripe mangoes.",
    "The remaining mangoes are unripe.",
    "If 18 mangoes are ripe, the number of unripe mangoes is 54 - 18.",
    "54 - 18 = 36 unripe mangoes.",
    "Jordan kept 16 unripe mangoes for himself.",
    "To find out how many unripe mangoes he gave to his sister, we subtract the 16 he kept from the total unripe mangoes.",
    "36 - 16 = 20 unripe mangoes were given to his sister.",
    "His sister pickled these 20 unripe mangoes in glass jars, with each jar holding 4 mangoes.",
    "To find the number of jars, we divide the total unripe mangoes given to his sister by the number of mangoes per jar.",
    "20 / 4 = 5 jars."
