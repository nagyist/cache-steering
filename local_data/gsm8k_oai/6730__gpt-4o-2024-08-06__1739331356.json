  "query": "A cook had 300 carrots in a bucket he was using to cook meals for a restaurant. Before lunch, he had used 2/5 of the carrots. By the end of the day, he had chopped and used 3/5 of the remaining carrots. How many carrots were not used that day?",
  "steps": [
    "I start with the total number of carrots, which is 300.",
    "First, I need to determine how many carrots were used before lunch. The problem states that 2/5 of the carrots were used before lunch.",
    "To find 2/5 of 300, I calculate (2/5) * 300.",
    "(2/5) * 300 = 120 carrots were used before lunch.",
    "Now, I subtract the carrots used before lunch from the total to find the remaining carrots after lunch.",
    "300 - 120 = 180 carrots remain after lunch.",
    "The problem states that 3/5 of the remaining carrots were used by the end of the day.",
    "To find how many of the remaining carrots were used, I calculate (3/5) * 180.",
    "(3/5) * 180 = 108 carrots were used after lunch.",
    "Now, I subtract the carrots used after lunch from the remaining carrots to find out how many carrots were not used at all.",
    "180 - 108 = 72 carrots were not used that day."
