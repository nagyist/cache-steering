  "query": "Ava planted 9 apple trees in her backyard. That's 3 more than Lily planted in her backyard. How many apple trees did they plant in their backyards collectively?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many apple trees Lily planted.",
    "Ava planted 9 apple trees, which is 3 more than Lily.",
    "To find out how many trees Lily planted, I subtract 3 from 9.",
    "9 - 3 equals 6, so Lily planted 6 apple trees.",
    "Now I know Ava planted 9 apple trees and Lily planted 6 apple trees.",
    "To find the total number of apple trees they planted together, I add the number of trees Ava planted to the number of trees Lily planted.",
    "9 + 6 equals 15, so together they planted 15 apple trees."
