  "query": "At the beginning of the day there were 74 apples in a basket. If Ricki removes 14 apples and Samson removes twice as many as Ricki. How many apples are left in the basket by the end of the day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I note that there are initially 74 apples in the basket.",
    "Ricki removes 14 apples from the basket.",
    "I need to find out how many apples Samson removes. He removes twice as many apples as Ricki.",
    "Ricki removes 14 apples, so twice as many would be 14 times 2.",
    "Calculating 14 times 2 gives 28.",
    "Therefore, Samson removes 28 apples.",
    "Now, I add the apples removed by both Ricki and Samson to see how many are removed in total.",
    "Ricki removes 14 apples, and Samson removes 28 apples, so the total is 14 + 28.",
    "Calculating 14 + 28, I get 42 apples removed in total.",
    "Now, I subtract the total number of apples removed from the initial amount to find how many are left.",
    "We started with 74 apples in the basket. After removing 42 apples, we have 74 - 42 remaining.",
    "Calculating 74 - 42, I get 32."

  "solution": "32"
