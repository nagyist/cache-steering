  "query": "June liked to collect cat stickers.  She had a total of 76 in her collection.  Her twin sister Bonnie also collected cat stickers and had 63 in her collection.  For their birthday, their grandparents gave them 25 cat stickers each.  How many combined stickers did they have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many stickers each sister had initially.",
    "June had 76 cat stickers.",
    "Bonnie had 63 cat stickers.",
    "Next, I should add the number of stickers they received from their grandparents to their initial amounts.",
    "June received 25 additional stickers from her grandparents.",
    "Bonnie also received 25 additional stickers from her grandparents.",
    "I'll now calculate the new total for June by adding the stickers she received to her initial total.",
    "76 (initial) + 25 (received) = 101 for June.",
    "Now, I'll calculate the new total for Bonnie by adding the stickers she received to her initial total.",
    "63 (initial) + 25 (received) = 88 for Bonnie.",
    "Finally, I need to find their combined total number of stickers by adding their new totals together.",
    "101 (June's total) + 88 (Bonnie's total) = 189."

  "solution": "189"
