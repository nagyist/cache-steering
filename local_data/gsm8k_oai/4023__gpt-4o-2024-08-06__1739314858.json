  "query": "Each yogurt is topped with 8 banana slices.  One banana will yield 10 slices.  If Vivian needs to make 5 yogurts, how many bananas does she need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of banana slices required for 5 yogurts.",
    "Each yogurt requires 8 banana slices.",
    "So, for 5 yogurts, the total number of banana slices needed is 5 yogurts \u00d7 8 slices/yogurt.",
    "Calculating that: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40 slices are needed.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many bananas are required to obtain 40 slices.",
    "One banana yields 10 slices.",
    "To find the number of bananas needed, I'll divide the total number of slices by the number of slices one banana provides.",
    "That calculation is 40 slices \u00f7 10 slices/banana.",
    "Calculating that: 40 \u00f7 10 = 4 bananas are needed."
