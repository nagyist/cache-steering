  "query": "Matias is a salesman in a bookstore. He sold 7 books on Tuesday and three times as many on Wednesday. If the sales from Wednesday were tripled on Thursday, how many books did Matias sell during these three days combined?",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine how many books Matias sold on Wednesday.",
    "He sold three times as many books on Wednesday as he did on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday, Matias sold 7 books.",
    "So, on Wednesday, he sold 7 * 3 = 21 books.",
    "Next, calculate the number of books sold on Thursday.",
    "He sold three times the number of books on Wednesday on Thursday.",
    "On Thursday, he sold 21 * 3 = 63 books.",
    "Now, add the sales from Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to find the total sales for the three days.",
    "Books sold on Tuesday: 7",
    "Books sold on Wednesday: 21",
    "Books sold on Thursday: 63",
    "Total books sold = 7 + 21 + 63 = 91."
