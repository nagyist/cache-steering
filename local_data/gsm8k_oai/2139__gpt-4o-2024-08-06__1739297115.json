  "query": "If there are sixty-five dolphins in the ocean, and three times that number joins in from a river which has its mouth at the ocean, calculate the total number of dolphins in the ocean.",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, there are sixty-five dolphins in the ocean.",
    "The number of dolphins joining from the river is three times the initial number in the ocean.",
    "We calculate three times sixty-five: \\( 3 \\times 65 \\).",
    "First, multiply 3 by 60, which is 180.",
    "Next, multiply 3 by 5, which is 15.",
    "Add these two results: 180 + 15 = 195.",
    "So, there are 195 dolphins joining from the river.",
    "To find the total number of dolphins, we add the initial number of dolphins in the ocean to the number from the river.",
    "Add 65 and 195: \\( 65 + 195 \\).",
    "Calculate the sum: 65 + 195 = 260."
