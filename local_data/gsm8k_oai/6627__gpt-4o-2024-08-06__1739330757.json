  "query": "John has been having trouble sleeping lately.  In the past week he was only able to get 3 hours of sleep on 2 of the days and on the remaining days he was only able to get 60% of the recommended 8 hours of sleep.  How much sleep did he get this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.",
    "John got 3 hours of sleep on 2 of these days. So, I can start by calculating the total sleep for those 2 days.",
    "3 hours per day for 2 days equals 3 * 2 = 6 hours.",
    "Next, I need to determine how much sleep John got on the remaining days. There are 7 days in a week, and 2 days have already been accounted for, so 7 - 2 = 5 remaining days.",
    "John gets 60% of the recommended 8 hours of sleep for these 5 days. So first, I need to calculate what 60% of 8 hours is.",
    "60% in decimal form is 0.6. I calculate 0.6 * 8 = 4.8 hours.",
    "John got 4.8 hours of sleep on each of these remaining 5 days. Now I calculate the total sleep for these 5 days.",
    "4.8 hours per day for 5 days equals 4.8 * 5 = 24 hours.",
    "Finally, I add the sleep he got on the first 2 days to the sleep he got on the remaining 5 days to find the total sleep for the week.",
    "6 hours (from the first 2 days) + 24 hours (from the remaining 5 days) equals 6 + 24 = 30 hours."

  "solution": "30"
