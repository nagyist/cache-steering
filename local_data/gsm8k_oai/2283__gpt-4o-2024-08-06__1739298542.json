  "query": "Sebastian plays drums for percussion in an orchestra. He sits next to the brass section where four people play trombone, two play trumpet, and one plays a French horn. In front of them are the strings section with three violinists, a cellist, and a contrabassist. Next to the strings are a trio of clarinets and a quartet of flute players in the woodwinds section. The maestro conducts them all. How many people are in the orchestra?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to count the number of people in each section of the orchestra.",
    "I'll start with the percussion section where Sebastian plays. There is one person, Sebastian.",
    "Next, I'll count the brass section. There are four trombone players, two trumpet players, and one French horn player.",
    "In total, the brass section has 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 people.",
    "Now, I'll count the strings section. There are three violinists, one cellist, and one contrabassist.",
    "The strings section has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 people.",
    "Next, I'll count the woodwinds section with clarinets and flutes. There is a trio of clarinets, which means 3 clarinet players.",
    "There is a quartet of flute players, which means 4 flute players.",
    "The woodwinds section has 3 + 4 = 7 people.",
    "I must not forget the maestro who conducts the orchestra.",
    "I will now add up all the people in each group: percussion (1) + brass (7) + strings (5) + woodwinds (7) + maestro (1).",
    "1 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 21 people in total."
