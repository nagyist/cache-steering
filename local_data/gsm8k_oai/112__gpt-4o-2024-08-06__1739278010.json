  "query": "Lilah's family gallery has 400 photos. On a two-day trip to the Grand Canyon, they took half as many photos they have in the family's gallery on the first day and 120 more photos than they took on the first day on the second day. If they added all these photos to the family gallery, calculate the total number of photos in the gallery.",
  "steps": [
    "Lilah's family gallery initially has 400 photos.",
    "On the first day of their trip, they took half as many photos as they have in the family's gallery.",
    "Since the family gallery has 400 photos, they took 400 / 2 = 200 photos on the first day.",
    "On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day.",
    "So, on the second day, they took 200 + 120 = 320 photos.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of photos taken during the two days.",
    "They took 200 photos on the first day and 320 photos on the second day.",
    "Therefore, the total number of photos taken is 200 + 320 = 520 photos.",
    "Add these new photos to the family gallery.",
    "Initially, there were 400 photos in the gallery.",
    "Now, there are 400 + 520 = 920 photos in the gallery."
