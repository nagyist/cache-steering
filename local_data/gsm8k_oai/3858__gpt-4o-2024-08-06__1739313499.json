  "query": "Three years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister. In 5 years, her younger sister will be 16. How old is Bethany now?",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that in 5 years, Bethany's younger sister will be 16 years old.",
    "To find her current age, I'll subtract 5 years from 16.",
    "16 - 5 = 11. So, Bethany's younger sister is currently 11 years old.",
    "Now, I'll find out how old Bethany's younger sister was three years ago.",
    "I'll subtract 3 years from her current age of 11.",
    "11 - 3 = 8. So, her younger sister was 8 years old three years ago.",
    "According to the problem, three years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister.",
    "So, I need to calculate twice the age of her sister three years ago.",
    "2 * 8 = 16. Three years ago, Bethany was 16 years old.",
    "To find Bethany's current age, I must add 3 years to the age she was three years ago.",
    "16 + 3 = 19."
