  "query": "Sylvia had one-fifth of incorrect answers in the exam, while Sergio got 4 mistakes. If there were 50 questions, how many more correct answers does Sergio have than Sylvia?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many incorrect answers Sylvia had.",
    "Sylvia had one-fifth of the questions incorrect.",
    "There were 50 questions in total. So, one-fifth of 50 is calculated as 50 / 5.",
    "50 divided by 5 equals 10. This means Sylvia had 10 incorrect answers.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how many correct answers Sylvia had.",
    "The total number of questions is 50. Sylvia had 10 incorrect answers.",
    "So the number of correct answers Sylvia had is 50 - 10.",
    "50 minus 10 equals 40. Sylvia had 40 correct answers.",
    "Now, I will determine how many correct answers Sergio had.",
    "Sergio made 4 mistakes.",
    "The number of correct answers Sergio had is the total questions minus his mistakes.",
    "That's 50 - 4.",
    "50 minus 4 equals 46. Sergio had 46 correct answers.",
    "The final step is to find how many more correct answers Sergio has than Sylvia.",
    "I need to subtract Sylvia's correct answers from Sergio's.",
    "46 (Sergio's correct answers) - 40 (Sylvia's correct answers) equals 6."
