  "query": "Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry, 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, a certain amount of time cleaning her room, and 40 minutes doing homework. If she spent a total of two hours on these tasks, how long, in minutes, did she spend cleaning her room?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will convert the total time Miriam spent on tasks from hours to minutes. Two hours is equal to 120 minutes.",
    "Next, I will add up the time spent on all the tasks except for cleaning her room to see how much time that adds up to.",
    "Miriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry.",
    "She spent 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom.",
    "She spent 40 minutes doing homework.",
    "To find the total time spent on these tasks, I add: 30 minutes (laundry) + 15 minutes (bathroom) + 40 minutes (homework).",
    "30 + 15 = 45",
    "45 + 40 = 85",
    "Miriam spent 85 minutes on all tasks except for cleaning her room.",
    "To find out how long she spent cleaning her room, I will subtract the time spent on other tasks from the total time spent.",
    "120 minutes (total time) - 85 minutes (other tasks) = 35 minutes."
