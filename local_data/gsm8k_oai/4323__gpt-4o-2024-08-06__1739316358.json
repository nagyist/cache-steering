  "query": "Sandra's dog gave birth to 7 puppies. Her vet gave her 105 portions of formula to give to the puppies for 5 days. How many times a day should Sandra feed the puppies?",
  "steps": [
    "Sandra's dog has 7 puppies.",
    "The vet gave Sandra 105 portions of formula for the puppies.",
    "These portions are meant to last for 5 days.",
    "First, I need to understand how many total feedings will happen over 5 days.",
    "To do this, I'll divide the total number of portions (105) by the number of days (5).",
    "105 divided by 5 equals 21.",
    "This means there are 21 total feedings needed per day for all the puppies combined.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many times a day each puppy should be fed.",
    "Since there are 7 puppies, I'll divide the 21 total feedings per day by 7.",
    "21 divided by 7 equals 3."
