  "query": "To produce one chocolate bar, a company needs 1.5 grams of sugar. Every minute the company produces 36 chocolate bars. How many grams of sugar will the company use in two minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much sugar is required for one minute of production.",
    "The company produces 36 chocolate bars every minute.",
    "Each chocolate bar requires 1.5 grams of sugar.",
    "To find the total grams of sugar used in one minute, I multiply the number of chocolate bars produced in one minute by the amount of sugar per chocolate bar.",
    "36 chocolate bars x 1.5 grams of sugar per bar = 54 grams of sugar used in one minute.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much sugar is used in two minutes.",
    "Since the company produces the same amount of chocolate bars every minute, I can simply multiply the one-minute sugar usage by 2.",
    "54 grams of sugar per minute x 2 minutes = 108 grams of sugar in two minutes."

  "solution": "108"
