  "query": "Wyatt's mother gave him $74 to go to the store. Wyatt bought 5 loaves of bread and 4 cartons of orange juice. Each loaf of bread cost $5 and each carton of orange juice cost $2. How much money does Wyatt have left?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will calculate the total cost of the loaves of bread Wyatt bought.",
    "Wyatt bought 5 loaves of bread, and each loaf costs $5.",
    "To find the total cost for the loaves of bread, I multiply 5 by 5.",
    "5 * 5 = 25",
    "The total cost of the loaves of bread is $25.",
    "Next, I will calculate the total cost of the cartons of orange juice.",
    "Wyatt bought 4 cartons of orange juice, and each carton costs $2.",
    "To find the total cost for the orange juice, I multiply 4 by 2.",
    "4 * 2 = 8",
    "The total cost of the cartons of orange juice is $8.",
    "Now, I will find the total amount of money Wyatt spent at the store.",
    "I add the total costs of bread and orange juice together: 25 + 8.",
    "25 + 8 = 33",
    "Wyatt spent a total of $33.",
    "Wyatt's mother originally gave him $74.",
    "To find out how much money Wyatt has left, I subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he was given.",
    "74 - 33 = 41"

  "solution": "41"
