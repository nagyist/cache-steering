  "query": "Kaiden is collecting cans of soup for the local soup kitchen. He collects 158 cans during his first week and 259 during the second week. If his goal is to collect 500 cans how many more cans of soup does he need to collect?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of cans Kaiden has collected so far.",
    "Kaiden collected 158 cans in the first week.",
    "Kaiden collected 259 cans in the second week.",
    "To find the total number of cans collected, I will add the cans from both weeks: 158 + 259.",
    "Let's add these numbers step by step.",
    "8 (from 158) + 9 (from 259) = 17. Put down 7, carry over 1.",
    "5 (from 158) + 5 (from 259) = 10, plus the carried over 1 = 11. Put down 1, carry over 1.",
    "1 (from 158) + 2 (from 259) = 3, plus the carried over 1 = 4.",
    "The total number of cans collected is 417.",
    "Kaiden's goal is to collect 500 cans.",
    "To find out how many more cans he needs, I will subtract the total collected from his goal: 500 - 417.",
    "Let's perform the subtraction step by step.",
    "0 - 7 is not possible, so I need to borrow 1 from the next left digit.",
    "10 - 7 = 3.",
    "I then move to the tens column: 9 (after borrowing) - 1 = 8.",
    "Finally, move to the hundreds column: 4 - 4 = 0.",
    "The result of 500 - 417 is 83."
