  "query": "Santino has 2 papaya trees and 3 mango trees. If each papaya tree produces 10 papayas and each mango tree produces 20 mangos, how many fruits does Santino have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find the total number of papayas from the papaya trees.",
    "Santino has 2 papaya trees.",
    "Each papaya tree produces 10 papayas.",
    "To find the total number of papayas, I multiply the number of trees by the number of papayas per tree.",
    "2 papaya trees * 10 papayas per tree = 20 papayas.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of mangos from the mango trees.",
    "Santino has 3 mango trees.",
    "Each mango tree produces 20 mangos.",
    "To find the total number of mangos, I multiply the number of trees by the number of mangos per tree.",
    "3 mango trees * 20 mangos per tree = 60 mangos.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of fruits from both papayas and mangos.",
    "I add the total number of papayas (20) to the total number of mangos (60).",
    "20 papayas + 60 mangos = 80 fruits."
