  "query": "In a day, Sam hunts 6 animals. Rob hunts half as many animals as Sam. Mark hunts 1/3 of the total of what Rob and Sam hunt. If Peter hunts 3 times as many animals as Mark does, how many animals do they all hunt in a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll calculate how many animals Rob hunts. Since Rob hunts half as many animals as Sam, and Sam hunts 6 animals, Rob hunts 6 / 2 = 3 animals.",
    "Next, I'll determine the total number of animals hunted by Rob and Sam together. This would be Sam's 6 animals plus Rob's 3 animals, which adds up to 6 + 3 = 9 animals.",
    "Now I'll find out how many animals Mark hunts. Mark hunts 1/3 of the total animals Rob and Sam hunt, which is 1/3 of 9 animals. So, Mark hunts 9 / 3 = 3 animals.",
    "Next, I need to calculate how many animals Peter hunts. According to the problem, Peter hunts 3 times as many animals as Mark. Since Mark hunts 3 animals, Peter hunts 3 * 3 = 9 animals.",
    "Now, I'll sum up the animals hunted by all four of them in a day. This is the sum of animals hunted by Sam, Rob, Mark, and Peter. Sam hunts 6 animals, Rob hunts 3 animals, Mark hunts 3 animals, and Peter hunts 9 animals.",
    "Adding all these together, I get 6 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 21 animals."
