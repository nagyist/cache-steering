  "query": "Tom bought 10 packages of miniature racing cars. Each package contains five cars. He gave each of his two nephews 1/5 of the cars. How many miniature racing cars are left with Tom?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of miniature racing cars Tom bought. He bought 10 packages, each containing 5 cars.",
    "Multiply the number of packages (10) by the number of cars per package (5): \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) cars.",
    "Tom originally has 50 miniature racing cars in total.",
    "Now, determine how many cars Tom gives to each nephew. He gives each nephew 1/5 of the total cars.",
    "Calculate 1/5 of 50 by dividing 50 by 5: \\(50 \\div 5 = 10\\).",
    "Tom gives 10 cars to each nephew.",
    "Since he has two nephews, calculate the total number of cars given to both nephews by multiplying the cars given to one nephew by 2: \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\).",
    "Tom gave away 20 cars in total.",
    "To find out how many cars are left with Tom, subtract the total cars given from the original number of cars. So, \\(50 - 20 = 30\\)."
