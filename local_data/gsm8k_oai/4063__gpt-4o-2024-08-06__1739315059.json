  "query": "At Hank\u2019s cafe, he sells big stack pancakes which have 5 pancakes and short stack pancakes which have 3 pancakes.  If 9 customers order the short stack and 6 customers order the big stack, how many pancakes does Hank need to make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of pancakes required for the short stack orders. Each short stack has 3 pancakes.",
    "There are 9 customers ordering short stacks. So, I will multiply 9 by 3 to find the total number of pancakes for short stacks.",
    "9 short stacks x 3 pancakes per short stack = 27 pancakes.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total number of pancakes required for the big stack orders. Each big stack has 5 pancakes.",
    "There are 6 customers ordering big stacks. So, I will multiply 6 by 5 to find the total number of pancakes for big stacks.",
    "6 big stacks x 5 pancakes per big stack = 30 pancakes.",
    "Now, I will add the total number of pancakes for short stacks and big stacks together to get the total number of pancakes Hank needs to make.",
    "27 pancakes (short stacks) + 30 pancakes (big stacks) = 57 pancakes."

  "solution": "57"
