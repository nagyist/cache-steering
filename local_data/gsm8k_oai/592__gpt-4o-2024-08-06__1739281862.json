  "query": "John uses 5 liters of fuel per km to travel. How many liters of fuel should John plan to use if he plans to travel on two trips of 30 km and 20 km?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total distance John plans to travel.",
    "The first trip is 30 km, and the second trip is 20 km.",
    "I add the distances: 30 km + 20 km = 50 km.",
    "John uses 5 liters of fuel per km.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total fuel consumption for 50 km.",
    "I multiply the total distance by the fuel consumption rate: 50 km * 5 liters/km.",
    "The result is 250 liters."
