  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the cost of the adult's ticket.",
    "The adult's ticket costs $8.",
    "Next, I will subtract the cost of the adult's ticket from the total amount of money the adult has.",
    "$35 - $8 = $27",
    "This means the adult has $27 left to spend on children's tickets.",
    "A child's ticket costs $3.",
    "To find out how many children's tickets can be bought with $27, I'll divide the remaining money by the cost of one child's ticket.",
    "$27 \u00f7 $3 = 9",
    "The adult can buy 9 children's tickets with the remaining $27."
