  "query": "A store owner buys clothes wholesale and adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price. The retail price of a pair of pants is $36. What is the wholesale price?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that the store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.",
    "Let's represent the wholesale price as \\( x \\).",
    "If the retail price is $36, then \\( x + 0.8x = 36 \\).",
    "This can be rewritten as \\( 1.8x = 36 \\).",
    "To find \\( x \\), I need to divide both sides by 1.8.",
    "\\( x = \\frac{36}{1.8} \\).",
    "I will now perform the division \\( \\frac{36}{1.8} \\).",
    "Dividing 36 by 1.8 gives me 20.",
    "I have found that the wholesale price, \\( x \\), is $20."
