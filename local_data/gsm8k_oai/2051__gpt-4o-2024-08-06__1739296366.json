  "query": "Mary wants to bake 10 apple pies for a charity event. Each pie needs 8 apples and she already harvested 50 apples from the trees in her garden. How many more apples does she need to buy to make all 10 pies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of apples Mary needs for 10 apple pies.",
    "Each pie needs 8 apples, so for 10 pies, she needs 10 times 8 apples.",
    "10 pies * 8 apples per pie = 80 apples needed in total.",
    "Mary already has 50 apples harvested from her garden.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many more apples she needs by subtracting the number of apples she already has from the total number of apples needed.",
    "80 apples needed - 50 apples she has = 30 more apples she needs to buy."

  "solution": "30"
