  "query": "James took a job delivering groceries in his neighborhood. He can carry 10 bags on each trip. If he takes 20 trips a day, how many bags does he deliver in 5 days?",
  "steps": [
    "James can carry 10 bags per trip.",
    "He takes 20 trips a day.",
    "To find out how many bags he delivers in one day, I need to multiply the number of bags per trip by the number of trips per day.",
    "10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many bags he delivers in 5 days.",
    "To find the total, I will multiply the number of bags per day by the number of days.",
    "200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags."
