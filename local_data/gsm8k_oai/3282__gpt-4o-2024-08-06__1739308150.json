  "query": "It\u2019s February 2021.  Mark was born in January 1976.  Graham is 3 years younger than Mark, and Graham\u2019s sister, Janice, is 1/2 the age of Graham.  How old is Janice?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how old Mark is in February 2021.",
    "Mark was born in January 1976. From January 1976 to January 2021, it is exactly 45 years.",
    "Since it's February 2021, Mark has already turned 45 years old.",
    "Graham is 3 years younger than Mark.",
    "Since Mark is 45 years old, Graham, being 3 years younger, is 45 - 3 = 42 years old.",
    "Janice is half the age of Graham.",
    "To find Janice's age, I divide Graham's age by 2. So, 42 / 2 = 21."

  "solution": "21"
