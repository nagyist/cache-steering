  "query": "Judson, Camilo, and Kenny decided to contribute money to paint their house. Judson contributed $500, Kenny contributed 20% more money than Judson, and Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny. How much was the cost of painting the house?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money Kenny contributed.",
    "Kenny contributed 20% more than Judson.",
    "Judson contributed $500.",
    "20% of $500 is calculated by multiplying $500 by 0.2.",
    "$500 * 0.2 = $100.",
    "Now, I add $100 to Judson's contribution to find Kenny's contribution.",
    "Kenny contributed $500 + $100 = $600.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Camilo contributed.",
    "Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny.",
    "Kenny contributed $600, so Camilo's contribution is $600 + $200.",
    "Camilo contributed $800.",
    "Finally, I need to add the contributions of Judson, Kenny, and Camilo together to find the total cost of painting the house.",
    "Judson contributed $500, Kenny contributed $600, and Camilo contributed $800.",
    "Adding these amounts together: $500 + $600 + $800.",
    "$500 + $600 = $1100.",
    "$1100 + $800 = $1900."
