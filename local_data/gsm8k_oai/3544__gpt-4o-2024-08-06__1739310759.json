  "steps": [
    "There are 100 employees in total at the company.",
    "60% of the employees drive to work.",
    "To find out how many employees drive to work, calculate 60% of 100.",
    "60% of 100 is calculated as (60/100) * 100 = 60.",
    "So, 60 employees drive to work.",
    "To find out how many employees do not drive to work, subtract the number of employees who drive from the total number of employees.",
    "100 - 60 = 40 employees do not drive to work.",
    "According to the problem, half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation.",
    "Calculate half of 40 to find out how many take public transportation.",
    "Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20."
