  "query": "Daria wants to go to a concert by her favorite band. She wants to buy tickets for her and for three of her friends. One ticket cost is $90. How much money does Daria need to earn if she currently has only $189?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total number of tickets Daria plans to buy.",
    "Daria wants to buy a ticket for herself and three friends, so she will buy 1 + 3 = 4 tickets.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the 4 tickets.",
    "Each ticket costs $90. Therefore, the total cost is 4 tickets \u00d7 $90 per ticket.",
    "Calculating the multiplication: 4 \u00d7 90 = $360.",
    "Now I know the total cost is $360.",
    "Daria currently has $189.",
    "To find out how much more money Daria needs, I need to subtract the amount she already has from the total cost.",
    "Calculating the subtraction: $360 - $189 = $171."

  "solution": "171"
