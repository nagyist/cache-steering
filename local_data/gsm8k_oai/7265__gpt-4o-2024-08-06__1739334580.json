  "steps": [
    "The total number of pieces in the chocolate bar is 60.",
    "Michael takes half of the bar, so he takes 60 / 2 pieces.",
    "60 / 2 = 30, so Michael takes 30 pieces.",
    "After Michael takes his share, there are 60 - 30 pieces left.",
    "60 - 30 = 30, so there are 30 pieces remaining.",
    "Paige takes half of the remaining 30 pieces.",
    "30 / 2 = 15, so Paige takes 15 pieces.",
    "After Paige takes her share, there are 30 - 15 pieces left.",
    "30 - 15 = 15, so there are 15 pieces remaining for Mandy."
