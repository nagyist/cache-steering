  "query": "Mr. Rocky went to the market to sell his handmade crafts on a particular week. He was selling jewelry at $30 each and paintings at $100 each. However, he realized the income from the sales wasn't worth the labor and materials he had used, so he decided to increase the price of jewelry by $10 each and the cost of each painting by 20%. Calculate the total price a buyer who takes two pieces of jewelry and five paintings would pay",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the original price of jewelry and paintings based on the given prices.",
    "The original price of each piece of jewelry was $30.",
    "The original price of each painting was $100.",
    "Now let's increase the price of the jewelry according to the problem. The price is increased by $10 each.",
    "The new price of each piece of jewelry is $30 + $10 = $40.",
    "Now, let's increase the price of the paintings by 20%.",
    "20% of the original painting price ($100) is calculated as 0.20 * $100 = $20.",
    "The new price of each painting is $100 + $20 = $120.",
    "Now calculate the total price for two pieces of jewelry at the new price.",
    "The total price for two pieces of jewelry is 2 * $40 = $80.",
    "Now calculate the total price for five paintings at the new price.",
    "The total price for five paintings is 5 * $120 = $600.",
    "Finally, add the cost of the jewelry and the paintings to get the total price a buyer would pay for two pieces of jewelry and five paintings.",
    "The total price the buyer would pay is $80 (jewelry) + $600 (paintings) = $680."
