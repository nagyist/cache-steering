  "query": "Billy buys a 12 pack of soda from the store.  If he has twice as many brothers as sisters, and he has 2 sisters, how many sodas can he give to each of his siblings if he wants to give out the entire 12 pack while giving each the same number?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many brothers Billy has.",
    "According to the question, Billy has twice as many brothers as sisters.",
    "Billy has 2 sisters.",
    "Therefore, Billy has 2 (sisters) x 2 (twice as many brothers) = 4 brothers.",
    "Now I know Billy has 4 brothers and 2 sisters.",
    "To find the total number of siblings, I add the number of brothers and sisters.",
    "4 brothers + 2 sisters = 6 siblings.",
    "Billy has 12 sodas to give out to all his siblings equally.",
    "I need to divide the 12 sodas among the 6 siblings.",
    "12 sodas \u00f7 6 siblings = 2 sodas per sibling."

  "solution": "2"
