  "query": "Jesse is desperately trying to finish a book for a school book report due on Monday so he can play this weekend. Friday afternoon, he read the first 5 chapters, which were 10, 15, 27, 12, and 19 pages, respectively, before taking a break. To his dismay, he found that he was only 1/3 of the way through the book. How many pages does he still have to read?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pages Jesse read on Friday afternoon.",
    "Jesse read 5 chapters.",
    "The number of pages in each chapter are 10, 15, 27, 12, and 19 pages respectively.",
    "I will add these numbers to find the total pages read: 10 + 15 + 27 + 12 + 19.",
    "10 + 15 is 25.",
    "25 + 27 is 52.",
    "52 + 12 is 64.",
    "64 + 19 is 83.",
    "Jesse has read 83 pages.",
    "Jesse is only 1/3 of the way through the book.",
    "If 83 pages is 1/3 of the book, then the total number of pages in the book is 3 times 83.",
    "I will calculate 3 times 83.",
    "3 times 83 is 249.",
    "The total book is 249 pages.",
    "To find out how many pages are left for Jesse to read, I need to subtract the pages he has already read from the total number of pages.",
    "249 minus 83 is the calculation needed.",
    "249 minus 83 is 166."

  "solution": "166"
