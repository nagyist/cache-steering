  "query": "On Monday Samson ate 3 sandwiches at lunch and ate twice as many at dinner. The next morning, he felt sick from eating all those sandwiches, so he only ate one sandwich for breakfast. How many more sandwiches in total did Samson eat on Monday than Tuesday?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many sandwiches Samson ate on Monday.",
    "On Monday, at lunch, he ate 3 sandwiches.",
    "At dinner, he ate twice as many sandwiches as he had at lunch.",
    "Twice 3 sandwiches is 6 sandwiches.",
    "So, at dinner, he ate 6 sandwiches.",
    "Now, I'll add the number of sandwiches eaten at lunch and dinner on Monday to get the total.",
    "3 sandwiches at lunch plus 6 sandwiches at dinner equals 9 sandwiches on Monday.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many sandwiches Samson ate on Tuesday.",
    "On Tuesday morning, Samson ate only 1 sandwich for breakfast.",
    "From the information given, it appears he didn't eat any more sandwiches that day, only the 1 for breakfast.",
    "Samson ate 1 sandwich on Tuesday.",
    "To find out how many more sandwiches he ate on Monday than Tuesday, I'll subtract the number of sandwiches he ate on Tuesday from the number he ate on Monday.",
    "9 sandwiches on Monday minus 1 sandwich on Tuesday equals 8 more sandwiches on Monday than Tuesday."
