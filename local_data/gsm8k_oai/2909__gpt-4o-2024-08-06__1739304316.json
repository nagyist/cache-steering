  "query": "Alan went to the market and bought 20 eggs at the price of $2 per egg. He bought 6 chickens for the price of $8 per chicken. How much money did Alan spend at the market?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the eggs.",
    "I have 20 eggs, and each egg costs $2.",
    "So, the total cost for the eggs is 20 eggs * $2/egg.",
    "This equals $40.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost for the chickens.",
    "Alan bought 6 chickens, and each chicken costs $8.",
    "So, the total cost for the chickens is 6 chickens * $8/chicken.",
    "This equals $48.",
    "Now, I need to add the cost of the eggs and the chickens to find the total amount Alan spent.",
    "The cost of the eggs is $40, and the cost of the chickens is $48.",
    "So, the total amount spent is $40 + $48.",
    "This equals $88."
