  "query": "Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan. Mary then adds 10 more pieces of candy to her collection. If Megan has 5 pieces of candy, how many does Mary have in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much candy Mary has initially in relation to Megan.",
    "I know that Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan.",
    "Megan has 5 pieces of candy.",
    "So, I calculate 3 times 5 to find out how much candy Mary initially has.",
    "3 times 5 equals 15.",
    "Mary initially has 15 pieces of candy.",
    "Mary then adds 10 more pieces to her collection.",
    "I need to add these 10 pieces to Mary's initial amount of 15 pieces.",
    "15 plus 10 equals 25.",
    "Therefore, in total, Mary has 25 pieces of candy now."

  "solution": "25"
