  "query": "A gold coin is worth 50 dollars and a silver coin is worth 25 dollars. If you have 3 gold coins, 5 silver coins, and 30 dollars cash, how much money do you have in dollars?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the value of the gold coins.",
    "Each gold coin is worth 50 dollars.",
    "I have 3 gold coins.",
    "The total value of the gold coins is 3 gold coins times 50 dollars per gold coin.",
    "3 times 50 is 150.",
    "So, the value of the gold coins is 150 dollars.",
    "Next, I consider the value of the silver coins.",
    "Each silver coin is worth 25 dollars.",
    "I have 5 silver coins.",
    "The total value of the silver coins is 5 silver coins times 25 dollars per silver coin.",
    "5 times 25 is 125.",
    "So, the value of the silver coins is 125 dollars.",
    "Now, I have to add the values of the gold coins, silver coins, and cash.",
    "I have 150 dollars from the gold coins.",
    "I have 125 dollars from the silver coins.",
    "I have 30 dollars in cash.",
    "I sum these amounts: 150 dollars plus 125 dollars plus 30 dollars.",
    "150 plus 125 is 275.",
    "275 plus 30 is 305."

  "solution": "305"
