  "query": "Rick held a fundraiser and is figuring out who still owes money. He marked on a sheet how much everyone has promised to contribute, but he forgot to note how much some people had actually paid. Altogether, everyone has promised to contribute $400, and Rick has actually received $285.  Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl all still owe money. Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts, Amy owes $30, and Derek owes half as much as Amy. How much, in dollars, do Sally and Carl each owe?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much money is still owed in total.",
    "The total promised amount is $400, and Rick has received $285.",
    "So the total amount still owed is $400 - $285, which equals $115.",
    "Now, I need to determine how much each of the individuals owe, starting with Amy and Derek.",
    "Amy owes $30.",
    "Derek owes half as much as Amy. Half of $30 is $15.",
    "Together, Amy and Derek owe $30 + $15, which equals $45.",
    "Now I subtract the amount owed by Amy and Derek from the total amount still owed.",
    "$115 (total amount still owed) - $45 (amount owed by Amy and Derek) equals $70.",
    "The amount remaining, $70, is owed by Sally and Carl together.",
    "Sally and Carl owe equal amounts, so I divide the remaining $70 equally between them.",
    "$70 divided by 2 equals $35."

  "solution": "35"
