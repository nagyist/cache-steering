  "query": "A jar of jellybeans has 14 blue jellybeans, 26 purple jellybeans and 40 orange jellybeans. If there are 200 jellybeans in the jar, how many are there of the red color?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of jellybeans accounted for by adding the blue, purple, and orange jellybeans.",
    "I have 14 blue jellybeans.",
    "I have 26 purple jellybeans.",
    "I have 40 orange jellybeans.",
    "Adding these together: 14 + 26 + 40.",
    "14 + 26 is 40.",
    "40 + 40 is 80.",
    "So, there are 80 jellybeans accounted for by blue, purple, and orange colors.",
    "The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200.",
    "To find the number of red jellybeans, I need to subtract the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans from the total number.",
    "200 - 80 = 120.",
    "Therefore, there are 120 red jellybeans in the jar."
