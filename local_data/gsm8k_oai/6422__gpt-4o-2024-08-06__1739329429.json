  "query": "Eric decides to go to the park. He runs for 20 minutes, then jogs for 10 minutes to reach the park. When he returns, he takes a different route home and this takes him 3 times as long as his trip there. How long does it take Eric to return home?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the total time Eric spent getting to the park.",
    "Eric ran for 20 minutes and jogged for 10 minutes.",
    "I add these times together: 20 minutes + 10 minutes = 30 minutes.",
    "Now, I know that the time taken to reach the park is 30 minutes.",
    "When returning home, Eric takes a different route which takes him 3 times as long as his trip to the park.",
    "I need to calculate 3 times the time it took to reach the park.",
    "3 times 30 minutes = 90 minutes.",
    "So, the time it takes Eric to return home is 90 minutes."

  "solution": "90"
