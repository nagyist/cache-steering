  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find Robert's current age.",
    "I'm told that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years.",
    "If Robert will be 30 after 2 years, then currently, Robert's age is 30 - 2.",
    "Calculating that gives me Robert's current age as 28.",
    "Now, I'm told that Patrick is half the age of Robert.",
    "Since Robert is currently 28 years old, Patrick's current age would be 28 / 2.",
    "Calculating that gives Patrick's current age as 14."
