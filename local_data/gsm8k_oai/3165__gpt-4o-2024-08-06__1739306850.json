  "query": "In seven years, Talia will be 20 years old.  Talia's mom is currently three times as old as Talia is today.  In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today.  Currently, how many years old is Talia's father?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine Talia's current age. Since Talia will be 20 years old in seven years, I can set up the equation: Talia's current age + 7 = 20.",
    "Solve for Talia's current age: Talia's current age = 20 - 7.",
    "Talia's current age is 13 years old.",
    "Next, I will determine Talia's mom's current age. Since Talia's mom is three times as old as Talia is today, I use the equation: Talia's mom's age = 3 * Talia's current age.",
    "So, Talia's mom's age = 3 * 13 = 39 years old.",
    "Now, I need to determine Talia's father's current age. In three years, Talia's father will be the same age as Talia's mom is today.",
    "Therefore, Talia's father's age in three years = Talia's mom's current age, which is 39.",
    "So, we solve for Talia's father's current age by subtracting 3 from 39: Talia's father's current age = 39 - 3.",
    "Talia's father's current age is 36 years old."

  "solution": "36"
