    "First, I need to understand the relationship between Sam's and Billy's money.",
    "Billy has $25 less than twice the money that Sam has.",
    "Sam has $75.",
    "Calculate twice the amount of money Sam has: 2 * $75 = $150.",
    "Now, subtract $25 from $150 to find how much Billy has: $150 - $25 = $125.",
    "Billy has $125.",
    "To find the total amount of money Sam and Billy have together, I add Sam's and Billy's amounts.",
    "Sam has $75, and Billy has $125.",
    "Add the two amounts: $75 + $125 = $200."
