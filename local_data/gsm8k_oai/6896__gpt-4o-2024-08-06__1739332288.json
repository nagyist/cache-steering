  "query": "Cindy and Olaf made 15 candied apples which they will be selling for $2 each, and 12 candied grapes which they will be selling for $1.5. How much will they earn if they sell everything?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to calculate the total income from selling the candied apples first.",
    "They sell each candied apple for $2.",
    "They made 15 candied apples.",
    "To find the income from candied apples, multiply the number of candied apples by the price per apple: 15 apples \u00d7 $2/apple.",
    "15 \u00d7 2 = 30.",
    "The total income from selling all the candied apples is $30.",
    "Next, I will calculate the income from selling the candied grapes.",
    "They sell each candied grape for $1.5.",
    "They made 12 candied grapes.",
    "To find the income from candied grapes, multiply the number of candied grapes by the price per grape: 12 grapes \u00d7 $1.5/grape.",
    "12 \u00d7 1.5 = 18.",
    "The total income from selling all the candied grapes is $18.",
    "To find the total income from selling everything, add the income from candied apples to the income from candied grapes: $30 + $18.",
    "30 + 18 = 48."
