  "query": "Lizzy had $30. She loaned out $15 to her friend. How much will Lizzy have if her friend returned the money with an interest of 20%?",
  "steps": [
    "Lizzy initially had $30.",
    "She loaned $15 to her friend, reducing her current funds to $30 - $15 = $15.",
    "Her friend will return the loaned amount with 20% interest.",
    "First, calculate 20% of $15.",
    "20% of $15 is calculated as 0.20 * $15 = $3.",
    "The total amount returned by the friend is the original $15 + $3 interest.",
    "This equals $15 + $3 = $18.",
    "Once her friend returns the money with interest, Lizzy will have her current funds plus the returned amount.",
    "Lizzy will have $15 (current funds) + $18 (returned amount) = $33."

  "solution": "33"
