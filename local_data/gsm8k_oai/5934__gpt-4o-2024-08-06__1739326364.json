  "query": "Ms. Cole teaches math in three levels of classes in her school. There are four times as many students in Ms. Cole's fourth-level math class as in her sixth-level math class. The number of students in her seventh-level math class is twice that in the fourth-level math class.  If Ms. Cole's sixth-level class has 40 students, how many math students does Ms. Cole teach?",
  "steps": [
    "To find the total number of students Ms. Cole teaches, I need to first identify the number of students in each of her math classes. I already know that the sixth-level class has 40 students.",
    "According to the problem, Ms. Cole's fourth-level class has four times as many students as the sixth-level class.",
    "Since the sixth-level class has 40 students, the fourth-level class has 4 times 40, which is 160 students.",
    "Next, the number of students in the seventh-level class is twice that in the fourth-level class.",
    "The fourth-level class has 160 students, so the seventh-level class has 2 times 160, which is 320 students.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of students by adding the numbers of students in each class: sixth-level, fourth-level, and seventh-level.",
    "The total is 40 (sixth-level) + 160 (fourth-level) + 320 (seventh-level).",
    "The sum of these numbers is 40 + 160 + 320, which equals 520."

  "solution": "520"
