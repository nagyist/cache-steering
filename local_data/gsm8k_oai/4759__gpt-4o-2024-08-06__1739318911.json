  "query": "James decides to buy himself a new barbell.  It cost 30% more than his old $250 barbell.  How much did it cost?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the cost of James's old barbell, which is $250.",
    "Next, I need to calculate 30% of $250 to find out how much more the new barbell costs compared to the old one.",
    "To find 30%, I calculate 30/100 of $250.",
    "I multiply $250 by 0.30, which equals $75.",
    "Now, I add this additional cost to the original price of the old barbell.",
    "$250 + $75 equals $325.",
    "The new barbell costs $325."

  "solution": "325"
