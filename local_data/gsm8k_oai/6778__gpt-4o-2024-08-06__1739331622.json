    "Joey starts by taking 1 pill on the first day.",
    "On the second day, Joey takes 1 (from the first day) + 2 = 3 pills.",
    "On the third day, Joey takes 3 (from the second day) + 2 = 5 pills.",

    "On the fifth day, Joey takes 7 (from the fourth day) + 2 = 9 pills.",
    "On the sixth day, Joey takes 9 (from the fifth day) + 2 = 11 pills.",
    "On the seventh day, Joey takes 11 (from the sixth day) + 2 = 13 pills.",
