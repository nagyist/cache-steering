  "query": "Nine adults went to a play with seven children. Adult tickets are $11 each and children's tickets are $7 each. How many dollars more did the adults' tickets cost in total than the children's tickets in total?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.",
    "There are 9 adults, and each adult ticket costs $11.",
    "To find the total cost for adults, I multiply 9 adults by $11 per ticket.",
    "9 * 11 = $99",
    "Now, I need to calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.",
    "There are 7 children, and each child ticket costs $7.",
    "To find the total cost for children, I multiply 7 children by $7 per ticket.",
    "7 * 7 = $49",
    "I now have the total costs: $99 for adults and $49 for children.",
    "I need to find the difference between the total cost of the adult tickets and the children's tickets.",
    "I subtract the total cost of children's tickets from the total cost of adult tickets: $99 - $49.",
    "99 - 49 = $50"

  "solution": "50"
