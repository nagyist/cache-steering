  "query": "Teresa scored 70 marks in science, 80 in music, 85 in social studies, and the physics exam, which was the hardest test that Teresa had ever taken in her entire life, she scored half as many marks as she scored in music. Calculate the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects.",
  "steps": [
    "Teresa's score in science is 70 marks.",
    "Teresa's score in music is 80 marks.",
    "Teresa's score in social studies is 85 marks.",
    "We need to find Teresa's score in physics.",
    "The problem states that Teresa scored half as many marks in physics as she did in music.",
    "Teresa scored 80 marks in music.",
    "Half of 80 marks is 80 / 2 = 40 marks.",
    "Teresa scored 40 marks in physics.",
    "Now, we add up all the marks from each subject.",
    "Science: 70 marks.",
    "Music: 80 marks.",
    "Social Studies: 85 marks.",
    "Physics: 40 marks.",
    "Total marks = 70 + 80 + 85 + 40.",
    "70 + 80 = 150.",
    "150 + 85 = 235.",
    "235 + 40 = 275."
