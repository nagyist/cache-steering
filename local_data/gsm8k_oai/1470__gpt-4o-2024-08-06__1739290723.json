  "query": "Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how long Ayen jogs on a typical weekday.",
    "Ayen normally jogs for 30 minutes each weekday.",
    "Next, I'll calculate how much she jogged from Monday to Friday without any changes.",
    "Normally, she would jog 30 minutes each on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and 30 minutes on Tuesday and Friday before accounting for any changes.",
    "Adding these up: 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30 minutes = 150 minutes for a normal week.",
    "Now, let's account for the changes on Tuesday and Friday.",
    "On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more, so that's 30 + 5 = 35 minutes on Tuesday.",
    "On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more, so that's 30 + 25 = 55 minutes on Friday.",
    "Now, I'll find the total jogging time considering the changes.",
    "Monday: 30 minutes, Tuesday: 35 minutes, Wednesday: 30 minutes, Thursday: 30 minutes, Friday: 55 minutes.",
    "Adding these up: 30 + 35 + 30 + 30 + 55 minutes = 180 minutes.",
    "To convert the total minutes to hours, I divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.",
    "180 minutes divided by 60 equals 3 hours."
