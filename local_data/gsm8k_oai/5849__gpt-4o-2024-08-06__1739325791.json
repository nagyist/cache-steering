  "query": "Max watches a show every day that airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm and only airs during weekdays. If he watches every episode during the week but misses the Friday episode, how many hours of the show did he watch?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to determine the number of days Max watched the show.",
    "The show airs every weekday, from Monday to Friday.",
    "Max watches the show from Monday to Thursday, since he misses Friday's episode.",
    "There are 4 weekdays from Monday to Thursday.",
    "Next, I calculate the duration of each episode.",
    "Each episode lasts from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, which is 30 minutes.",
    "Since Max watches the episodes from Monday to Thursday, I need to multiply 30 minutes by 4 days.",
    "30 minutes multiplied by 4 days equals 120 minutes.",
    "Now I convert 120 minutes into hours.",
    "120 minutes is equivalent to 2 hours."
