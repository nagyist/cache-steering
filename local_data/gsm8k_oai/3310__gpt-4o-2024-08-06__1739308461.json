  "query": "Aubriella is pouring water into a 50-gallon fish tank at the rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds. How many more gallons will she have to pour into the tank to fill the tank if she poured water into the fish tank for 6 minutes?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's calculate the total time Aubriella has been pouring water in seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute.",
    "Aubriella has been pouring water for 6 minutes. So, in seconds, this would be 6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 360 seconds.",
    "Now we know that she pours 1 gallon every 20 seconds. Let's see how many 20-second intervals fit into 360 seconds.",
    "360 seconds / 20 seconds/gallon = 18 gallons. This means 18 gallons have been poured into the tank so far.",
    "The fish tank has a capacity of 50 gallons, and 18 gallons have already been poured.",
    "Now, let's calculate how many more gallons are needed to fill the tank. We subtract the number of gallons already in the tank from the total capacity.",
    "50 gallons (total capacity) - 18 gallons (poured) = 32 gallons"
  ],
  "solution": "32"
