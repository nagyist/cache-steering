  "query": "Kendy made 2 online bank transactions. She transferred $60 to her mom and half that amount to her sister. As a result, her account now has $100 left in it. How much money was in the account before the transfer?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Kendy transferred to her sister.",
    "Kendy transferred $60 to her mom.",
    "Half of $60 is $30.",
    "So, Kendy transferred $30 to her sister.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total amount Kendy transferred.",
    "Kendy transferred $60 to her mom and $30 to her sister.",
    "Total transferred = $60 + $30 = $90.",
    "Kendy's account now has $100 left.",
    "To find out how much money was initially in her account, I need to add the amount transferred to the remaining balance.",
    "Initial amount = Remaining balance + Total transferred.",
    "Initial amount = $100 + $90.",
    "Initial amount = $190."

  "solution": "190"
