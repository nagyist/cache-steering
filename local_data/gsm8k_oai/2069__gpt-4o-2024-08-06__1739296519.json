  "steps": [
    "Page has 80 pairs of fancy shoes initially.",
    "She decides to donate 30% of her collection.",
    "To find out how many pairs she donates, calculate 30% of 80.",
    "30% of 80 is calculated as (30/100) * 80.",
    "(30/100) * 80 is 24.",
    "Page donates 24 pairs of shoes.",
    "Subtract the donated pairs from the initial total: 80 - 24.",
    "80 - 24 equals 56.",
    "After donating, Page has 56 pairs of shoes.",
    "Page treats herself by buying 6 more pairs.",
    "Add the new pairs to her remaining collection: 56 + 6.",
    "56 + 6 equals 62."
