  "query": "A toy car factory made 60 cars yesterday. Today, they made twice the number of cars than yesterday. How many toy cars did the factory make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the problem.",
    "The factory made 60 toy cars yesterday.",
    "Today, they made twice the number of cars compared to yesterday.",
    "To find the number of cars made today, I need to multiply the number of cars made yesterday by 2.",
    "60 cars yesterday multiplied by 2 equals 120 cars.",
    "So, today, the factory made 120 toy cars.",
    "To find the total number of toy cars made over the two days, I need to add the number of cars made yesterday and today.",
    "60 cars (yesterday) + 120 cars (today) = 180 cars in total."

  "solution": "180"
