  "query": "James buys 5 packs of beef that are 4 pounds each.  The price of beef is $5.50 per pound.  How much did he pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total weight of beef James bought.",
    "James bought 5 packs of beef, and each pack is 4 pounds.",
    "Therefore, the total weight is 5 packs * 4 pounds per pack = 20 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total cost by using the price per pound.",
    "The price of beef is $5.50 per pound.",
    "I multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 20 pounds * $5.50 per pound.",
    "20 * 5.50 = $110."
