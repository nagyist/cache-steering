  "query": "Gerald thought it would be funny to trick his coworker, who's allergic to peanuts, into eating a peanut butter cookie. When his coworker goes into anaphylactic shock and is taken to the hospital, Gerald is arrested. The judge sentences Gerald to 3 months for assault and 2 years for poisoning, then extends his sentence by 1/3 since this is Gerald's third offense. How many months does Gerald spend in jail?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out the total sentence from the assault and poisoning charges.",
    "Gerald is sentenced to 3 months for assault.",
    "He is also sentenced to 2 years for poisoning.",
    "First, I need to convert the 2 years into months.",
    "1 year is equal to 12 months, so 2 years is 24 months.",
    "Now, I add the months for assault and poisoning together: 3 months + 24 months = 27 months.",
    "This is not Gerald\u2019s final sentence; it is extended by 1/3.",
    "To find 1/3 of 27 months, I divide 27 by 3.",
    "27 divided by 3 is 9.",
    "Now, I add this extension to the original total: 27 months + 9 months = 36 months."

  "solution": "36"
