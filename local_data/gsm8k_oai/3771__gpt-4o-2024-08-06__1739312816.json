  "query": "Jenny is scraping gum off the bottom of the seats in a stadium with two sections. Section A has 1 subsection with 60 seats and 3 subsections with 80 seats each. Section B has 20 more seats than 3 times as many seats as Section A has total. How many seats does Section B have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of seats in Section A.",
    "Section A has 1 subsection with 60 seats.",
    "There are also 3 subsections with 80 seats each.",
    "To find the number of seats in the three subsections with 80 seats each, I need to multiply 80 by 3.",
    "80 multiplied by 3 equals 240. So, the subsections have 240 seats combined.",
    "Now, I add the 60 seats from the first subsection to the 240 seats from the other subsections.",
    "60 plus 240 equals 300. Therefore, Section A has 300 seats in total.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how many seats Section B has.",
    "According to the problem, Section B has 20 more seats than 3 times the number of seats in Section A.",
    "First, I calculate 3 times the number of seats in Section A.",
    "3 times 300 equals 900.",
    "Adding 20 to 900 gives the total number of seats in Section B.",
    "900 plus 20 equals 920."

  "solution": "920"
