  "query": "Bekah had to read 408 pages for history class. She read 113 pages over the weekend and has 5 days left to finish her reading. How many pages will she need to read each day for 5 days to complete her assignment?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find out how many pages Bekah has left to read.",
    "She has already read 113 pages out of 408 pages.",
    "To find the remaining pages, I subtract the pages she has read from the total pages.",
    "408 - 113 = 295",
    "Bekah has 295 pages left to read.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many pages she should read each day over the next 5 days.",
    "I will divide the remaining pages by the number of days left.",
    "295 \u00f7 5 = 59",
    "So, Bekah needs to read 59 pages each day."

  "solution": "59"
