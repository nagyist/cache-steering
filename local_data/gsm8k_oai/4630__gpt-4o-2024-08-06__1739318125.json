  "query": "The big fashion show is being planned for next week.  The show includes runway models strutting up and down the runway wearing designer clothing in front of an audience.  There are two parts to the show: evening wear and bathing suits.  It takes a model 2 minutes to walk out to the end of the runway and back, and models take turns, one at a time, walking the runway up and back, while wearing different clothes.  If there are 6 models in the show, and each model will wear two sets of bathing suits and three sets of evening wear clothing during the runway portion of the show, how long will it take, in minutes, to complete all of the runway trips during the show?",
  "steps": [
    "I need to find out how many total runway trips each model will make.",
    "Each model wears two sets of bathing suits and three sets of evening wear.",
    "Thus, each model will walk the runway two times for bathing suits and three times for evening wear.",
    "This amounts to a total of 2 (bathing suit) + 3 (evening wear) = 5 trips per model.",
    "Next, I need to find the total number of trips for all models combined.",
    "Since there are 6 models, and each makes 5 trips, the total number of runway trips is 6 models * 5 trips/model = 30 trips.",
    "Each trip takes 2 minutes.",
    "So, the total time for all trips is 30 trips * 2 minutes/trip = 60 minutes."

  "solution": "60"
