  "steps": [
    "First, understand that the price of the movie ticket was $100 last week.",
    "The price is down by 20%, which means there is a 20% decrease in the price.",
    "Calculate 20% of $100 to find out how much the price has decreased.",
    "20% of $100 is 0.20 \u00d7 100.",
    "0.20 \u00d7 100 equals $20.",
    "Subtract the decrease from the original price: $100 - $20.",
    "$100 - $20 equals $80."
