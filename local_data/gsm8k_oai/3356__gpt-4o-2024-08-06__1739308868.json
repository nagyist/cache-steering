  "query": "Angel has written letters to all of her pen pals and is putting all of the letters in envelopes. Most of the letters are put into large envelopes and the remaining 20 letters are put into small envelopes. The large envelopes each contain 2 letters each. If Angel has written a total of 80 letters, how many large envelopes did she use?",
  "steps": [
    "Angel wrote a total of 80 letters.",
    "She placed 20 letters into small envelopes.",
    "The remaining letters therefore are 80 - 20 = 60 letters.",
    "Each large envelope contains 2 letters.",
    "To find out how many large envelopes she used, divide the remaining letters by the number of letters per large envelope.",
    "60 letters divided by 2 letters per large envelope equals 30 large envelopes."
  ],
  "solution": "30"
