  "query": "John decides to trade in his stereo system.  His old system cost 250 dollars and he got 80% of the value for it.  He then buys a system that costs $600 that he gets a 25% discount on.  How much money came out of his pocket?",
  "steps": [
    "John's old stereo system originally cost 250 dollars.",
    "He receives 80% of the value of his old system when trading it in.",
    "I need to calculate 80% of 250 dollars.",
    "80% of 250 dollars is calculated as (80/100) * 250.",
    "(80/100) * 250 equals 200 dollars.",
    "So, John receives 200 dollars for his old stereo system.",
    "The new system he wants to buy costs 600 dollars.",
    "He gets a 25% discount on the new stereo system.",
    "I need to calculate 25% of 600 dollars to find out how much he saves with the discount.",
    "25% of 600 dollars is calculated as (25/100) * 600.",
    "(25/100) * 600 equals 150 dollars.",
    "Thus, the discount is 150 dollars.",
    "The price after the discount is calculated by subtracting the 150 dollar discount from the original 600 dollar price.",
    "600 dollars - 150 dollars equals 450 dollars.",
    "The new stereo system costs 450 dollars after the discount.",
    "John has 200 dollars from trading in his old stereo system.",
    "To find out how much money came out of his pocket, I subtract the 200 dollars he received for his old system from the 450 dollars cost of the new system.",
    "450 dollars - 200 dollars equals 250 dollars."
