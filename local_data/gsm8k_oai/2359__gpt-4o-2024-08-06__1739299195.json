  "query": "Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Joshua paid for each orange.",
    "Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. So, I divide the total cost by the number of oranges: $12.50 / 25 oranges.",
    "12.50 divided by 25 is 0.50. This means Joshua paid $0.50 for each orange.",
    "Now, I need to compare the selling price of each orange to the purchase price to calculate the profit.",
    "Joshua sells each orange for 60 cents. I should convert this to dollars to compare: 60 cents is $0.60.",
    "The profit Joshua makes on each orange is the selling price minus the purchase price.",
    "The selling price is $0.60, and the purchase price is $0.50. So the profit is $0.60 - $0.50.",
    "$0.60 - $0.50 equals $0.10 profit per orange.",
    "Since the final answer needs to be in cents, I'll convert $0.10 to cents. $0.10 is equivalent to 10 cents."

  "solution": "10"
