  "query": "Melinda is taking a 1200-mile trip with her family to visit their cousins. How much time will they save if they drive 60 miles an hour instead of 50 miles an hour?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much time it takes to drive the 1200-mile trip at 50 miles per hour.",
    "To find the time, I use the formula: time = distance/speed.",
    "At 50 miles per hour, time = 1200 miles / 50 miles per hour = 24 hours.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the time it takes to drive the same 1200-mile trip at 60 miles per hour.",
    "Using the same formula, at 60 miles per hour, time = 1200 miles / 60 miles per hour = 20 hours.",
    "Now, I'll find the difference in time between driving at 50 miles per hour and 60 miles per hour.",
    "The time saved is 24 hours - 20 hours = 4 hours."
