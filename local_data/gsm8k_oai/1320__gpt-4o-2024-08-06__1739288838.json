  "steps": [
    "Shaniqua makes $12 for every haircut.",
    "Shaniqua gives 8 haircuts.",
    "To find the total earnings from haircuts, I need to multiply the number of haircuts by the earnings per haircut.",
    "The calculation is 8 haircuts * $12 per haircut = $96.",
    "Shaniqua makes $25 for every style.",
    "Shaniqua performs 5 styles.",
    "To find the total earnings from styles, I need to multiply the number of styles by the earnings per style.",
    "The calculation is 5 styles * $25 per style = $125.",
    "Now I need to add the total earnings from haircuts and the total earnings from styles to find the total amount Shaniqua makes.",
    "The calculation is $96 (from haircuts) + $125 (from styles) = $221."
