  "query": "Martin went on an eight-hour business trip. During the first half of the trip, he traveled at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour and during the second half at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did he travel during the journey?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand that Martin's trip is divided into two equal halves in terms of time.",
    "Since the whole trip is 8 hours, each half is 4 hours long.",
    "For the first half of the trip, Martin travels at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour for 4 hours.",
    "The distance covered in the first half is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time: 70 km/h * 4 h = 280 km.",
    "For the second half of the trip, Martin travels at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour for 4 hours.",
    "The distance covered in the second half is calculated similarly: 85 km/h * 4 h = 340 km.",
    "To find the total distance traveled, I need to add the distance of the first and second halves together: 280 km + 340 km.",
    "The total distance traveled is 620 kilometers."

  "solution": "620"
