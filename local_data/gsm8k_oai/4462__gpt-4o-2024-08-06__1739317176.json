  "query": "John buys 20 bars of soap each weighing 1.5 pounds for $.5 per pound.  How much money did he spend on soap?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to figure out the total weight of the soap bars John buys.",
    "Each bar of soap weighs 1.5 pounds.",
    "John buys 20 bars of soap.",
    "To find the total weight, I multiply the number of bars by the weight of each bar: 20 bars * 1.5 pounds/bar.",
    "20 * 1.5 = 30 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much John pays per pound.",
    "He pays $0.5 per pound.",
    "To find the total cost, I multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 30 pounds * $0.5/pound.",
    "30 * 0.5 = 15.",
    "John spent $15 on soap."
