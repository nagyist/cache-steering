  "query": "Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane\u2019s?",
  "steps": [
    "Lana initially has 8 blank pages in her binder.",
    "Duane has 42 pages in his binder.",
    "Duane takes half of the pages from his binder to give to Lana.",
    "Half of 42 is calculated as 42 divided by 2, which equals 21.",
    "Duane gives 21 pages to Lana.",
    "To find out how many pages Lana has after receiving Duane\u2019s pages, I need to add the 21 pages from Duane to the 8 pages Lana already has.",
    "8 pages + 21 pages = 29 pages."
