  "query": "Davonte is trying to figure out how much space his art collection takes up. He measures his paintings and finds he has three square 6-foot by 6-foot paintings, four small 2-foot by 3-foot paintings, and one large 10-foot by 15-foot painting. How many square feet does his collection take up?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the area of the three square paintings. Each square painting has a side length of 6 feet.",
    "The area of one square painting is 6 feet x 6 feet = 36 square feet.",
    "Since he has three square paintings, the total area for these is 3 paintings x 36 square feet per painting = 108 square feet.",
    "Next, I will calculate the area of the four small paintings. Each small painting is 2 feet by 3 feet.",
    "The area of one small painting is 2 feet x 3 feet = 6 square feet.",
    "For four small paintings, the total area is 4 paintings x 6 square feet per painting = 24 square feet.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the area of the large painting, which is 10 feet by 15 feet.",
    "The area of the large painting is 10 feet x 15 feet = 150 square feet.",
    "Finally, I will add the areas of all the paintings together to find the total area of the collection.",
    "The total area of the collection is 108 square feet + 24 square feet + 150 square feet.",
    "Calculating the sum: 108 + 24 = 132, and then 132 + 150 = 282."

  "solution": "282"
