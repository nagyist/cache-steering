  "query": "Christine and Rachel went strawberry picking.  They want to make pies and need 3 pounds of strawberries per pie.  Christine picked 10 pounds of strawberries and Rachel picked twice as much as Rachel.  Together, how many pies can they make?",
  "steps": [
    "Christine picked 10 pounds of strawberries.",
    "Rachel picked twice as much as Christine, so I need to calculate 2 times 10.",
    "2 times 10 is 20.",
    "Rachel picked 20 pounds of strawberries.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of pounds picked by Christine and Rachel together.",
    "Christine picked 10 pounds and Rachel picked 20 pounds. I need to add these two amounts together.",
    "10 plus 20 equals 30.",
    "Together, Christine and Rachel picked 30 pounds of strawberries.",
    "They need 3 pounds of strawberries per pie.",
    "I need to divide the total pounds of strawberries by the pounds of strawberries needed per pie to find out how many pies they can make.",
    "30 divided by 3 equals 10."
