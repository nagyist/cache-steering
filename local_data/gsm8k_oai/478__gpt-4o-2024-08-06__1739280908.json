  "query": "Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve. Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim. If Jim weighs 110 pounds and the three of them crowd onto a scale at the same time, what is their total weight?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Steve weighs. I know that Steve is eight pounds lighter than Jim.",
    "Jim weighs 110 pounds. If Steve is eight pounds lighter, I subtract 8 from 110.",
    "110 - 8 = 102. Therefore, Steve weighs 102 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to find out how much Stan weighs. I know that Stan weighs 5 more pounds than Steve.",
    "Since Steve weighs 102 pounds, I add 5 to this weight to find Stan's weight.",
    "102 + 5 = 107. Therefore, Stan weighs 107 pounds.",
    "Now that I have the weights of all three individuals, I need to add their weights together to find their total weight when they stand on the scale together.",
    "Jim weighs 110 pounds, Steve weighs 102 pounds, and Stan weighs 107 pounds. I need to sum these three numbers.",
    "110 + 102 + 107 = 319."
  ],
  "solution": "319"
