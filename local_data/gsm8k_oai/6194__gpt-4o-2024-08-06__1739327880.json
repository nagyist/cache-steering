  "query": "Matt and Blake want to watch every episode of the show The Office. There are 201 episodes. If they watch 1 episode every Monday and 2 episodes every Wednesday each week, how many weeks will it take them to watch the whole series?",
  "steps": [
    "The show has 201 episodes in total.",
    "Each week, they watch 1 episode on Monday.",
    "Each week, they also watch 2 episodes on Wednesday.",
    "This means they watch 1 + 2 = 3 episodes per week.",
    "To find out how many weeks it will take, divide the total number of episodes by the number of episodes they watch per week.",
    "201 episodes \u00f7 3 episodes per week = 67 weeks."
