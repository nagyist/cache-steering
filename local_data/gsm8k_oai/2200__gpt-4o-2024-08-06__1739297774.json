  "query": "Farmer Brown fed 7 chickens and 5 sheep. How many total legs were there among the animals he fed?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many legs a chicken has.",
    "Chickens have 2 legs each.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll calculate the total number of legs for the chickens.",
    "There are 7 chickens, and each has 2 legs.",
    "7 chickens * 2 legs per chicken = 14 legs for all chickens.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many legs a sheep has.",
    "Sheep have 4 legs each.",
    "Next, I\u2019ll calculate the total number of legs for the sheep.",
    "There are 5 sheep, and each has 4 legs.",
    "5 sheep * 4 legs per sheep = 20 legs for all sheep.",
    "Now, I\u2019ll add the total legs of the chickens and the sheep to find the total number of legs.",
    "14 legs (from chickens) + 20 legs (from sheep) = 34 legs in total."
