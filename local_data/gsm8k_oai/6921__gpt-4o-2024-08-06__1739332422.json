  "query": "Yanni has $0.85. His mother gave him $0.40 in addition. While going to the mall, Yanni found $0.50. He bought a toy that cost $1.6. How much money in cents did Yanni have left?",
  "steps": [
    "Yanni initially had $0.85.",
    "His mother gave him an additional $0.40.",
    "So, adding the two amounts: $0.85 + $0.40 = $1.25.",
    "Yanni found another $0.50.",
    "Adding this to the previous total: $1.25 + $0.50 = $1.75.",
    "Yanni then bought a toy costing $1.60.",
    "To find out how much money he has left, subtract the toy's cost from his total money: $1.75 - $1.60 = $0.15.",
    "Convert $0.15 into cents: $0.15 is equivalent to 15 cents."

  "solution": "15"
