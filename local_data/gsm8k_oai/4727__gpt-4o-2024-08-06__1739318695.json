  "query": "On March 1st the sun sets at 6 PM.  Every day after the sun sets 1.2 minutes later.  It is 6:10 PM and 40 days after March 1st.  How many minutes until the sun sets?",
  "steps": [
    "I know that March 1st is the starting point and the sun sets at 6 PM that day.",
    "The sun sets 1.2 minutes later each subsequent day.",
    "I need to calculate the total number of days since March 1st, which is given as 40 days.",
    "For each of these 40 days, the sun sets 1.2 minutes later than the previous day.",
    "I will calculate the total additional minutes the sun sets later after 40 days: 40 days \u00d7 1.2 minutes/day = 48 minutes.",
    "Therefore, on the 40th day after March 1st, the sun sets at 6 PM + 48 minutes = 6:48 PM.",
    "The current time is 6:10 PM, and I need to find out how many minutes until the sunset on this 40th day.",
    "From 6:10 PM to 6:48 PM is a difference of 38 minutes."
