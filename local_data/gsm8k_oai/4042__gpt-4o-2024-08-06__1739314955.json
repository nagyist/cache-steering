  "query": "Carlson bought land that cost $8000 and additional land that cost $4000. He initially owned 300 square meters of land. If the land he bought costs $20 per square meter, how big is his land after buying the new land?",
  "steps": [
    "Carlson bought land that cost a total of $8000 + $4000.",
    "The total cost of the land he bought is $12000.",
    "The cost of the new land is $20 per square meter.",
    "To find the total square meters of land he bought, I need to divide the total cost by the cost per square meter.",
    "I divide $12000 by $20 per square meter.",
    "$12000 / $20 = 600 square meters.",
    "Carlson initially owned 300 square meters of land.",
    "The total amount of land Carlson has now is 300 square meters plus the 600 square meters he bought.",
    "300 + 600 = 900 square meters."
