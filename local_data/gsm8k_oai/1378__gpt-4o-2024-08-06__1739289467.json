  "query": "Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. If Brenda weighs 220 pounds, what is Mel's weight?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I start by defining what I know. Let Mel's weight be denoted as M.",
    "According to the problem, Brenda's weight is 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. This can be expressed as: Brenda's weight = 3 * Mel's weight + 10.",
    "I'm given that Brenda's weight is 220 pounds. So, I can set up the equation: 220 = 3 * M + 10.",
    "Now I need to solve for M. To do that, I first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with M. So, 220 - 10 = 3 * M.",
    "This simplifies to 210 = 3 * M.",
    "To find the value of M, I divide both sides of the equation by 3. So, M = 210 / 3.",
    "Now I perform the division: 210 divided by 3 is 70.",
    "Thus, Mel's weight is 70 pounds."
