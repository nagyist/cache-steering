  "query": "Dale just learned how to make homemade macaroni and cheese. He decided to make a big batch for his family reunion. The original recipe calls for 2 pounds of pasta and serves 7 people. Dale's family reunion will have 35 people. How many pounds of pasta does Dale need to buy?",
  "steps": [
    "The original recipe serves 7 people with 2 pounds of pasta.",
    "Dale's family reunion will have 35 people.",
    "To find out how many times bigger the reunion batch needs to be compared to the original recipe, I need to divide 35 by 7.",
    "35 divided by 7 equals 5.",
    "So, Dale needs to make 5 times the original recipe to serve everyone at the reunion.",
    "The original recipe uses 2 pounds of pasta. Therefore, for 5 times the recipe, he will need 5 times 2 pounds of pasta.",
    "5 times 2 is 10."

  "solution": "10"
