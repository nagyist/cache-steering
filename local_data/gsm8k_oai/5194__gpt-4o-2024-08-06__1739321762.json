  "query": "Sean designs and sells patches.  He orders his patches in a unit of 100 and is charged $1.25 per patch.  If he turns around and sells all 100 patches for $12.00 each, what is his net profit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the cost of ordering 100 patches.",
    "Each patch costs $1.25, so for 100 patches, the total cost is 100 * $1.25.",
    "100 * $1.25 = $125. This is the total cost Sean incurs for the patches.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling the patches.",
    "Each patch is sold for $12.00, so for 100 patches, the total revenue is 100 * $12.00.",
    "100 * $12.00 = $1,200. This is the total revenue from selling the patches.",
    "Now, I need to determine the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.",
    "Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost",
    "Net profit = $1,200 - $125",
    "$1,200 - $125 = $1,075."
