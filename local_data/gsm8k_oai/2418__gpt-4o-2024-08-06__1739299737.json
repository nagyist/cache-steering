  "query": "Lyra has an $80 budget for a week to spend on food. If she bought 1 bucket of fried chicken that costs $12 and 5 pounds of beef that cost $3 per pound. How much is left on her weekly budget?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, which is $12.",
    "Next, I calculate the cost of the 5 pounds of beef. Each pound costs $3, so I multiply 5 pounds by $3 per pound.",
    "5 pounds * $3/pound = $15",
    "Now, I add the cost of the fried chicken and the beef together to find the total amount spent.",
    "$12 (fried chicken) + $15 (beef) = $27",
    "Lyra's budget is $80 for the week. To find out how much is left, I subtract the total amount spent from her budget.",
    "$80 (total budget) - $27 (total spent) = $53"
  ],
  "solution": "53"
