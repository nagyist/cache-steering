  "query": "A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?",
  "steps": [
    "The wire is divided into three smaller pieces in a ratio of 7:3:2.",
    "If the shortest piece is 16 cm, that corresponds to the last part of the ratio, which is 2.",
    "To find the length of each part of the ratio, the shortest piece is 16 cm and represents the \"2\" in the ratio 7:3:2.",
    "Let's find the unit length for each part of the ratio: 16 cm / 2 = 8 cm per unit.",
    "Using the unit length, calculate the lengths of the other pieces.",
    "For the piece that represents \"3\" in the ratio: 3 * 8 cm = 24 cm.",
    "For the piece that represents \"7\" in the ratio: 7 * 8 cm = 56 cm.",
    "Now add the lengths of all three pieces to find the total length of the original wire.",
    "Original wire length = shortest piece + middle piece + longest piece.",
    "Original wire length = 16 cm + 24 cm + 56 cm.",
    "Original wire length = 96 cm."
