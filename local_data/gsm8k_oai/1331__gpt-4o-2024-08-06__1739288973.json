  "steps": [
    "Jane's goal is to exercise 1 hour each day.",
    "She wants to exercise 5 days a week.",
    "This means in one week, Jane exercises for 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.",
    "Jane maintains this weekly routine for 8 weeks.",
    "Therefore, in 8 weeks, she exercises for 5 hours/week * 8 weeks.",
    "Calculating that gives 5 * 8 = 40 hours.",
    "I will check the calculations again: 1 hour/day * 5 days/week = 5 hours/week. 5 hours/week * 8 weeks = 40 hours."

  "solution": "40"
