  "query": "Wickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?",
  "steps": [
    "Wickham invites 30 people to the party.",
    "Half of the 30 guests bring a plus one. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 guests bring someone with them.",
    "Each of these 15 guests brings an additional person. Therefore, there are 15 additional people attending.",
    "To find the total attendance, add the original 30 guests to the 15 plus ones. This results in 30 + 15 = 45 people in total.",
    "Each person will have a 3-course meal, and a new plate is used for each course.",
    "Thus, for each person, 3 plates are needed.",
    "To find the total number of plates needed, multiply the total number of people by the number of plates per person: 45 people * 3 plates per person = 135 plates."

  "solution": "135"
