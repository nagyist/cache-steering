  "query": "Jillian had 80 oranges which she had bought to give to her friends. She divided each orange into ten equal pieces for each friend to get four pieces. How many friends were there?",
  "steps": [
    "Jillian has 80 oranges in total.",
    "She divides each orange into 10 pieces.",
    "So, for 80 oranges, the total number of pieces would be 80 oranges * 10 pieces/orange = 800 pieces.",
    "Each friend receives 4 pieces.",
    "To find the number of friends, I need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces each friend receives.",
    "800 pieces \u00f7 4 pieces/friend = 200 friends."

  "solution": "200"
