  "query": "Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many dice Jerry has.",
    "Since Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan, I multiply the number of dice Ivan has by 2.",
    "Ivan has 20 dice, so I calculate 20 * 2 = 40.",
    "Jerry has 40 dice.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of dice Ivan and Jerry have together.",
    "I add the number of dice Ivan has to the number of dice Jerry has.",
    "Ivan has 20 dice and Jerry has 40 dice. So, I calculate 20 + 40.",
    "20 + 40 = 60."
