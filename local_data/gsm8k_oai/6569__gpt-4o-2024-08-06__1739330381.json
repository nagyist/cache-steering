  "steps": [
    "The price per person for the trip is $147.",
    "Both Ali and Leila will receive a discount of $14 each.",
    "First, calculate the price for one person after the discount.",
    "The original price per person is $147.",
    "Subtract the discount of $14 from $147.",
    "$147 - $14 = $133",
    "Each person pays $133 after the discount.",
    "Now, calculate the total cost for both Ali and Leila.",
