    "Sally picks 30 seashells on Monday.",
    "On Tuesday, she picks half as many seashells as she did on Monday.",
    "Half of 30 seashells is 15 seashells.",
    "On Tuesday, Sally picks 15 seashells.",
    "Total number of seashells Sally picked is 30 (Monday) + 15 (Tuesday).",
    "Adding the seashells picked on both days: 30 + 15 = 45.",
    "Sally has a total of 45 seashells.",
    "Each seashell can be sold for $1.20.",
    "To find out how much money Sally can make, multiply the total number of seashells by the price per seashell.",
    "Multiply 45 seashells by $1.20 per seashell: 45 x 1.20.",
    "45 x 1.20 equals 54."
