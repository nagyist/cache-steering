  "query": "Jennie drives to her son\u2019s house in 5 hours when there is heavy traffic. When there is no traffic the same trip takes only 4 hours. If her son's house is 200 miles away, what is the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate her average speed when there is heavy traffic.",
    "The distance to her son's house is 200 miles, and it takes her 5 hours to drive there when there is heavy traffic.",
    "To find the speed, I'll use the formula: speed = distance/time.",
    "So, her average speed during heavy traffic is 200 miles / 5 hours = 40 miles per hour.",
    "Next, I need to calculate her average speed when there is no traffic.",
    "The distance is still 200 miles, but it takes only 4 hours.",
    "Again, using the formula: speed = distance/time.",
    "Her average speed when there is no traffic is 200 miles / 4 hours = 50 miles per hour.",
    "Finally, I need to find the difference between the two average speeds.",
    "The difference is 50 miles per hour - 40 miles per hour = 10 miles per hour."
