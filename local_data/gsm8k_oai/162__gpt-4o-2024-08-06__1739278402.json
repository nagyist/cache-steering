  "query": "Daniel has a collection of 346 video games. 80 of them, Daniel bought for $12 each. Of the rest, 50% were bought for $7. All others had a price of $3 each. How much did Daniel spend on all the games in his collection?",
  "steps": [
    "Daniel has a collection of 346 video games in total.",
    "Out of these, he bought 80 games for $12 each.",
    "The cost for these 80 games is calculated by multiplying 80 by $12.",
    "80 multiplied by 12 is 960.",
    "So, Daniel spent $960 on the 80 games.",
    "Now, let's find out how many games are left.",
    "346 total games minus 80 games is 266 games remaining.",
    "Of these 266 games, 50% were bought for $7 each.",
    "To find 50% of 266, divide 266 by 2.",
    "266 divided by 2 is 133.",
    "So, there are 133 games that were bought for $7 each.",
    "The cost for these 133 games is calculated by multiplying 133 by $7.",
    "133 multiplied by 7 is 931.",
    "So, Daniel spent $931 on the 133 games.",
    "The remaining games were bought for $3 each.",
    "The number of remaining games is 266 minus 133.",
    "266 minus 133 is 133.",
    "So, there are 133 games that were bought for $3 each.",
    "The cost for these 133 games is calculated by multiplying 133 by $3.",
    "133 multiplied by 3 is 399.",
    "So, Daniel spent $399 on the 133 games.",
    "Now, we add up the total cost for all games.",
    "Total cost is $960 (for the first 80 games) plus $931 (for the next 133 games) plus $399 (for the last 133 games).",
    "$960 plus $931 is $1891.",
    "$1891 plus $399 is $2290."

  "solution": "2290"
