  "query": "A few friends are making a small movie.  They hire a few actors and that cost $1200.  They also get food for the 50 people there.  Each person gets $3 worth of food.  Equipment rental costs twice as much as food and actors combined.  They sold the movie for $10,000.  How much profit did they make?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total cost of the food for 50 people.",
    "Each person gets $3 worth of food, so the total cost of food is 50 people times $3 per person.",
    "50 times 3 equals 150, so the total cost of the food is $150.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the cost of the equipment rental.",
    "The equipment rental costs twice as much as the combined cost of food and actors.",
    "The combined cost of food and actors is the sum of $1200 for actors and $150 for food.",
    "$1200 plus $150 equals $1350.",
    "The equipment rental cost is twice $1350, so I need to multiply $1350 by 2.",
    "$1350 times 2 equals $2700, so the equipment rental costs $2700.",
    "Now, I will calculate the total expenses by adding the cost of actors, food, and equipment rental.",
    "The total expenses are $1200 (actors) plus $150 (food) plus $2700 (equipment rental).",
    "$1200 plus $150 equals $1350.",
    "$1350 plus $2700 equals $4050.",
    "Now, I know that the total expenses are $4050.",
    "The movie was sold for $10,000.",
    "To find the profit, I subtract the total expenses from the selling price.",
    "$10,000 minus $4050 equals $5950."

  "solution": "5950"
