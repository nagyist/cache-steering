  "query": "Charles can earn $15 per hour when he housesits and $22 per hour when he walks a dog. If he housesits for 10 hours and walks 3 dogs, how many dollars will Charles earn?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate how much Charles earns from housesitting.",
    "Charles earns $15 per hour from housesitting.",
    "He housesits for 10 hours.",
    "So, I multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: $15 * 10 = $150.",
    "Now, I need to calculate how much Charles earns from walking dogs.",
    "He earns $22 per hour when walking a dog.",
    "It's important to know how many hours he walks each dog.",
    "The problem doesn't specify the number of hours for dog walking, only that he walks 3 dogs.",
    "Let's assume each dog walk takes 1 hour. This means he walks for 3 hours total.",
    "Now I multiply the hourly rate for dog walking by the number of hours: $22 * 3 = $66.",
    "Finally, I add the earnings from housesitting and dog walking to find the total earnings.",
    "$150 (housesitting) + $66 (dog walking) = $216."

  "solution": "216"
