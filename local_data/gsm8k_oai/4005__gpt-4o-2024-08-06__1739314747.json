  "query": "Shelby had $20 to take to the book fair. She bought one book for $8 and another for $4. She decided to buy as many $4 posters as she could with the money she had left. How many posters can she buy?",
  "steps": [
    "Shelby started with $20.",
    "She bought the first book for $8.",
    "After buying the first book, she has $20 - $8 = $12 left.",
    "She then bought the second book for $4.",
    "After buying the second book, she has $12 - $4 = $8 left.",
    "Posters cost $4 each.",
    "To find out how many posters she can buy, I need to divide the money she has left by the cost of one poster.",
    "So, $8 \u00f7 $4 = 2.",
    "Shelby can buy 2 posters."
