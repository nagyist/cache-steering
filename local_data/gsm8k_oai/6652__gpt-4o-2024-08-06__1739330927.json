  "query": "In a stationery store, there are three kinds of pencils. A pencil with an eraser, which costs $0.8 each, a regular pencil for $0.5 each, and a short pencil for $0.4 each. This store was able to sell 200 pencils with an eraser, 40 regular pencils, and 35 short pencils. How much money did the store make from these sales?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the money earned from selling pencils with an eraser. The price for one pencil with an eraser is $0.8.",
    "The store sold 200 pencils with an eraser.",
    "So, the total money from pencils with an eraser is 200 pencils \u00d7 $0.8 per pencil.",
    "Calculating that gives 200 \u00d7 0.8 = $160.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the money earned from selling regular pencils. The price for one regular pencil is $0.5.",
    "The store sold 40 regular pencils.",
    "So, the total money from regular pencils is 40 pencils \u00d7 $0.5 per pencil.",
    "Calculating that gives 40 \u00d7 0.5 = $20.",
    "Now, I need to calculate the money earned from selling short pencils. The price for one short pencil is $0.4.",
    "The store sold 35 short pencils.",
    "So, the total money from short pencils is 35 pencils \u00d7 $0.4 per pencil.",
    "Calculating that gives 35 \u00d7 0.4 = $14.",
    "I need to find the total money from all the pencils sold.",
    "The total money earned is the sum of the money from pencils with an eraser, regular pencils, and short pencils.",
    "Adding these, $160 + $20 + $14 = $194."

  "solution": "194"
