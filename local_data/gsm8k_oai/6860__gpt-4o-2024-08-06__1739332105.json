  "query": "Calvin signed up for a gym training service to lose some pounds. If he weighed 250 pounds to start with and lost 8 pounds every month during the training sessions, what's his weight after one year?",
  "steps": [
    "Calvin's initial weight is 250 pounds.",
    "Each month, Calvin loses 8 pounds.",
    "There are 12 months in one year.",
    "I need to calculate the total weight loss over one year.",
    "Calvin loses 8 pounds per month x 12 months.",
    "8 pounds/month * 12 months = 96 pounds lost in a year.",
    "Now I subtract the total weight loss from Calvin's initial weight.",
    "Calvin's weight after one year = 250 pounds - 96 pounds.",
    "250 - 96 = 154 pounds."

  "solution": "154"
