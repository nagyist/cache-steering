  "query": "Angela is a bike messenger in New York. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?",
  "steps": [
    "Let the number of meals Angela delivers be represented by the variable \\( m \\).",
    "Since the problem states that Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals, the number of packages can be expressed as \\( 8m \\).",
    "According to the problem, the total number of meals and packages is 27.",
    "We can set up the equation: \\( m + 8m = 27 \\).",
    "Combine like terms to simplify the equation to \\( 9m = 27 \\).",
    "To solve for \\( m \\), divide both sides of the equation by 9: \\( m = \\frac{27}{9} \\).",
    "Calculating the division gives \\( m = 3 \\).",
    "To verify, if Angela delivers 3 meals, then the number of packages is \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).",
    "The total number of meals and packages is \\( 3 + 24 = 27 \\), which matches the given total."
