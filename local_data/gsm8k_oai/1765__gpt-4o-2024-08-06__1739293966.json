  "query": "Mama bird has 6 babies in the nest.  She needs to feed each baby 3 worms a day.  Papa bird caught 9 worms. If she caught 13 worms and had 2 stolen, how many more does she need to catch to feed them for 3 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total number of worms needed to feed the babies for one day. Each baby needs 3 worms, and there are 6 babies.",
    "Multiply 6 babies by 3 worms per baby to get 18 worms needed per day.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of worms needed to feed the babies for 3 days.",
    "Multiply 18 worms per day by 3 days to get a total of 54 worms needed.",
    "Now, calculate the total number of worms the birds currently have. Papa bird caught 9 worms, and Mama bird caught 13 worms but had 2 stolen.",
    "Subtract 2 stolen worms from Mama bird's 13 worms to get 11 worms remaining.",
    "Add Papa bird's 9 worms to Mama bird's 11 worms to get a total of 20 worms.",
    "Now, find out how many more worms Mama bird needs to catch.",
    "Subtract the total number of worms they have (20 worms) from the total number of worms needed (54 worms).",
    "54 worms needed minus 20 worms on hand equals 34 worms."

  "solution": "34"
