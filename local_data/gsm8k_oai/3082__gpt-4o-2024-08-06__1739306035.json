  "query": "Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many seashells Mimi picked up. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 * 12 = 24 seashells.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of seashells Kyle found. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So, Kyle found 2 * 24 = 48 seashells.",
    "Leigh took one-third of the seashells that Kyle found. I will calculate one-third of Kyle's 48 seashells.",
    "One-third of 48 is calculated as 48 / 3 = 16 seashells."
