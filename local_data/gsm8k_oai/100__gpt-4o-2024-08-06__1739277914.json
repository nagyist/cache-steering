  "query": "A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the number of sales made in the fabric section.",
    "The fabric section accounts for a third of the total sales.",
    "A third of 36 is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12 \\).",
    "Next, I calculate the number of sales made in the jewelry section.",
    "The jewelry section accounts for a quarter of the total sales.",
    "A quarter of 36 is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\).",
    "Now, I know the number of sales in both the fabric and jewelry sections, which are 12 and 9 respectively.",
    "I add the sales from the fabric and jewelry sections to determine the total sales made in these two sections.",
    "The total sales in the fabric and jewelry sections is \\( 12 + 9 = 21 \\).",
    "Finally, I calculate the number of sales in the stationery section by subtracting the sales from the fabric and jewelry sections from the total sales.",
    "The sales in the stationery section is \\( 36 - 21 = 15 \\)."
