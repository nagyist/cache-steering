  "query": "Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?",
  "steps": [
    "Mr. Sean charges $60 to treat each dog.",
    "Khalil took 20 dogs to the clinic.",
    "To find out how much Khalil paid for treating dogs, I need to multiply the number of dogs by the charge per dog: 20 dogs * $60 per dog.",
    "20 dogs * $60 per dog = $1200.",
    "Next, Mr. Sean charges $40 to care for each cat.",
    "Khalil took 60 cats to the clinic.",
    "To find out how much Khalil paid for caring for cats, I will multiply the number of cats by the charge per cat: 60 cats * $40 per cat.",
    "60 cats * $40 per cat = $2400.",
    "To find the total amount Khalil paid Mr. Sean, I need to add the amount paid for dogs and the amount paid for cats.",
    "$1200 (for dogs) + $2400 (for cats) = $3600."
  ],
  "solution": "3600"
