  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Washington has 140 goats.",
    "Paddington has 40 more goats than Washington.",
    "To find out how many goats Paddington has, I need to add 40 to the number of goats Washington has.",
    "140 (Washington's goats) + 40 = 180 goats for Paddington.",
    "Now, to find the total number of goats Paddington and Washington have together, I need to add Paddington's goats to Washington's goats.",
    "180 (Paddington's goats) + 140 (Washington's goats) = 320 goats in total."
