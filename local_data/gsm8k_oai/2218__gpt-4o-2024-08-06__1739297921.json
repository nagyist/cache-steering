  "query": "Eastern rattlesnakes have 6 segments in their tails, while Western rattlesnakes have 8 segments. What is the percentage difference in their tail size, expressed as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the difference in the number of segments between the two types of rattlesnakes.",
    "Eastern rattlesnakes have 6 segments, and Western rattlesnakes have 8 segments.",
    "The difference in the number of segments is 8 - 6 = 2 segments.",
    "Now, I need to express this difference as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size (8 segments).",
    "To find the percentage difference, I take the difference (2 segments) and divide it by the Western rattlesnake's tail size (8 segments).",
    "2 segments divided by 8 segments equals 0.25.",
    "Now, I convert this decimal into a percentage by multiplying by 100.",
    "0.25 times 100 equals 25."
  ],
  "solution": "25"
