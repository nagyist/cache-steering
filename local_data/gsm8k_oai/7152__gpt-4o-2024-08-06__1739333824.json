  "query": "Blanche, Rose and Dorothy liked to collect sea glass when they went to the beach.  Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.  Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.  If Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, how many pieces did Dorothy have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to calculate the total number of red pieces Blanche and Rose found together.",
    "Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass.",
    "Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass.",
    "Adding them together gives: 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass.",
    "Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose together.",
    "Twice the 12 pieces of red glass they found together is 12 * 2 = 24 pieces of red glass.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of blue pieces of sea glass Dorothy found.",
    "Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass.",
    "Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose.",
    "Three times 11 is 11 * 3 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass.",
    "Now I need to find the total number of pieces Dorothy found.",
    "Dorothy found 24 pieces of red glass and 33 pieces of blue glass.",
    "Adding these together gives: 24 + 33 = 57 pieces of glass."
