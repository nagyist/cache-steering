  "query": "Kira wants some new music on her phone. She downloads 10 songs in the morning. Later on that day, she finds 15 more songs she likes so she downloads them, and at night a friend of hers recommends 3 more songs she also downloads. Knowing that each song has a size of 5 MB, how much memory space in MB will the new songs occupy?",
  "steps": [
    "Kira downloads 10 songs in the morning.",
    "Later on, she downloads 15 more songs.",
    "At night, she downloads 3 additional songs.",
    "First, I need to find the total number of songs Kira downloaded.",
    "Total number of songs = 10 (morning) + 15 (later) + 3 (night).",
    "Total number of songs = 10 + 15 + 3 = 28 songs.",
    "Each song occupies 5 MB of space.",
    "To find the total memory space, I need to multiply the total number of songs by the size of each song.",
    "Total memory space = 28 songs * 5 MB/song.",
    "Total memory space = 140 MB."
