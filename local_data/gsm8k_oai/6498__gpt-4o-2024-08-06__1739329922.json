  "query": "DeShaun always wins the award in English class for reading the most books over the summer. This year is no different. Summer break is 80 days long. When he arrives, he notifies the teacher that he read 60 books over the summer. Each book averaged 320 pages long. The person closest to him read 75% as much as he did. How many pages did the second person read on average each day of break?",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's determine how many books the second person read over the summer.",
    "DeShaun read 60 books, and the next closest person read 75% as many books as DeShaun.",
    "Calculate 75% of 60 books: 0.75 * 60 = 45 books.",
    "Now, we know the second person read 45 books over the summer.",
    "Each book averaged 320 pages, so calculate the total number of pages the second person read.",
    "Multiply the number of books (45) by the average pages per book (320): 45 * 320 = 14,400 pages.",
    "Determine how many days were in the summer break. According to the problem, summer break is 80 days long.",
    "To find out how many pages the second person read on average each day, divide the total number of pages by the number of days of summer break.",
    "Divide 14,400 pages by 80 days: 14,400 \u00f7 80 = 180 pages."

  "solution": "180"
