  "query": "Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca and remains with 60 books. If Rebecca received 40 books, how many books did Roselyn have before?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that Rebecca received 40 books.",
    "Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca.",
    "Since Rebecca received 40 books, Mara must have received 3 times 40 books.",
    "Calculating 3 times 40 gives me 120 books that Mara received.",
    "Now, to find out how many books Roselyn originally had, I need to consider the sum of the books given to Rebecca and Mara, plus the books Roselyn has left.",
    "The books given to Rebecca are 40, and the books given to Mara are 120.",
    "Adding these, 40 + 120 equals 160 books.",
    "Roselyn still has 60 books remaining after giving books to Rebecca and Mara.",
    "Adding the remaining books to the books given becomes 160 + 60.",
    "Performing this addition gives me 220 books."

  "solution": "220"
