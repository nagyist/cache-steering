  "query": "Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?",
  "steps": [
    "Maddie makes 2 cups of coffee per day.",
    "Each cup requires 1.5 ounces of coffee beans.",
    "Calculate the total coffee beans used per day: 2 cups/day * 1.5 ounces/cup = 3 ounces/day.",
    "Calculate the total coffee beans used per week: 3 ounces/day * 7 days/week = 21 ounces/week.",
    "A bag of coffee beans costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces.",
    "Determine how many bags are needed per week: 21 ounces/week / 10.5 ounces/bag = 2 bags/week.",
    "Calculate the cost of coffee beans per week: 2 bags/week * $8/bag = $16.",
    "She uses 1/2 gallon of milk per week.",
    "A gallon of milk costs $4.",
    "Calculate the cost of milk per week: 1/2 gallon/week * $4/gallon = $2.",
    "Add the cost of coffee beans and milk to find the total weekly cost: $16 (coffee) + $2 (milk) = $18."
