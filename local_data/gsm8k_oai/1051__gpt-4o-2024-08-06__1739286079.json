  "query": "The Reptile House at the zoo has 5 fewer animals than 3 times the number of animals housed in the Rain Forest exhibit. If the Reptile House has 16 animals, how many are in the Rain Forest exhibit?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to set up an equation based on the information provided.",
    "Let the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit be represented by the variable \\( x \\).",
    "The problem states that the Reptile House has 5 fewer animals than 3 times the number in the Rain Forest exhibit.",
    "Therefore, the equation representing the situation would be: \\( 3x - 5 = \\) number of animals in the Reptile House.",
    "We are given that the Reptile House has 16 animals.",
    "So I can substitute 16 into the equation: \\( 3x - 5 = 16 \\).",
    "Now, I need to solve for \\( x \\).",
    "First, I add 5 to both sides of the equation to get: \\( 3x = 16 + 5 \\).",
    "This simplifies to: \\( 3x = 21 \\).",
    "Next, I divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 21 / 3 \\).",
    "This simplifies to: \\( x = 7 \\).",
    "Thus, the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit is 7."
