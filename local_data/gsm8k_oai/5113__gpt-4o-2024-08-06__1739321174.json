  "query": "Two birds making a nest each made 10 round trips collecting building materials. If the building materials were located 200 miles from where they were building the nest, what is the total distance the birds covered in the trips?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the distance covered by one round trip. A round trip involves traveling to the location and back, so it is twice the distance to the location.",
    "The distance to the materials is 200 miles, one way. Therefore, a round trip is 200 miles there and 200 miles back.",
    "I calculate the distance for one round trip by multiplying 200 miles by 2, which gives me 400 miles per round trip.",
    "I know each bird made 10 round trips, so I need to calculate the distance covered by one bird first.",
    "For one bird making 10 round trips, the calculation is 10 round trips multiplied by 400 miles per round trip.",
    "The total distance covered by one bird is 10 x 400 = 4000 miles.",
    "Since there are two birds, I need to calculate the total distance for both birds combined.",
    "I multiply the distance covered by one bird, which is 4000 miles, by 2 because there are two birds.",
    "The total distance covered by both birds is 4000 x 2 = 8000 miles."

  "solution": "8000"
