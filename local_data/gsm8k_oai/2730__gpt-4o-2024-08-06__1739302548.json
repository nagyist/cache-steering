  "query": "James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I identify the number of people who volunteered. There is James and 4 of his friends.",
    "This makes a total of 5 volunteers planting flowers.",
    "I know they planted a total of 200 flowers over 2 days.",
    "I need to find out how many flowers they planted per day.",
    "Since it was over 2 days, I divide the total number of flowers, 200, by 2.",
    "200 flowers divided by 2 days is 100 flowers per day.",
    "Now, I need to find out how many flowers each person planted in a day.",
    "There are 5 volunteers, so I divide the 100 flowers planted per day by 5.",
    "100 flowers per day divided by 5 people equals 20 flowers per day per person.",
    "James, being one of the volunteers, planted the same number as the others: 20 flowers in a day."
