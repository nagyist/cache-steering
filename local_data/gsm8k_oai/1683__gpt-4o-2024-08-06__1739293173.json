  "query": "In Carrie's desk drawer there are 7 yellow highlighters. There are 7 more pink highlighters than yellow highlighters, and there are 5 more blue highlighters than pink highlighters. How many highlighters are in Carrie's desk drawer in all?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the number of yellow highlighters. There are 7 yellow highlighters.",
    "Next, determine the number of pink highlighters. There are 7 more pink highlighters than yellow highlighters.",
    "Pink highlighters = number of yellow highlighters + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14.",
    "Now, determine the number of blue highlighters. There are 5 more blue highlighters than pink highlighters.",
    "Blue highlighters = number of pink highlighters + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19.",
    "Now add all the highlighters together to find the total number in the drawer.",
    "Total highlighters = yellow highlighters + pink highlighters + blue highlighters = 7 + 14 + 19.",
    "Calculate the final sum: 7 + 14 + 19 = 40."
