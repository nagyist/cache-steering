  "query": "Carrie is making punch. She adds 6 12-oz cans of Mountain Dew, 28 oz of ice, and a 40 oz bottle of fruit juice. How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to find the total amount of punch Carrie has made by adding up the amounts from all the ingredients.",
    "Carrie used 6 cans of Mountain Dew, each 12 oz. To find the total volume from Mountain Dew, I multiply 6 by 12.",
    "6 cans * 12 oz/can = 72 oz from Mountain Dew.",
    "Next, Carrie used 28 oz of ice, so I add this to the 72 oz of Mountain Dew.",
    "72 oz + 28 oz = 100 oz.",
    "Carrie also used a 40 oz bottle of fruit juice, which I need to add to the current total of 100 oz.",
    "100 oz + 40 oz = 140 oz.",
    "Now I have the total volume of the punch, which is 140 oz.",
    "Carrie wants to serve the punch in 10 oz servings, so I will divide the total amount of punch by the size of each serving.",
    "140 oz \u00f7 10 oz/serving = 14 servings."

  "solution": "14"
