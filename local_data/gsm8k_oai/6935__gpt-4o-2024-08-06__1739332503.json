  "query": "An air conditioner running for eight hours would consume 7.2 kilowatts. How many kilowatts would the air conditioner consume if it was used for 6 hours a day for 5 days?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the rate of kilowatt consumption per hour for the air conditioner.",
    "The air conditioner consumes 7.2 kilowatts when running for 8 hours.",
    "To find the consumption rate per hour, I divide the total kilowatts by the number of hours: 7.2 kilowatts / 8 hours.",
    "7.2 / 8 equals 0.9 kilowatts per hour.",
    "Now that I know the air conditioner uses 0.9 kilowatts per hour, I need to find out how many kilowatts it uses in 6 hours.",
    "To find this, I multiply the rate of 0.9 kilowatts per hour by 6 hours.",
    "0.9 * 6 equals 5.4 kilowatts.",
    "The air conditioner consumes 5.4 kilowatts when used for 6 hours in one day.",
    "Next, I calculate the total kilowatt consumption over 5 days when the air conditioner runs 6 hours each day.",
    "I multiply the daily consumption of 5.4 kilowatts by 5 days.",
    "5.4 * 5 equals 27 kilowatts.",
    "The air conditioner would consume 27 kilowatts if used for 6 hours a day for 5 days."
