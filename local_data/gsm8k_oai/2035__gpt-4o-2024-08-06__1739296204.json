  "query": "There are 14 more kittens than two times the number of puppies at the animal shelter. If there are 32 puppies at the shelter, how many kittens are there?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the relationship between the number of kittens and the number of puppies. The problem states that there are 14 more kittens than two times the number of puppies.",
    "Let P represent the number of puppies, which is given as 32.",
    "The formula for the number of kittens, K, is K = 2 * P + 14.",
    "I will substitute the value of P into the formula. So, K = 2 * 32 + 14.",
    "First, calculate 2 * 32, which is 64.",
    "Then, add 14 to 64, which gives 78."

  "solution": "78"
