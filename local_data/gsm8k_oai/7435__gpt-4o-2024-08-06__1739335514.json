  "query": "Bogan laid out 10 maggots for her pet beetle. The beetle only ate 1 and Bogan had to throw out the rest. Later that day, she tried feeding again and the beetle ate 3. If Bogan served 20 maggots in total, how many did she attempt to feed the beetle the second time?",
  "steps": [
    "Bogan initially laid out 10 maggots.",
    "The beetle ate 1 maggot from the first serving, leaving 9 maggots left over that were thrown out.",
    "Bogan served a total of 20 maggots over the course of the day.",
    "She initially served 10 maggots, so I need to determine how many she served the second time.",
    "Subtract the 10 maggots served initially from the total of 20 maggots.",
    "20 maggots total - 10 maggots initially = 10 maggots served the second time."
