  "query": "Oliver collects trading cards. He has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards. His Battle Gremlins card collection is the largest at 48 cards, three times the size of his Alien Baseball card collection. How many Monster Club cards does Oliver have?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine the number of Alien Baseball cards that Oliver has. It is given that the Battle Gremlins card collection is three times the size of his Alien Baseball card collection.",
    "I know Oliver has 48 Battle Gremlins cards. Therefore, to find the Alien Baseball card count, I'll divide the number of Battle Gremlins cards by 3.",
    "Dividing 48 by 3 gives me 16. So, Oliver has 16 Alien Baseball cards.",
    "According to the problem, Oliver has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards.",
    "Since Oliver has 16 Alien Baseball cards, he will have 16 times 2 Monster Club cards.",
    "Calculating 16 times 2 gives me 32. Therefore, Oliver has 32 Monster Club cards."

  "solution": "32"
