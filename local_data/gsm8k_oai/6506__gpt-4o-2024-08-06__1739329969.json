  "query": "Polly the parakeet tweets all day long.  When she is happy, she tweets 18 times per minute.  When she is hungry, she tweets 4 times per minute.  And when she watches herself in the mirror, she tweets 45 times per minute.  During a time period where she is happy for 20 minutes, hungry for 20 minutes, and watches her reflection for 20 minutes, what is the total number of times she will tweet?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many times Polly tweets during the 20 minutes she is happy.",
    "When Polly is happy, she tweets 18 times per minute.",
    "Therefore, in 20 minutes, Polly will tweet 18 times/minute * 20 minutes = 360 times.",
    "Next, I need to calculate the number of tweets when Polly is hungry.",
    "When Polly is hungry, she tweets 4 times per minute.",
    "Thus, in 20 minutes, Polly will tweet 4 times/minute * 20 minutes = 80 times.",
    "Now, I will calculate how many times Polly tweets while watching her reflection.",
    "When Polly watches her reflection, she tweets 45 times per minute.",
    "In 20 minutes, Polly will tweet 45 times/minute * 20 minutes = 900 times.",
    "Finally, I will add up all the tweets from the different activities to find the total.",
    "Polly tweets a total of 360 + 80 + 900 = 1340 times in 60 minutes."

  "solution": "1340"
