  "query": "After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?",
  "steps": [
    "The initial number of cats on the island is given as 1800.",
    "During the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated.",
    "After the first relocation, the number of cats left is 1800 - 600 = 1200 cats.",
    "In the second mission, half of the remaining cats (which are 1200) were relocated.",
    "Calculating half of the remaining 1200 cats: 1200 / 2 = 600 cats were relocated.",
    "After the second relocation, the number of cats left is 1200 - 600 = 600 cats."
