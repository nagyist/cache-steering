  "query": "Nick is asking all his co-workers to chip in for a birthday gift for Sandra that costs $100. The boss agrees to contribute $15, and Todd volunteers to contribute twice as much since he always has to one-up everyone. If the remaining 5 employees (counting Nick) each pay an equal amount, how much do they each pay?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how much Todd is contributing since he is paying twice as much as the boss.",
    "The boss is contributing $15.",
    "Therefore, Todd will contribute twice the boss's amount, which is 2 times $15.",
    "2 times $15 is $30.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much has been contributed so far by both the boss and Todd combined.",
    "The boss contributes $15 and Todd contributes $30.",
    "The combined contribution of the boss and Todd is $15 + $30.",
    "$15 + $30 equals $45.",
    "The total cost of the birthday gift is $100.",
    "To find out how much is left to be contributed by Nick and the other 4 employees, I subtract the combined contribution from the total cost.",
    "$100 - $45 equals $55.",
    "The remaining amount, $55, needs to be covered by Nick and the other 4 employees.",
    "So, there are 5 people (including Nick) who need to share this remaining amount equally.",
    "To find out how much each of the 5 employees should pay, I divide $55 by 5.",
    "$55 divided by 5 equals $11."

  "solution": "11"
