  "query": "Greg has his own dog walking business. He charges $20 per dog plus $1 per minute per dog for walking the dog. If he walks one dog for 10 minutes, two dogs for 7 minutes and three dogs for 9 minutes, how much money, in dollars, does he earn?",
  "steps": [
    "To solve this problem, I need to calculate Greg's earnings for each of the mentioned cases and then sum them up.",
    "First, calculate the earnings for walking one dog for 10 minutes.",
    "The base charge for one dog is $20.",
    "The additional charge for walking one dog for 10 minutes is $1 per minute times 10 minutes, which is $10.",
    "The total charge for one dog walked for 10 minutes is $20 + $10 = $30.",
    "Next, calculate the earnings for walking two dogs for 7 minutes.",
    "The base charge for two dogs is 2 times $20, which is $40.",
    "The additional charge for walking two dogs for 7 minutes is 2 dogs times $1 per minute times 7 minutes, which is $14.",
    "The total charge for two dogs walked for 7 minutes is $40 + $14 = $54.",
    "Finally, calculate the earnings for walking three dogs for 9 minutes.",
    "The base charge for three dogs is 3 times $20, which is $60.",
    "The additional charge for walking three dogs for 9 minutes is 3 dogs times $1 per minute times 9 minutes, which is $27.",
    "The total charge for three dogs walked for 9 minutes is $60 + $27 = $87.",
    "Add up all the charges: $30 for the first case, $54 for the second case, and $87 for the third case.",
    "The total earnings for the three cases is $30 + $54 + $87.",
    "Calculate the final total: $30 + $54 = $84.",
    "Add $84 + $87 = $171."

  "solution": "171"
