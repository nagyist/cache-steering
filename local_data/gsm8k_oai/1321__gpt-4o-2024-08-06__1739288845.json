  "query": "Pauline is buying school supplies. The total amount of all the items she wants to buy add up to $150 before sales tax. Sales tax is 8% of the total amount purchased. How much will Pauline spend on all the items, including sales tax?",
  "steps": [
    "Pauline's total amount before tax is $150.",
    "The sales tax is 8% of the total amount before tax.",
    "To find the sales tax, I need to calculate 8% of $150.",
    "First, I convert 8% to a decimal by dividing by 100. So, 8% becomes 0.08.",
    "Next, I multiply $150 by 0.08 to find the sales tax.",
    "$150 * 0.08 = $12",
    "The sales tax is $12.",
    "To find the total amount Pauline will spend, I need to add the sales tax to the total amount before tax.",
    "I add $150 (the cost before tax) and $12 (the sales tax).",
    "$150 + $12 = $162"
  ],
  "solution": "162"
