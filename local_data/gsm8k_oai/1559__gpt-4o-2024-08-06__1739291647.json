  "query": "Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?",
  "steps": [
    "Maci needs to determine the cost of one red pen first.",
    "A red pen costs twice as much as a blue pen.",
    "A blue pen costs 10 cents.",
    "Twice the cost of a blue pen is 10 cents multiplied by 2.",
    "This means a red pen costs 20 cents.",
    "Now, Maci needs to calculate the total cost for the blue pens.",
    "Maci needs 10 blue pens.",
    "The cost for 10 blue pens is 10 pens multiplied by 10 cents per pen.",
    "This results in 100 cents for the blue pens.",
    "Next, Maci needs to calculate the total cost for the red pens.",
    "Maci needs 15 red pens.",
    "The cost for 15 red pens is 15 pens multiplied by 20 cents per pen.",
    "This results in 300 cents for the red pens.",
    "Now, Maci must calculate the total cost for both the blue and red pens together.",
    "The total cost is the sum of 100 cents for blue pens and 300 cents for red pens.",
    "The total cost is 400 cents in total.",
    "Convert cents to dollars, since usually money is represented in dollars.",
    "400 cents is the same as 4 dollars."
