  "query": "Cordelia is dyeing her hair red. To get the color she wants, she first has to bleach her dark brown hair to blonde, and then she has to apply the dye. The whole process will take 9 hours. Dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching. How many hours will it take Cordelia to bleach her hair?",
  "steps": [
    "Let's denote the time it takes to bleach her hair as B hours. According to the problem, dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching. Therefore, dyeing will take 2B hours.",
    "The total time for both bleaching and dyeing is given as 9 hours. So, we can write the equation: B + 2B = 9.",
    "Combine the terms on the left side of the equation: 3B = 9.",
    "To find the value of B, divide both sides of the equation by 3: B = 9 / 3.",
    "Calculate the division: B = 3.",
    "This means that it will take Cordelia 3 hours to bleach her hair."

  "solution": "3"
