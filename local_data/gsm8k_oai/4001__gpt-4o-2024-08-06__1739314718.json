  "query": "Liza reads 20 pages in an hour, and Suzie reads 15 pages in an hour. How many more pages does Liza read than Suzie in 3 hours?",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the reading speed of Liza. She reads 20 pages in an hour.",
    "Next, identify the reading speed of Suzie. She reads 15 pages in an hour.",
    "Calculate how many pages Liza reads in 3 hours. Multiply 20 pages/hour by 3 hours.",
    "20 pages/hour * 3 hours = 60 pages. Liza reads 60 pages in 3 hours.",
    "Calculate how many pages Suzie reads in 3 hours. Multiply 15 pages/hour by 3 hours.",
    "15 pages/hour * 3 hours = 45 pages. Suzie reads 45 pages in 3 hours.",
    "Now, find the difference in the number of pages read by Liza and Suzie in 3 hours.",
    "Subtract the number of pages Suzie reads from the number of pages Liza reads: 60 pages - 45 pages.",
    "60 - 45 = 15 pages."
