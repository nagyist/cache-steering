  "query": "Every day, Billie bakes 3 pumpkin pies for 11 days and puts them in the refrigerator.  It takes 2 cans of whipped cream to cover 1 pie.  If Tiffany comes over and eats 4 pies, how many cans of whipped cream does Billie need to buy to cover the remaining pies?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many pies Billie bakes in total. Billie bakes 3 pumpkin pies each day for 11 days.",
    "So, I calculate the total number of pies as 3 pies/day * 11 days.",
    "That equals 33 pies in total.",
    "Next, I need to figure out how many pies are left after Tiffany eats 4 pies.",
    "I subtract the 4 pies eaten by Tiffany from the 33 pies Billie baked.",
    "33 pies - 4 pies equals 29 pies remaining.",
    "Now, I need to determine how many cans of whipped cream are required for the remaining pies.",
    "It takes 2 cans of whipped cream for 1 pie.",
    "To find out the total number of cans needed, I multiply the number of remaining pies by the cans needed per pie: 29 pies * 2 cans/pie.",
    "This calculation equals 58 cans of whipped cream."

  "solution": "58"
