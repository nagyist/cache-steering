  "query": "Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now. In two years, Sandy will be three times as old as Kim. If Kim is currently 10 years old, calculate Sandy's monthly phone bill expense.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's start by defining the variables for unknown quantities. Let Sandy's current age be \\( S \\).",
    "According to the problem, Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is ten times her age. Therefore, her phone bill expense is \\( 10S \\).",
    "In two years, Sandy's age will be \\( S + 2 \\).",
    "Kim is currently 10 years old. Therefore, in two years, Kim's age will be \\( 10 + 2 = 12 \\).",
    "In two years, Sandy will be three times as old as Kim. This gives us the equation: \\( S + 2 = 3 \\times 12 \\).",
    "Calculate \\( 3 \\times 12 \\). This is 36.",
    "Substitute 36 into the age equation: \\( S + 2 = 36 \\).",
    "Solve for \\( S \\) by subtracting 2 from both sides: \\( S = 36 - 2 \\).",
    "Therefore, \\( S = 34 \\). Sandy is currently 34 years old.",
    "Her monthly phone bill expense is ten times her age. Calculate \\( 10 \\times 34 \\)."
