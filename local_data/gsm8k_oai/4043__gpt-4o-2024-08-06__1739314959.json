  "query": "John buys 3 puzzles.  The first puzzle has 1000 pieces.  The second and third puzzles have the same number of pieces and each has 50% more pieces.  How many total pieces are all the puzzles?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that the first puzzle has 1000 pieces.",
    "The second puzzle has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle.",
    "50% of 1000 pieces is 500 pieces.",
    "So, the second puzzle has 1000 + 500 = 1500 pieces.",
    "The third puzzle has the same number of pieces as the second puzzle, which is also 1500 pieces.",
    "Now, I need to find the total number of pieces in all the puzzles.",
    "Total pieces = pieces of first puzzle + pieces of second puzzle + pieces of third puzzle.",
    "Total pieces = 1000 + 1500 + 1500.",
    "Calculating the sum: 1000 + 1500 + 1500 = 4000"

  "solution": "4000"
