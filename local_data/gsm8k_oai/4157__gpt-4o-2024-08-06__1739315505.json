  "query": "Lady Bird uses 1 1/4 cup flour to make 9 biscuits.  She\u2019s hosting this month's Junior League club which has 18 members and wants to make sure she allows 2 biscuits per guest.  How many cups of flour will Lady Bird need?",
  "steps": [
    "Lady Bird needs to provide 2 biscuits for each of the 18 guests.",
    "First, I calculate the total number of biscuits needed: 18 guests x 2 biscuits per guest = 36 biscuits.",
    "Lady Bird's current recipe makes 9 biscuits using 1 1/4 cups of flour.",
    "To find out how many batches she needs to make, I divide the total biscuits required by the number of biscuits per batch: 36 biscuits \u00f7 9 biscuits per batch = 4 batches.",
    "Now I calculate the total amount of flour needed by multiplying the quantity of flour used for one batch by the number of batches: 1 1/4 cups flour x 4 batches.",
    "Convert 1 1/4 cups to an improper fraction or decimal for easy multiplication. 1 1/4 cups is equal to 5/4 cups.",
    "Multiply the amount of flour per batch by the number of batches: 5/4 cups x 4 = 20/4 cups.",
    "Simplify the fraction: 20/4 cups = 5 cups."
