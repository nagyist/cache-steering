  "query": "James decides to make a bathtub full of jello.  For every pound of water, you need 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix.  The bathtub can hold 6 cubic feet of water.  Each cubic foot of water is 7.5 gallons.  A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.  A tablespoon of jello mix costs $0.50.  How much did he spend to fill his tub?",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine how many cubic feet of water the bathtub can hold. The problem states the bathtub can hold 6 cubic feet of water.",
    "Next, I need to convert the cubic feet of water into gallons, since each cubic foot of water is equivalent to 7.5 gallons.",
    "Calculate the gallons of water in the bathtub: 6 cubic feet x 7.5 gallons per cubic foot = 45 gallons.",
    "Now, I need to convert the gallons of water into pounds, using the information that each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.",
    "Calculate the pounds of water: 45 gallons x 8 pounds per gallon = 360 pounds.",
    "Next, I need to determine how many tablespoons of jello mix are required. For every pound of water, 1.5 tablespoons of jello mix is needed.",
    "Calculate the total tablespoons of jello mix needed: 360 pounds x 1.5 tablespoons per pound = 540 tablespoons.",
    "Now, I need to find out how much money James spent on the jello mix. Each tablespoon of jello mix costs $0.50.",
    "Calculate the total cost of the jello mix: 540 tablespoons x $0.50 per tablespoon = $270."
