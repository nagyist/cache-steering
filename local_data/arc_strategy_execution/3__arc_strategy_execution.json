        "Strategy: Evaluate which aspect of the model inaccurately represents atomic structure.\nSolution:\n- Protons and electrons have very different masses.\n- The model uses golf balls of the same size.\n- This misrepresents their relative masses.\n- Thus, the relative mass of particles is not accurately shown."
