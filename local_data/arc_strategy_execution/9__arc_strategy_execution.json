Which best explains how this occurred?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earthquake activity folded the rock layers.\nB: Volcanic eruptions destroyed a rock layer.\nC: Erosion removed several layers of rock.\nD: Weathering changed the layering of the rocks.",

        "Strategy: Explain a geological process that leads to unusual layering of rocks.\nSolution:\n- Normally, older rock is below younger rock.\n- Earthquakes can fold and overturn rock layers.\n- This can place older rocks above younger ones.\n- So folding from earthquake activity explains the finding."
