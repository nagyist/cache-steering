  "query": "Question: The gravitational force of the Sun affects the planets in our solar system. Which of these is influenced the most by this force?\n\nChoices:\nA: axial tilt\nB: orbital path\nC: the masses of the planets\nD: the number of moons per planet",
  "steps": [
    "The gravitational force of the Sun primarily affects the motion and behavior of the planets in their orbits rather than their physical characteristics or attributes.",
    "Among the choices given, the orbital path refers to the trajectory followed by a planet around the Sun, which is directly impacted by the Sun's gravitational force.",
    "The axial tilt of a planet, its mass, and the number of moons are influenced by various factors, but these are not directly affected by the Sun\u2019s gravitational force in the same way that the orbital path is."

  "solution": "B"
