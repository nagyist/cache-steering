  "query": "Question: Which of these is found in all organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: a cell\nB: a tissue\nC: an organ\nD: an organ system",
  "steps": [
    "First, we assess the meaning of each choice in the context of all living organisms.",
    "A cell (Choice A) is the basic structural and functional unit of life; all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, including unicellular (single-celled) organisms like bacteria.",
    "A tissue (Choice B) is a group of similar cells that perform a specific function. Tissues are found in multicellular organisms but not in unicellular ones.",
    "An organ (Choice C) is a structure composed of different types of tissues working together. Organs are only present in multicellular organisms.",
    "An organ system (Choice D) is a group of organs that work together for a common purpose. This applies only to multicellular organisms and not to unicellular ones.",
    "Since only A: a cell is found in all organisms, regardless of whether they are unicellular or multicellular, it is the only choice that fits the requirement."
