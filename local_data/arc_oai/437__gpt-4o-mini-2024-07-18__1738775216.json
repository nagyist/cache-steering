  "query": "Question: Approximately 59% of the Moon is visible from Earth because the Moon rotates and revolves in the same period. Which most likely causes this phenomenon?\n\nChoices:\nA: the gravitational pull of the Sun\nB: the gravitational pull of Earth\nC: the composition of the Moon\nD: the phases of the Moon",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that approximately 59% of the Moon is visible from Earth and that this is related to the Moon rotating and revolving in the same period.",
    "This phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation or tidal locking, where an object's rotation period matches its orbital period around another body.",
    "In this case, the gravitational pull of Earth affects the Moon's rotation, causing it to present the same face to our planet as it orbits around it.",
    "The Sun's gravitational pull is relevant for tides and other effects, but it does not directly cause the phenomenon of synchronous rotation.",
    "The composition of the Moon (option C) doesn't influence the visibility aspect; it merely relates to the physical characteristics of the Moon itself.",
    "The phases of the Moon (option D) refer to the appearance of the Moon as seen from Earth, which is a result of its position relative to the Earth and Sun, but they do not explain the 59% visibility issue directly."
