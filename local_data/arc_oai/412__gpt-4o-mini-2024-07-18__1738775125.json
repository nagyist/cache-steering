  "query": "Question: How many chromosomes are in a human sperm cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: 12\nB: 23\nC: 46\nD: 58",
  "steps": [
    "First, I know that human cells typically have 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs, which is the diploid number.",
    "Sperm cells are reproductive cells (gametes) that are produced through meiosis, which reduces the number of chromosomes by half.",
    "Therefore, human sperm cells must have half the diploid number of chromosomes, which means they have 23 chromosomes."

  "solution": "B"
