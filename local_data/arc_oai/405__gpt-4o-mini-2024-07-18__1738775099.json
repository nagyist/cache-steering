  "query": "Question: Which of the following Earth layers has the greatest density?\n\nChoices:\nA: crust\nB: mantle\nC: inner core\nD: outer core",
  "steps": [
    "The Earth is composed of several layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.",
    "The crust is the outermost layer and is relatively thin and less dense compared to the other layers.",
    "The mantle lies beneath the crust and is denser than the crust, but not the densest of all the layers.",
    "The outer core is liquid and consists mainly of iron and nickel; it is denser than both the crust and the mantle.",
    "The inner core is solid and composed mainly of iron and nickel, and it is under immense pressure, making it the densest layer of the Earth."
