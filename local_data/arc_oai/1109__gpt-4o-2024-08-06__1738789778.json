  "steps": [
    "Amoeba is a type of protist that does not have flagella and is not an autotroph. It moves using pseudopodia and engulfs food via phagocytosis.",
    "Euglena is a protist that has a flagellum and is capable of photosynthesis, thus it is an autotroph. However, typically euglena has a single flagellum.",
    "Paramecium is a ciliate protist with many tiny hair-like cilia for movement. It is not known for being an autotroph or having flagella.",
    "Volvox is a colonial alga, considered a protist, and is a bi-flagellate autotroph. Each cell in the volvox colony has two flagella."
