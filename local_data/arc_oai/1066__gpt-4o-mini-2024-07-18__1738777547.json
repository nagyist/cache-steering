  "query": "Question: Runoff from nearby farms can deposit excess amounts of nutrients into bodies of water such as lakes. This abiotic process will most likely cause a decrease in which aspect of a lake?\n\nChoices:\nA: the depth of the water\nB: the oxygen levels for fish\nC: the amount of minerals in the water\nD: the accumulation of organic matter",
  "steps": [
    "Runoff from farms typically adds nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to the water body.",
    "The increase in nutrients can lead to eutrophication, which is an overgrowth of algae in the water.",
    "As algae die and decompose, the decomposition process consumes oxygen from the water, thus lowering the oxygen levels.",
    "While the depth of water (A) and minerals (C) may not be directly impacted, the accumulation of organic matter (D) is not likely to decrease, as organic matter from algae remains present."
