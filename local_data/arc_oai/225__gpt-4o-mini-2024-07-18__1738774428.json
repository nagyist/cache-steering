  "query": "Question: Scientists have measured the rate of growth of the Atlantic Ocean basin to be about 2 to 3 cm per year. This type of activity coincides with the formation of ridges on the ocean floor. What is the most likely cause of this activity?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion from tidal action\nB: the deposition of sediment\nC: the flow of continental basalt\nD: movement from tectonic plates",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the Atlantic Ocean basin is growing at a rate of 2 to 3 cm per year, which suggests that there is some process causing the seafloor to expand.",
    "The mention of \"the formation of ridges on the ocean floor\" indicates that this process is likely related to tectonic activities, as ridges typically form at mid-ocean ridges where new oceanic crust is created.",
    "Choices A (erosion from tidal action) and B (the deposition of sediment) do not explain the active formation of new crust and ridges; they are more about alteration of existing structures rather than creation.",
    "Choice C (the flow of continental basalt) is not the primary cause of the ocean basin's growth; rather, it is the movement related to tectonic plates that leads to this process.",
    "Therefore, the most likely cause of the activity described, growing ocean basin and ridges, relates to tectonic plates moving apart at mid-ocean ridges."
