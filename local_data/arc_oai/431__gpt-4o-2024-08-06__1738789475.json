  "query": "Question: A pesticide gets into the waters of the Everglades and wipes out many of the fish, amphibian and bird populations on which alligators depend for food. Which change would most likely occur among the alligator population?\n\nChoices:\nA: increase in the reproduction rate\nB: decrease in the number of alligator deaths\nC: increase in aggression between individuals\nD: decrease in the number of alligators migrating",
  "steps": [
    "The introduction of a pesticide leads to a reduction in the population of fish, amphibians, and birds.",
    "These species are key components of the alligator's diet. A reduction in these populations would result in a decreased food supply for the alligators.",
    "With less food available, alligators would likely have to compete more intensely for resources to survive.",
    "Increased competition for limited resources often leads to increased aggression between individuals as they vie for the available food."
