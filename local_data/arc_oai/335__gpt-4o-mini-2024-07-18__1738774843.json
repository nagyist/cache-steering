  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which action involves a chemical change, as chemical changes result in new chemical properties.",
    "Shredding a newspaper (Choice A) is a physical change; it does not alter the chemical structure of the paper.",
    "Breaking a mirror (Choice B) is also a physical change; it doesn\u2019t change the composition of the materials involved.",
    "Cutting wood (Choice C) is again a physical change that keeps the chemical structure of the wood intact.",
    "Popping popcorn (Choice D) involves heating corn kernels, which causes them to undergo a chemical change resulting in the formation of a new product (popped corn) with different properties."
