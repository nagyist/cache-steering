  "query": "Question: In Florida, both panthers and bobcats prey on white-tailed deer. How will their competition for food most likely be affected if white-tailed deer populations in Florida suddenly decreases?\n\nChoices:\nA: Competition will increase between bobcats and panthers.\nB: Competition will decrease between bobcats and panthers.\nC: Competition will increase between white-tailed deer and bobcats.\nD: Competition will decrease between white-tailed deer and panthers.",
  "steps": [
    "If the population of white-tailed deer decreases, the food resource available for both panthers and bobcats will also decrease.",
    "With less food available, both species will have to compete more intensely for the remaining white-tailed deer, which means competition among them will likely increase.",
    "Therefore, as the competition for the same limited food source intensifies, the interactions between bobcats and panthers over preying on white-tailed deer will become more competitive."
