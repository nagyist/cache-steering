  "query": "Question: Which property best indicates that soil contains nutrients?\n\nChoices:\nA: texture\nB: color\nC: amount of sand\nD: amount of clay",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what nutrient-rich soil looks like and what characteristics it typically has. Nutrient-rich soils often have a darker color compared to sandy or clay-rich soils.",
    "Next, examine the options: texture does not necessarily indicate nutrients since various textures can contain nutrients; the amount of sand may contribute to drainage but not directly to nutrient content; the amount of clay generally holds nutrients better but may not indicate nutrient richness on its own; however, color is a significant visual cue for organic matter and, consequently, nutrients.",
    "Based on the reasoning, the color of the soil provides insight into its organic matter content, which is closely tied to the availability of nutrients."
