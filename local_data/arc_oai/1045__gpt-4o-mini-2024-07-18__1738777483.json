  "query": "Question: Laundry detergents were once manufactured to contain high concentrations of phosphorus compounds. When waste water containing these compounds ran off into lakes, the phosphorous became a nutrient to algae. As algae populations increased in the lakes, succession accelerated. Over a long time, which would a lake become as a result of the phosphorous in the detergent?\n\nChoices:\nA: canyon\nB: desert\nC: swamp\nD: river",
  "steps": [
    "The question discusses the effects of phosphorus from laundry detergents on lake ecosystems, particularly how it leads to increased algae growth.",
    "Increased algae populations can lead to a phenomenon called eutrophication, where the algae bloom depletes oxygen in the water as they die and decompose, harming aquatic life.",
    "As water quality worsens due to eutrophication, the lake can undergo significant ecological changes, potentially transitioning into a wetland or swamp-like environment as it becomes shallower and more nutrient-rich in organic matter.",
    "Comparing the choices provided: a canyon is not formed in aquatic environments, a desert is not consistent with increased moisture and nutrients, a river is a flowing system that is different from a lake, while a swamp is a wetland typically characterized by saturated soil due to high nutrient levels."
