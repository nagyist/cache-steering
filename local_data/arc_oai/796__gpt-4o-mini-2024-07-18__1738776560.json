  "query": "Question: Which of these occurs due to the rotation of Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: the seasons\nB: day and night\nC: the orbit of the Moon\nD: lunar and solar eclipses",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what effect the rotation of the Earth has on our daily experience. The most direct outcome of Earth's rotation is the cycle of day and night.",
    "The seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun, rather than its rotation.",
    "The orbit of the Moon around the Earth is a separate phenomenon influenced by gravitational forces, not by Earth\u2019s rotation.",
    "Lunar and solar eclipses are events that happen as a result of the positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, rather than the rotation of the Earth itself."
