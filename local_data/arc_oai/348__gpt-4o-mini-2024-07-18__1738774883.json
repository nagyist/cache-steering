  "query": "Question: Which is true of the seasonal weather patterns of places that are at the same latitude?\n\nChoices:\nA: They have the same wind patterns.\nB: They have the same amount of rain.\nC: They have the same intensity of sunlight.\nD: They have the same kinds of severe weather.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider that places at the same latitude receive similar amounts of sunlight throughout the year, which causes seasonal weather patterns. Therefore, option C seems plausible.",
    "Next, look at option A. While places at the same latitude may have similar general wind patterns, local geographical features (like mountains, bodies of water, etc.) can greatly affect wind patterns, making this option less reliable.",
    "Then evaluate option B. The amount of rain can vary significantly due to local climate factors such as proximity to oceans, altitude, and prevailing winds. Thus, this option is not necessarily true for all locations at the same latitude.",
    "Finally, consider option D. Severe weather can differ greatly due to numerous environmental factors unrelated to latitude, such as ocean currents and regional climate zones, so this option is also not universally accurate."
