  "query": "Question: Some of the new cars being made can run on a renewable fuel that is made mostly from corn. Scientists are developing even more renewable fuels to replace gasoline. Why are renewable fuels most likely becoming more important?\n\nChoices:\nA: Renewable fuels release less energy.\nB: Car fuel tanks are being made smaller.\nC: The demand for gasoline is decreasing.\nD: Nonrenewable fuel supplies are limited.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the main benefit of renewable fuels. They are often seen as a solution to the environmental impact associated with fossil fuels.",
    "Next, examine the context surrounding renewable fuel development. There is an active effort to find alternatives as traditional fuel sources are finite.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices. Option A suggests renewable fuels release less energy, which is not a reason for their increasing importance. Option B talks about car fuel tank sizes, which is unrelated to the relevance of fuels themselves. Option C mentions the decreasing demand for gasoline, but this does not explain why renewable fuels are gaining importance. Finally, option D asserts that nonrenewable fuel supplies are limited, which aligns with the need to develop alternative fuels."
