  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the processes that can create both valleys and canyons.",
    "Glaciers can carve out valleys, but they do not typically create canyons in the same way that rivers do.",
    "Rivers erode the landscape as they flow, and through this process, they can form both valleys (widened riverbeds) and canyons (deep cuts through rock).",
    "Wind can erode land, but it usually doesn't create valleys or canyons that are as prominent as those formed by rivers.",
    "Tides primarily affect coastal regions and do not create valleys or canyons inland.",
    "Considering all the above, the main agent that forms both valleys and canyons is rivers."
