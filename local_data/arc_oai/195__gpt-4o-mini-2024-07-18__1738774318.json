  "query": "Question: Why can steam be used to cook food?\n\nChoices:\nA: Steam does work on objects.\nB: Steam is a form of water.\nC: Steam can transfer heat to cooler objects.\nD: Steam is able to move through small spaces.",
  "steps": [
    "First, steam is produced when water boils and turns into vapor, which means it is, in fact, a form of water. However, this alone isn't the reason it can be used for cooking.",
    "Secondly, steam can transfer heat efficiently to the food being cooked. When steam comes into contact with cooler surfaces (like food), it condenses back into water, releasing a significant amount of heat, which is effective for cooking.",
    "Additionally, while steam can fill small spaces and surround food, the primary cooking function comes from its ability to transfer heat, not just its ability to move through small areas."
