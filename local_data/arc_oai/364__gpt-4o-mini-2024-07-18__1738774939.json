  "query": "Question: Both hurricanes and tornadoes always ___.\n\nChoices:\nA: cause flooding\nB: are hundreds of miles wide\nC: have high winds\nD: produce light snow",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the common characteristic of hurricanes and tornadoes, I will analyze their definitions. Both are severe weather phenomena associated with high wind speeds.",
    "Hurricanes are large storm systems that can cover hundreds of miles and are known for their extremely high winds, often exceeding 74 mph.",
    "Tornadoes are smaller, localized storms but can also produce winds that exceed 110 mph, sometimes much higher.",
    "There is a clear indication that both hurricanes and tornadoes are defined by having high winds as a primary characteristic.",
    "Now I will evaluate the answer choices: A (cause flooding) is not always true for tornadoes; B (are hundreds of miles wide) is true for hurricanes but not tornadoes; C (have high winds) is true for both; D (produce light snow) is irrelevant to both phenomena."
