  "query": "Question: During sexual reproduction, a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell to form a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg then develops into a new organism. Which statement describes the primary advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction?\n\nChoices:\nA: Sexual reproduction produces identical offspring.\nB: Sexual reproduction results in less adaptable offspring.\nC: Sexual reproduction generates a large number of offspring.\nD: Sexual reproduction results in genetic variation in offspring.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the primary advantage of sexual reproduction compared to asexual reproduction.",
    "Option A states that sexual reproduction produces identical offspring, which is false because sexual reproduction creates genetically diverse offspring.",
    "Option B claims that sexual reproduction results in less adaptable offspring, which is incorrect as sexual reproduction actually contributes to more adaptable (genetically varied) offspring.",
    "Option C asserts that sexual reproduction generates a large number of offspring, but this is generally a characteristic of asexual reproduction, which can produce many offspring quickly.",
    "Option D indicates that sexual reproduction results in genetic variation in offspring, which is a key advantage as it enhances adaptability and evolution in changing environments."
