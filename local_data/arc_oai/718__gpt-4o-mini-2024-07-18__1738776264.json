  "query": "Question: Kailey and LeAnn were preparing a report on ocean tides. Which information should they include in their report concerning the greatest influence on the strength of a high tide in a particular area?\n\nChoices:\nA: the position of the Moon around Earth\nB: the position of Earth around the Sun\nC: the rotation of the Moon\nD: the rotation of Earth",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the greatest influence on the strength of a high tide in a particular area. It's important to consider what factors impact tides the most.",
    "Tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. The position of the Moon plays a significant role in dictating the height of tides.",
    "Among the available options, the position of the Moon around Earth is directly linked to the variations in tidal strength and timing.",
    "The other options, while they do influence tides, do not have as strong of an impact on the immediate strength of high tides as the position of the Moon does."
