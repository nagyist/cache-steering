  "query": "Question: How did scientists arrive at the theory of plate tectonics?\n\nChoices:\nA: by determining the age of lava rising at ocean ridges\nB: by determining the composition of limestone deposits\nC: by determining the rate of weathering of mountain ranges\nD: by determining the type of sedimentary rock formed on land",
  "steps": [
    "Scientists observed the movement of the earth's crust and noted features such as earthquakes and volcanic activity linked to the shifting of tectonic plates.",
    "They studied the ocean floor and found that new oceanic crust was created at mid-ocean ridges, indicating a mechanism for plate movement.",
    "Research on the age of the rocks at these ridges provided evidence of spreading, supporting the idea that plates are constantly moving.",
    "While options B, C, and D involve geological processes, none directly relate to the key discoveries that led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics."
