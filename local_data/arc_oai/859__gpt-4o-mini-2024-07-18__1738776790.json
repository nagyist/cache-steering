  "steps": [
    "To determine which option provides the best evidence for constant cell division, we should focus on indicators that reflect ongoing biological processes.",
    "Option A speaks about breathing, which is not directly related to cell division; breathing relates more to respiration and gas exchange.",
    "Option B mentions that active people require more food than inactive ones, which pertains to energy expenditure and metabolism rather than cell division directly.",
    "Option C states that there are many different types of tissues in the human body. This implies differentiation and maintenance of those tissues but doesn\u2019t directly provide evidence of cell division occurring constantly.",
    "Option D discusses human beings shedding millions of cells. This suggests a process where cells are being lost and must be replaced, indicating that cell division is necessary to maintain cellular levels in the body."
