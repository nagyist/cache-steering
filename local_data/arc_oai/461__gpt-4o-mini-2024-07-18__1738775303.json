  "query": "Question: Base your answers on the information below. One hot, summer day it rained very heavily. After the rain, a plastic pan on a picnic table had 2 cm of rainwater in it. Four hours later, all the rainwater in the pan was gone. If the day were cool instead of hot, the rainwater in the pan would have disappeared\n\nChoices:\nA: slower\nB: faster\nC: in the same amount of time",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes evaporation of rainwater from a plastic pan after heavy rain. Evaporation rates are influenced by temperature.",
    "On a hot day, the temperature is higher which increases the rate of evaporation, allowing the rainwater to disappear in a shorter time.",
    "If the day were cool instead of hot, the temperature would be lower, which typically slows down the evaporation process.",
    "Thus, the water in the pan would evaporate slower compared to a hot day."
