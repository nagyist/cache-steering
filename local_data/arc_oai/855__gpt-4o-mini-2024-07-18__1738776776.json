  "query": "Question: The liver converts glucose to glycogen for storage. Why is this function considered a chemical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: because the conversion transforms solids to liquids\nB: because the conversion allows for less glucose in the liver\nC: because the conversion changes one substance to a new one\nD: because the conversion changes the shape of the liver cells",
  "steps": [
    "The liver's conversion of glucose to glycogen involves a transformation of one chemical substance into another, specifically changing glucose (a monosaccharide) into glycogen (a polysaccharide).",
    "A chemical change is characterized by a change in the chemical composition of a substance, producing a new substance with different properties.",
    "In this case, since glycogen is a different chemical structure and substance compared to glucose, the conversion can be classified as a chemical change."
