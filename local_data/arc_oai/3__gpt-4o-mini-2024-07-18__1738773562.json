  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the leading hypotheses surrounding the mass extinction event at the end of the Mesozoic era, which is often associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event.",
    "One of the most widely accepted explanations among scientists for this mass extinction is the impact hypothesis, which suggests that a large asteroid or comet struck the Earth's surface, causing drastic environmental changes.",
    "This impact is believed to have created dust and debris that blocked sunlight, leading to a drop in temperatures and disruption of photosynthesis, significantly affecting both plant and animal life.",
    "The other options, such as worldwide disease, global mountain building, or the rise of mammals as predators, do not have strong evidence supporting them as primary causes of the mass extinction event compared to the asteroid impact theory."
