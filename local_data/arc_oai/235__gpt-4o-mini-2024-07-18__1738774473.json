  "query": "Question: Which statement describes how muscles work to allow a person to extend an arm from a curled position by straightening the elbow?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both the biceps and triceps contract.\nB: Both the biceps and the triceps relax.\nC: The triceps contract and the biceps relax.\nD: The biceps contract and the triceps relax.",
  "steps": [
    "The arm is initially in a curled position, meaning the biceps are contracted to flex the elbow.",
    "To extend the arm and straighten the elbow, the muscle that needs to contract is the triceps, which is responsible for extending the elbow joint.",
    "At the same time, the biceps, which originally contracted to hold the arm in a curled position, need to relax in order to allow the arm to extend.",
    "Thus, the action of straightening the elbow involves the triceps contracting and the biceps relaxing."
