  "query": "Question: The depth of Lake Superior can be measured by sending sound waves to the bottom and measuring the period of time it takes for the reflected sound waves to return to the surface. Which of the following would indicate a shallow depth?\n\nChoices:\nA: There is no return signal.\nB: The return signal is very weak.\nC: The return signal appears almost instantaneously.\nD: The return signal comes back at a different speed",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine what condition would indicate a shallow depth in Lake Superior based on the return signal of sound waves.",
    "A shallow depth would mean that the sound waves have less distance to travel, which would result in a quicker return of the sound waves to the surface.",
    "Option A states that there is no return signal, which would imply an absence of reflection rather than a measurement of depth. Therefore, it does not indicate shallow depth.",
    "Option B states that the return signal is very weak, which may suggest a longer distance or poor conditions, but does not directly indicate a shallow depth.",
    "Option C states that the return signal appears almost instantaneously. This would suggest that the sound waves traveled a short distance, which is characteristic of a shallow depth.",
    "Option D states that the return signal comes back at a different speed. The speed of sound in water is generally constant and any deviation from this would not indicate shallow depth but rather an anomaly in conditions."
