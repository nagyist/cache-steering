  "query": "Question: The mixing of cold Arctic Ocean water with warm surface Atlantic currents off the northwestern coast of Europe causes which effect?\n\nChoices:\nA: sinking of water as it circulates southwest\nB: reversal of current direction back toward the European coast\nC: rise in water salinity and upwelling of affected currents\nD: rapid evaporation and acceleration of currents toward the pole",
  "steps": [
    "The mixing of cold Arctic Ocean water with warm surface Atlantic currents leads to a temperature difference that affects water density.",
    "Cold water is denser than warm water, causing the cold Arctic water to sink when it mixes with the warmer Atlantic currents.",
    "As the colder, denser water sinks, it creates a circulation pattern that draws in more warm water from the surface, leading to the movement of water southwest.",
    "The question specifically asks for the primary effect of this mixing, which is the sinking of denser cold water rather than a reversal of currents or other effects mentioned in the choices."
