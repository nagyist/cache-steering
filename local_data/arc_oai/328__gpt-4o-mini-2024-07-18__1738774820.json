  "query": "Question: Dr. Tanaka discovered a new virus. The virus has a single strand of a nucleic acid, but she does not know if it is DNA or RNA. After running tests, she concludes that it is DNA. Which of the following would lead her to that conclusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: It contains uracil.\nB: It contains adenine.\nC: It contains thymine.\nD: It contains cytosine.",
  "steps": [
    "The key distinction between DNA and RNA is the type of nucleobases they contain. DNA contains thymine, while RNA contains uracil.",
    "If Dr. Tanaka found the virus to contain thymine, this would indicate it has DNA, as thymine is not present in RNA.",
    "The options provided include various nucleobases. To conclude that the virus is DNA, the presence of thymine specifically would be significant."
