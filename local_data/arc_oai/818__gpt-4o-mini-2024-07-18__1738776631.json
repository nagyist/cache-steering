  "query": "Question: A new organism is discovered. It is multicellular, autotrophic, and does not move on its own. In which kingdoms could the organism belong?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fungi and Plants\nB: Protists and Plants\nC: Animals and Fungi\nD: Protists and Animals",
  "steps": [
    "The organism is multicellular, which rules out certain kingdoms. For example, unicellularity is a characteristic of some protists and bacteria, so we can eliminate those options.",
    "The organism is autotrophic, implying it produces its own food. This characteristic is primarily associated with plants and some protists, but not with animals or fungi as they cannot perform photosynthesis.",
    "The organism does not move on its own, which is a typical characteristic of plants (they remain stationary) and contrasts with animals (which are generally motile).",
    "Given that the organism is multicellular, autotrophic, and non-motile, the most fitting kingdom for this organism would be the Plant kingdom. Therefore, it cannot belong to the Fungi kingdom given the autotrophic nature of the organism.",
    "Therefore, the only possible option that includes the Plant kingdom, which fits all the organism\u2019s characteristics, is option B (Protists and Plants)."
