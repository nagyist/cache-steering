  "query": "Question: Why are the rocks and pebbles found on riverbeds usually smooth?\n\nChoices:\nA: The rocks and pebbles in riverbeds are not very old.\nB: The rocks and pebbles rub against each other as water flows over them.\nC: Rivers can only flow over smooth rocks and pebbles.\nD: Organisms in the rivers break down the rocks and pebbles.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks why rocks and pebbles in riverbeds are generally smooth.",
    "Option A states that the rocks and pebbles are not very old, but age does not directly correlate with smoothness.",
    "Option B suggests that the rocks and pebbles rub against each other due to the flow of water, which causes abrasion and leads to smooth surfaces.",
    "Option C claims that rivers can only flow over smooth rocks and pebbles, which is inaccurate; rivers can flow over various shapes and sizes of rocks.",
    "Option D suggests that organisms in rivers break down rocks and pebbles, but this is not the primary reason for the smoothing process observed."
