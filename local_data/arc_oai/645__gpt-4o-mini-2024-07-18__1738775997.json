  "query": "Question: People use water in different ways. Which of these activities wastes water?\n\nChoices:\nA: filling a glass with water\nB: leaving a faucet on\nC: soaking vegetables in water to clean them\nD: adding cups of water as directed by a recipe",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify what constitutes wasteful use of water. Wasting water generally refers to using it unnecessarily or leaving it running without purpose.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice against the concept of wastefulness: \n- Choice A (filling a glass with water) is a normal household use and does not waste water. \n- Choice B (leaving a faucet on) clearly wastes water as it continues to run without need. \n- Choice C (soaking vegetables to clean) involves using water efficiently for cleaning and does not waste water.\n- Choice D (adding cups of water as directed by a recipe) is necessary for cooking and does not involve waste.",
    "Based on this evaluation, the only activity that can be classified as wasting water is leaving the faucet running without purpose."
