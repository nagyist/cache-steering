  "query": "Question: A tree frog with which characteristic is more likely to survive than other tree frogs?\n\nChoices:\nA: a preference for rare insects\nB: an unusually high-pitched call\nC: skin that resembles tree leaves\nD: a body larger than other tree frogs",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which characteristic increases the likelihood of survival, we should consider the role of camouflage in predator avoidance.",
    "Among the options, \"skin that resembles tree leaves\" (Option C) suggests effective camouflage which can help the tree frog blend into its environment and avoid predators.",
    "The other options\u2014preference for rare insects, an unusually high-pitched call, and a larger body size\u2014are less likely to provide a significant survival advantage. For example, a preference for rare insects might limit food availability, while a high-pitched call might attract more attention from predators.",
    "Therefore, the characteristic that maximizes survival chances through effective camouflage is \"skin that resembles tree leaves.\""
