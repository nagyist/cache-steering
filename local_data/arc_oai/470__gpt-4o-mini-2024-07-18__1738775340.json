  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the broadest groups into which organisms can be categorized based on their most basic characteristics.",
    "In biological classification, the highest taxonomic ranks are domains and kingdoms. Domains are the broadest category, followed by kingdoms.",
    "While phyla and orders are also categories in biological classification, they are more specific and are not the most basic separations.",
    "Therefore, since \"domains\" represent the broadest taxonomic groups, the correct answer must relate to domains or kingdoms.",
    "Among the choices given, \"domains\" (B) is the correct answer, as it is broader than kingdoms."

  "solution": "B"
