  "query": "Question: Which is the best explanation for how air masses move across the United States?\n\nChoices:\nA: The prevailing westerlies move air masses from west to east across the United States but may be deflected by the jet stream.\nB: The trade winds move air masses from west to east across the United States.\nC: The jet stream moves air masses from the Pacific Ocean across the United States.\nD: The warm air of the Gulf Stream causes air masses to move from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the movement of air masses across the United States.",
    "Air masses are influenced by global wind patterns, which include the trade winds and prevailing westerlies.",
    "In the context of the United States, the prevailing westerlies are the dominant wind pattern affecting air motion, typically moving air masses from west to east.",
    "The jet stream can also play a significant role by deflecting these air masses, but it does not solely dictate the movement across the country.",
    "Choice A states that the prevailing westerlies move air masses from west to east and acknowledges the influence of the jet stream, making it a comprehensive explanation for air mass movement.",
    "Choice B incorrectly attributes the movement solely to trade winds, which do not impact the U.S. significantly compared to westerlies.",
    "Choice C suggests that the jet stream is the primary mover of air masses, but while it affects air mass movement, the predominant movement is still the westerlies.",
    "Choice D inaccurately describes a movement from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which is not characteristic of air mass movements in the U.S."
