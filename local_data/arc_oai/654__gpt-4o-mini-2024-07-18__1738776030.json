  "query": "Question: The temperature at which water freezes enables water to exist in which two forms on Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: freshwater rivers and saltwater oceans\nB: liquid oceans and solid glaciers\nC: atmospheric vapor and cloud droplets\nD: water in soil and water in plants",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the temperature at which water freezes and how this allows water to exist in different forms.",
    "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), which allows it to exist in solid form (ice) and liquid form (water).",
    "On Earth, these conditions particularly enable the presence of water in oceans (as liquid) and in glaciers (as solid).",
    "Other choices do not directly refer to solid and liquid states of water, but rather different contexts in which water might be found.",
    "Thus, the optimal choice that signifies the two forms water takes at freezing temperatures is liquid oceans and solid glaciers."
