  "query": "Question: Comparing the skeletons of which of the following fish would best show the evolution of a fish species?\n\nChoices:\nA: a male fish and a female fish that could produce offspring\nB: the same fish just before it received a cut and after it healed\nC: a fish that lived recently and a fish that lived a long time ago\nD: the same fish just after it hatched and when it was full-grown",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about comparing skeletons to show the evolution of a fish species, which involves looking at differences over time and changes in structure.",
    "Option A compares male and female fish of the same species that can produce offspring. This does not show evolutionary change but rather sexual dimorphism within a species.",
    "Option B compares the same fish before and after healing from a cut. This reflects healing processes rather than evolutionary changes in skeletons over time.",
    "Option C compares a recently living fish with one that lived a long time ago. This option is most relevant because it allows observation of evolutionary changes between species that lived in different eras.",
    "Option D compares the same fish at two life stages, which can show developmental changes rather than evolutionary changes pertaining to a species over time."
