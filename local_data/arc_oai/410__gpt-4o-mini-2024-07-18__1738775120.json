  "query": "Question: Which graph is best to present data collected on yearly water usage in the United States?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar graph\nB: line graph\nC: scatterplot\nD: circle graph",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the best graph for presenting yearly water usage data, I need to consider the type of data being presented. Yearly water usage is a continuous variable that changes over time.",
    "A line graph is typically used to show trends over time, making it suitable for presenting data that varies from year to year, such as annual water usage.",
    "A bar graph can also be used to compare different categories, but it is less effective in showing changes over time compared to a line graph.",
    "A scatterplot is usually used to show relationships between two variables rather than changes in a single variable over time, which does not fit the data type here.",
    "A circle graph (or pie chart) is not suitable for showing changes over time as it represents parts of a whole at a specific point, which is also not relevant for yearly data.",
    "Given these considerations, the line graph is the most appropriate choice for displaying yearly water usage data effectively."
