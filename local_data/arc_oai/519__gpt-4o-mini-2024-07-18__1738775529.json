  "query": "Question: Which best describes how ice cores are important to the study of geologic history?\n\nChoices:\nA: They show unconformities, which signal changes in deposition.\nB: They hold index fossils, which are used to date the different ice cores.\nC: They contain evidence showing changes in the atmospheric composition over time.\nD: They follow the Law of Superposition, which gives reasons for extinctions of species.",
  "steps": [
    "Ice cores are cylinders of ice drilled from glaciers and ice sheets, which trap layers of snow and ice that accumulated over time, thus preserving historical data.",
    "The trapped air bubbles in the ice cores contain ancient atmospheric gases, which provide evidence about the Earth's climate and atmospheric composition at different periods in history.",
    "This evidence is crucial for understanding how the Earth's atmosphere has changed over time, especially in relation to temperature, greenhouse gases, and climate changes.",
    "While other options mention concepts like unconformities, index fossils, or the Law of Superposition, these do not accurately describe the primary significance of ice cores in geologic history."
