  "query": "Question: A student wants to use a stream table to test the influence of water acidity on the erosion rate of a stream. Which variable should be constant in this experiment?\n\nChoices:\nA: angle of tilt of the table\nB: acidity of the water\nC: amount of sediment eroded\nD: rate that sediment is eroded",
  "steps": [
    "The student is testing the influence of water acidity on the erosion rate, which means that water acidity is the independent variable being manipulated.",
    "To determine the effect of the independent variable (acidity), other conditions must be kept constant to ensure that any changes in erosion rate are due to acidity alone.",
    "The angle of tilt of the table affects water flow and, consequently, the erosion process; keeping this constant would help isolate the effect of acidity.",
    "The amount of sediment eroded is the dependent variable that would be measured, so it cannot be kept constant.",
    "The rate that sediment is eroded may vary based on the experiment's conditions and is not something to be controlled."
