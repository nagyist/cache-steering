  "query": "Question: What circuit does not allow an electrical current to flow through it?\n\nChoices:\nA: closed\nB: open\nC: parallel\nD: series",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a circuit that does not allow electrical current to flow through it.",
    "A closed circuit is one where the current can flow because there is a complete path for it to travel; therefore, it does not fit the description.",
    "An open circuit is one where the path is broken, preventing current from flowing, which directly matches the question's requirement.",
    "Parallel and series are types of circuit configurations, but they can both be closed or open; therefore, they do not directly answer the question about allowing or preventing current flow."
