  "query": "Question: Which characteristic property indicates that igneous rock cools slowly?\n\nChoices:\nA: mineral composition\nB: hardness\nC: density\nD: crystal size",
  "steps": [
    "Igneous rocks can form from the cooling of molten lava or magma, and the cooling rate affects their characteristics.",
    "When igneous rock cools slowly, it typically allows larger crystals to form, as the minerals have more time to grow.",
    "Therefore, the property that indicates slow cooling in igneous rocks is associated with the size of the crystals formed."
  ],
  "solution": "D"
