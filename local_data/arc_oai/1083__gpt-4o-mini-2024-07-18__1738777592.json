  "query": "Question: Cindy learned that trees release gases into to the air during photosynthesis. What gas does a tree release?\n\nChoices:\nA: carbon dioxide\nB: hydrogen\nC: nitrogen\nD: oxygen",
  "steps": [
    "First, recall that photosynthesis is the process by which trees and plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, using sunlight as energy.",
    "Next, consider the byproducts of photosynthesis. The process not only utilizes carbon dioxide but also produces oxygen, which is released into the air.",
    "Now, evaluate the choices provided: \n- A: carbon dioxide (this is absorbed, not released), \n- B: hydrogen (not a primary product of photosynthesis), \n- C: nitrogen (not related to the photosynthesis process), \n- D: oxygen (this is what is produced and released)."

  "solution": "D"
