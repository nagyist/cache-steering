  "query": "Question: During which phase of the Moon could a solar eclipse take place?\n\nChoices:\nA: full\nB: new\nC: quarter\nD: crescent",
  "steps": [
    "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun\u2019s light. This alignment can only happen when the Moon is in the new phase.",
    "In the new phase, the Moon is not visible from Earth because the side that is illuminated by the Sun faces away from the Earth. This is the phase where solar eclipses occur.",
    "The other phases such as full, quarter, and crescent do not align the Moon directly between the Earth and the Sun, therefore they cannot cause a solar eclipse."

  "solution": "B"
