  "query": "Question: Mrs. Tucker gives her class samples of different soil types. Which action best helps Tanisha identify each soil type?\n\nChoices:\nA: smelling it\nB: touching it\nC: weighing it\nD: measuring it",
  "steps": [
    "Tanisha needs to identify different soil types, which can involve understanding their texture, composition, and characteristics.",
    "Smelling the soil may provide some clues regarding organic material or specific features but is not a definitive method for soil identification.",
    "Touching the soil allows for an assessment of its texture (like sandy, clayey, or loamy), which is crucial for identifying soil types.",
    "Weighing the soil does not provide information about its type, as all soil types can vary in weight due to moisture content, but it doesn't help specifically in type identification.",
    "Measuring soil can refer to measuring its volume or area but again does not assist in identifying types based on soil characteristics.",
    "Among the actions listed, touching the soil provides the most relevant and immediate information for identifying different types, including texture and feel."
