  "query": "Question: Newton's work in physics helped to provide mathematical explanations for the earlier conclusions of which scientist?\n\nChoices:\nA: Ptolemy\nB: Aristotle\nC: Nicolas Copernicus\nD: Dmitri Mendeleev",
  "steps": [
    "Newton's work in physics laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and included the laws of motion and universal gravitation.",
    "Ptolemy is known for his geocentric model of the universe, which was later replaced by heliocentric models and was not aligned with Newton's gravitational laws.",
    "Aristotle contributed to early physics and natural philosophy, but much of his work was later superseded by Newton, especially regarding motion and gravity.",
    "Nicolas Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the universe, which suggested that the Earth revolves around the Sun. Newton's formulation of gravity provided a mathematical framework that supported heliocentric theory.",
    "Dmitri Mendeleev is known for developing the periodic table of elements, which is unrelated to Newton's work in physics.",
    "Considering the connections, Newton's work most directly builds upon and provides explanations for the conclusions drawn by Copernicus regarding the structure of the universe."
