  "query": "Question: The average distance between Earth and the Sun is 149,600,000 kilometers. Which of the following is the correct scientific notation for this distance?\n\nChoices:\nA: 1.496 x 10^3 km\nB: 1496 x 10^5\nC: 149.6 x 10^6 km\nD: 1.496 x 10^8 km",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to convert the number 149,600,000 into scientific notation. Scientific notation expresses numbers as a multiple of a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10.",
    "Next, we identify that 149,600,000 can be rewritten as 1.496 in front of a power of 10. We determine how many places we have moved the decimal point to achieve this.",
    "We move the decimal point 8 places to the left (from 149,600,000 to 1.496). Therefore, we express this as 1.496 x 10^8.",
    "Now, we compare this result to the provided choices to find the correct representation of the distance in scientific notation.",
    "Choice D states 1.496 x 10^8 km, which matches our derived scientific notation for the distance between Earth and the Sun."
