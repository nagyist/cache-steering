  "query": "Question: Most mountains on Earth occur in huge ranges stretching for thousands of miles. Which event is most likely to cause the formation of these mountain ranges?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion of rocks\nB: violent earthquakes\nC: volcanic eruption\nD: movement of plates",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the event that most likely causes mountain ranges to form, I need to evaluate the options presented based on geological processes.",
    "Mountains typically form as a result of tectonic processes, particularly the movement of the Earth's plates. This movement can lead to the folding, faulting, and uplifting of the crust, which creates mountain ranges.",
    "Erosion (option A) wears down mountains, but it does not create them. Violent earthquakes (option B) can occur as a result of tectonic plate movements but are not the primary cause of mountain formation. Volcanic eruptions (option C) can create mountains, such as volcanic mountains, but this is a less common process compared to tectonic movement.",
    "Comparatively, the movement of plates (option D) is a fundamental process responsible for the majority of mountain building, particularly in forming extensive ranges."
