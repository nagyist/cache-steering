  "query": "Question: Casey has found several identical marine animals attached to an artificial reef in the Gulf of Mexico. Which characteristic would identify the animals as mollusks?\n\nChoices:\nA: brain\nB: tentacles\nC: muscular foot\nD: hard outer casing",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a characteristic that specifically identifies the animals as mollusks.",
    "Mollusks include a diverse group of animals known for specific features, one of which is the presence of a muscular foot that is used for locomotion and attachment.",
    "While some mollusks may have a hard outer casing (like shells), not all mollusks possess this feature since there are groups such as cephalopods (e.g., octopuses) which do not have external shells.",
    "Additionally, not all mollusks have a brain or tentacles, as these features can vary across different classes within the phylum Mollusca.",
    "Since the presence of a muscular foot is a defining characteristic of mollusks, this is the most accurate option to identify the animals found by Casey."
