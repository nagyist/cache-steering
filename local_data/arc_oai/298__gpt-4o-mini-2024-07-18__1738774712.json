  "query": "Question: A student gives a red toy car a push on a wooden floor. The student then pushes the same red toy car on a cement floor. Which question is the student most likely investigating?\n\nChoices:\nA: How fast does a toy car usually roll?\nB: What is the best way to make a toy car roll?\nC: Which surface allows a toy car to roll farther?\nD: Does color have an effect on the distance a toy car rolls?",
  "steps": [
    "The student is conducting an experiment involving two different surfaces: wooden and cement.",
    "The main focus of the experiment appears to be on how the surface affects the toy car's performance, specifically its rolling distance.",
    "The question that aligns best with investigating the impact of different surfaces on the toy car's distance traveled is about comparing the surfaces."

  "solution": "C"
