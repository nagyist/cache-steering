  "query": "Question: The following mathematical expressions represent four different concentrations of a chemical solution to be used in a science experiment. Which one is equal in magnitude to 1/1000?\n\nChoices:\nA: 1.0 x 10^3\nB: 1.0 x 10^4\nC: 1.0 x 10^-3\nD: 1.0 x 10^-4",
  "steps": [
    "We need to find out which of the given options is equal in magnitude to 1/1000.",
    "First, let's convert 1/1000 into scientific notation. 1/1000 is equal to 0.001, which in scientific notation can be written as 1.0 x 10^-3.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices:\n- A: 1.0 x 10^3 is equal to 1000.\n- B: 1.0 x 10^4 is equal to 10000.\n- C: 1.0 x 10^-3 is equal to 0.001, which is equal to 1/1000.\n- D: 1.0 x 10^-4 is equal to 0.0001.",
    "Based on the evaluations, option C (1.0 x 10^-3) matches the magnitude of 1/1000."
