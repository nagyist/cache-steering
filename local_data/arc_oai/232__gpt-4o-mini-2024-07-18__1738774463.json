  "query": "Question: A tropical rain forest contains many tall trees. Smaller plants with large leaves grow at the base of the tall trees. The large leaves are most likely an adaptation of the plant due to which condition?\n\nChoices:\nA: lack of sunlight\nB: lack of oxygen\nC: lack of water\nD: lack of food",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a tropical rain forest environment where tall trees overshadow smaller plants. This creates a specific condition for the smaller plants regarding the availability of sunlight.",
    "In dense forests, particularly tropical rain forests, the taller trees can block sunlight from reaching smaller plants at the ground level. This situation can lead to a situation where smaller plants receive insufficient sunlight.",
    "The adaptation of large leaves in smaller plants can be explained as an evolutionary response to maximize their surface area for light absorption, allowing them to capture as much sunlight as possible in a shaded environment.",
    "The other options (lack of oxygen, lack of water, lack of food) do not directly correlate with the described adaptation. Smaller plants having large leaves primarily relates to their need for more sunlight rather than the other factors."
