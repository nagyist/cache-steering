  "query": "Question: Street maps are examples of two dimensional models. Which information cannot be determined using a basic map?\n\nChoices:\nA: distance from place to place\nB: directions such as north and south\nC: names of highways and roads\nD: elevations such as distance above sea level",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to recognize what basic street maps typically provide. They generally show places, roads, and can indicate directions like north and south.",
    "Next, I should analyze what information is usually lacking on basic street maps. Basic maps often do not provide elevation information, as they are primarily two-dimensional and do not convey vertical measurements.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the choices given: \n- A: distance from place to place is something that can be determined by measuring on the map.\n- B: directions such as north and south can be determined using the map's orientation.\n- C: names of highways and roads can be found on basic street maps as well.\n- D: elevations such as distance above sea level cannot be determined using a basic map."
