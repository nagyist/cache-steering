  "steps": [
    "To determine the type of energy a person uses to pedal a bicycle, I need to consider the action involved in pedaling.",
    "Pedaling a bicycle involves the movement of the legs and the transfer of energy from the person's body to the bicycle's mechanics.",
    "This transfer of energy that makes the bicycle move is classified as mechanical energy since it involves motion and work being done through the mechanical system of the bicycle.",
    "Other types of energy such as light, sound, and electrical do not directly apply to the action of pedaling a bicycle."
