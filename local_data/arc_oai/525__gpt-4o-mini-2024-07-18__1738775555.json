  "query": "Question: A student investigates how speed changes as a ball travels down a ramp. Measurements taken by computer every second are recorded on a data table. Which diagram will best display the data from this table?\n\nChoices:\nA: a bar graph\nB: a line graph\nC: a pie chart\nD: a pictograph",
  "steps": [
    "The student is measuring speed over time as the ball travels down the ramp. This implies a continuous change in speed with respect to time.",
    "To best represent continuous data, such as speed changing at each second, a line graph is typically used since it effectively shows trends and changes over intervals.",
    "A bar graph is better suited for categorical data rather than continuous data, a pie chart is used for showing parts of a whole, and a pictograph represents data with images, which is not appropriate in this case."

  "solution": "B"
