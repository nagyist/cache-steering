  "query": "Question: An escalator at a shopping mall is 10 m long and moves at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s. If Jose steps onto the escalator at the bottom while it is moving, how long will it take him to travel the 10 m?\n\nChoices:\nA: 5 s\nB: 10 s\nC: 15 s\nD: 20 s",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how long it takes the escalator alone to travel 10 meters. The speed of the escalator is 0.5 m/s.",
    "Next, we calculate the time it takes for the escalator to cover the entire length of 10 meters using the formula: time = distance / speed. Therefore, time = 10 m / 0.5 m/s = 20 s.",
    "Since Jose steps onto the escalator while it is moving, he also contributes to the movement. However, the problem doesn't specify how fast Jose is moving relative to the escalator, and we assume he is simply being carried by it.",
    "Thus, the time for Jose to travel 10 meters, while being on the escalator that is moving at 0.5 m/s, remains 20 seconds, as the escalator alone requires that amount of time to cover the distance."
