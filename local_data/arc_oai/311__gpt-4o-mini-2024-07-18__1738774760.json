  "query": "Question: Which phrase best describes the mass of an object?\n\nChoices:\nA: the weight of the object\nB: the volume of the object\nC: the amount of matter in the object\nD: the amount of gravitational pull on the object",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to clarify the definition of mass. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, regardless of its location or the gravitational forces acting on it.",
    "Next, we evaluate the options provided: \n- Option A refers to the weight, which is the force exerted by gravity on an object and not a direct measure of mass.\n- Option B relates to volume, which is the space an object occupies, rather than the matter it contains.\n- Option D discusses gravitational pull, which is related to weight and not mass itself.",
    "The only option that directly relates to the intrinsic property of mass is option C, which states \"the amount of matter in the object.\" This accurately describes what mass is."

  "solution": "C"
