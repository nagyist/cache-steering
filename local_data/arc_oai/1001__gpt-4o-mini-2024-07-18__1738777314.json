  "query": "Question: Students watched a bird fly to and from a large bush every few minutes. The students told their teacher, \"The bird has a nest in that bush.\" This statement is an example of\n\nChoices:\nA: an inference made from observations.\nB: an observation made from predictions.\nC: a prediction made from data samples.\nD: a result made from inference.",
  "steps": [
    "The students observed the bird flying to and from the bush multiple times.",
    "From these observations, they concluded that the bird likely has a nest in the bush.",
    "This conclusion is not a direct observation but rather an inference based on repeated observations of the bird's behavior.",
    "Therefore, the statement about the bird having a nest is an inference made from the observations of its flight pattern."
