  "query": "Question: Which of the following elements is the least electrically conductive?\n\nChoices:\nA: sodium\nB: tungsten\nC: zinc\nD: argon",
  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the electrical conductivity of each element based on their general properties and states.",
    "Sodium (A) is a metal and generally has good electrical conductivity, as all metals do.",
    "Tungsten (B) is also a metal and is known for high conductivity, particularly at high temperatures.",
    "Zinc (C) is a metal as well and has decent conductivity, but typically is not as conductive as sodium or tungsten.",
    "Argon (D) is a noble gas and does not conduct electricity; in fact, it is an insulator.",
    "Among the options, since argon is not a metal and does not conduct electricity at all, it is the least electrically conductive element."
