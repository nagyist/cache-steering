  "query": "Question: Which of the following substances can be separated into several elements?\n\nChoices:\nA: nitrogen\nB: zinc\nC: air\nD: aluminum",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to analyze each choice to determine if the substance can be separated into its constituent elements.",
    "Option A (nitrogen) is a chemical element and cannot be separated into other elements.",
    "Option B (zinc) is also a chemical element and, like nitrogen, cannot be separated into other elements.",
    "Option C (air) is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases. It can be separated into these constituent gases using physical methods such as fractional distillation.",
    "Option D (aluminum) is another chemical element and, similar to nitrogen and zinc, cannot be separated into other elements.",
    "From my analysis, the only substance that can be separated into several elements is air."
