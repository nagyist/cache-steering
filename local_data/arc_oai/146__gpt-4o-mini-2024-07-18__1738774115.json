  "query": "Question: In a recycling program, which materials can be reused many times?\n\nChoices:\nA: steel cans\nB: glass bottles\nC: paper containers\nD: plastic containers",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify which materials are commonly known to be recyclable and reusable many times.",
    "Steel cans are known for being recyclable repeatedly without losing quality.",
    "Glass bottles can also be recycled and reused many times; glass maintains its quality through the recycling process.",
    "Paper containers can be recycled, but they are generally limited to a few cycles before they degrade and cannot be recycled further.",
    "Plastic containers usually can be recycled, but the number of times they can be reused typically varies based on the type of plastic.",
    "From the above analysis, steel cans (A) and glass bottles (B) are the materials that can indeed be reused many times without losing quality."
