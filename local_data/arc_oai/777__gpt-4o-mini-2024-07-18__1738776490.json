    "The orange juice is initially in a liquid state before being frozen.",
    "When the orange juice is frozen, it changes from a liquid to a solid state.",
    "As a solid, the frozen orange juice holds its shape, unlike liquid, which takes the shape of its container.",
    "The weight of the orange juice remains unchanged regardless of its state.",
    "Freezing typically increases the volume of water due to the expansion when it turns into ice, so it does not take up less space."
