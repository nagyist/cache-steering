  "query": "Question: After observing several dogs running, students ask the following question: Do dogs with long hair run faster than dogs with short hair? How can the students best answer their question?\n\nChoices:\nA: record the weights and heights of many dogs\nB: measure the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs\nC: research to find the type of dog with the longest hair\nD: race one long-haired dog against one short-haired dog",
  "steps": [
    "The students need to determine if there's a relationship between the type of hair (long vs. short) and running speed in dogs.",
    "To make a valid comparison, they should measure actual speeds and consider a range of hair lengths, not just compare one type of dog.",
    "Thus, measuring the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs would provide a comprehensive dataset that can help answer the question of whether long-haired dogs run faster than short-haired dogs."
