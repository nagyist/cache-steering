    "When oil and water are mixed, they do not form a homogeneous solution. Instead, they remain distinct substances.",
    "Oil is hydrophobic and does not dissolve in water, leading to the formation of separate layers when combined.",
    "A compound is formed when two substances react chemically to create a new substance, which does not occur with oil and water.",
    "The mixture of oil and water can be described as a suspension because the oil droplets are dispersed throughout the water without dissolving."
