  "query": "Question: Which of these events occurs about every three months?\n\nChoices:\nA: high tide\nB: new moon\nC: new season\nD: solar eclipse",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which event occurs about every three months, I need to assess the frequency of the events listed in the choices.",
    "High tides occur at least twice daily, so they do not fit the three-month interval.",
    "New moons occur approximately once a month, which also does not match the three-month cycle.",
    "Seasons change about every three months (roughly every season lasts three months), so this event fits the criteria.",
    "Solar eclipses do not have a set frequency; they can occur multiple times a year or not at all for several years, so they do not occur reliably every three months."

  "solution": "C"
