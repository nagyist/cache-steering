  "query": "Question: Students study human body structure to learn how the body functions. Which life-size model would best represent the size, shape, and location of human internal organs?\n\nChoices:\nA: a two-dimensional upper body diagram with magnetic stickers of the organs\nB: a three-dimensional plastic upper body with removable parts\nC: a two-dimensional detailed wall poster\nD: a three-dimensional paper body",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a life-size model that accurately represents internal organs in terms of size, shape, and location.",
    "Option A, a two-dimensional upper body diagram with magnetic stickers, does not provide a realistic representation of the 3D structure or size of the organs.",
    "Option B, a three-dimensional plastic upper body with removable parts, offers a realistic and accurate depiction of the internal organs' size, shape, and location.",
    "Option C, a two-dimensional detailed wall poster, lacks the depth needed to represent the organs accurately in a life-sized context.",
    "Option D, a three-dimensional paper body, might provide some representation but does not suggest that it is life-size or offers removable parts for better understanding."

  "solution": "B"
