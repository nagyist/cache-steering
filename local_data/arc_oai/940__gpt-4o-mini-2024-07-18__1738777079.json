  "query": "Question: Which describes the role of sexual reproduction in plants and animals?\n\nChoices:\nA: keeps all organisms looking similar\nB: ensures the continuation of the species\nC: produces offspring that are identical to the parents\nD: increases the size of any population over a long period of time",
  "steps": [
    "First, I determine the primary function of sexual reproduction in both plants and animals. Sexual reproduction promotes genetic diversity and the mixing of genetic materials from two parents, which is essential for evolution and adapting to environmental changes.",
    "Next, I analyze the answer choices to find one that aligns with this function. Choices like A and C suggest that sexual reproduction results in similarities or identical offspring, which contradicts the concept of genetic variation.",
    "I review choice B, which states that sexual reproduction ensures the continuation of the species. Given that it contributes to genetic diversity, which is vital for the survival and adaptation of species, this choice resonates with the role of sexual reproduction.",
    "Finally, choice D implies that sexual reproduction directly increases population size, which is not necessarily true, as the impact on population size can vary depending on environmental factors and survival rates of offspring."

  "solution": "B"
