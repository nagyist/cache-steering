  "query": "Question: Which of the following statements best explains why it is warmer at the equator than at the North Pole?\n\nChoices:\nA: The equator has a larger area than the North Pole.\nB: The equator is closer to the Sun than the North Pole.\nC: The equator receives more direct sunlight than the North Pole.\nD: The equator has more hours of daylight per year than the North Pole.",
  "steps": [
    "The temperature difference between the equator and the North Pole is primarily due to the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth.",
    "At the equator, sunlight reaches the surface more directly, providing concentrated heat energy.",
    "In contrast, the North Pole receives sunlight at a much lower angle, spreading the energy over a larger area and resulting in less heating.",
    "While it is true that the equator has more hours of daylight overall, the more significant factor in temperature is how direct the sunlight is, not just the amount of time the sun is above the horizon."
