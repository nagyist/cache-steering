  "query": "Question: Sodium, Na, is in the same group as\n\nChoices:\nA: Ne.\nB: Mg.\nC: Ca.\nD: K.",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the group of sodium (Na) in the periodic table. Sodium is in Group 1 (the alkali metals).",
    "Determine which of the choices are in the same group as sodium. The elements in Group 1 include Li (Lithium), Na (Sodium), K (Potassium), Rb (Rubidium), Cs (Cesium), and Fr (Francium).",
    "Evaluate each choice against the identified group:\n- A: Ne (Neon) is in Group 18 (noble gases).\n- B: Mg (Magnesium) is in Group 2 (alkaline earth metals).\n- C: Ca (Calcium) is also in Group 2 (alkaline earth metals).\n- D: K (Potassium) is in Group 1 (alkali metals).",
    "Since K (Potassium) is the only choice that is in the same group (Group 1) as Na (Sodium), it is the correct answer."
