  "query": "Question: A student pushes against a tree with a force of 10 newtons (N). The tree does not move. What is the amount of force exerted by the tree on the student?\n\nChoices:\n1: 0 N\n2: 5 N\n3: 10 N\n4: 20 N",
  "steps": [
    "According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
    "When the student pushes against the tree with a force of 10 N, the tree pushes back with an equal and opposite force.",
    "Since the tree does not move, the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.",
    "Thus, the force exerted by the tree on the student must be 10 N."

  "solution": "3"
