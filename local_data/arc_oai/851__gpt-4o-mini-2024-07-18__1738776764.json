  "query": "Question: A student is using descriptions to classify organisms. One organism is described as having sense organs to detect heat, laying eggs to reproduce, using venom for protection, and having the ability to change body temperature with its surroundings. How would the student classify this organism?\n\nChoices:\nA: bacteria\nB: mammal\nC: reptile\nD: bird",
  "steps": [
    "The organism has sense organs to detect heat, which is a characteristic commonly found in reptiles, as they are ectothermic and can sense temperature variations in their environment.",
    "Laying eggs to reproduce is also a typical feature of reptiles, as many reptiles reproduce this way, unlike mammals, which usually give live birth.",
    "Using venom for protection further supports the classification as a reptile, since some reptiles, like snakes, use venom to defend themselves from predators.",
    "Finally, the ability to change body temperature with its surroundings indicates that this organism is ectothermic, which is a defining trait of reptiles, as opposed to endothermic animals like mammals and birds."
