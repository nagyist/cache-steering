  "steps": [
    "The force of gravity on an object is described by Newton's law of gravitation, which states that gravitational force depends on mass and the distance between the objects.",
    "Among the given options, we need to identify which one relates most directly to the force of gravity.",
    "Density, momentum, and volume are not the primary factors in the gravitational force equation, which focuses specifically on mass.",
    "Thus, the correct option that aligns with the dependence of gravitational force is mass."
