  "query": "Question: An engineer can choose from four different materials to make a heat-resistant handle for a stirring spoon. Which material is least likely to get hot when the spoon is placed in boiling water?\n\nChoices:\nA: Ceramic\nB: Wood\nC: Glass\nD: Iron",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the thermal conductivity of each material. Materials with low thermal conductivity will not transfer heat as easily as those with high conductivity.",
    "Ceramic has moderate thermal conductivity and can become hot, especially when exposed to intense heat for extended periods.",
    "Wood has low thermal conductivity and typically does not get hot when exposed to heat, making it a good candidate for a heat-resistant handle.",
    "Glass can conduct some heat and may become hot when placed in boiling water, especially if it is a thin glass.",
    "Iron has high thermal conductivity and will quickly become hot when exposed to boiling water.",
    "Based on the analysis, wood is the material least likely to get hot when the spoon is placed in boiling water."
