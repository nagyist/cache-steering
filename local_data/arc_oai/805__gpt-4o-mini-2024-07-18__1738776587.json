  "query": "Question: The ice cubes in a freezer are melting. Which change most likely is causing the ice cubes to melt?\n\nChoices:\nA: a decrease in the mass of the ice cubes\nB: an increase in the mass of the ice cubes\nC: a decrease in the temperature inside the freezer\nD: an increase in the temperature inside the freezer",
  "steps": [
    "The ice cubes are melting, which means they are transitioning from a solid state to a liquid state.",
    "Melting occurs when the temperature of the ice rises above the freezing point, which implies that the surrounding temperature must be higher than the ice's freezing point.",
    "Given the situation, for the ice cubes to melt, the temperature inside the freezer must be increasing, not decreasing.",
    "Thus, the most likely cause of the ice cubes melting is an increase in the temperature inside the freezer."
  ],
  "solution": "D"
