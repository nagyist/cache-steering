  "steps": [
    "The question asks about a part of an atom that orbits around the center of the atom.",
    "In an atom, the nucleus is at the center, and it is composed of protons and neutrons.",
    "Protons and neutrons do not orbit; they are located within the nucleus.",
    "Electrons, however, are the particles that orbit around the nucleus of the atom.",
    "Therefore, the correct choice that fits the description of orbiting around the center of the atom is the electron."
