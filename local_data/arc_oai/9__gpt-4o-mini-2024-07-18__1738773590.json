  "query": "Question: Hatchling sea turtles are typically dark in color. Occasionally, a sea turtle hatches that is almost white in color. When crawling from the nest on the beach to the ocean, this light-colored sea turtle could be at risk for sunburn. The light color of the turtles would most likely\n\nChoices:\nA: help the turtles have better chances at reproducing.\nB: cause the shell of the sea turtles to become stronger.\nC: reduce the chances of turtles surviving to reproduce.\nD: help in the development of a new species of sea turtles.",
  "steps": [
    "The question discusses the survival risks of a light-colored sea turtle compared to dark-colored hatchlings. Dark coloration typically provides better camouflage from predators and reduces the risk of sunburn.",
    "The light color of the turtle could lead to increased vulnerability to sunburn and predation, potentially impairing its ability to survive in its natural environment.",
    "If a turtle is unable to survive to adulthood due to these risks, it cannot reproduce, which suggests that this trait would not be beneficial for the population's survival.",
    "Considering the choices, we need to find which one aligns with the idea that a light-colored turtle has decreased survival chances due to increased exposure and risk."
