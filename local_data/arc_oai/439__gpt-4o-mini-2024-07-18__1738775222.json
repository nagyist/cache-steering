  "steps": [
    "The question describes a dog performing a specific action, which implies it is responding to an external stimulus (the command).",
    "The action of sitting on command indicates that the dog has been taught or trained to respond in a certain way to that command.",
    "Inherited behavior refers to actions or reactions that are innate and not learned, while instinctive behavior also denotes automatic, reflexive responses that do not require learning.",
    "Since the dog performs the action in response to training rather than genetic predisposition, it fits the definition of learned behavior."
