  "query": "Question: What tool would be most useful to calculate the volume of a glass prism?\n\nChoices:\nA: ruler\nB: scale\nC: voltmeter\nD: thermometer",
  "steps": [
    "To calculate the volume of a glass prism, the relevant physical dimensions need to be measured, which typically includes length, width, and height.",
    "A ruler is a tool that can effectively measure the length, width, and height of the prism, which are essential for calculating its volume.",
    "A scale measures weight, which is not helpful for directly calculating volume without additional information about density.",
    "A voltmeter measures electrical potential difference and is not relevant for measuring physical dimensions or calculating volume.",
    "A thermometer measures temperature, which does not provide any relevant information for calculating the volume of a prism."
