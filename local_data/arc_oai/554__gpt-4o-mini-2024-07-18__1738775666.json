  "query": "Question: What do the Milky Way Galaxy and other galaxies in the universe have in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: They are similar in shape.\nB: They rotate in the same direction.\nC: They contain the same number of stars.\nD: They have similar elements.",
  "steps": [
    "The Milky Way Galaxy, like other galaxies, is made up of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.",
    "While galaxies can have diverse shapes (spiral, elliptical, irregular), they do not necessarily all share the same shape.",
    "The rotation of galaxies can vary significantly and is not a common trait across all galaxies, as they can rotate in different directions or not at all.",
    "The number of stars in galaxies varies greatly, with some containing billions while others may contain significantly fewer, so this is not a common factor either.",
    "However, galaxies are composed of similar fundamental elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements that are produced through nuclear fusion in stars."
