  "query": "Question: Two layers of sedimentary rock are exposed on the side of a hill. Only one of the layers has fossils. The lack of fossils in one layer of sedimentary rock is most likely due to\n\nChoices:\nA: changing environments.\nB: volcanic activity.\nC: changing rates of erosion.\nD: evaporation of sea water.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that two layers of sedimentary rock are present, but only one contains fossils. This suggests that one layer has conditions favorable for fossil preservation, while the other does not.",
    "Fossils are typically formed in environments where organisms can be buried quickly with sediment, which protects them from decay. Therefore, the absence of fossils indicates that the conditions were not conducive for fossil formation in that particular layer.",
    "Now, we need to analyze the choices provided. A change in environment (Choice A) could lead to different conditions for fossilization. For example, if one layer formed in a marine environment (favorable for fossils) and the other in a desert environment (less favorable), this would explain the difference.",
    "Volcanic activity (Choice B) typically leads to destruction of potential fossils due to the heat and ash, but the question does not indicate any volcanic influence.",
    "Changing rates of erosion (Choice C) might affect the top layer but does not directly explain the lack of fossils in a particular layer entirely.",
    "Evaporation of seawater (Choice D) usually affects water bodies but isn't a direct cause for the absence of fossils in sedimentary rock layers.",
    "The most logical conclusion is that the environment in which the rock layers formed changed, leading to differing fossilization potential\u2014thus choice A (changing environments) makes the most sense."
