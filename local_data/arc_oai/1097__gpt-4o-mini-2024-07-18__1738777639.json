  "query": "Question: A teacher opens a can of food in the front of a classroom. Soon, all of the students in the classroom can smell the food. Which statement identifies a property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food?\n\nChoices:\nA: A gas has no mass.\nB: A gas has a large mass.\nC: A gas takes the shape of its container.\nD: A gas keeps its shape when placed in a container.",
  "steps": [
    "The question relates to how the smell of the food spreads in the classroom. This spreading of smell is due to the movement of gas particles.",
    "The fact that all of the students can smell the food suggests that the gas (in this case, the scent molecules) is able to fill the available space in the room.",
    "Among the options provided, we need to identify which property of a gas explains why the smell spreads throughout the classroom.",
    "Option C states that \"A gas takes the shape of its container,\" which implies that a gas will expand to fill the space available to it, thus reaching all parts of the classroom.",
    "Options A and B focus on mass, and option D implies that a gas maintains a shape, which is not true for gases as they are not rigid and do not keep a shape."
