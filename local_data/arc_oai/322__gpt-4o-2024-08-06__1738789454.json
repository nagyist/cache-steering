  "query": "Question: Most volcanoes develop due to interactions between two tectonic plates. Which of the tectonic plate interactions is least likely to produce volcanic activity?\n\nChoices:\nA: two diverging oceanic plates\nB: two converging oceanic plates\nC: two diverging continental plates\nD: two converging continental plates",
  "steps": [
    "Volcanic activity commonly occurs at the boundaries of tectonic plates due to the movement and interaction of these plates.",
    "When two oceanic plates diverge, magma rises to fill the gap, which can lead to the formation of mid-ocean ridges and volcanic activity. Hence, option A is likely to produce volcanic activity.",
    "When two oceanic plates converge, one plate is often subducted beneath the other. The subducted plate melts and can lead to volcanic activity. Hence, option B is likely to produce volcanic activity.",
    "When two continental plates diverge, it can lead to the formation of rift valleys, and while volcanic activity can occur, it is not as common or intense as it is with oceanic plates. Hence, option C may produce volcanic activity but to a lesser extent.",
    "When two continental plates converge, they tend to create large mountain ranges as the plates crumple. There is little to no volcanic activity in such convergent boundaries because there is less melting of the crust compared to when oceanic plates are involved. Hence, option D is the least likely to produce volcanic activity."
