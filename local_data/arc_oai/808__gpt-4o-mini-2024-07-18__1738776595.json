  "query": "Question: Which statement best explains why a car that is rolling on a level surface will eventually come to a stop?\n\nChoices:\nA: Frictional forces oppose the motion of the car.\nB: Forward motion slowly runs out as energy is expended.\nC: The natural state of an object is to be at rest.\nD: Inertia acting on an object will dissipate.",
  "steps": [
    "The car is rolling on a level surface, which means there are forces acting on it that will eventually stop its motion.",
    "Friction is a force that opposes motion; therefore, it acts on the car, slowing it down until it stops.",
    "While energy expenditure and inertia are important concepts, the direct reason for the car coming to a stop is primarily due to the action of friction."

  "solution": "A"
