  "query": "Question: Which of the following data would be most useful for describing the climate of a specific area?\n\nChoices:\nA: average weekly wind speeds for 1 month\nB: daily relative humidity levels for 18 months\nC: total annual precipitation amounts for 2 years\nD: average high and low monthly temperatures for 20 years",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the most useful data for describing the climate of a specific area, we need to consider data that represents long-term trends and averages, rather than short-term or variable data.",
    "Option A provides a short timeframe (1 month) and focuses only on wind speeds, which gives limited information about the overall climate.",
    "Option B includes daily humidity levels over 18 months, which is more extended than option A but still focused heavily on just one aspect of climate.",
    "Option C provides total annual precipitation amounts for 2 years. While it gives insight into precipitation, it is only a two-year period and does not provide any additional climate factors.",
    "Option D offers average high and low temperatures over 20 years, covering a significant timeframe and including important temperature data, which is crucial for understanding climate.",
    "Given that climate is defined by long-term weather patterns and averages of various factors, option D is clearly the most comprehensive and useful for describing the climate of a specific area."
