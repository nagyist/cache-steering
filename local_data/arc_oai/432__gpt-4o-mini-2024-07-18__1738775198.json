  "query": "Question: Which upgrade to a school will most likely reduce the school's consumption of nonrenewable resources?\n\nChoices:\nA: solar-collection panels\nB: high-speed computers\nC: wireless Internet connections\nD: biodegradable carpeting",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an upgrade that will reduce the consumption of nonrenewable resources, which refers to resources that cannot be replenished or take a long time to regenerate, such as fossil fuels.",
    "Option A suggests installing solar-collection panels, which harness solar energy, a renewable resource, thus directly reducing reliance on nonrenewable resources for energy consumption.",
    "Option B, high-speed computers, does not directly impact nonrenewable resource consumption, as their production and electricity use primarily depend on existing energy sources, which may include nonrenewable ones.",
    "Option C, wireless Internet connections, similarly does not necessarily affect the consumption of nonrenewable resources significantly since it doesn't deal with energy production or major resource consumption directly.",
    "Option D, biodegradable carpeting, while environmentally friendly, does not directly address the consumption of nonrenewable resources either, as it's more focused on material waste rather than energy consumption."
