  "query": "Question: Which is an example of organic weathering of rocks?\n\nChoices:\nA: glaciers moving large pieces of a fractured rock\nB: tree roots growing in a fractured rock\nC: ice freezing on a rock surface\nD: wind blowing sand against a rock surface",
  "steps": [
    "Organic weathering refers to the breakdown of rocks through biological processes. This typically involves living organisms contributing to the weathering of rock material.",
    "Among the provided choices, option B mentions tree roots growing in a fractured rock. Tree roots can exert pressure on rock, and as they grow, they can both physically break apart the rock and contribute to chemical changes due to organic acids, which characterizes organic weathering.",
    "The other options either involve physical processes related to non-organic factors\u2014such as glaciers (A) and ice (C)\u2014or involve wind, which is also a physical process (D). None of these options involve biological activity directly breaking down the rock."
