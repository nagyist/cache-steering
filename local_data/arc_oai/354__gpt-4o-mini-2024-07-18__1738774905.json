  "steps": [
    "To change water from a liquid to a solid, we need to consider the physical state of water. Water freezes when it reaches 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure.",
    "Lowering the temperature of water effectively reduces its thermal energy, allowing it to transition from liquid to solid state (ice).",
    "Increasing the temperature would keep water in its liquid state or change it into vapor, which does not help in forming a solid.",
    "Changing the mass of the water does not directly affect its phase transition from liquid to solid; it pertains more to the amount of substance rather than the state of matter."
