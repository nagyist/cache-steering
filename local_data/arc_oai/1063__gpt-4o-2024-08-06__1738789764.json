  "query": "Question: When fresh water and salt water meet in an estuary, the salt water typically flows underneath the fresh water because the salt water is denser. What effect does this most likely have on the nutrients concentrated in the fresh water?\n\nChoices:\nA: They are kept close to the shore.\nB: They are spread out from the shore.\nC: They are diluted by the ocean water.\nD: They are inactivated by the ocean water.",
  "steps": [
    "When fresh water, which is less dense, flows into an estuary where it meets denser salt water, the fresh water typically remains on top while the salt water flows beneath it.",
    "This layering effect can create a stratified water column, where the fresh water, which is laden with nutrients, is concentrated near the surface.",
    "Since the fresh water stays above the salt water and does not immediately mix, the nutrients in the fresh water are more likely to remain in the upper layer rather than being mixed downward into the deeper salt water.",
    "This situation implies that nutrients in the fresh water are likely to spread out gradually across the estuary's surface, rather than being confined to the shore.",
    "Therefore, the correct effect of the salt water flowing underneath is that the nutrients in the fresh water are spread out from the shore into the estuary, allowing for a wider distribution."
