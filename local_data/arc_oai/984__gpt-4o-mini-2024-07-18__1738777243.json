  "query": "Question: As an airplane climbs in the sky, the pilot notices ice crystals forming on the windshield. This happens because\n\nChoices:\nA: blizzards occur more often at higher altitudes.\nB: friction with the atmosphere causes ice to develop.\nC: water evaporates faster at higher altitudes, resulting in ice crystals.\nD: moisture on the outside of the plane freezes due to colder air at higher altitudes.",
  "steps": [
    "Ice crystals form on the windshield of the airplane due to conditions in the atmosphere at higher altitudes, which tend to be colder.",
    "At higher altitudes, the outside temperature is significantly lower, which can lead to moisture freezing.",
    "The presence of moisture in the air combined with the lower temperatures means that any water present can freeze and become ice crystals on surfaces like the windshield.",
    "The focus of the question is on the direct cause of ice formation on the windshield rather than general atmospheric phenomena or evaporation rates."
