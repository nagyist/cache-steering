  "query": "Question: A bus traveled 280 kilometers between two cities. It left the first city at 3:00 p.m. and arrived at the second city at 7:00 p.m. What was the average speed of the bus during the trip?\n\nChoices:\nA: 4 km/h\nB: 40 km/h\nC: 70 km/h\nD: 280 km/h",
  "steps": [
    "First, calculate the total travel time by finding the difference between the departure and arrival times. The bus left at 3:00 p.m. and arrived at 7:00 p.m.",
    "From 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. is a total of 4 hours.",
    "Next, use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. The total distance traveled is 280 kilometers.",
    "Now, divide the distance (280 km) by the travel time (4 hours) to find the average speed: \\( \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{280 \\text{ km}}{4 \\text{ hours}} \\).",
    "Calculating this gives \\( 70 \\text{ km/h} \\)."
