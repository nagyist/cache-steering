  "query": "Question: The presence of high temperatures during fossil-fuel formation results in a higher percentage of which product?\n\nChoices:\nA: tar\nB: coal\nC: crude oil\nD: natural gas",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the effect of high temperatures during the formation of fossil fuels. Different fossil fuels are generated under various temperature conditions.",
    "Coal is formed at lower temperatures, while crude oil and natural gas form at higher temperatures.",
    "Among the given options, we need to determine which product has a higher percentage when high temperatures are involved. Crude oil is typically formed under moderate to high temperatures, while natural gas is produced at even higher temperatures.",
    "If we focus on the highest temperatures mentioned, natural gas is the product that forms at the highest temperatures during fossil-fuel formation, leading to a higher percentage of it under those conditions."
