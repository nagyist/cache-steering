  "query": "Question: Directions Read the information about wind erosion then answer the question. Wind can cause erosion that changes the surface of the Earth. Wind erosion can have negative effects on the environment by removing soil and polluting the air during dust storms. What is one way to prevent wind erosion?\n\nChoices:\nA: People can drive off-road bikes across the desert.\nB: Ranchers can let their cattle graze in areas with little plant growth.\nC: Construction workers can wet the ground before driving on it or digging.\nD: Farmers can remove all plant material in the soil between planting seasons.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a method to prevent wind erosion, which involves maintaining soil stability and reducing the likelihood of soil being lifted into the air by wind.",
    "Choice A suggests driving off-road bikes across the desert, which would likely disturb the soil and increase erosion, making it an ineffective method for preventing wind erosion.",
    "Choice B describes ranchers grazing cattle in areas with little plant growth. Grazing in bare areas can lead to further degradation of the land and is not a preventative measure against wind erosion.",
    "Choice C proposes that construction workers wet the ground before driving on it or digging. Wetting the ground can help keep soil particles in place and prevent them from being lifted by the wind, making this a viable method for preventing wind erosion.",
    "Choice D involves farmers removing all plant material between planting seasons. This would leave the soil exposed and vulnerable to erosion, which is contrary to preventing erosion."
