  "query": "Question: Mara planted six pots of lettuce seeds. She placed three pots in a sunny area and three pots in a shaded area. She watered each pot the same and measured the growth of the lettuce. After Mara analyzes her data, what conclusion will it help her to make?\n\nChoices:\nA: When to plant her lettuce\nB: Where to plant her lettuce\nC: How much water to give lettuce\nD: How many lettuce plants to grow",
  "steps": [
    "Mara planted the seeds in two different environments: sunny and shaded. This setup allows her to compare the growth of lettuce in different lighting conditions.",
    "Since she has measured the growth in both areas after watering them the same, the main factor affecting growth is likely the amount of sunlight each pot receives.",
    "Analyzing her data will help her determine which environment (sunny or shaded) is more conducive for lettuce growth.",
    "Based on her observations, she will likely conclude where to best plant her lettuce for optimal growth in future planting."
