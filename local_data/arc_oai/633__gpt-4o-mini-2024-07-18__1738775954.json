  "query": "Question: Which of these is not an example of a physical change of state?\n\nChoices:\nA: boiling\nB: stirring\nC: freezing\nD: evaporating",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which option is not a physical change of state, I need to understand what constitutes a physical change. A physical change involves a change in state or appearance without altering the chemical composition of the substance.",
    "Next, I analyze each option. Boiling is a change from liquid to gas; stirring is a mechanical process that does not change the state; freezing is a change from liquid to solid; and evaporating is a change from liquid to gas.",
    "From the analysis, boiling, freezing, and evaporating are all state changes, while stirring does not change the state of the substance but only its distribution."

  "solution": "B"
