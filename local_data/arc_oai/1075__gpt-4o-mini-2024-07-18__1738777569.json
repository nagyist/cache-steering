  "query": "Question: Which of the following can be caused by weathering?\n\nChoices:\nA: cracks forming in a boulder\nB: rocks melting to form magma\nC: glaciers forming on a mountainside\nD: pebbles combining to form a large rock",
  "steps": [
    "Weathering is the process that breaks down rocks and minerals through various physical, chemical, and biological means without changing the chemical structure of the minerals.",
    "Cracks forming in a boulder is a phenomenon that results from the mechanical weathering process where temperature changes and freeze-thaw cycles can cause the rock to expand and contract, leading to the formation of cracks.",
    "Rocks melting to form magma is a process related to high temperatures and pressures, which is not caused by weathering but rather by geological processes associated with the earth's interior.",
    "Glaciers forming on a mountainside is a process related to the accumulation of snow and ice, which is influenced by climate rather than weathering.",
    "Pebbles combining to form a large rock typically occurs through lithification, which is a geological process that involves compression and cementation, not weathering."
