  "query": "Question: The composition of soil influences the soil's ability to retain and transmit water and air. What soil type would be best for planting a productive garden?\n\nChoices:\nA: Sandy soils because they provide high silica content.\nB: Loamy soils because they contain sand and clay.\nC: Slightly rocky soils because they provide needed minerals.\nD: Clay soils because they are heavy soils and retain water.",
  "steps": [
    "Sandy soils are known for draining quickly, which can lead to lower water retention necessary for a productive garden.",
    "Loamy soils, which are a mix of sand, silt, and clay, provide good drainage while also retaining moisture and nutrients, making them ideal for most garden plants.",
    "Slightly rocky soils may contain minerals, but the rocks can hinder root growth and water retention.",
    "Clay soils tend to hold water well, but they can become compacted, leading to poor aeration and drainage, which is not suitable for many plants."
