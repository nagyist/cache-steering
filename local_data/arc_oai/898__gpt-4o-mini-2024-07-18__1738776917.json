  "query": "Question: A pan of soup is being heated on an electric stove. A metal spoon is used to occasionally stir the soup. Which of the following is an example of heat being transferred by convection?\n\nChoices:\nA: heating the pan\nB: heating the soup\nC: heating the spoon\nD: heating the stove burner",
  "steps": [
    "Convection is a method of heat transfer that involves the movement of fluids (liquids or gases) due to differences in temperature and density. As the soup heats up, the warmer, less dense liquid rises to the top while cooler, denser liquid moves down, creating a circulation pattern.",
    "In this scenario, the main focus is on the soup being heated. As the bottom of the soup is heated by the pan, the heated soup rises, and cooler soup moves down to take its place, demonstrating convection.",
    "Among the choices provided, the option that directly relates to the process of heated liquid moving and circulating due to temperature differences is \"heating the soup,\" which involves convection."
