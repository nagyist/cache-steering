  "query": "Question: Coal and trees are resources found in Maryland. Both resources are used for\n\nChoices:\nA: making paper\nB: making pencils\nC: building houses\nD: producing heat",
  "steps": [
    "Both coal and trees are natural resources that can be utilized in various industries.",
    "Coal is primarily known for its use as a fuel source for energy production, providing heat when burned.",
    "Trees, on the other hand, are sourced from timber and can be used in construction, particularly for building houses, as well as for making paper.",
    "While both resources can be used for producing heat and construction, only coal directly produces heat when burned, whereas trees are critical for construction and can also be used to produce heat indirectly through their use in wood-burning stoves.",
    "Analyzing the choices: A and B do not encompass the primary use of coal; thus, they are less relevant. C and D are plausible since coal is used for heat, and trees for building houses but are not directly interchangeable.",
    "However, for a combined answer based on their broader applications, option D (producing heat) directly encompasses the primary use of coal, while option C (building houses) represents the significant contribution of trees when processed into timber."
