  "steps": [
    "First, a testable question must be able to be answered through observation or experimentation. It needs to be specific and measurable.",
    "Option A, \"Are dogs better pets than cats?\" is subjective and relies on personal opinion, making it not testable.",
    "Option B, \"Are dogs happy when they are walked?\" is also subjective because the concept of \"happiness\" in dogs cannot be easily measured or defined.",
    "Option C, \"Are cats more active at night than during the day?\" can be observed and measured by tracking their activity levels during different times, making it a testable question.",
    "Option D, \"Are cats easier to take care of than dogs?\" is another subjective question that cannot be clearly measured or validated, as it depends on individual experiences and preferences."
