  "query": "Question: A Mars Rover has been sent to explore and relay data from Mars. Mars is less massive than Earth. When compared with Earth, which is the best comparison between the mass and the weight of the Rover on Mars?\n\nChoices:\nA: The mass is more on Mars and the weight is less.\nB: The weight is more on Mars and the mass is less.\nC: The weight is less on Mars and the mass is the same.\nD: The mass is less on Mars and the weight is the same.",
  "steps": [
    "The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it and does not change regardless of location. Therefore, the mass of the Rover remains the same on Mars as it is on Earth.",
    "Weight, however, is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. Since Mars has a lower gravitational force than Earth, the weight of the Rover will be less on Mars compared to its weight on Earth.",
    "Given that the mass remains the same and the weight is less on Mars, we can now evaluate the answer choices."
