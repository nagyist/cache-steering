  "query": "Question: Newly discovered organisms are now classified based on DNA evidence. Which of the following is most helpful to a researcher classifying a newly discovered organism?\n\nChoices:\nA: fossil record\nB: gene splicing\nC: selective breeding\nD: gel electrophoresis",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which method is the most helpful for classifying newly discovered organisms based on DNA evidence.",
    "Fossil records (Choice A) provide historical information about organisms but do not directly classify them based on DNA.",
    "Gene splicing (Choice B) involves altering an organism's DNA but does not help with the classification of newly discovered organisms.",
    "Selective breeding (Choice C) is a method used in agriculture to enhance certain traits in organisms but does not provide a classification method based on DNA evidence.",
    "Gel electrophoresis (Choice D) is a technique used to analyze DNA by separating it based on size or charge, which can be highly beneficial in classifying organisms based on their genetic material."
