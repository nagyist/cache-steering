  "query": "Question: Which statement best compares single-celled and multi-celled organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: Tissues in a single-celled organism are like the cells in a multi-celled organism.\nB: The nucleus in a single-celled organism is like the skin of a multi-celled organism.\nC: Organelles in a single-celled organism are like the organs in a multi-celled organism.\nD: The cytoplasm in a single-celled organism is like the nervous system in a multi-celled organism.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the options by comparing the structures and functions of single-celled and multi-celled organisms.",
    "Option A compares tissues in single-celled organisms to cells in multi-celled organisms. This is not accurate since single-celled organisms do not have tissues; they are made up of a single cell.",
    "Option B suggests that the nucleus of a single-celled organism is analogous to the skin of a multi-celled organism. This is incorrect, as the nucleus is an organelle that controls cellular functions, while skin serves a different purpose in multi-celled organisms.",
    "Option C states that organelles in a single-celled organism are like the organs in a multi-celled organism. This is a valid comparison since organelles perform specific functions within the cell, similar to how organs perform specific functions within a multi-celled organism.",
    "Option D compares the cytoplasm in a single-celled organism to the nervous system in a multi-celled organism. However, the cytoplasm is a substance within the cell, while the nervous system is an organ system with complex functions, leading to a poor comparison.",
    "After analyzing all options, Option C stands out as the most accurate and appropriate comparison between single-celled and multi-celled organisms."
