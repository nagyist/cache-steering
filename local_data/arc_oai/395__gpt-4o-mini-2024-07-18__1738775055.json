  "query": "Question: Which of the following is a likely reason for a sinkhole to form?\n\nChoices:\nA: the removal of underground resources\nB: a collision between two tectonic plates\nC: dense rock formations under the topsoil\nD: buildup of sediment on the ocean floor",
  "steps": [
    "First, we must understand what causes sinkholes. Sinkholes typically form due to the collapse of surface layers into underground voids created by the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone.",
    "Next, we need to evaluate the answer choices given. Option A discusses the removal of underground resources, which can lead to voids and may cause sinkholes if the ground above collapses.",
    "Then, we consider option B, which mentions a collision between two tectonic plates. While tectonic activity can impact geological features, it is not a direct cause of sinkholes.",
    "Option C refers to dense rock formations under the topsoil. While dense rock might affect formations above, it does not directly contribute to the typical conditions for sinkhole formation.",
    "Lastly, option D refers to the buildup of sediment on the ocean floor. This is unrelated to sinkhole formation, as sinkholes occur primarily on land and are associated with the dissolution of rocks beneath the surface.",
    "Thus, the most relevant choice linking to the formation of sinkholes is option A, which correlates with the removal of materials underground potentially leading to collapses."
