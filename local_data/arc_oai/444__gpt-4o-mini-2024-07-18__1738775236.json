  "query": "Question: In the rock cycle, weathering and erosion begin the process of the formation of\n\nChoices:\nA: sediments.\nB: magma.\nC: minerals.\nD: crystals.",
  "steps": [
    "The rock cycle consists of several processes that transform rocks from one type to another. Weathering and erosion are the processes that break down rocks into smaller particles or sediments.",
    "Weathering refers to the breaking down of rocks due to various environmental factors, while erosion is the movement of these weathered materials from one location to another.",
    "These small particles formed through weathering and transported through erosion are known as sediments.",
    "Therefore, the processes of weathering and erosion lead to the formation of sediments in the rock cycle."
