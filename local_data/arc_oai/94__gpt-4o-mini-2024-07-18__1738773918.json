  "query": "Question: Many common hand tools create a mechanical advantage by using the basic principles found in simple machines. For example, a screwdriver uses the principles of the wheel and axle. In order to increase gripping force, pliers use the principle demonstrated in the\n\nChoices:\nA: pulley.\nB: lever.\nC: wedge.\nD: screw.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that pliers increase gripping force, which suggests they enhance the force applied on an object through some mechanical principle.",
    "Pliers resemble the design of a lever, where a small amount of force applied at one end can result in a larger force at the other end.",
    "While the principles of pulleys, wedges, and screws all provide mechanical advantages, in the case of pliers, they operate primarily by utilizing the lever principle."
