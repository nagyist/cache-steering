  "query": "Question: A class is studying the density of rock samples. What scientific equipment do they need to determine the density of the rock samples?\n\nChoices:\nA: microscope and balance\nB: beaker and graduated cylinder\nC: graduated cylinder and balance\nD: microscope and graduated cylinder",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the density of a rock sample, we need to measure its mass and volume.",
    "A balance is suitable for measuring the mass of the rock sample accurately.",
    "A graduated cylinder is appropriate for measuring the volume of the liquid displaced by the rock sample, which helps determine its volume using the water displacement method.",
    "Since choices A, B, and D include equipment that does not align with both necessary measurements, we can eliminate those options.",
    "Choice C includes both the graduated cylinder for volume measurement and the balance for mass measurement, making it the correct choice."

  "solution": "C"
