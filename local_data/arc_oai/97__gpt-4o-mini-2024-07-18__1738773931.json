  "query": "Question: Data in tables may also be presented in graphs. Which type of data would best be displayed on a circle graph?\n\nChoices:\nA: the distance of the planets from the sun\nB: the depths of the major oceans on Earth\nC: the amount of rainfall each day for a month\nD: the percent of various materials in solid waste",
  "steps": [
    "A circle graph, or pie chart, is best used to represent data as parts of a whole, showing the relative percentages of different categories.",
    "Option A (the distance of the planets from the sun) represents a relationship that isn't best expressed as parts of a whole, as the distances do not sum to a total value.",
    "Option B (the depths of the major oceans on Earth) is also not appropriate for a circle graph, as it involves linear measurements that don't represent proportions of a whole.",
    "Option C (the amount of rainfall each day for a month) is better represented over time (like a line graph) rather than as parts of a whole for a single category.",
    "Option D (the percent of various materials in solid waste) clearly pertains to how much of each material contributes to the total waste, making it ideal for a circle graph."
