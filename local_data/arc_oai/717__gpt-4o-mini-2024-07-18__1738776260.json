  "steps": [
    "To identify a physical change during digestion, we must understand what constitutes a physical change versus a chemical change. Physical changes typically involve changes in state or form but not in chemical composition.",
    "Choice A, the addition of acids to create a ball of food, involves the forming of a bolus, which is a physical change as the food is simply being formed into a different shape.",
    "Choice B, the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides, involves a chemical change because it alters the chemical structure of proteins.",
    "Choice C, the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices, predominantly involves chemical reactions where food is chemically altered, suggesting it is primarily a chemical change rather than a physical change.",
    "Choice D, the squeezing of food through the intestines, constitutes a physical change as it involves movement and transformation into a different form without altering the underlying chemical structure of the food.",
    "Choices A and D both indicate physical changes, but choice D in particular captures the process of moving food through the intestines, which is largely mechanical."
