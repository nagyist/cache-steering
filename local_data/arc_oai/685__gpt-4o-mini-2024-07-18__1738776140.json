  "query": "Question: A plant gets the energy it needs from the Sun. The plant uses about ten percent of the energy to carry on its life functions. The plant transfers approximately another ten percent of the energy to the consumers in a food chain. What happens to most of the remaining energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is reabsorbed by the Sun.\nB: It is recycled by decomposers.\nC: It is stored in soil for later use.\nD: It is released into the ecosystem as heat.",
  "steps": [
    "The plant receives energy from the Sun and uses about ten percent of that energy for its own life functions.",
    "Then, the plant transfers approximately ten percent of the energy it receives to consumers in the food chain.",
    "The question asks what happens to most of the remaining energy after the plant uses and transfers some of it.",
    "The majority of the energy that is not used or transferred is released back into the ecosystem as heat, due to the laws of thermodynamics and energy transformation processes within plants."
