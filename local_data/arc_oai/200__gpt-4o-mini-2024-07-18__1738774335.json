  "query": "Question: A line graph is best used to\n\nChoices:\nA: compare many variables.\nB: display data as parts of a whole.\nC: track the relationship between two variables over time.\nD: organize data using pictures of objects.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the primary function of a line graph, we should consider what it visually represents and how it is typically used in data analysis.",
    "Line graphs are particularly effective for showing trends over time, particularly when tracking changes in one variable concerning another variable.",
    "The key phrase in the question is \"track the relationship between two variables over time,\" which aligns with the common application of line graphs.",
    "Other options like comparing many variables or displaying data as parts of a whole are better suited for bar graphs or pie charts, respectively.",
    "Thus, the most appropriate choice that describes the purpose of a line graph is option C."
