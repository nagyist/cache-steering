  "query": "Question: Which object has a gravitational force so strong that it forms the center of the solar system?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth\nB: Pluto\nC: the Moon\nD: the Sun",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify the object that has a gravitational force strong enough to influence the movement of other celestial bodies in the solar system.",
    "The center of the solar system is defined by the gravitational pull that dictates the orbits of the planets around it.",
    "Earth and Pluto are planets, but they do not have a gravitational force strong enough to be the center of the solar system.",
    "The Moon is Earth's natural satellite and also does not have the necessary gravitational force to be considered the center of the solar system.",
    "The Sun is a star and has the largest mass in the solar system, exerting a significant gravitational force that keeps the planets, including Earth and Pluto, in orbit around it."
