  "query": "Question: A city wants to build a dam nearby to increase water supplies. Which question is most important to ask about the environmental effects of building the dam?\n\nChoices:\nA: How long will it take to build?\nB: How much concrete is needed?\nC: How will the lake be used for recreation?\nD: How will the dam affect fish populations?",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine which question is most relevant to the environmental impacts of constructing a dam.",
    "Options A and B concern logistical aspects of the dam's construction rather than its environmental effects, therefore they are less relevant.",
    "Option C, while related to the utilization of the lake, does not directly inquire about the environmental consequences.",
    "Option D specifically addresses the impact of the dam on fish populations, which is a crucial environmental concern when building a dam as it affects aquatic ecosystems."
