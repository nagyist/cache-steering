  "query": "Question: As the molecules of water begin to slow down they go into a phase where they are no longer able to easily move past each other. The water is passing through a phase change and will\n\nChoices:\nA: remain a mixture.\nB: remain a compound.\nC: become an element.\nD: become a compound.",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves understanding the phase change of water when its molecules slow down.",
    "Water is a compound with the chemical composition H\u2082O.",
    "When water molecules slow down, they lose kinetic energy.",
    "As a result of slowing down, water molecules will eventually reach a phase change from liquid to solid (ice).",
    "During this phase change, the molecular arrangement becomes more fixed, and water becomes solid but remains a chemical compound.",
    "This means water continues as a compound throughout the phase change."
