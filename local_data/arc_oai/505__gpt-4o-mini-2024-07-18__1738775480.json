  "query": "Question: Fraternal twins may or may not share similar characteristics due to\n\nChoices:\nA: independent assortment.\nB: polygenic inheritance.\nC: incomplete dominance.\nD: multiple alleles.",
  "steps": [
    "Fraternal twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm cells, leading to the possibility of them inheriting different combinations of genes.",
    "Independent assortment refers to how different genes independently separate from one another when reproductive cells develop, which plays a role in genetic variation.",
    "Polygenic inheritance is a pattern where multiple genes influence a trait, but it does not specifically explain why fraternal twins may have different traits since it relates to the traits themselves rather than their similarity.",
    "Incomplete dominance refers to a situation where the phenotype of a heterozygote is an intermediate between the phenotypes of the homozygotes, which does not apply directly to the characteristic similarity between fraternal twins.",
    "Multiple alleles refer to the existence of more than two alleles at a gene locus, which can affect traits but is also not directly related to the differences seen in fraternal twins.",
    "Since fraternal twins can inherit different genes entirely and may exhibit diverse traits due to the independent assortment of alleles during gamete formation, this indicates that they may not share similar characteristics."
