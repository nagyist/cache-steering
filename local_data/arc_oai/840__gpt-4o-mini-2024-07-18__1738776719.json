  "query": "Question: Which best describes the speed of a ball as it is thrown straight up into the air and comes back down?\n\nChoices:\nA: The ball goes up at a constant speed, stops, then comes down at a constant speed.\nB: The ball goes up at a constant speed, stops, and increases speed as it comes down.\nC: The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then goes faster and faster as it comes down.\nD: The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then comes down at a constant speed.",
  "steps": [
    "When a ball is thrown straight up, it initially moves upward with some speed. As it ascends, it is influenced by gravity, which decelerates it.",
    "As the ball continues to rise, its speed decreases due to the force of gravity acting against its motion until it reaches its highest point, where it momentarily stops.",
    "After reaching the highest point, the ball starts to fall back down. During its descent, gravity accelerates the ball, causing it to increase speed as it falls downwards.",
    "Thus, the best description of the motion is that the ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then goes faster and faster as it comes down."
