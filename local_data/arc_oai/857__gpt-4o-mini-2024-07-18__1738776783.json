  "query": "Question: Which of these is the most likely effect of cutting down large numbers of trees?\n\nChoices:\nA: loss of habitat for animals\nB: increase in oxygen in the air\nC: lower pollution levels\nD: decrease in soil erosion",
  "steps": [
    "Cutting down large numbers of trees typically removes the natural habitats that various animal species depend on for survival.",
    "This destruction of habitat can lead to a decline in animal populations as they lose their homes and food sources.",
    "While trees produce oxygen, cutting down a large number of them would likely decrease, not increase, the overall oxygen levels in the air.",
    "Deforestation often leads to increased pollution levels as the natural filtration and stabilization that trees provide is lost.",
    "Additionally, removing trees can increase soil erosion as tree roots help hold the soil in place, preventing it from washing away in heavy rains."
