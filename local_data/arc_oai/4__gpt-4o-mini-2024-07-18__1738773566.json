  "query": "Question: A boat is acted on by a river current flowing north and by wind blowing on its sails. The boat travels northeast. In which direction is the wind most likely applying force to the sails of the boat?\n\nChoices:\nA: west\nB: east\nC: north\nD: south",
  "steps": [
    "The boat is traveling northeast, which means its velocity vector is directed towards the northeast direction. This indicates that the net forces acting on the boat are also directed in that general direction.",
    "The river current is flowing north, contributing to the boat's motion in the north direction. Therefore, to achieve a northeast trajectory, the wind must be acting to push the boat towards the east to counterbalance the northward current.",
    "Typically, forces acting on a sailing boat come from the wind pushing the sails. Since the wind needs to provide the necessary eastward force for the boat to travel northeast, the wind must be blowing from the east."
