  "query": "Question: It takes approximately 365 days for\n\nChoices:\nA: the Sun to orbit around Earth.\nB: the Moon to orbit around Earth.\nC: Earth to orbit around the Sun.\nD: Earth to orbit around the Moon.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the options listed regarding celestial orbits and their respective timeframes.",
    "We know that Earth orbits around the Sun, and this period is known as a solar year, which takes approximately 365 days.",
    "The Moon orbits around Earth in about 27.3 days, which eliminates option B.",
    "Options A and D imply Earth orbiting the Sun and the Moon respectively, which do not fit the time frame of 365 days for an orbit.",
    "Thus, the only valid option that takes approximately 365 days is when Earth orbits around the Sun."

  "solution": "C"
