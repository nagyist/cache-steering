  "query": "Question: Which of the following best describes a change in Earth's atmosphere made by early photosynthetic life?\n\nChoices:\nA: increased level of oxygen\nB: increased level of carbon dioxide\nC: decreased ability to support life\nD: decreased ability to transmit light",
  "steps": [
    "Early photosynthetic life, such as cyanobacteria, began to produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.",
    "As oxygen was released into the atmosphere, it led to a significant increase in the overall levels of oxygen available.",
    "This increase in oxygen levels had a profound effect on Earth's atmosphere, allowing for the evolution of more complex life forms that depend on oxygen.",
    "The other options (increased carbon dioxide, decreased ability to support life, decreased ability to transmit light) do not accurately represent the effects of early photosynthetic organisms on Earth's atmosphere."

  "solution": "A"
