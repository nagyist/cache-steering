  "query": "Question: In addition to oxygen, what do plants produce during photosynthesis?\n\nChoices:\nA: chlorophyll\nB: sugar\nC: carbon dioxide\nD: light energy",
  "steps": [
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.",
    "During this process, plants take in carbon dioxide and water, and use light energy to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.",
    "The question specifically asks for what plants produce, in addition to oxygen, during photosynthesis.",
    "Since plants produce glucose (sugar) as a byproduct of photosynthesis, this is the correct answer."
