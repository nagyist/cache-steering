  "query": "Question: The early Greeks are credited with many valid concepts in astronomy. Some of their theories were correct; some were later proven incorrect. One theory was that Earth was the center of the universe and that other planets circled Earth. The Greeks thought Earth did not move because its movement was not obvious from the surface of the planet. The Greeks also believed that an invisible sphere surrounding our planet contained the stars. This sphere rotated, explaining the apparent movement of constellations over time. Which celestial motion is responsible for the phases of the moon?\n\nChoices:\nA: the moon revolving around Earth\nB: Earth revolving around the sun\nC: the moon rotating on its axis\nD: Earth rotating on its axis",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what causes the phases of the moon. The phases of the moon are determined by its position relative to Earth and the sun.",
    "The moon reflects sunlight, and as it revolves around Earth, different portions of its illuminated side are visible from Earth, creating the phases.",
    "The question asks specifically for the type of celestial motion responsible for the changing appearance of the moon as seen from Earth, which is due to the moon's orbit around our planet.",
    "Although Earth\u2019s revolution around the sun and its rotation on its axis affect the view of the sky, they do not directly cause the moon\u2019s phases. The moon's own orbit around Earth is the primary factor."
