  "query": "Question: Rolando wants to see at what temperature various liquids boil. He boils tap water and records the temperature. He then boils tap water with milk added and tap water with sugar added. What is the purpose of boiling plain tap water first?\n\nChoices:\nA: to include a factor to manipulate\nB: to have a possible explanation to a problem\nC: to change one variable while observing the others\nD: to provide a standard by which to compare the results",
  "steps": [
    "Rolando is conducting an experiment where he is boiling different liquids and wants to understand their boiling points.",
    "By boiling plain tap water first, he establishes a baseline or control to compare the boiling points of the other liquids (tap water with milk and tap water with sugar).",
    "The purpose of having a control is to understand how the addition of other substances (milk and sugar) affects the boiling point compared to plain tap water."
