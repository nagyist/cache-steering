  "query": "Question: A student blew air into a beach ball and sealed it. She then pushed on the middle of the beach ball. What happened to the air inside the beach ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: The air in the beach ball escaped.\nB: The air in the beach ball became a liquid.\nC: The type of air in the beach ball changed.\nD: The shape of the air in the beach ball changed.",
  "steps": [
    "When the student sealed the beach ball after blowing air into it, the air inside became trapped and could not escape.",
    "When she pushed on the middle of the beach ball, the volume and shape of the beach ball changed due to the force applied.",
    "The air inside the beach ball is a gas, and while the shape and distribution of the air change as a result of the pressure applied, there are no conditions presented that would cause the air to escape, become liquid, or change its type.",
    "Thus, the main effect of pushing on the beach ball is a change in the shape of the air within it, as the air redistributes in response to the pressure."
