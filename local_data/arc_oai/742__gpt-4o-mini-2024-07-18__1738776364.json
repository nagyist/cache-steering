  "query": "Question: In humans, the gene for a free earlobe [E] is dominant over the gene for an attached earlobe [e]. If one parent has a free earlobe [ Ee ] and the other parent has an attached earlobe ( ee ), what is the probability that their offspring will have an attached earlobe?\n\nChoices:\nA: 0%\nB: 25%\nC: 50%\nD: 100%",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the genotypes of the parents. The first parent has a genotype of Ee (free earlobe) and the second parent has a genotype of ee (attached earlobe).",
    "Determine the possible alleles that the offspring can inherit. The first parent can contribute either E or e, while the second parent can only contribute e.",
    "List the potential combinations of alleles for the offspring based on the contributions from both parents. The potential combinations from the cross are: Ee (free earlobe) and ee (attached earlobe).",
    "Count the viable outcomes from the combinations. Out of the two possible combinations (Ee and ee), only one combination (ee) results in an attached earlobe.",
    "Calculate the probability. Since there is 1 combination that leads to attached earlobe out of 2 possible combinations, the probability is 1/2 or 50%."
