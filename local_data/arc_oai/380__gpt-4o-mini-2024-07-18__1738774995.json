  "query": "Question: When performing an experiment for a science fair, what should be done if the data do not support the hypothesis?\n\nChoices:\nA: Check for errors and run the experiment again.\nB: Change the hypothesis to match the conclusion.\nC: Change the variable so the data will match the hypothesis.\nD: Ignore the data and prepare the science fair display anyway.",
  "steps": [
    "If the data do not support the hypothesis, the first action should be to check for errors in the experiment to ensure that the data is valid.",
    "Once errors are checked, the experiment can be rerun to verify the results.",
    "Changing the hypothesis should be based on the findings and not simply to match the conclusion, as science values adjustments based on experimental data.",
    "Changing the variable to force data to match the hypothesis is not a responsible scientific practice, as it undermines the integrity of the experiment.",
    "Ignoring the data contradicts the scientific method, as one must report all findings honestly, regardless of whether they support the initial hypothesis."
