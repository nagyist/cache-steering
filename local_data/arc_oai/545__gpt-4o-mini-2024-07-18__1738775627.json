  "steps": [
    "Observation and measurement involves collecting data or recording information based on what is directly seen or measured.",
    "Choice A, gathering resources, does not involve data collection or measurement; it is preparation rather than observation.",
    "Choice B, recording how much a plant grew daily for a week, involves actual measurements of growth, which aligns with observation and measurement.",
    "Choice C involves predicting outcomes, which is not an observation but rather a hypothesis or guess about future growth.",
    "Choice D involves explaining observed phenomena, which is analytical rather than observational or measurement-based."
