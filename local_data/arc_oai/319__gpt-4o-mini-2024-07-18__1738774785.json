  "query": "Question: A student uses a pH meter to measure the acidity of a water sample from a lake. For what purpose is the student most likely testing the water?\n\nChoices:\nA: to learn what organisms could survive in the lake\nB: to determine the age of the lake\nC: to understand how people use the lake\nD: to find out the depth of the lake",
  "steps": [
    "The student is using a pH meter, which primarily measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.",
    "Understanding the pH of a water sample is crucial for assessing the environmental health and quality of the water body, particularly in relation to living organisms.",
    "Knowing the pH can help determine what types of organisms could thrive in that environment since different species have specific pH tolerances.",
    "The other options (determining the age, understanding usage, or finding depth) do not specifically relate to pH measurement."
