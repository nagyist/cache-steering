  "query": "Question: Which of the following is the farthest from Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: Halley's comet\nB: the Andromeda galaxy\nC: Neptune\nD: the Sun",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the distances of each option from Earth.",
    "Halley's comet varies in distance but generally comes relatively close to Earth when it approaches the Sun, and it can be within a few hundred million kilometers at that time.",
    "The Andromeda galaxy is approximately 2.537 million light-years away from Earth, which is much farther than any object in our solar system.",
    "Neptune, being a planet in our solar system, is about 4.3 billion kilometers (about 30 astronomical units) away on average from Earth.",
    "The Sun is about 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) away from Earth, which is much closer than the other options.",
    "Comparing these distances, the Andromeda galaxy is significantly farther away than Halley's comet, Neptune, or the Sun."
