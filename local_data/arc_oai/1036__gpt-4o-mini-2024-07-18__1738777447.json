  "steps": [
    "To identify balanced forces, we need to find a situation where the net force acting on an object is zero, meaning it is either at rest or moving at a constant speed.",
    "Option A (car increasing speed) involves an unbalanced force since the car is accelerating, indicating a net force acting on it.",
    "Option B (bus parked in a garage) implies that the bus is at rest, hence the forces acting on it (gravity pulling it down and the ground pushing it up) are balanced.",
    "Option C (ball kicked along a flat surface) likely has unbalanced forces because the ball is in motion and may eventually stop due to friction, indicating a net force acting against it.",
    "Option D (roller coaster slowing down on an incline) also involves unbalanced forces since the coaster is decelerating, meaning that gravitational force is greater than the force propelling it forward.",
    "Considering the analysis, the only situation where forces are balanced is the bus parked in a garage."
