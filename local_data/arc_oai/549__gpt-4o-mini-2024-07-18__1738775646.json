  "query": "Question: The plate-tectonic model has achieved the status of a scientific theory due to which property of the model?\n\nChoices:\nA: It has been empirically proved to be true.\nB: It has passed extensive, independent tests of its predictions.\nC: It is clearer, simpler, and more plausible than other models.\nD: It provides guidelines for Earth-science investigations that are scientifically valid.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks why the plate-tectonic model is considered a scientific theory.",
    "A scientific theory is typically validated through extensive testing and its ability to make accurate predictions that can be independently verified.",
    "Choice A suggests that the model has been empirically proved to be true, but absolute proof is generally not achievable in science; theories can be supported but not proved in a definitive sense.",
    "Choice B states that the model has passed extensive, independent tests of its predictions, which aligns with the way scientific theories gain acceptance; they need to be validated through rigorous testing.",
    "Choice C discusses clarity and simplicity compared to other models, which can contribute to theory selection but does not directly explain why it has achieved scientific status.",
    "Choice D claims that the model provides guidelines for valid investigations but does not address the successful testing aspect that is crucial for a model attaining scientific theory status.",
    "Comparing options, choice B is the most fitting because it emphasizes extensive testing and validation, key aspects of the scientific method that contribute to a model being recognized as a scientific theory."
