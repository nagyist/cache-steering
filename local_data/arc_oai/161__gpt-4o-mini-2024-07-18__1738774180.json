  "query": "Question: Which term is used to describe a physical property of a mineral?\n\nChoices:\nA: organic\nB: solid\nC: gaseous\nD: fossiliferous",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the nature of minerals; they are naturally occurring substances that are solid and inorganic.",
    "Consider the provided choices to see which one describes a physical property of mineral.",
    "The term \"solid\" is relevant as it directly describes the state of a mineral, distinguishing it from other states of matter like gases.",
    "The terms \"organic,\" \"gaseous,\" and \"fossiliferous\" do not accurately reflect a physical property of minerals; \"organic\" refers to materials derived from living organisms rather than minerals, \"gaseous\" describes a state that does not apply to minerals, and \"fossiliferous\" refers to rock containing fossils and not a property of minerals themselves."
