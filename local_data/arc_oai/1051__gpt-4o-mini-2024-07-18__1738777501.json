  "query": "Question: A simple food chain includes hawks, lizards, and insects. Which will most likely happen to the lizard and hawk populations if a pesticide is sprayed to kill the insects, and the lizard and hawk populations cannot find other food in this ecosystem?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both the lizard population and the hawk population will increase.\nB: Both the lizard population and the hawk population will decrease.\nC: The lizard population will increase, but the hawk population will decrease.\nD: The lizard population will decrease, but the hawk population will increase.",
  "steps": [
    "The food chain indicates that hawks feed on lizards, and lizards feed on insects. If the pesticide is used to eliminate insects, the primary food source for lizards will be removed.",
    "Without insects, lizards will struggle to find food, leading to a decrease in their population due to starvation.",
    "Since lizards are a primary food source for hawks, if the lizard population decreases, there will be less food available for hawks.",
    "Consequently, the hawk population will also decrease as they cannot find enough food if the lizard population declines."

  "solution": "B"
