  "query": "Question: A teacher puts a cup of coffee into the cup holder of a car. When the car stops suddenly some of the coffee spills out of the cup. Which statement best explains why the coffee spills?\n\nChoices:\nA: The coffee stays in motion because the stopping force acts only on the car.\nB: The coffee stays in motion because a force from the cup holder pulls on the coffee.\nC: The stopping force on the car causes an equal and opposite reaction from the coffee.\nD: The stopping force causes the motion of the car to slow down and the motion of the coffee to speed up.",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the scenario in which the car comes to a sudden stop while the coffee is in the cup holder. The coffee, being at rest relative to the car before the stop, tends to remain at rest due to inertia.",
    "Identify the role of inertia: Inertia is the property of matter that causes an object to resist changes in its state of motion. When the car stops abruptly, the coffee tries to maintain its forward motion.",
    "Review the answer choices: \nA mentions that the stopping force only affects the car, which aligns with the concept of inertia. \nB suggests a pulling force from the cup holder, which is incorrect; the cup holder does not pull the coffee forward.\nC speaks about an action-reaction pair, but it doesn't directly explain why the coffee spills.\nD incorrectly states that the motion of the coffee speeds up when the car slows down. Since the coffee is trying to maintain its forward velocity, it spills because it continues to move forward.",
    "Conclude with the best explanation: The best option is A, as it accurately describes how the coffee continues in its state of motion due to the stopping force acting only on the car."
