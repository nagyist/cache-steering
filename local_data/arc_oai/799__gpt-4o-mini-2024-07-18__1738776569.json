  "query": "Question: As humans travel in space, which gas is provided in the atmosphere of the spacecraft and which gas is removed from the atmosphere of the spacecraft?\n\nChoices:\nA: Oxygen is provided. Carbon dioxide is removed.\nB: Carbon dioxide is provided. Oxygen is removed.\nC: Carbon dioxide is provided. Nitrogen is removed.\nD: Oxygen is provided. Nitrogen is removed.",
  "steps": [
    "We need to determine what the atmosphere of a spacecraft requires for humans to survive during space travel.",
    "Humans need oxygen to breathe, so it must be provided in the spacecraft's atmosphere.",
    "As humans breathe, they produce carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed from the atmosphere to prevent toxic buildup.",
    "Based on this reasoning, oxygen is provided, and carbon dioxide is removed."
