  "query": "Question: According to a pH scale, which pH would be the strongest acid?\n\nChoices:\nA: 3\nB: 6\nC: 9\nD: 12",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand that the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where lower values indicate stronger acids, and higher values indicate stronger bases.",
    "Identify the pH values given in the choices: A: 3, B: 6, C: 9, D: 12.",
    "Determine which of these values is the lowest, as lower pH values correspond to stronger acidity. Here, 3 is the lowest pH value among the options.",
    "Conclude that pH 3 represents the strongest acid when compared to the other choices."
