  "query": "Question: Which is a characteristic of a sperm cell but not of an egg cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: round shape\nB: presence of a tail\nC: contains genetic information\nD: involved in sexual reproduction",
  "steps": [
    "A sperm cell is typically elongated and has a tail, while an egg cell is generally round in shape.",
    "Sperm cells have a flagellum or tail that aids in their motility, allowing them to swim towards the egg. In contrast, egg cells do not possess a tail.",
    "Both sperm and egg cells contain genetic information, and both are involved in sexual reproduction, so these options do not uniquely characterize sperm cells."

  "solution": "B"
