  "query": "Question: Bluebirds prefer to live near open, grassy places. Where would you most likely find a bluebird?\n\nChoices:\nA: a dam\nB: a beach\nC: a ball field\nD: a parking lot",
  "steps": [
    "Bluebirds are known to prefer habitats that are open and grassy, which suggests they favor locations with plenty of grass and somewhat free of obstructions.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each of the options provided to see which one offers a more open and grassy environment suitable for bluebirds.",
    "A dam typically has water and some vegetation around it, but it isn\u2019t generally known for an open grassy environment.",
    "A beach consists mainly of sand with sparse vegetation and is not characterized by open grassy areas.",
    "A ball field is a large open area, usually with a well-maintained grassy surface, making it an ideal habitat for bluebirds.",
    "A parking lot is predominantly paved, offering no grassy area at all, which would not support bluebirds\u2019 habitat needs."
