  "query": "Question: Two students are studying what makes ice melt fastest. They want to conduct an investigation. During which of these steps in their investigation will they measure the ice?\n\nChoices:\nA: showing some graphs\nB: making a conclusion\nC: developing a hypothesis\nD: collecting some data",
  "steps": [
    "The students are conducting an investigation to understand how to make ice melt fastest, which involves measuring the ice at some point in their experiment.",
    "The measurement of the ice would occur during the data collection phase, as this is the step where they gather quantitative or qualitative evidence from their experiment.",
    "The other options involve stages that are not directly related to measuring ice: A correlates with presenting data, B relates to drawing conclusions from the data, and C is about formulating predictions before conducting the experiment."
