  "query": "Question: Sulfur (S), oxygen (O2), water (H2O), and sodium chloride (NaCl) are all examples of pure substances. Which of the following describes all pure substances?\n\nChoices:\nA: A pure substance consists of only one type of element.\nB: A pure substance has a definite chemical composition.\nC: A pure substance cannot be broken down into simpler substances.\nD: A pure substance is normally found as a solid at room temperature.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a pure substance is. Pure substances are materials that have a constant composition and consistent properties throughout the sample.",
    "Next, I consider the definitions of each choice to see which one accurately describes pure substances. Choice A mentions single types of elements, which implies that only elements are considered pure substances, but it excludes compounds which are also pure substances.",
    "Choice B states that a pure substance has a definite chemical composition, which aligns well with the definition of pure substances, including elements and compounds.",
    "For choice C, while pure substances cannot be broken down into simpler substances in the case of elements, compounds can further be broken down into their constituent elements. Therefore, this statement does not apply to all pure substances.",
    "Lastly, choice D states that a pure substance is normally found as a solid at room temperature, which is not true since pure substances can be gases (like oxygen) or liquids (like water) as well."
