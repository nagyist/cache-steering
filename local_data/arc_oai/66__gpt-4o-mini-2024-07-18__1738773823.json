  "query": "Question: An astronomer is studying two stars that are the same distance from Earth. Star X appears brighter than star Y. Which statement best explains this observation?\n\nChoices:\nA: Star X is larger than star Y.\nB: Star Y is larger than star X.\nC: Star X reflects the Sun\u2019s light better than star Y.\nD: Star Y reflects the Sun\u2019s light better than star X.",
  "steps": [
    "Both stars are at the same distance from Earth, which means their brightness as seen from Earth can be compared directly without the influence of distance.",
    "Star X appearing brighter than Star Y indicates that either Star X emits more light, is larger, or has a higher reflectivity than Star Y.",
    "Among the choices, option A suggests that Star X is larger, which could be a plausible explanation for it appearing brighter.",
    "Option C states that Star X reflects the Sun's light better than Star Y, which could also explain its brightness, but it is less conventional as both are stars and would primarily emit their own light.",
    "Options B and D suggest the opposite scenarios, where Star Y is larger or reflects light better than Star X, which contradicts the observation that Star X is brighter.",
    "Considering the typical characteristics of stars and their emissions, it is most plausible that Star X being larger (and consequently more luminous) is the best explanation for its greater brightness compared to Star Y."
