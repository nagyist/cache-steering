  "steps": [
    "When sugar is dissolved in water, the sugar molecules disperse throughout the water.",
    "The sugar molecules still exist individually, even though they are surrounded by water molecules.",
    "Dissolving sugar means that it separates into its constituent molecules, but it does not create new elements or cause the molecules to cease to exist.",
    "The sugar molecules remain in solution, maintaining their identity as sugar even after dissolving."
