  "query": "Question: Which statement best describes the theory of natural selection?\n\nChoices:\nA: It guarantees the survival of a species.\nB: It increases the size of a population.\nC: It requires the individuals to be identical.\nD: It happens over a long period of time.",
  "steps": [
    "Natural selection is a process that explains how certain traits become more or less common in a population based on their impact on survival and reproduction.",
    "The theory does not guarantee the survival of a species; rather, it explains how species adapt, which can lead to their survival or extinction.",
    "Natural selection does not directly increase the size of a population; it affects the genetic composition of populations instead.",
    "It is incorrect to say that natural selection requires individuals to be identical; in fact, it relies on variation within populations for differential survival and reproduction.",
    "Natural selection can indeed happen over long periods of time, as gradual changes accumulate, leading to evolution."
