  "query": "Question: Which factors can have the greatest effect on the health of a river system?\n\nChoices:\nA: type of soil and salinity\nB: nitrate levels and turbidity\nC: human consumption and pH\nD: natural disasters and tidal changes",
  "steps": [
    "Rivers can be affected by both natural and human-induced factors that impact their health and ecosystem balance.",
    "Nitrate levels significantly affect water quality by contributing to eutrophication, leading to excessive algae growth and oxygen depletion.",
    "Turbidity measures water clarity. High turbidity can block sunlight for aquatic plants and smother habitats, affecting the entire food chain in the river.",
    "While soil type and salinity are important, they are often more related to estuaries and coastal areas rather than the entire river system.",
    "Human consumption and pH are relevant, but changes in pH are often chemical pollution indicators, not primary factors.",
    "Natural disasters and tidal changes affect rivers, but factors like nitrate levels and turbidity have more consistent and significant impacts over time."
