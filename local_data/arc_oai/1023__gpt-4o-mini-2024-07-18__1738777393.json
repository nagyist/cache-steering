  "query": "Question: In pea plants, tall is dominant over short. What size pea plants would result when two short plants are crossed?\n\nChoices:\nA: short plants only\nB: short and tall plants\nC: tall plants only\nD: middle-sized plants",
  "steps": [
    "In pea plants, the trait for tall plants (T) is dominant over the trait for short plants (t). This means that if a plant has at least one dominant allele (T), it will be tall. Only plants with two recessive alleles (tt) will be short.",
    "When two short plants are crossed, both parents would have the genotype \"tt\" since they are short.",
    "The possible offspring genotype from crossing tt with tt will be 100% tt. This means all offspring will also express the short phenotype since they do not receive any dominant allele.",
    "Therefore, when two short pea plants are crossed, all resulting plants will also be short."
