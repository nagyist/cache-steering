  "query": "Question: Scientists perform experiments to test hypotheses. How do scientists try to remain objective during experiments?\n\nChoices:\nA: Scientists analyze all results.\nB: Scientists use safety precautions.\nC: Scientists conduct experiments once.\nD: Scientists change at least two variables.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider how scientists ensure the integrity and objectivity of their experiments. This involves minimizing personal biases and ensuring that their findings are based solely on data.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option to see which best relates to objectivity. Option A suggests that analyzing all results helps maintain objectivity, which implies a thorough evaluation of data without selective reporting.",
    "Option B refers to safety precautions, which are critical for conducting experiments but do not directly relate to objectivity.",
    "Option C states that scientists conduct experiments once. This does not align with objectivity, as multiple trials are essential to validate results.",
    "Option D mentions changing at least two variables, which can introduce bias because it complicates the analysis of which variable is truly affecting the results.",
    "Therefore, the best option that aligns with how scientists remain objective is to analyze all results."
