  "query": "Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?\n\nChoices:\nA: perform the investigation in a different way\nB: change the hypothesis to match the results\nC: choose a different investigation\nD: repeat the investigation",
  "steps": [
    "Michelle's initial hypothesis was not supported by the results of her investigation, indicating that her understanding or expectation about the outcome was incorrect.",
    "Changing her hypothesis to match the results (Option B) would be inappropriate, as it may undermine the scientific process of testing and validating ideas based on evidence.",
    "Choosing a different investigation (Option C) would not directly address the discrepancy she found in her current investigation and would not further test her initial hypothesis.",
    "Repeating the investigation (Option D) could provide consistency in the results and may help confirm or refute her hypothesis, allowing her to draw more reliable conclusions.",
    "Performing the investigation in a different way (Option A) could also help uncover reasons for the initial results and test the robustness of the findings.",
    "Between options A and D, repeating the investigation (D) is the most direct next step to gain further insights before making any substantial changes to her approach or hypothesis."
