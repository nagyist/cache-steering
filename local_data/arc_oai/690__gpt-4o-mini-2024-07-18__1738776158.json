  "query": "Question: A potassium (K) atom has 20 neutrons, 19 protons and 19 electrons. What is the atomic mass of potassium?\n\nChoices:\nA: 19\nB: 20\nC: 38\nD: 39",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the atomic mass of an element, which is approximately the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Electrons have a negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons.",
    "Next, add the number of protons and neutrons in the potassium atom. Potassium has 19 protons and 20 neutrons.",
    "Calculating the total: 19 protons + 20 neutrons = 39.",
    "Therefore, the atomic mass of potassium, based on the total count of protons and neutrons, is 39."
