  "query": "Question: Which transition is most responsible for gaps in the fossil record?\n\nChoices:\nA: metamorphic rock to igneous rock\nB: igneous rock to metamorphic rock\nC: metamorphic rock to sedimentary rock\nD: sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock",
  "steps": [
    "The fossil record is primarily found in sedimentary rocks, as these rocks form from the accumulation of sediments that can preserve biological material, including fossils.",
    "When rocks change from one type to another, especially through processes like metamorphism, fossils can be destroyed because the heat and pressure involved can obliterate the original biological materials.",
    "The transition from sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock is particularly significant here; this transition can lead to the loss of fossils, creating gaps in the fossil record.",
    "Thus, the movement from sedimentary to metamorphic rocks is crucial because it is during this change that previously preserved fossils can be lost."
