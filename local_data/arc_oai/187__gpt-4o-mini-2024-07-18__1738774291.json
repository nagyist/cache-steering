  "query": "Question: Inside cells, special molecules carry messages from the membrane to the nucleus. Which body system uses a similar process?\n\nChoices:\nA: endocrine system\nB: lymphatic system\nC: excretory system\nD: integumentary system",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes molecules that transmit messages from the membrane to the nucleus inside cells, which indicates a signaling process resembling communication within a system.",
    "The endocrine system uses hormones, which are also special molecules that are secreted into the bloodstream and convey messages to various organs and tissues throughout the body.",
    "The lymphatic system is primarily involved in fluid balance and immune responses but does not function through messaging like the endocrine system.",
    "The excretory system is responsible for eliminating waste products from the body and does not use a messaging mechanism similar to hormones.",
    "The integumentary system includes skin, hair, and nails, serving protective functions rather than communication through molecules.",
    "Considering the function of the endocrine system and how it parallels the described process of message-carrying molecules, it is the most appropriate choice in this context."
