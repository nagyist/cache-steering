  "query": "Question: Rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta, are a species made of many distinct populations in different areas. Each of the populations has different markings and colorings. Where would rat snakes most likely be gray?\n\nChoices:\nA: in a forest\nB: in a swamp\nC: in a gravel pit\nD: in a corn field",
  "steps": [
    "Rat snakes' coloration can help them blend into their environment, providing camouflage against predators and aiding in hunting.",
    "Gray is a coloration that would provide effective camouflage in certain habitats, particularly those with rocky or gravelly substrates.",
    "A gravel pit consists mainly of rocks and gravel, which would make gray snakes harder to see as they would blend in with the surroundings.",
    "In contrast, the other options (forest, swamp, corn field) have vegetation and colors that do not align as well with the gray coloring of the snakes, making them more visible."
