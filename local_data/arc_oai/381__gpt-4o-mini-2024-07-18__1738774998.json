  "query": "Question: Sound waves travel the fastest through\n\nChoices:\nA: rock.\nB: seawater.\nC: space.\nD: atmosphere.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the states of matter through which sound can travel: solids, liquids, gases, and a vacuum (space).",
    "Next, I remember that sound waves travel fastest in solids because the particles are closely packed together, allowing the vibrations to transfer quickly.",
    "I compare the options given: rock (solid), seawater (liquid), space (vacuum where sound cannot travel), and atmosphere (gas).",
    "Since rock is a solid, I recognize that it allows sound to travel faster than seawater, atmosphere, or space.",
    "Therefore, the correct choice for the medium through which sound travels fastest is A: rock."

  "solution": "A"
