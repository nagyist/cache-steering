  "query": "Question: Which condition is associated with most warm fronts?\n\nChoices:\nA: tornado formations\nB: low temperatures\nC: violent air mass collisions\nD: cloud formations bringing precipitation",
  "steps": [
    "Warm fronts typically involve the gradual lifting of warm, moist air over cooler air. This process leads to the development of clouds and precipitation.",
    "Cloud formations associated with warm fronts are usually stratiform, which bring widespread, steady precipitation rather than severe weather events like tornadoes.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the condition most commonly associated with warm fronts is the development of clouds that bring precipitation."
