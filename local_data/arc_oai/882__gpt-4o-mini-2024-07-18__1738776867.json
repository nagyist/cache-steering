  "query": "Question: Four identical candles are set on a safe surface and lit. One is covered with a small-sized jar, one is covered with a large-sized jar, and one candle is left in the open. A fourth lit candle is placed in a vacuum. Which candle will most likely stay lit the longest?\n\nChoices:\nA: the candle placed in the vacuum\nB: the candle covered with the small-sized jar\nC: the candle covered with the large-sized jar\nD: the candle left out in the open",
  "steps": [
    "The candle placed in the vacuum is isolated from all air, which means it has no oxygen available for combustion. Therefore, it will extinguish almost immediately.",
    "The candle covered with the small-sized jar will eventually use up the limited amount of oxygen inside the jar and extinguish relatively quickly.",
    "The candle covered with the large-sized jar will have a larger volume of air and thus more oxygen available compared to the small-sized jar. This means it can burn for a longer period.",
    "The candle left in the open has an unlimited supply of oxygen and will remain lit as long as there are no external factors (like wind or drafts) to extinguish it.",
    "Comparing all options, the candle left out in the open will most likely stay lit the longest as it has a continuous supply of oxygen, while the other candles are constrained by limited air supply."
