  "query": "Question: Sam builds a ramp and lets a toy car roll down. Which describes the energy of the car as it rolls down the ramp?\n\nChoices:\nA: The kinetic energy and the potential energy both increase.\nB: The kinetic energy and the potential energy both decrease.\nC: The kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases.\nD: The kinetic energy decreases and the potential energy increases.",
  "steps": [
    "When the toy car is at the top of the ramp, it has a certain amount of potential energy due to its height and a negligible amount of kinetic energy if it's not moving.",
    "As the car starts to roll down the ramp, it loses height, which means its potential energy decreases because potential energy is related to height.",
    "Simultaneously, as the car rolls down, it gains speed, which means its kinetic energy increases because kinetic energy is related to the speed of the car.",
    "Therefore, as the toy car rolls down the ramp, the kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases."
