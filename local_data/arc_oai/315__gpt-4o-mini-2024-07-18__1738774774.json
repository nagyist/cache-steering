  "query": "Question: Ptolemy was an ancient astronomer who thought Earth was the center of the universe. When he made observations that were inconsistent with this, he proposed a phenomenon called \"epicycles\" to explain the observations. How was Ptolemy's process similar to the modern scientific process?\n\nChoices:\nA: Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system.\nB: Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations.\nC: Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it.\nD: Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe.",
  "steps": [
    "Ptolemy made observations about the celestial bodies and recognized that some of these observations contradicted his existing model of the universe.",
    "To address the inconsistencies he observed, Ptolemy adjusted his model by introducing the concept of epicycles, which allowed him to explain the observed movements of the planets better.",
    "This process of modifying a model in response to new observations reflects a key aspect of the modern scientific method, where theories are revised based on empirical evidence."
