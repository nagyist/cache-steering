  "query": "Question: Which material should be used on a bicycle ramp to increase friction?\n\nChoices:\nA: shiny metal\nB: rough paper\nC: smooth wood\nD: wet plastic",
  "steps": [
    "To increase friction, we need to choose a material that has a rough texture.",
    "Shiny metal (Choice A) is smooth and would likely decrease friction rather than increase it.",
    "Rough paper (Choice B) has a rough texture, which could increase friction, making it a suitable choice.",
    "Smooth wood (Choice C) is also likely to have a smooth surface, which would not effectively increase friction.",
    "Wet plastic (Choice D) would be slippery due to the wetness, leading to a decrease in friction.",
    "Among the choices, rough paper is the best option for increasing friction."
