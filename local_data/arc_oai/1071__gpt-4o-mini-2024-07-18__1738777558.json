  "query": "Question: A metal sample is placed into a beaker of boiling water. After two minutes the metal is removed. After 5 minutes the metal can be picked up by hand but the water is still too hot to touch. Which of these matter and energy interactions is being illustrated?\n\nChoices:\nA: water has a low specific heat\nB: metals have low specific heat\nC: glass from the beaker is a good insulator\nD: water loses its heat energy quickly to the air",
  "steps": [
    "The problem describes a situation where a metal sample heats up quickly in boiling water but cools down faster than the water itself after being removed.",
    "This implies that the metal has a low specific heat capacity because it reaches a temperature at which it can be handled more quickly than the water, which retains its heat.",
    "To contrast, water typically has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it retains heat well and does not cool down as quickly as the metal does.",
    "Thus, option B is supported by the observation that the metal cools down quickly after being removed from the hot water."

  "solution": "B"
