  "query": "Question: Which measurement describes the motion of a rubber ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: 5 cm\nB: 10 m/s\nC: 15 newtons\nD: 50 grams",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the types of measurements we have in the options. The motion of a rubber ball typically relates to its speed, force, or mass.",
    "Option A (5 cm) represents a distance, which does not describe motion.",
    "Option B (10 m/s) represents a speed, which directly describes how fast the rubber ball is moving. This is a clear measurement of motion.",
    "Option C (15 newtons) represents force, which can relate to motions but does not directly measure the motion itself.",
    "Option D (50 grams) represents mass, which also does not directly measure motion.",
    "Since we are looking for a measurement that specifically describes motion, option B (10 m/s) is the most appropriate choice."
