  "query": "Question: A block of ice is placed on a hot sidewalk. The ice melts because\n\nChoices:\nA: the energy from the ice flows to the sidewalk.\nB: the energy from the sidewalk flows to the ice.\nC: convection currents flow between the ice and the sidewalk.\nD: radiation flows between the ice and the sidewalk.",
  "steps": [
    "The situation involves heat transfer, particularly between the ice and the sidewalk, with the intention of melting the ice.",
    "For melting to occur, energy must be transferred to the ice, which implies that the ice needs to gain heat from its surroundings.",
    "In this scenario, the sidewalk is hot, meaning it has higher thermal energy compared to the ice, which is cold.",
    "The principle of heat transfer indicates that energy naturally flows from hotter objects to colder ones. Therefore, energy must be moving from the sidewalk to the ice.",
    "Among the answer choices, option B correctly states that the energy from the sidewalk flows to the ice, which is the reason the ice starts melting."
