  "query": "Question: Young robins build the same kinds of nests their parents build even if the young birds have never seen their parents build a nest. This is an example of\n\nChoices:\nA: a learned behavior.\nB: an inherited behavior.\nC: a physical characteristic.\nD: acquired characteristic.",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes young robins building nests similar to their parents' nests without any prior observation. This indicates a form of behavior that is not learned through experience or observation.",
    "Since the young robins build their nests in a way that reflects the nests of their parents, it suggests that this behavior is innate and passed down genetically.",
    "Learned behaviors are those acquired through experience or observation, which does not apply here because the young robins have not seen their parents build nests.",
    "A physical characteristic refers to a trait related to the body structure/appearance, which does not fit the context of nest-building behavior.",
    "An acquired characteristic is typically something that develops after birth due to experience or environment, which again, does not match the scenario given."
