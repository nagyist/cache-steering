Which characteristic would best help stout beardfish to survive in the dark?\n\nChoices:\nA: a mouth full of bristles\nB: a brightly colored body\nC: the ability to swim quickly\nD: two whiskers that locate food",
  "steps": [
    "The stout beardfish lives in the deep ocean where there is no light, so having a brightly colored body (Choice B) would not be beneficial as it would not be visible in darkness.",
    "Having a mouth full of bristles (Choice A) could be useful for feeding but does not specifically help in locating food in the dark.",
    "The ability to swim quickly (Choice C) may help escape from predators but does not directly address survival in the dark environment.",
    "Two whiskers that locate food (Choice D) would be highly beneficial as they assist the fish in sensing its environment and finding food without depending on sight."
