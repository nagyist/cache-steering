  "query": "Question: A student boils 100 grams of water to form water vapor (gas). What method should the student use to determine that the mass of the water vapor is equal to 100 grams?\n\nChoices:\nA: measuring the amount of water vapor (gas) in the air\nB: collecting the water vapor (gas) and cooling it back to a liquid\nC: weighing the beaker before and after the water is boiled\nD: comparing the temperature of the boiling water to the temperature of the water vapor (gas)",
  "steps": [
    "The student wants to determine if the mass of the water vapor is equal to the initial mass of water, which is 100 grams.",
    "The mass conservation principle states that mass remains constant in a closed system, even when the state of matter changes (from liquid to gas, in this case).",
    "Measuring the amount of water vapor in the air (choice A) does not directly relate to mass and does not provide a way to ensure all vapor is accounted for, and is thus not reliable.",
    "Collecting the water vapor and cooling it back to a liquid (choice B) would allow the student to weigh the condensed liquid and check if it matches the initial mass, directly testing mass conservation.",
    "Weighing the beaker before and after boiling (choice C) does not directly measure the mass of the vapor. It only ensures that the mass in the entire system hasn't changed, assuming no vapor escapes.",
    "Comparing the temperatures (choice D) is irrelevant to mass determination, since temperature does not reveal anything about mass.",
    "The most direct method to ensure the mass of water vapor equals 100 grams is to condense it back to water and weigh it again, as in choice B."
