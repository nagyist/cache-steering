  "query": "Question: Which of the following is a function of the motor neurons in the nervous system?\n\nChoices:\nA: to directly apply force to the skeletal system\nB: to gather information about the stimuli\nC: to transmit messages from the brain to the body\nD: to directly control the action of muscles",
  "steps": [
    "Motor neurons are responsible for transmitting signals from the central nervous system to the peripheral muscles.",
    "These neurons play a crucial role in conveying commands from the brain to different parts of the body, enabling movement and responses.",
    "One of the key functions of motor neurons is to control muscle action directly by sending signals that trigger muscle contractions.",
    "Reviewing the choices, the statements about gathering information (B) and applying force (A) are not direct functions of motor neurons, while controlling muscles (D) and transmitting messages (C) correctly reflect their roles.",
    "However, the most accurate choice that encapsulates both the aspect of transmitting messages and the direct action on muscles is choice D, as it emphasizes the direct control of muscle actions."

  "solution": "D"
