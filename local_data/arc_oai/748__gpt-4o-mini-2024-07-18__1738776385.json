  "query": "Question: At what temperature is water most likely to be in vapor form?\n\nChoices:\nA: -10\u00b0C\nB: 20\u00b0C\nC: 90\u00b0C\nD: 120\u00b0C",
  "steps": [
    "Water transitions between liquid and vapor states depending on temperature and pressure. Higher temperatures typically increase the likelihood of water being in vapor form.",
    "At -10\u00b0C, water is likely to be in solid form (ice) rather than in vapor form.",
    "At 20\u00b0C, while some water can be in vapor form, it is not at the most significant likelihood compared to higher temperatures.",
    "At 90\u00b0C, water is close to its boiling point (100\u00b0C at standard pressure), meaning there is a substantial likelihood of it being in vapor form.",
    "At 120\u00b0C, water is above its boiling point at standard pressure and will predominantly be in vapor form.",
    "Comparing the options, while 90\u00b0C shows high likelihood for water to be vapor, 120\u00b0C indicates an even greater likelihood of water existing primarily as vapor."
