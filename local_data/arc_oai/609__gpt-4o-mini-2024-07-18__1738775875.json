  "query": "Question: The rate of growth for a species of grass was measured in a treeless yard and tree-shaded yard. The grass grew twice as fast in the treeless yard. Which factor most likely contributed to the difference in growth rate?\n\nChoices:\nA: amount of animals\nB: amount of light\nC: amount of soil\nD: amount of rain",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the grass grew twice as fast in a treeless yard compared to a tree-shaded yard. This suggests that the presence of trees is limiting the growth of the grass in some way.",
    "In a tree-shaded yard, the trees would block some sunlight from reaching the grass, which is essential for photosynthesis and growth.",
    "The treeless yard, receiving full sunlight, likely provides better conditions for the grass to thrive, leading to its faster growth compared to the shaded yard.",
    "While factors like soil quality, rain, and animal presence can affect grass growth, the significant difference noted in growth rates points most directly to the amount of light available to the grass."
