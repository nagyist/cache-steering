  "query": "Question: When Chemical X is added to a certain liquid, the chemical breaks into Substances Y and Z. It is not possible to break Substances Y and Z into simpler particles. Which statement is best supported by this evidence?\n\nChoices:\nA: Chemical X is an element.\nB: Chemical X is soluble in water.\nC: Substances Y and Z are elements.\nD: Substances Y and Z are compounds.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that Chemical X breaks into Substances Y and Z, and that both Y and Z cannot be broken into simpler particles.",
    "Since both Y and Z cannot be broken down further, it suggests that they are in their simplest form. This typically indicates that they are elements, as elements cannot be decomposed into simpler substances.",
    "As a result, if Y and Z are elements, this supports the conclusion regarding Chemical X. If Chemical X breaks down into these substances that are not further reducible, then it follows that Chemical X itself cannot be made of simpler constituents beyond those elements.",
    "Now we evaluate the answer choices: \n- A suggests Chemical X as an element but does not indubitably follow since it could be a compound made from the elements Y and Z.\n- B states nothing about Chemical X's solubility, which isn't relevant to the breakdown process described.\n- C asserts that Y and Z are elements, which aligns with the reasoning we've established.\n- D indicates that Y and Z are compounds, which contradicts their inability to be broken down further."
