  "query": "Question: On Earth, water can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. Which energy source has the greatest influence on the state of matter of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: the sun\nB: the wind\nC: ocean currents\nD: the metal core",
  "steps": [
    "The state of matter of water (solid, liquid, gas) is primarily affected by temperature. Therefore, the energy source that primarily influences temperature would be the most significant.",
    "The sun radiates energy in the form of heat and light, which directly impacts Earth's temperatures and, consequently, the state of water (e.g., heating for evaporation to gas, cooling for freezing to solid).",
    "The wind, ocean currents, and the Earth's metal core have varying effects, but they are secondary to the influence of the sun in terms of changing water's state through direct temperature variation."
