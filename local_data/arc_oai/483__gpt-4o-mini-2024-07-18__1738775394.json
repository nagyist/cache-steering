  "steps": [
    "The skin is part of the integumentary system and interacts directly with several organ systems, including the immune system, which relies on the skin as a protective barrier.",
    "The excretory system involves the removal of waste products, and the skin can excrete substances like sweat and help in thermoregulation, indicating a direct interaction.",
    "The nervous system is closely linked to the skin as it has many sensory receptors that respond to external stimuli, showing a significant direct interaction.",
    "The digestive system primarily processes food and waste internally, with no significant interaction with the skin compared to the other systems mentioned."
