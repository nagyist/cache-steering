  "query": "Question: From Earth, we see the sun in the day sky and other stars in the night sky. Nighttime stars look like tiny points of light. Which statement explains why nighttime stars appear so much smaller than the sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: The stars are much smaller.\nB: The sky is much darker at night.\nC: The stars are much farther away.\nD: The moon blocks out most starlight.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the differences in the apparent size of celestial objects as viewed from Earth. The sun is relatively close to Earth, while stars are incredibly distant.",
    "Next, evaluate each choice to determine which best explains the significant size difference in appearance. If stars are farther away, they will appear smaller.",
    "Analyze the other options: A suggests that stars are smaller, which is misleading since many stars are larger than the sun; B states that the sky is darker at night, which does not directly affect the size appearance; and D mentions the moon blocking out starlight, which is irrelevant to the size perspective."
