  "query": "Question: A flowing stream contains water at 18\u00b0C. Cans of soft drinks at 28\u00b0C are lowered into the stream. Which of the following will most likely occur?\n\nChoices:\nA: The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water.\nB: The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.\nC: The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed.\nD: The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing.",
  "steps": [
    "The temperature of the stream is lower than that of the soft drink cans (18\u00b0C vs. 28\u00b0C), which means there is a temperature difference between the two.",
    "Heat will naturally flow from a warmer object (the soft drink cans) to a cooler one (the stream water) in an attempt to reach thermal equilibrium.",
    "Since the cans are not insulated and the water in the stream is flowing, the heat transfer can occur effectively, allowing the soft drink temperature to decrease.",
    "The cans will continue to cool until they reach the same temperature as the stream's water, given enough time for the heat exchange to occur."

  "solution": "B"
