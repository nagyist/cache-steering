  "query": "Question: Which of the following factors would most likely cause a hurricane to decrease in strength?\n\nChoices:\nA: staying over a warm body of water for a long time.\nB: increasing the number of large clouds.\nC: moving over a continent.\nD: moving toward tropical waters.",
  "steps": [
    "A hurricane derives its strength primarily from warm ocean waters. If a hurricane stays over a warm body of water for a long time, it generally strengthens, not weakens.",
    "The presence of large clouds generally indicates a well-developed storm system. While they are part of the hurricane structure, simply increasing the number of clouds does not weaken a hurricane.",
    "When a hurricane moves over a continent, it typically encounters land which disrupts its circulation and reduces its supply of warm, moist air. This will lead to a decrease in strength.",
    "Moving toward tropical waters would likely support hurricane strength because those waters are warm and can fuel the hurricane further."
