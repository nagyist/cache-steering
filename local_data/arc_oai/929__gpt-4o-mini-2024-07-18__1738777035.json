  "query": "Question: Earth's distance from the Sun helps the planet sustain life. If the Sun were larger, what would most likely also have to be true for Earth to sustain life?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth would have to be further from the Sun.\nB: Earth would have to be closer to the Sun.\nC: Earth would have to be smaller.\nD: Earth would have to be larger.",
  "steps": [
    "If the Sun were larger, it would generally emit more energy and heat, which could increase Earth's temperature if its distance from the Sun remained the same.",
    "To maintain a suitable temperature for life, Earth would need to be at a greater distance from the larger Sun to balance the increased energy output and avoid overheating.",
    "This reasoning leads us to conclude that if the Sun were larger, the most logical solution for Earth to continue sustaining life would be to increase its distance from the Sun."
