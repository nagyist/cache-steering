  "query": "Question: A student poured water into a plastic tray. The student then put the tray into the freezer. What property of the water changed as the water froze?\n\nChoices:\nA: The water became a gas.\nB: The mass of water increased.\nC: The water took a definite shape.\nD: The flavor of the water changed.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider what happens to water when it freezes. Water transitions from a liquid state to a solid state when it freezes.",
    "Next, we analyze the options given. Option A suggests that the water became a gas, which is incorrect as freezing results in solidification, not vaporization.",
    "Then, we evaluate option B, which states that the mass of water increased. Freezing does not change the mass of the substance itself; it remains the same.",
    "Now, we assess option C, which states that the water took a definite shape. When water freezes, it becomes ice, which has a definite shape compared to the liquid form that takes the shape of its container.",
    "Finally, we look at option D, which claims the flavor of the water changed. Freezing and thawing do not inherently change the flavor of pure water."

  "solution": "C"
