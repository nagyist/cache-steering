  "query": "Question: When it rains, some animals will ___.\n\nChoices:\nA: hibernate for the season\nB: migrate to warmer climates\nC: change their body covering\nD: move to seek shelter",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the typical behavior of animals during rainy weather. Many animals seek protection from rain to avoid getting wet and to maintain their body temperature.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices given. Hibernation is generally a seasonal behavior and not specifically related to rain; migration is also associated with seasons rather than rain; while changing body covering is not a common response to rain for most animals.",
    "In contrast, moving to seek shelter is a clear and direct response to rain, as animals often look for places to stay dry and safe during wet conditions."
