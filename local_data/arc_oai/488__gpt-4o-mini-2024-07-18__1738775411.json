  "query": "Question: What kind of energy change occurs when a battery is operating a remote control toy?\n\nChoices:\nA: Heat energy is changed to light energy.\nB: Light energy is changed to heat energy.\nC: Potential energy is changed to kinetic energy.\nD: Kinetic energy is changed to chemical energy.",
  "steps": [
    "A battery stores chemical energy when it is charged. This chemical energy is released when the battery powers the remote control toy.",
    "The remote control toy converts the chemical energy from the battery into kinetic energy to enable movement.",
    "Since the remote control toy is capable of motion as a result of energy conversion from the battery, the primary transformation involved is from potential energy to kinetic energy."
