  "steps": [
    "A solution with a pH of 2 is highly acidic.",
    "To increase the pH above 7, which is neutral, a substance that neutralizes or reacts with the acidity must be added.",
    "Adding an acid (choice A) would further lower the pH, and adding hydrogen (choice D) does not neutralize acidity. Therefore, these options would not help achieve the goal.",
    "Adding water (choice B) dilutes the solution but may not be sufficient to raise the pH above 7.",
    "Adding a base (choice C) will neutralize the acid, resulting in an increase in pH. A strong enough base can raise the pH above 7."
