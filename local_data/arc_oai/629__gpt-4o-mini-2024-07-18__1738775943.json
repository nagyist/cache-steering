  "query": "Question: Which of the following has the greatest mass?\n\nChoices:\nA: star\nB: moon\nC: planet\nD: galaxy",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the relative sizes and masses of the items listed: star, moon, planet, and galaxy.",
    "Stars are typically massive celestial bodies that undergo nuclear fusion. They usually have much greater mass than planets, moons, or even small galaxies.",
    "Moons are natural satellites and are significantly smaller in mass compared to planets, stars, and galaxies.",
    "Planets have considerable mass, but they are generally less massive than stars.",
    "Galaxies are vast collections of stars, planets, and other matter, and they contain billions to trillions of stars, giving them enormous mass on astronomical scales.",
    "When comparing the mass of a star, a moon, a planet, and a galaxy, it's clear that a galaxy has the greatest mass because it encompasses a multitude of stars and other celestial objects."
