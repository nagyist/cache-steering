  "query": "Question: Which of these is never found in prokaryotic cells?\n\nChoices:\nA: cell membrane\nB: ribosome\nC: cell wall\nD: nucleus",
  "steps": [
    "Prokaryotic cells are characterized by the absence of a nucleus, which distinguishes them from eukaryotic cells.",
    "Cell membranes, ribosomes, and cell walls are all present in prokaryotic cells; the cell membrane encloses the cell, ribosomes are necessary for protein synthesis, and many prokaryotes have a cell wall that provides structure and protection.",
    "The defining feature of prokaryotic cells is that they lack a membrane-bound nucleus, which is typical of eukaryotic cells."
