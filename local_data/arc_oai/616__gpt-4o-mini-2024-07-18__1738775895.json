  "steps": [
    "Sound travels through different states of matter at different speeds due to the density and elasticity of the materials.",
    "In solids, particles are closely packed together, allowing sound waves to transfer quickly because the particles can collide more frequently.",
    "In liquids, particles are further apart compared to solids, so sound travels slower than in solids but faster than in gases.",
    "In gases, particles are much more spread out than in liquids and solids, which makes sound travel slowest in gases due to less frequent collisions between particles.",
    "Thus, the speed of sound is greatest in solids and lowest in gases."

  "solution": "B"
