  "query": "Question: Which of the following is an example of an escape strategy that is used to avoid being killed and eaten by predators?\n\nChoices:\nA: Deer shed their antlers in the fall.\nB: Newts drop their tails when threatened.\nC: Anglerfish produce light to attract other fish.\nD: Otters produce oil to coat their fur and make it waterproof.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an example of an escape strategy specifically used to avoid predation.",
    "Option A: Deer shedding their antlers is a natural process for growth and does not serve as an escape strategy. Therefore, it is not a correct example.",
    "Option B: Newts dropping their tails when threatened is a known escape strategy. It distracts predators and allows the newt to escape while the predator focuses on the tail.",
    "Option C: Anglerfish producing light is primarily a method for attracting prey, not avoiding predators, so it doesn't fit the criteria.",
    "Option D: Otters producing oil for waterproofing helps with survival and buoyancy but does not specifically relate to escaping predators."
