  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the relationship between a fox and an eagle that eat some of the same organisms in an ecosystem.",
    "Since both the fox and the eagle consume the same organisms, they are likely competing for those resources.",
    "The relationship does not indicate any benefit to one from the other (which would qualify for mutualism), nor does it indicate one is killing the other (which would qualify for predation), or that one is living off the other without killing it (which would be parasitism).",
    "Therefore, the best classification of the relationship due to the shared resource consumption is competition."
