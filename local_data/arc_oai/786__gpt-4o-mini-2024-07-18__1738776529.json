  "query": "Question: Students measure the effect of water on the growth of plants for a lab experiment. The students give different amounts of water to three different groups of plants. All plants receive the same amount of light and are planted in the same amount of soil. The students then measure the height of the plants over a period of four weeks. Which variables should be labeled on the axes to graph the data collected in this experiment?\n\nChoices:\nA: Amount of Water vs. Height of Plants\nB: Temperature vs. Amount of Sunlight\nC: Amount of Water vs. Amount of Soil\nD: Amount of Sunlight vs. Height of Plants",
  "steps": [
    "In an experiment, typically one variable is manipulated (independent variable), and the other variable is observed or measured (dependent variable). In this case, the amount of water is being manipulated to observe its effect on the growth of the plants, specifically their height.",
    "The independent variable, which is the one that is controlled or changed by the students, is the amount of water given to the plants. Therefore, this variable should be placed on the x-axis of the graph.",
    "The dependent variable, which is measured as the outcome of the experiment, is the height of the plants. This should be plotted on the y-axis of the graph.",
    "Thus, the correct labeling for the axes of the graph based on the collected data would be \u201cAmount of Water\u201d on the x-axis and \u201cHeight of Plants\u201d on the y-axis."
