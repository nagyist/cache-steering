  "query": "Question: Which of these is a composite material?\n\nChoices:\nA: a glass window\nB: a bronze statue\nC: an aluminum can\nD: a fiberglass bumper",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to define what a composite material is. A composite material is made from two or more constituent materials that have significantly different physical or chemical properties. When combined, they produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components.",
    "Next, we analyze each choice to see if it fits the definition of a composite material. \nOption A, a glass window, is made of solid glass and does not combine different materials.",
    "Option B, a bronze statue, is primarily made of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin but not a composite as it's a metal, not a combination of different materials contributing to a new structure.",
    "Option C, an aluminum can, is made of aluminum metal and does not represent a combination of different materials in the sense of composites.",
    "Finally, we look at Option D, a fiberglass bumper. Fiberglass consists of strands of glass fibers embedded in a resin, which is the combination of two materials, making it a composite material."
