  "query": "Question: Animals may fight, make threatening sounds, and act aggressively toward members of the same species. These behaviors usually occur as the result of\n\nChoices:\n1: competition\n2: conservation\n3: decomposition\n4: pollution",
  "steps": [
    "Animals often display aggressive behaviors to establish dominance within a group or to gain access to resources such as food, mates, or territory.",
    "Such competition helps ensure survival and reproductive success, with stronger individuals outcompeting others for limited resources.",
    "Since the behaviors are aimed at members of the same species, it suggests intraspecific competition rather than external environmental factors.",
    "Conservation, decomposition, and pollution do not typically explain aggressive interactions within a species."

  "solution": "1"
