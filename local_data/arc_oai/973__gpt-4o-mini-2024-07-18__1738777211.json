  "query": "Question: A class is modeling the differences between a unicellular organism and a multicellular organism. Which example is a model of a unicellular organism?\n\nChoices:\nA: a student passing out water to a group\nB: a student getting cereal from the cabinet\nC: two students collecting trash from a group\nD: four students working together to move a desk",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which example represents a unicellular organism, which functions as a single unit.",
    "In a unicellular organism, all necessary life functions are carried out by a single cell.",
    "Looking at the choices, we must find the one that reflects a single unit performing a task, rather than multiple individuals working together.",
    "A: a student passing out water to a group \u2014 This involves one student (unicellular) interacting with multiple others (multicellular).",
    "B: a student getting cereal from the cabinet \u2014 This implies a single student engaging in a solitary task (unicellular).",
    "C: two students collecting trash from a group \u2014 This clearly indicates a collaboration of two students (multicellular).",
    "D: four students working together to move a desk \u2014 This involves multiple students working collectively (multicellular).",
    "Among all the choices, option B stands out as it depicts one student acting independently, closely resembling the definition of a unicellular organism."
