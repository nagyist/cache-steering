  "query": "Question: The Late Heavy Bombardment was a period of extensive comet impact on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago. Scientists believe this period provided much of the matter now found in which part of the Earth system?\n\nChoices:\nA: core\nB: mantle\nC: atmosphere\nD: hydrosphere",
  "steps": [
    "The Late Heavy Bombardment refers to a time when numerous comets and asteroids impacted the Earth, potentially delivering various materials.",
    "One significant result of these impacts was the delivery of water and other volatiles, which contributed to the formation of the Earth's oceans.",
    "The hydrosphere consists of all water bodies on Earth, including oceans, rivers, and lakes, which would have been significantly influenced by the water delivered during this bombardment.",
    "While the core and mantle are important geological layers, they are not primarily affected by the impact of comets, whereas the atmosphere is more about gases that are not directly supplied by impacts in the same way as water."
