  "query": "Question: A statue and a table are both made of the same type of marble. Which of the following properties will most likely be the same for both of these objects?\n\nChoices:\nA: size\nB: shape\nC: weight\nD: hardness",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that both the statue and the table are made of the same type of marble, which implies they share material properties.",
    "Of the options given, hardness is a material property that will be the same for both objects since they are both made of the same type of marble.",
    "Size and shape will likely differ between the statue and the table, as they are inherently different objects designed for different purposes.",
    "Weight can vary depending on the size and volume of each object, even if they are made from the same material."

  "solution": "D"
