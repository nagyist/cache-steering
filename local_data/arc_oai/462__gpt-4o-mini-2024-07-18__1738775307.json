  "query": "Question: A group of students plans to build a model of a local pond habitat. Which model best represents an environment similar to a pond?\n\nChoices:\nA: a sealed plastic bottle containing insects and algae from a pond\nB: a classroom aquarium containing plants and animals bought from a store\nC: a classroom aquarium containing freshwater, non-native plants, and non-native animals\nD: a small plastic outdoor pool containing freshwater, native plants, and native animals",
  "steps": [
    "The habitat being modeled is a pond, which naturally supports native plants and animals that live in an aquatic environment.",
    "Option A presents a sealed plastic bottle with insects and algae from a pond, which confines the habitat and does not provide a realistic or sustainable model of an entire ecosystem.",
    "Option B involves plants and animals bought from a store, which means they are not representative of the local pond environment and likely do not include native species.",
    "Option C has freshwater, but it uses non-native plants and animals. This does not accurately represent a local pond habitat since it excludes local biodiversity.",
    "Option D describes a small plastic outdoor pool with freshwater, native plants, and native animals, making it the best choice for representing a pond habitat since it focuses on local species in a similar environment to a pond."
