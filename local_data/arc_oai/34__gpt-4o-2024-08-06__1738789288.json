  "query": "Question: Four materials are put into small containers. These materials are then moved from the small containers into larger containers. Which material will spread out to completely fill a larger container?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: ice\nC: sand\nD: water",
  "steps": [
    "The problem involves understanding the behavior of different materials when placed in larger containers.",
    "Air is a gas and gases have the property of expanding to fill their entire container.",
    "Ice is a solid and solids maintain their shape regardless of the container they are placed in.",
    "Sand is made up of solid particles and will not spread out to completely fill the container without additional forces like shaking.",
    "Water is a liquid and will take the shape of the container but does not expand to fill it completely unless the container is filled with water.",
    "Among the materials listed, air as a gas will expand to completely fill a larger container."
