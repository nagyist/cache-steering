  "query": "Question: Which statement accurately describes the neutrons in any element?\n\nChoices:\nA: The number of neutrons equals the number of electrons.\nB: Neutrons are found in a cloud around the nucleus.\nC: The charge of a neutron is always negative.\nD: Neutrons are more massive than electrons.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze statement A: \"The number of neutrons equals the number of electrons.\" This is not true for most elements, as the number of neutrons can vary independently of the number of electrons, especially in isotopes.",
    "Next, we look at statement B: \"Neutrons are found in a cloud around the nucleus.\" This is incorrect; neutrons are located within the nucleus of the atom, not in a cloud.",
    "Now, consider statement C: \"The charge of a neutron is always negative.\" This statement is incorrect because neutrons are neutral particles and have no charge.",
    "Finally, evaluate statement D: \"Neutrons are more massive than electrons.\" This is true, as neutrons are significantly more massive than electrons."

  "solution": "D"
