  "query": "Question: A student stirred some sand into a container of water and left the mixture alone for several hours until the sand settled on the bottom of the container. Which statement best explains why the sand separated from the water?\n\nChoices:\nA: Sand particles are denser than water.\nB: Water is a liquid and sand is a solid.\nC: The sand was insufficiently stirred.\nD: There was more sand than water.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the properties of the materials involved: sand and water. Sand is a solid, while water is a liquid.",
    "Next, think about the behavior of solids in a liquid. Generally, if a solid has a higher density than the liquid it is in, it will settle at the bottom over time.",
    "Evaluate the choices based on this understanding. Choice A states that sand particles are denser than water, which would explain why sand settles at the bottom after being stirred into water.",
    "Now, consider the other options. Choice B, while true, does not specifically explain the separation. Choice C is irrelevant because the question is about separation after settling, not stirring. Choice D does not directly address the factors of density that cause settlement."

  "solution": "A"
