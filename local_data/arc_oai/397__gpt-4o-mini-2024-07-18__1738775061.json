  "query": "Question: The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of approximately one kilometer per second. The Moon is kept in orbit by which of the following?\n\nChoices:\nA: gravity\nB: lunar phases\nC: magnetism\nD: ocean tides",
  "steps": [
    "The Moon is held in orbit around the Earth due to a force that pulls it towards the Earth.",
    "The primary force that acts to keep celestial bodies in orbit, such as the Moon around the Earth, is gravity.",
    "Lunar phases, magnetism, and ocean tides do not play a direct role in keeping the Moon in its orbit. Lunar phases are the different appearances of the Moon as it orbits Earth, magnetism is not a significant force between the Earth and the Moon, and ocean tides are a result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth's oceans."
