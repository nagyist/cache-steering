  "query": "Question: How will a thriving grassland ecosystem most likely be affected by a drought?\n\nChoices:\nA: Plant respiration will increase.\nB: Animals will be forced to migrate.\nC: Soil nutrients will be enriched.\nD: Natural succession will cease.",
  "steps": [
    "A drought typically reduces the availability of water, which is critical for plant growth and respiration. Therefore, plant respiration is likely to decrease rather than increase during a drought.",
    "With reduced water availability, many animals in a grassland ecosystem will struggle to find food and water sources, leading them to migrate to areas where conditions are more favorable.",
    "Drought conditions often lead to soil depletion due to the lack of water that helps maintain soil health and nutrient levels. Therefore, soil nutrients are not likely to be enriched during a drought.",
    "Natural succession refers to the gradual process by which ecosystems change and develop over time. A drought can disrupt this process rather than completely cease it, as some species may adapt to survive."
