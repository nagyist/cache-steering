  "query": "Question: How do coal and the sun compare as sources of energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: Coal is renewable, and the sun is renewable.\nB: Coal is renewable, and the sun is nonrenewable.\nC: Coal is nonrenewable, and the sun is renewable.\nD: Coal is nonrenewable, and the sun is nonrenewable.",
  "steps": [
    "First, define what renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy are. Renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished naturally, such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Nonrenewable energy comes from sources that are finite and will deplete over time, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.",
    "Next, evaluate coal as an energy source. Coal is formed from ancient organic materials and takes millions of years to form. Once it is used up, it cannot be replaced within a human timescale. Therefore, coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source.",
    "Then, consider the sun as an energy source. The sun produces energy continuously and will continue to do so for billions of years. As such, solar energy is classified as renewable.",
    "Based on the definitions and evaluations, coal is nonrenewable, while the sun is renewable. This leads to the conclusion that the correct comparison between the two as energy sources is: Coal is nonrenewable, and the sun is renewable."
