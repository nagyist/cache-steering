  "query": "Question: Which process forced Nevada's mountain ranges upward over the past million years?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion of surrounding material\nB: seismic activity along fault lines\nC: multiple volcanic eruptions\nD: deposition of wind-blown sediments",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the geological processes that cause mountain ranges to be forced upward. Generally, this upward movement is associated with tectonic activity rather than erosion or deposition.",
    "Next, I analyze the choices. A: erosion of surrounding material, typically involves a lowering of elevation rather than uplift. B: seismic activity along fault lines often indicates tectonic movements that can lead to uplift, making this a strong candidate. C: multiple volcanic eruptions can contribute to building up land but are less about forcing existing mountain ranges upward. D: deposition of wind-blown sediments tends to build up layers rather than uplift existing ranges.",
    "Looking closely at seismic activity, it can cause significant geological changes, including the uplift of mountain ranges. Mountains in Nevada, for example, are heavily influenced by tectonic forces associated with faulting. This aligns well with the idea of seismic activity causing upward thrust."
