  "query": "Question: Lactose intolerance is a condition of the digestive system in which an individual has an inability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. An individual affected with lactose intolerance does not produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. If more adults than children are diagnosed with lactose intolerance, what does this most likely suggest?\n\nChoices:\nA: The production of lactase decreases over time.\nB: The digestion of food breaks down lactase.\nC: Lactose intolerance is an allergic reaction.\nD: Lactose intolerance is contagious.",
  "steps": [
    "Lactose intolerance is associated with the inability to produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose. The fact that more adults than children are diagnosed suggests a change over time in lactase production.",
    "If more adults are diagnosed, it implies that as people age, they may produce less lactase. This aligns with the understanding that lactase production can decrease during adulthood.",
    "Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the diagnosis pattern is that the production of lactase decreases over time."
