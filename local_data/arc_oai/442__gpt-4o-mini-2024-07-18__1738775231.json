  "query": "Question: A student uses the following characteristics to describe a group of objects in space. * 200 billion stars * 30 million light years from Earth * 500 light years in diameter Which of the following is the student most likely describing?\n\nChoices:\nA: a galaxy\nB: the universe\nC: a constellation\nD: the solar system",
  "steps": [
    "The student mentions \"200 billion stars,\" which is a characteristic often attributed to galaxies. The number of stars in a galaxy can be in this range.",
    "The distance mentioned, \"30 million light years from Earth,\" is also consistent with the distance to many galaxies. In contrast, most objects in the solar system are much closer.",
    "The diameter of \"500 light years\" aligns with the sizes of many galaxies, as galaxies can span hundreds to thousands of light years in diameter, whereas a solar system would be much smaller.",
    "The options provided indicate that the other choices (the universe, a constellation, and the solar system) do not adequately match the described characteristics. The universe is much larger, a constellation is not a physical structure of stars like a galaxy, and the solar system is too small."

  "solution": "A"
