  "query": "Question: Which of following is a property shared by the elements in the carbon family?\n\nChoices:\nA: an atomic number of 6\nB: an atomic mass of 12\nC: the same electron configuration\nD: the number of valence electrons",
  "steps": [
    "The carbon family consists of elements in Group 14 of the periodic table, which includes carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium.",
    "Option A is incorrect because only carbon has an atomic number of 6; the other elements in the carbon family have different atomic numbers.",
    "Option B is incorrect as well since the atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12, but the atomic masses of the other elements vary significantly.",
    "Option C is misleading because while elements in the same group have similar properties, they do not share the same electron configuration overall; they all have a similar outer electron configuration but differ in the number of electron shells.",
    "Option D is correct because all elements in the carbon family have four valence electrons, which is a characteristic of this group."

  "solution": "D"
