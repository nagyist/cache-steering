  "query": "Question: Which of these statements best describes a possible environmental consequence in constructing a large-scale wind farm to generate electricity?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wind farms alter the regional climate.\nB: Wind farms can disrupt migrating wildlife.\nC: Wind farms use a renewable energy source.\nD: Wind farms generate direct current electricity.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an environmental consequence of constructing a large-scale wind farm.",
    "Choice A states that wind farms alter the regional climate. While wind farms can influence local weather patterns, the statement does not directly imply a significant environmental consequence associated specifically with their construction.",
    "Choice B mentions that wind farms can disrupt migrating wildlife. This is a well-documented consequence of wind farm construction, as the placement of wind turbines can affect bird and bat migration routes and behaviors.",
    "Choice C indicates that wind farms use a renewable energy source. While this is true and is a positive aspect of wind energy, it does not describe a consequence of constructing the farms.",
    "Choice D states that wind farms generate direct current electricity. This is also incorrect, as wind farms generate alternating current electricity, and it does not reflect an environmental consequence."
