  "query": "Question: Photosynthesis is a process involving carbon dioxide, water, glucose, oxygen, and sunlight. Which is the correct chemical equation for photosynthesis?\n\nChoices:\nA: O_{2} + H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + CO_{2}\nB: CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{6}O_{3} + O_{2} + energy\nC: 6O_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6CO_{2} + energy\nD: 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}",
  "steps": [
    "Photosynthesis primarily occurs in plants, using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
    "The general formula for photosynthesis can be represented as: carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> glucose + oxygen.",
    "From this, we can deduce that the reactants should include 6 carbon dioxide (CO2) and 6 water (H2O) molecules, while the products should yield 1 glucose (C6H12O6) and 6 oxygen (O2) molecules.",
    "Looking at the given options, we check each equation for the consistency with this understanding.",
    "Option D: 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 is consistent and correctly represents the reactants and products of photosynthesis.",
    "The other options do not correctly represent the process or the stoichiometry of the reaction."
