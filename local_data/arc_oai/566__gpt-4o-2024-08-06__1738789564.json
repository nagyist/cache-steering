  "query": "Question: Volcanic eruptions early in Earth's history are believed to be responsible for a large proportion of the matter now found in which Earth structure?\n\nChoices:\nA: mantle\nB: asthenosphere\nC: hydrosphere\nD: ozone layer",
  "steps": [
    "Volcanic eruptions release materials from Earth's interior, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other gases, as well as solid particles.",
    "Early volcanic activity would have released a significant amount of water vapor into the atmosphere.",
    "As the Earth cooled, this water vapor would have condensed to form bodies of water.",
    "These bodies of water contribute to the formation and sustaining of the Earth's hydrosphere, which includes all the water on Earth's surface."
