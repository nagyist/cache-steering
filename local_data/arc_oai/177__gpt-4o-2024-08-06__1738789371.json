  "steps": [
    "The hinges on eyeglasses allow for a rotational movement to open and close the temples.",
    "Knees primarily provide forward and backward bending movement, similar to a hinge.",
    "Fingers have joints that provide more complex motions, not purely hinge-like.",
    "The neck vertebrae allow for a wide range of motion, not hinge-like movement.",
    "The base of the thumb is a saddle joint allowing multi-directional movement, not just a simple rotation."
