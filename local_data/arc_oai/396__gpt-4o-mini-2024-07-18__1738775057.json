  "query": "Question: The temperature of water in a glass changes from 5\u00b0C to -1\u00b0C. How will the water most likely change?\n\nChoices:\nA: It will boil.\nB: It will melt.\nC: It will freeze.\nD: It will condense.",
  "steps": [
    "The initial temperature of the water is 5\u00b0C, which is above the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C).",
    "As the temperature drops to -1\u00b0C, it falls below the freezing point, which indicates that water will change from liquid to solid.",
    "Therefore, the water will undergo a phase change and will likely freeze at this temperature."
  ],
  "solution": "C"
