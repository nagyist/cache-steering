  "steps": [
    "The gravitational force between two objects is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects and directly proportional to the product of their masses.",
    "Let's analyze how each of the provided choices affects the gravitational force. Starting with the base formula: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between them.",
    "Choice A states to halve the distance. Halving the distance would increase the gravitational force because F is inversely proportional to r^2 (i.e., if r is halved, r^2 becomes one-fourth, increasing F).",
    "Choice B suggests doubling the distance. This would decrease the gravitational force because it makes r larger, which increases r^2, thereby reducing F.",
    "Choice C involves halving the distance and doubling the mass. Halving the distance would increase the force by a factor of 4 (since r^2 decreases to 1/4), and doubling the mass would double the force. Together, this significantly increases the gravitational force.",
    "Choice D suggests doubling the distance and halving the mass. Doubling the distance decreases the gravitational force, as noted in choice B, and halving the mass further reduces the gravitational force, leading to a significant decrease overall.",
    "To find which choice reduces the gravitational force the most, we can compare conclusions: \n- Choice A increases the force.\n- Choice B decreases it.\n- Choice C increases it.\n- Choice D significantly decreases it due to both factors working against the force.",
    "Thus, between the choices, choice D (doubling the distance and halving the mass) results in the greatest reduction to gravitational force."
