  "query": "Question: How many times does Earth rotate on its axis in one day?\n\nChoices:\nA: once\nB: twice\nC: 24 times\nD: 365 times",
  "steps": [
    "The Earth rotates on its axis, and one complete rotation corresponds to one day.",
    "A day is generally defined as the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once on its axis relative to the sun, which is approximately 24 hours.",
    "Although it may seem like the Earth rotates multiple times in terms of its orbit around the sun, we are specifically focusing on the rotation on its axis to define a day.",
    "Therefore, the correct number of rotations the Earth makes on its axis in one day is once."

  "solution": "A"
