  "query": "Question: During a sporting event, a referee uses a whistle to alert the teams to start and stop playing. What causes the sound from the referee's whistle to travel in all directions?\n\nChoices:\nA: vibrations on the ground\nB: vibrations of the air\nC: seismic waves\nD: light waves",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about how the sound produced by the referee's whistle is able to travel.",
    "The sound from the whistle originates from the vibrations that occur when the referee blows into it.",
    "Sound waves travel through a medium; in this case, the medium is the air surrounding the whistle.",
    "These air vibrations create pressure waves that propagate outwards in all directions from the source of the sound, which is the whistle.",
    "The other options involve different types of waves that do not relate to the propagation of sound. Seismic waves (C) relate to ground vibrations, while light waves (D) relate to electromagnetic radiation and vibrations on the ground (A) do not significantly produce sound waves in this context."

  "solution": "B"
