  "query": "Question: In multicellular organisms, different structures have different functions. Which function is carried out in the leaves of a plant?\n\nChoices:\nA: absorbing food\nB: producing flowers\nC: absorbing light\nD: making seeds",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the primary functions of leaves in plants. Leaves are primarily involved in the process of photosynthesis.",
    "Next, identify the key component involved in photosynthesis, which is the absorption of light. Leaves contain chlorophyll, the pigment that captures light energy.",
    "Now, evaluate the answer choices provided. \"Absorbing food\" (A) is not a function of leaves, as they do not absorb food but rather produce it through photosynthesis. \"Producing flowers\" (B) is the function of reproductive organs, not leaves. \"Making seeds\" (D) relates to reproductive structures, not leaves.",
    "Since the primary function of leaves involves light, the most relevant choice here is \"absorbing light\" (C), as it directly relates to photosynthesis."
