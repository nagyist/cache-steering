  "query": "Question: A gene mutates in a type of bacteria. When these bacteria reproduce asexually, this mutation can only be inherited by\n\nChoices:\nA: different types of bacteria.\nB: cells in the bacteria that are non-reproductive.\nC: bacteria cells that are missing the gene.\nD: direct descendants of the bacteria.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that a gene mutates in bacteria and that these bacteria reproduce asexually. Asexual reproduction means that the offspring are clones of the parent, inheriting all genetic material directly from it.",
    "Since the mutation occurs in a gene of the bacteria, it will be passed on to the offspring through this asexual reproduction, which means that only the direct descendants of the original bacteria will inherit the mutation.",
    "The other options are not applicable: different types of bacteria (A) would not inherit the mutation, non-reproductive cells (B) do not pass on genes since they are not involved in reproduction, and bacteria missing the gene (C) wouldn\u2019t inherit a mutation in that gene."
