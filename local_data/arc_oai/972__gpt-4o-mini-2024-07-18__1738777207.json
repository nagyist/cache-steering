  "query": "Question: A hydrologist is studying the acidity level of a city lake. She collects samples twice a week and takes them to her lab to test them. After testing the samples, she places the data on a graph. She tells the city engineers that her tests indicate that the pH level has been steadily dropping over the past few months. Which of the following steps is the best way to check the accuracy of her data?\n\nChoices:\nA: retest new samples\nB: retest the original samples\nC: show the graphs to the engineers\nD: show the samples to the engineers",
  "steps": [
    "The hydrologist has been collecting samples and has noted a steady drop in pH levels. To ensure her findings are accurate, it\u2019s important to verify her testing methods or sample integrity.",
    "Option A suggests retesting new samples. This could provide additional data but does not validate the original test results.",
    "Option B suggests retesting the original samples. This would be a direct way to re-evaluate her initial findings and confirm that her data was accurate.",
    "Option C suggests showing the graphs to the engineers. While this communicates findings, it does not verify the accuracy of the data.",
    "Option D suggests showing the samples to the engineers. This would not provide any verification of the data either.",
    "Among these options, retesting the original samples is the most effective way to confirm the accuracy of her previous tests."
