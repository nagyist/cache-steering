  "query": "Question: A species lives in a region that changes over time from temperate to tropical. The survival of the species will be most probable if the species can do which of the following?\n\nChoices:\nA: reduce the energy requirements\nB: adapt to exploit changed resources\nC: interbreed with similar tropical organisms\nD: emigrate before the change is complete",
  "steps": [
    "The species is facing a change in its habitat from temperate to tropical, which suggests that the resources and conditions it relies on may also change significantly.",
    "For the species to survive in a changing environment, it will likely need to adapt to the new conditions and resources available in the tropical setting.",
    "Option A, reducing energy requirements, could help but does not address the need for adaptation to new resources directly.",
    "Option C, interbreeding with similar tropical organisms, may not directly ensure survival if the species cannot adapt to the new environment itself.",
    "Option D, emigration, is a potential strategy but may not always be feasible as it requires finding a new suitable habitat quickly.",
    "Option B, adapting to exploit changed resources, directly addresses the necessity of adapting to the new tropical environment for survival, making it the most relevant choice."
