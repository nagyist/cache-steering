  "query": "Question: New evidence suggests that \"hot spots\" may form in response to \"twisting\" stresses on plates. It is theorized that these stresses may eventually result in the splitting apart of the tectonic plate in the area of the hot spot. Which of the geographic features would be affected most by the splitting of a tectonic plate?\n\nChoices:\nA: the Himalayas\nB: the Hawaiian Islands\nC: the San Andreas Fault\nD: the Mid-Atlantic Ridge",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves understanding how a hot spot relates to tectonic plate dynamics, specifically regarding the splitting of plates.",
    "Among the geographic features listed, the feature that is most closely associated with hot spots is the Hawaiian Islands, which are formed as a result of volcanic activity from a stationary hot spot beneath the Pacific Plate.",
    "The Himalayas are formed by continental collision rather than a hot spot, the San Andreas Fault is a transform boundary with lateral movement, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent boundary where plates move apart but not specifically linked to hot spots.",
    "Since the question specifically asks for the geographic feature most affected by the splitting of a tectonic plate due to a hot spot, the Hawaiian Islands are the most relevant choice."
