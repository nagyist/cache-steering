  "query": "Question: Earthworms move randomly throughout topsoil. How do earthworms most likely affect the topsoil?\n\nChoices:\nA: by compacting the topsoil\nB: by decreasing the fertility of the topsoil\nC: by adding nutrients to the topsoil\nD: by removing the minerals from the topsoil",
  "steps": [
    "Earthworms burrow through the topsoil as they move and consume organic matter, such as decaying leaves and other plant material.",
    "As earthworms digest this organic material, they break it down and produce castings, which are nutrient-rich deposits that enhance soil fertility.",
    "Additionally, their movement aerates the soil, allowing for better water infiltration and root growth, which also contributes to the overall health of the soil.",
    "Considering all of these factors, earthworms most likely contribute positively to the nutrients in the topsoil rather than compacting it or depleting it."
