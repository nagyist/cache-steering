  "query": "Question: Scientists claim that the continents of South America and Africa were once a single landmass. All of the following observations support this claim except\n\nChoices:\nA: the mountains on these continents have similar rocks of the same age.\nB: these continents appear to fit together like the pieces of a puzzle.\nC: similar fish live in the ocean off the coasts of these continents.\nD: the same kinds of fossils have been found on these continents.",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves identifying which observation does not support the claim that South America and Africa were once a single landmass.",
    "Observation A states that the mountains on these continents have similar rocks of the same age, which supports the idea of a connected landmass, as similar geological features suggest a shared history.",
    "Observation B notes that the continents fit together like puzzle pieces, which directly supports the claim of a former single landmass.",
    "Observation C mentions that similar fish live off the coasts of these continents; while this may suggest some level of ecological connection, it is less direct evidence of a shared landmass compared to geological or fossil evidence.",
    "Observation D points out that the same kinds of fossils have been found on these continents, providing strong evidence that they were once connected.",
    "Since C provides the least direct evidence supporting the landmass claim, it is the observation that does not support the claim."
