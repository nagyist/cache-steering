  "query": "Question: A ball is dropped from different heights. When the ball is dropped from the highest height, it makes the greatest noise or vibration when it lands on the ground. What is the best explanation for the ball making the greatest noise?\n\nChoices:\nA: The air pushes down more and the ball goes faster.\nB: Gravity pulls for a longer time and the ball goes faster.\nC: The ball is gaining weight and going faster.\nD: The ball is warming up and going faster.",
  "steps": [
    "The problem involves a ball being dropped from various heights and the correlation between height and noise made upon landing. Higher heights lead to greater potential energy for the ball.",
    "When the ball is dropped from a higher point, it has more time to accelerate due to gravity, meaning it will typically fall faster and reach a higher velocity before impact.",
    "The increased speed at which the ball strikes the ground will result in a higher impact force, which contributes to louder noise or vibrations.",
    "The option that best explains the relationship between height and the resulting noise upon impact is that gravity has more time to accelerate the ball downwards when dropped from a greater height."
