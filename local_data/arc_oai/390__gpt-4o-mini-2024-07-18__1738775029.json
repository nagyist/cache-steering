  "query": "Question: A student has a pink eraser on her desk. Which property shows that the eraser is a solid?\n\nChoices:\nA: Its color stays the same when it is broken in half.\nB: Its temperature goes up when it is rubbed on paper.\nC: Its shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot.\nD: Its size changes when it is used to remove pencil marks.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine if an object is a solid, we need to consider its physical properties, particularly its shape and volume.",
    "In solids, the particles are closely packed together, giving them a definite shape and volume that do not change easily.",
    "Looking at the options, option C states that the eraser's shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot, which indicates it maintains its shape and is characteristic of solids.",
    "The other options either refer to color consistency or changes in size and temperature, which do not specifically indicate that the object is a solid."
