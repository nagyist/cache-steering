  "query": "Question: Using nonrenewable resources for energy produces waste products that can have long-term, negative effects on Earth's subsystems. Which energy source produces waste products that can have these effects for the longest amount of time?\n\nChoices:\nA: natural gas\nB: uranium\nC: crude oil\nD: coal",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of the waste products produced by each energy source. Natural gas primarily emits carbon dioxide when burned, which contributes to climate change but has a relatively shorter-term impact compared to others.",
    "Next, look at uranium. While uranium is used in nuclear power and produces radioactive waste that can remain hazardous for thousands of years, the waste does not pollute the atmosphere but rather remains contained.",
    "Then, analyze crude oil. The combustion of crude oil produces CO2 and other pollutants, which impact the environment but generally do not last as long as some other types of waste.",
    "Finally, assess coal. Burning coal produces significant amounts of CO2, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, all of which contribute to long-term environmental issues. Additionally, coal ash can contain heavy metals that have lasting effects on the environment.",
    "Considering the longevity of waste products, uranium's radioactive waste has a long half-life and poses long-term hazardous effects, but coal's overall impact on the environment through combustion emissions and solid waste is also significant. However, the direct radioactive effects from uranium are more concerning for a much longer duration."
