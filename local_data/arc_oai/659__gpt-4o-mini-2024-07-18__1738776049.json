  "query": "Question: Which list gives the correct order of substances from the lowest melting point to the highest?\n\nChoices:\nA: oxygen, water, iron\nB: water, iron, oxygen\nC: oxygen, iron, water\nD: iron, oxygen, water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will evaluate the melting points of each substance. Oxygen has a melting point of about -218.8 \u00b0C. Water (ice) has a melting point of 0 \u00b0C. Iron has a melting point of approximately 1538 \u00b0C.",
    "Next, I will arrange these substances in order according to their melting points, starting from the lowest to the highest. I see that oxygen has the lowest melting point, followed by water, and then iron, which has the highest melting point.",
    "Now, I will compare the choices given to find which one lists the substances in the correct order. The correct order is oxygen, water, and then iron, which aligns with choice A."
