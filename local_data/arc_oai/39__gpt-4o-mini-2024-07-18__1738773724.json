  "query": "Question: An engineer measured the time it takes sound to travel through samples of different materials. All of the samples were identical in shape and size. The measurements were made using ultrasonic waves with a frequency of 5 megahertz. Which question was the engineer most likely trying to answer?\n\nChoices:\nA: In which material does sound travel fastest?\nB: In which material does sound travel farthest?\nC: Does frequency affect the distance sound travels?\nD: Does the shape of the medium affect the speed of sound?",
  "steps": [
    "The engineer is measuring the time it takes sound to travel through various materials, which directly relates to the speed of sound in those materials.",
    "The measurements involved comparing different materials under the same conditions (same shape and frequency), indicating that the key focus is on how sound travels in different contexts rather than other variables.",
    "The question that best aligns with measuring the time taken for sound to travel is about identifying the speed of sound in those materials, which relates to how fast sound travels through them.",
    "The main goal of the experiment appears to be to determine which material allows sound to travel the fastest, as opposed to distance or other influences like shape and frequency."
