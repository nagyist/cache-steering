  "query": "Question: A person cuts down a living oak tree. The person burns the wood from the oak tree to boil water. Which sequence correctly orders the energy transformations that occurred from the living tree to the boiling of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: light energy \u2192 chemical energy \u2192 thermal energy\nB: thermal energy \u2192 chemical energy \u2192 light energy\nC: chemical energy \u2192 mechanical energy \u2192 electrical energy\nD: electrical energy \u2192 mechanical energy \u2192 chemical energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, the living oak tree contains chemical energy stored in its biomass through photosynthesis, which uses light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
    "Next, when the person cuts down the living tree, the stored chemical energy in the wood is released upon burning it.",
    "Then, as the wood burns, it transforms that chemical energy into thermal energy (heat) which can be used to boil water."

  "solution": "A"
