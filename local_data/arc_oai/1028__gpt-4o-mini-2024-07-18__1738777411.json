  "steps": [
    "To determine how an atom becomes an ion with a -1 charge, we need to understand what a negative charge means in terms of electrons and protons.",
    "An atom is neutral when it has an equal number of protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged). Therefore, if the atom gains electrons, it will have more negative charges than positive charges, resulting in a negative overall charge.",
    "If an atom gains one electron, it will have one more negative charge than it has positive charges from protons, hence becoming an ion with a -1 charge.",
    "On the other hand, losing an electron would result in a positive charge, while gaining protons would also increase positive charges, and losing protons would decrease the positive charge but not result in a -1 charge."
