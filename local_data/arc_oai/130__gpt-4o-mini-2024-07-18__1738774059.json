  "query": "Question: A geologist conducts an investigation to determine the absolute age of a fossil. She then repeats the procedure three times. Which best explains why she repeated the procedure several times?\n\nChoices:\nA: It helps her develop better procedures.\nB: It improves the accuracy of the results.\nC: She wants all the results to be different.\nD: She has more than one hypothesis to prove.",
  "steps": [
    "The geologist is conducting an investigation to determine the absolute age of a fossil, which typically requires careful measurements and analyses to ensure accuracy.",
    "Repeating the procedure allows for checks on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained from the investigation.",
    "If the results from the multiple trials are similar, it indicates greater accuracy, as any anomalies can be identified and accounted for.",
    "The purpose of repeating the procedure is not to develop better procedures, ensure different results, or have multiple hypotheses; rather, it is to improve confidence in the accuracy of those results."
