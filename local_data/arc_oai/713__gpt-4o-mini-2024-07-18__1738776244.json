  "steps": [
    "The Doppler effect describes how the frequency of waves changes for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. When the source of the waves is moving away from the observer, the waves are stretched.",
    "When electromagnetic waves, such as light, are emitted from a galaxy that is moving away from Earth, the waves will be redshifted. This means that their wavelength will increase and thus their frequency will decrease.",
    "From this understanding, the correct answer must describe a decrease in frequency of the waves reaching Earth from the receding galaxy."
