  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the source of fuels like coal and natural gas.",
    "Both coal and natural gas are fossil fuels, which means they are formed from the remains of ancient, once-living organisms.",
    "Coal is formed from decomposed plant material, while natural gas is primarily formed from the remains of marine organisms that have undergone heat and pressure over millions of years.",
    "The other choices (cold-water oceans, erupting volcanoes, and forest fires) do not directly relate to the formation of fossil fuels."
