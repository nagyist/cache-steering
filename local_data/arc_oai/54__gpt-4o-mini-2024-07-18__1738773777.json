  "query": "Question: Based on their locations in the periodic table, which element has chemical properties most similar to those of calcium, Ca?\n\nChoices:\nA: beryllium, Be\nB: potassium, K\nC: titanium, Ti\nD: yttrium, Y",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify the position of calcium (Ca) in the periodic table. Calcium is located in Group 2, which contains alkaline earth metals.",
    "Next, we recognize that elements in the same group tend to have similar chemical properties due to their similar electron configurations.",
    "Now we look at the choices provided and determine which elements are in the same group (Group 2 or similar groups) as calcium. Beryllium (Be) is also in Group 2.",
    "The other choices - potassium (K), titanium (Ti), and yttrium (Y) - are located in different groups: potassium in Group 1, titanium in Group 4, and yttrium in Group 3.",
    "Since beryllium (Be) is the only element that shares the same group as calcium, it will have the most similar chemical properties."
