  "steps": [
    "Cell differentiation in developing embryos refers to the process by which cells become specialized in structure and function.",
    "This process is influenced by the specific genes that are turned on or off in different cell types during development.",
    "While the presence of genes (Choice A) or the number of copies (Choice B) may have some role, they do not directly dictate differentiation.",
    "The activity of genes (Choice C) determines the specific characteristics of a cell, which is crucial in differentiation.",
    "The proteins produced by active genes (Choice D) are a result of gene activity but do not directly describe the characteristic that results in differentiation."
