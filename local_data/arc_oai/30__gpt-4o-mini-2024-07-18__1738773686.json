  "query": "Question: Heat, light, and sound are all different forms of ___.\n\nChoices:\nA: fuel\nB: energy\nC: matter\nD: electricity",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of heat, light, and sound. They are all phenomena that can be measured and have effects on the physical world.",
    "Next, analyze the properties of the options given. Fuel is a source of energy, but it is not a form of energy itself. Electricity is a type of energy but does not encompass heat, light, and sound comprehensively.",
    "Then, evaluate the choice of matter. Matter refers to substances that have mass and occupy space, which does not apply to heat, light, and sound.",
    "Finally, conclude that heat, light, and sound are indeed forms of energy, as they can be converted and transferred in various ways in physical processes."
