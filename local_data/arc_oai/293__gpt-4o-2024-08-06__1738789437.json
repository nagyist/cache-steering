  "steps": [
    "Oscar is investigating the time it takes for a chick to hatch from an egg. A larger sample size will generally yield more reliable results because it reduces the effect of anomalies or outliers.",
    "Each given choice represents the number of eggs Oscar could use for his investigation. By using more eggs, Oscar can identify the typical incubation period more accurately.",
    "Among the options, Option D (7 eggs) is the largest sample size provided, which should give Oscar the most reliable average time compared to using fewer eggs."
