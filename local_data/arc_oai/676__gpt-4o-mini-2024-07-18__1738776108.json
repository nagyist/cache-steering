  "query": "Question: A reflex can protect the body from harm. Which organ systems work together to produce a reflex?\n\nChoices:\nA: nervous and immune systems\nB: nervous and muscular systems\nC: circulatory and immune systems\nD: circulatory and muscular systems",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which organ systems collaborate to produce a reflex action in the body.",
    "Reflex actions typically involve a stimulus detected by sensory receptors, which send signals through sensory neurons to the central nervous system (CNS), and then motor neurons send signals to effectors, usually muscles, to elicit a response.",
    "This description suggests that the nervous system is crucial for initiating and processing reflex actions, and the muscular system is responsible for carrying out the physical response to the reflex.",
    "Examining the options, the nervous system\u2019s role in sending impulses and the muscular system\u2019s role in responding aligns with option B.",
    "The other options involve systems that do not directly correlate with the mechanism of reflex actions\u2014such as the immune system or circulatory system."
