  "query": "Question: Which of these is a function of all cells?\n\nChoices:\nA: to absorb nutrients and gases from blood\nB: to extract energy from food to sustain life\nC: to produce food using water and carbon dioxide\nD: to give shape and structural support to an organism",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the characteristic that applies to all cells. Functions common to all cells typically relate to their basic survival and metabolic processes.",
    "Option A mentions absorbing nutrients and gases, which is pertinent mostly for specialized cells, such as those in the bloodstream or in certain tissues.",
    "Option B discusses extracting energy from food, which is a fundamental function of all living cells through processes like cellular respiration.",
    "Option C refers specifically to producing food, which predominantly describes the function of plant cells (photosynthesis) and does not apply to all cells (e.g., animal cells).",
    "Option D relates to giving shape and structural support, which is true for many cells but not a universal function as some cell types, like blood cells, do not provide structural support.",
    "Evaluate the options based on their applicability to all cells. Option B, extracting energy from food, is the most universally applicable function across different cell types."
