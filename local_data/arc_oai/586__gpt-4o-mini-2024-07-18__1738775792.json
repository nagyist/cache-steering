  "steps": [
    "The classification of organisms within the plant kingdom typically relies on specific characteristics that differentiate various groups. One significant characteristic that influences classification is the type of vascular tissue present in the plants.",
    "Vascular tissue is crucial for the transport of water and nutrients in plants, distinguishing between non-vascular plants (like mosses) and vascular plants (like ferns and flowering plants).",
    "While other options like photosynthesis, presence of cell walls, and production of oxygen are important for plants, they do not provide clear differentiation between plant groups in the way vascular tissue does."
