  "query": "Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?\n\nChoices:\nA: It has melted.\nB: It has sublimated.\nC: It has evaporated.\nD: It has condensed.",
  "steps": [
    "When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface, the temperature of the air near the surface drops.",
    "If the temperature of the air drops below the freezing point, the water vapor can undergo a direct phase transition without becoming liquid first.",
    "This phase transition from water vapor directly to solid ice is known as deposition.",
    "Deposition is different from condensation, where water vapor turns into liquid water before freezing.",
    "The correct process for forming frost from water vapor is sublimation in reverse, meaning deposition."
