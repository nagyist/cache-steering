  "query": "Question: In pea plants, the allele for smooth peas is dominant (S). If a heterozygous smooth pea plant (Ss) is crossed with a homozygous smooth pea plant (SS), which are the possible genotypes the offspring could have?\n\nChoices:\nA: only SS\nB: only Ss\nC: Ss or SS\nD: ss or SS",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the genotypes of the parent plants. One parent is heterozygous (Ss) and the other is homozygous (SS).",
    "Determine the possible alleles contributed by each parent. The heterozygous parent (Ss) can contribute either an S or an s allele, while the homozygous parent (SS) can only contribute S alleles.",
    "List the potential combinations of alleles for the offspring. \n- If the offspring receives S from the heterozygous parent, the genotype will be SS. \n- If the offspring receives s from the heterozygous parent (which is possible), the genotype will be Ss.",
    "Conclude the possible genotypes of the offspring. The offspring can either be SS or Ss, but not ss since there is no 's' allele from the homozygous parent."
