  "query": "Question: Members of a planning team build a model of a nearby stream and then block the stream to show how it can form a lake. Which is a limitation of the model?\n\nChoices:\nA: showing how a nearby town will avoid flooding\nB: explaining how the lake will be used for recreation\nC: explaining how some of the water can be used for agriculture\nD: showing how the dam will affect the plants and animals in the area",
  "steps": [
    "The model demonstrates how blocking a stream can create a lake but may not address all potential consequences or uses of the lake.",
    "Option A talks about flooding, which the model does not specifically address, but it\u2019s possible that the concept of flooding could be a broader discussion in relation to the model.",
    "Option B discusses recreational use, which is not a focus of the model showing the creation of the lake.",
    "Option C mentions agricultural use of the lake's water, which is another potential use not detailed in the model.",
    "Option D focuses on the ecological impact, such as effects on plants and animals, which a simple model might not adequately represent.",
    "Thus, the limitations of the model are best associated with not adequately explaining ecological impacts, hence supporting D as a potential limitation."

  "solution": "D"
