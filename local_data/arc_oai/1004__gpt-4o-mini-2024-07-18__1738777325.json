    "Mushrooms are a type of fungi that primarily decompose organic materials to obtain nutrients.",
    "They commonly thrive on rotting organisms such as dead plants, wood, and other organic matter.",
    "While water in soil (D) is essential for their growth, it does not serve as a source of food; rather, it helps in the absorption of nutrients.",
    "Sunshine (B) is not a direct food source for mushrooms since they do not photosynthesize.",
    "Minerals in soil (C) are important for some organisms but are not the main food source for mushrooms, which rely on decomposing organic matter."
