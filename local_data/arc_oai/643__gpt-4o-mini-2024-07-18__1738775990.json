  "query": "Question: A child rides a wagon down a hill. Eventually, the wagon comes to a stop. Which is most responsible for causing the wagon to stop?\n\nChoices:\nA: gravity acting on the wagon\nB: friction acting on the wagon\nC: the mass of the wagon\nD: the mass of the child",
  "steps": [
    "The wagon is in motion due to the force of gravity pulling it down the hill.",
    "As the wagon moves, it encounters resistance from the surface it is rolling on, which is known as friction.",
    "Friction opposes the motion of the wagon, and over time, it causes the wagon to slow down and eventually come to a stop.",
    "While gravity provides the initial acceleration down the hill, it is friction that ultimately brings the wagon to a halt."

  "solution": "B"
