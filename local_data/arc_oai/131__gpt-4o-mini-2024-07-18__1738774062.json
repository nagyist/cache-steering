  "steps": [
    "I need to determine which question can be investigated scientifically, meaning it should be able to be tested through observation or experimentation.",
    "Option A refers to predicting the outcome of a lottery, which is random and cannot be investigated scientifically.",
    "Option B asks about the outcome of a football game, which is also unpredictable and influenced by many variables, making it difficult to conduct a scientific investigation.",
    "Option C involves the amount of light needed for plant growth, which can be tested through controlled experiments by measuring growth under different light conditions.",
    "Option D asks about evaluating aesthetics (prettiness of colors) in feathers, which is subjective and not easily quantifiable in a scientific manner."
