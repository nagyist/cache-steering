  "query": "Question: Which of the following is an example of a physical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: lighting a match\nB: breaking a glass\nC: burning of gasoline\nD: rusting of iron",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the definition of a physical change. A physical change is a change that affects one or more physical properties of a substance without altering its chemical composition.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options provided. Option A, lighting a match, is a chemical change because it involves a chemical reaction that produces new substances.",
    "Option B, breaking a glass, is a physical change because it changes the shape and size of the glass, but the glass itself remains chemically the same.",
    "Option C, burning of gasoline, is a chemical change because it produces different substances (like carbon dioxide and water) through combustion.",
    "Option D, rusting of iron, is also a chemical change as it involves the reaction of iron with oxygen to form rust, changing its chemical composition.",
    "Based on this analysis, the only example of a physical change from the provided options is breaking a glass (Option B)."
