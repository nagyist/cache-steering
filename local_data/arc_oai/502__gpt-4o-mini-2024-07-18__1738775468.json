  "query": "Question: A student mixed salt and sugar. Which statement describes the physical properties of salt and sugar after they were mixed?\n\nChoices:\nA: The sugar dissolved the salt.\nB: The salt and sugar changed color.\nC: The sugar and the salt were unchanged.\nD: The salt and sugar formed a new material.",
  "steps": [
    "The question focuses on the physical properties of salt and sugar after being mixed together.",
    "When salt and sugar are mixed, they remain as individual substances and do not chemically change into something new.",
    "Neither salt nor sugar dissolves in this scenario; they can exist in the mixture without altering their intrinsic properties.",
    "Thus, the most accurate statement describing their physical state is that the sugar and the salt were unchanged."
  ],
  "solution": "C"
