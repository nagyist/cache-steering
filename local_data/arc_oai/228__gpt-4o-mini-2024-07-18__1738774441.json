  "query": "Question: Which of the following best explains how stems transport water to other parts of the plant?\n\nChoices:\nA: through a chemical called chlorophyll\nB: by using photosynthesis\nC: through a system of tubes\nD: by converting water to food",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the mechanism by which stems transport water within a plant.",
    "Chlorophyll, mentioned in choice A, is involved in photosynthesis but does not play a role in water transport.",
    "Photosynthesis, referenced in choice B, is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, but it doesn't specifically describe how water is transported.",
    "Choice D states that water is converted to food, which is incorrect as water is mainly used for photosynthesis and not directly converted into food.",
    "Choice C correctly describes that water is transported through a system of tubes, specifically xylem vessels, within the stem of a plant."
