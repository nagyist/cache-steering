  "query": "Question: Which of the following is a similarity 20 between x-ray waves and sound waves?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both transfer energy.\nB: Both require a vacuum.\nC: Both have the same speed.\nD: Both have the same frequency.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's consider the definitions of x-ray waves and sound waves. X-ray waves are electromagnetic waves, while sound waves are mechanical waves.",
    "Next, we assess the characteristics of these waves. X-ray waves can travel through a vacuum since they do not require a medium. In contrast, sound waves require a medium (such as air or water) to propagate.",
    "Now, let's analyze the energy transfer. Both x-ray waves and sound waves can transfer energy; x-ray waves transfer energy through electromagnetic radiation, while sound waves transfer energy through the vibration of particles in a medium.",
    "Next, we examine the speed of these waves. The speed of sound is significantly slower than the speed of light (and therefore x-rays), which travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.",
    "Lastly, we clarify their frequencies. X-ray waves have much higher frequencies than sound waves, making this option incorrect as well."
