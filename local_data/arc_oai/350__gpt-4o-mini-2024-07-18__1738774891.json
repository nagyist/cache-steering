  "steps": [
    "To determine which hypothesis can be easily tested, we need to analyze each option in terms of testability and scientific methodologies.",
    "Option A states that \"The Moon causes high tides.\" This is a well-accepted scientific fact that can be tested and observed but is not presented as a specific hypothesis for testing a particular condition.",
    "Option B asks, \"During which season are the tides the highest?\" This question lacks specificity and does not propose a hypothesis that can be immediately tested.",
    "Option C, \"What is the phase of the Moon when tides are highest?\" is also more of a question rather than a testable hypothesis. It doesn't provide a clear prediction or condition to test.",
    "Option D states, \"When the Moon is full, the tides will be at their highest.\" This is a specific, testable hypothesis because it can be empirically tested by observing tide levels during full moons compared to other moon phases."
