  "query": "Question: A student observes zinc turning from a solid to a liquid in a laboratory investigation. Which statement describes the change in zinc atoms while melting?\n\nChoices:\nA: The mass of the zinc atoms decreased.\nB: The zinc atoms lost their relative fixed position.\nC: The zinc atoms were changed into atoms of another element.\nD: The size of the zinc atoms decreased.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we identify what happens to zinc as it melts. Melting involves a change from a solid to a liquid, which means the zinc atoms are gaining energy and moving more freely.",
    "Next, we consider the arrangement of atoms in a solid compared to a liquid. In a solid state, atoms are arranged in a fixed and orderly structure, while in a liquid state, they lose this fixed arrangement and can move past one another more freely.",
    "Now, we evaluate the provided options based on this understanding. Option A (mass of zinc atoms decreased) can be ruled out because the mass remains the same during a phase change.",
    "Option C (zinc atoms changed into another element) is incorrect as the chemical identity of the material does not change during melting.",
    "Option D (size of zinc atoms decreased) is also incorrect; the size of atoms does not change during a phase transition like melting.",
    "Only option B (the zinc atoms lost their relative fixed position) correctly describes the change that occurs during melting, as the atoms transition from a fixed structure to a fluid state."
