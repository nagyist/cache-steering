  "query": "Question: What can a flower become?\n\nChoices:\nA: a fruit\nB: a leaf\nC: a stem\nD: a branch",
  "steps": [
    "A flower can develop into a fruit after pollination and fertilization occur, as the ovaries of the flower typically mature into fruit.",
    "A flower itself does not become a leaf, as leaves are different structures that arise from the plant's stem.",
    "A flower does not develop into a stem; the stem is already a separate structure that supports the flower.",
    "A flower does not become a branch; branches grow from the plant's main stem, not from the flower."
