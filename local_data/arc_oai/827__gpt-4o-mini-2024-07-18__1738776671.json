  "query": "Question: Which resource when used causes the most pollution?\n\nChoices:\nA: solar\nB: coal\nC: wind\nD: water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate each resource option based on the pollution they generate during their lifecycle, including extraction, production, and use.",
    "Solar energy typically has low pollution levels, mainly associated with the manufacturing of solar panels and their eventual disposal.",
    "Coal, as a fossil fuel, is known to produce significant pollution during both extraction and combustion, including greenhouse gases and particulate matter.",
    "Wind energy is considered one of the cleanest forms of energy, with minimal pollution produced during the manufacturing and operation of wind turbines.",
    "Water, in the context of hydroelectric power, does have some environmental impacts, but it does not produce direct pollution like fossil fuels.",
    "Comparing all the options, coal stands out as the resource that causes the most pollution overall due to its combustion process and the extraction methods involved."
