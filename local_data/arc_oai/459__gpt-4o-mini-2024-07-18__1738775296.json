  "query": "Question: What is a worldwide increase in temperature called?\n\nChoices:\nA: greenhouse effect\nB: global warming\nC: ozone depletion\nD: solar heating",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the topic of the question, which is about an increase in temperature that occurs globally.",
    "Consider the definitions of the choices provided. The term \"greenhouse effect\" refers to the process by which certain gases trap heat in the atmosphere, not a worldwide increase in temperature itself.",
    "Next, evaluate \"global warming.\" This term specifically refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels.",
    "Now, analyze \"ozone depletion.\" This refers to the reduction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere and is not directly related to an increase in temperature across the globe.",
    "Finally, look at \"solar heating.\" This term generally refers to the way sunlight heats the Earth but does not specifically describe a worldwide increase in temperature."
