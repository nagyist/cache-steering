  "query": "Question: While on a field trip to NASA, Felicia saw a short film on materials that make up nebulae. Which topic was most likely presented in the film?\n\nChoices:\nA: asteroid development\nB: stellar formation\nC: planetary orbits\nD: galaxy shapes",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the main subject of the short film Felicia watched, which was about materials that make up nebulae. Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust in space, often associated with star formation.",
    "Next, assess the connection between nebulae and the provided choices. Asteroids (Choice A) are not directly related to nebulae but rather to the remnants left in the solar system. Planetary orbits (Choice C) refer to the paths planets take around stars, which is a different topic. Galaxy shapes (Choice D) involve the structure of entire galaxies, not specifically about nebulae themselves.",
    "Given that stellar formation (Choice B) is closely tied to nebulae, since stars form from the materials found in nebulae, it is logical that this would be the main topic discussed in the film."
