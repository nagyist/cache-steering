  "query": "Question: Which of these statements is most accurate about the Sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: It has an infinite energy supply.\nB: It is near the end of its life cycle.\nC: It is in its infancy in terms of energy consumption.\nD: It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.",
  "steps": [
    "The Sun is currently in the main sequence phase of its life cycle, where it has been for about 4.6 billion years and is expected to remain stable for several billion more years.",
    "Option A states that the Sun has an infinite energy supply, which is incorrect because stars do have a finite lifespan and exhaust their nuclear fuel over time.",
    "Option B suggests that the Sun is near the end of its life cycle, which is misleading because it is actually in a stable phase and has plenty of time left before it becomes a red giant.",
    "Option C says that the Sun is in its infancy in terms of energy consumption. However, given its age, this statement is also inaccurate as the Sun has been consuming energy for billions of years.",
    "Option D claims that the Sun has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy. While it has consumed a significant amount, it\u2019s difficult to quantify that as exactly half, but it\u2019s generally understood that it still has a substantial portion of its hydrogen fuel left."
