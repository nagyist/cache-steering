  "steps": [
    "The vomiting reflex is a response that involves the contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm to force contents from the stomach through the mouth.",
    "It is often triggered by factors such as toxins, irritation in the stomach, or extreme fullness, suggesting that its primary role is protective in nature.",
    "Choice A refers to ridding the body of waste, but the vomiting reflex is more about immediate expulsion rather than waste excretion.",
    "Choice B mentions expelling food with no nutritional value. While this can happen, it's not the primary or defining function of vomiting.",
    "Choice C states that the main function is to empty the stomach of excess food. This could be part of a vomiting episode, but it does not encompass the full range of reasons why vomiting occurs.",
    "Choice D posits that the main function is to remove toxic materials before they can be absorbed by the body. This aligns with the protective nature of vomiting against harmful substances ingested."
