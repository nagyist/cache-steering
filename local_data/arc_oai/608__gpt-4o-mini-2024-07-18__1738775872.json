  "query": "Question: In a comparison of metals to nonmetals, metals tend to have\n\nChoices:\nA: lower melting points and greater conductivity than nonmetals.\nB: lower conductivity and lower density than nonmetals.\nC: higher density and lower melting points than nonmetals.\nD: greater conductivity and higher melting points than nonmetals.",
  "steps": [
    "Metals are generally characterized by their ability to conduct electricity and heat well, while nonmetals are typically poor conductors.",
    "Metals usually have higher melting points compared to nonmetals, which is attributed to the strong metallic bonding present in metals.",
    "Considering density, metals are usually denser than nonmetals because metal atoms tend to be heavier and are packed more closely together in a solid state.",
    "Now, we review the answer choices; only one of them describes metals as having greater conductivity and higher melting points compared to nonmetals."

  "solution": "D"
