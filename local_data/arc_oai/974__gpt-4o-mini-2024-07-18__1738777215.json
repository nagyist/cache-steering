  "steps": [
    "To determine what will most likely increase a plant population, we need to consider factors that positively influence plant growth. Healthy plants require adequate water, sunlight, and stable temperatures.",
    "Option A, strong winds, may damage plants or cause them to lose moisture, which typically does not help increase plant populations.",
    "Option B, freezing temperatures, can be harmful to many plants, particularly non-winter hardy species, potentially reducing their populations.",
    "Option C, fewer days of sunshine, would limit the ability of plants to photosynthesize, which is detrimental to their growth and would likely lead to a decrease in population.",
    "Option D, more days of rain showers, generally provides the necessary water that plants need for growth, which can lead to an increase in plant populations compared to drier conditions."
