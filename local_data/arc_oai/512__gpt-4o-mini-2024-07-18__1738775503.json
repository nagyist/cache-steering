    "Next, we evaluate the choices given to determine which animal is actively preparing for these seasonal changes.",
    "The bat flying at night does not demonstrate preparation for seasonal change; it is simply engaging in its normal nocturnal behavior.",
    "The deer drinking water is also not an indication of preparing for a seasonal change; it is satisfying its immediate need for hydration.",
