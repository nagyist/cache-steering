  "query": "Question: Because water can hold a large amount of heat, which effect do oceans have on nearby land areas?\n\nChoices:\nA: They prevent rapid extreme temperature changes.\nB: They form high-pressure areas that cause magma currents.\nC: They provide the energy that triggers volcanic events.\nD: They lower the freezing point of fresh water.",
  "steps": [
    "Oceans have a high specific heat capacity, meaning they can absorb and store large amounts of heat without experiencing significant temperature changes themselves.",
    "As a result, oceans can moderate the climate of nearby land areas, preventing rapid and extreme temperature changes between day and night and across seasons.",
    "This moderation leads to milder temperatures, which benefits the local ecosystem and human activity."
  ],
  "solution": "A"
