  "query": "Question: Electricity has many uses. Which device is designed to transform electrical energy into useful heat energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: a clock radio\nB: an electric stove\nC: an electric motor\nD: a battery charger",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the purpose of each device listed in the choices.",
    "A clock radio primarily functions to tell the time and play radio broadcasts, not to convert electrical energy into heat.",
    "An electric stove is specifically designed to convert electrical energy into heat for cooking food.",
    "An electric motor transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy to perform work, not heat.",
    "A battery charger converts electrical energy into stored chemical energy in batteries, not heat energy.",
    "Based on the analysis, the device that transforms electrical energy into useful heat energy is the electric stove."
