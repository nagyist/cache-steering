  "query": "Question: Kerry made a simple flashlight. She recorded the following statements in her lab book. Which statement is an inference?\n\nChoices:\nA: The wire was 35 cm long.\nB: The flashlight contained a battery.\nC: The plastic switch was better than the metal switch.\nD: The bulb was lit for 20 minutes before it burned out.",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to understand the definitions of facts and inferences. A fact is a statement that can be empirically verified, while an inference is a conclusion drawn from evidence or reasoning that may not be directly observed.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each statement in the context of whether it can be directly observed (a fact) or if it is a conclusion drawn from observations (an inference).",
    "Statement A (\"The wire was 35 cm long\") presents a specific measurement that can be directly measured, thus it is a fact.",
    "Statement B (\"The flashlight contained a battery\") is a factual observation confirming the presence of a component, eliminating it from being an inference.",
    "Statement C (\"The plastic switch was better than the metal switch\") involves a subjective judgment based on assumptions or experiences, making it an inference.",
    "Statement D (\"The bulb was lit for 20 minutes before it burned out\") involves a specific measurement of time, which can be verified, categorizing it as a fact."
