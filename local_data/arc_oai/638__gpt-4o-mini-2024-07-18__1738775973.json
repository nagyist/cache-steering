  "query": "Question: A student leaves a bucket of water outside on a warm, sunny day. Which process most likely happens to the water in the bucket?\n\nChoices:\nA: melting\nB: freezing\nC: evaporation\nD: condensation",
  "steps": [
    "The bucket of water is left outside on a warm, sunny day, implying that the temperature is higher than normal for water remaining at a solid state.",
    "Given that the temperature is warm, one would not expect the water to freeze, as freezing requires temperatures at or below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).",
    "Melting refers to the transition of a substance from solid to liquid, which is not applicable here since the water is already in liquid form.",
    "Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air cools and turns back into liquid water. However, this process is not the immediate result of leaving a bucket of water outside in warm conditions.",
    "Evaporation is the process where water turns from liquid into vapor, which is highly likely to occur on a warm, sunny day as the heat from the sun increases the water molecules' energy."
