  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand that momentum (p) is calculated using the formula p = mass (m) \u00d7 velocity (v).",
    "Now, we'll calculate the momentum for each choice.",
    "For choice A: p = 0.5 kg \u00d7 1000 m/s = 500 kg\u00b7m/s.",
    "For choice B: p = 1 kg \u00d7 100 m/s = 100 kg\u00b7m/s.",
    "For choice C: p = 10 kg \u00d7 11 m/s = 110 kg\u00b7m/s.",
    "For choice D: p = 100 kg \u00d7 2 m/s = 200 kg\u00b7m/s.",
    "Now we compare the calculated momentum: A = 500 kg\u00b7m/s, B = 100 kg\u00b7m/s, C = 110 kg\u00b7m/s, D = 200 kg\u00b7m/s.",
    "The smallest value of momentum is from choice B with 100 kg\u00b7m/s."
