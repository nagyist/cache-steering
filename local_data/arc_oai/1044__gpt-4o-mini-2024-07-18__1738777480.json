  "query": "Question: An experiment is being conducted to determine the air quality inside a building. In order to come to a conclusion, scientists must gather data. Which of the following would be an excellent source of data from which to draw a conclusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: naked-eye viewing\nB: calculations of air mass\nC: demonstrations of air pressure\nD: measurement of airborne particulates",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an excellent source of data regarding air quality. Therefore, we need to consider what provides quantifiable information about air quality.",
    "Option A, naked-eye viewing, does not provide precise data or reliable measurements; it is subjective and may lead to incorrect conclusions.",
    "Option B, calculations of air mass, while potentially useful, it does not directly measure air quality factors such as pollutants or particulates.",
    "Option C, demonstrations of air pressure, can tell us about atmospheric conditions but does not relate specifically to the quality of the air in terms of contaminants or pollutants.",
    "Option D, measurement of airborne particulates, directly assesses the quality of the air by measuring pollutants and is therefore highly relevant to determining air quality."
