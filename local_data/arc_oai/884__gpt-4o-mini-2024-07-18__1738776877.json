  "query": "Question: A wetland habitat can continue to support the birds and fish that live there if people ___.\n\nChoices:\nA: drain the water away\nB: flood the highest parts of the land\nC: leave the land alone\nD: use the land for planting crops",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what action would help sustain a wetland habitat, we need to consider the requirements of birds and fish that live in these ecosystems. Wetlands rely on balanced water levels to support diverse wildlife.",
    "Draining the water away (choice A) would eliminate the habitat entirely, making it unsustainable for birds and fish. Thus, this option is not viable.",
    "Flooding the highest parts of the land (choice B) would also disrupt the natural balance of the wetland, potentially harming the existing wildlife instead of supporting it. Therefore, this option is also not appropriate.",
    "Using the land for planting crops (choice D) would likely lead to habitat destruction and pollution from agricultural practices, which would not help the wetland ecosystem in supporting its wildlife.",
    "Leaving the land alone (choice C) would allow the natural ecosystem to thrive and maintain the necessary conditions for birds and fish. This option is the most supportive of the wetland habitat."
