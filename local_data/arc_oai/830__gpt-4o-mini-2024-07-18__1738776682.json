  "query": "Question: For a class project, students converted the daily temperatures for the past month from Fahrenheit to Celsius. What is the clearest way for the students to present the information?\n\nChoices:\nA: table\nB: formula\nC: pie chart\nD: line graph",
  "steps": [
    "The students need to present converted temperature data from Fahrenheit to Celsius, which involves numerical values that can be compared.",
    "A table provides a clear and organized way to display temperature values, allowing easy access to exact figures for each day.",
    "A formula is useful for demonstrating how the conversions were done but is not an effective presentation format for viewing multiple data points.",
    "A pie chart is not suitable since it is used for showing proportional relationships among categories, rather than numerical temperature data.",
    "A line graph can show temperature trends over time but might not be as straightforward for presenting individual temperature values for each day."
