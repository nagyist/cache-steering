  "query": "Question: Decomposers are important to the flow of energy in an ecosystem because they\n\nChoices:\nA: are at the top of every food chain.\nB: eat things other organisms do not eat.\nC: make up a large portion of the top layer of the soil.\nD: break organic material into parts that can be reused.",
  "steps": [
    "Firstly, we need to understand the role of decomposers in an ecosystem. They are organisms that break down dead organic material.",
    "Secondly, this decomposition process is crucial as it recycles nutrients back into the soil, making them available for plants and other producers.",
    "Next, we can evaluate the choices regarding their role: \n- Option A suggests they are at the top of every food chain, which is incorrect as decomposers do not occupy the top position.\n- Option B states they eat things other organisms do not eat, but their primary function is breaking down dead matter rather than selectively eating uneaten food.\n- Option C claims they make up a large portion of the top layer of soil, which is not their main impact on energy flow, even though they may contribute to soil composition.\n- Option D accurately describes their role in breaking down organic material into reusable parts, which is essential for energy recycling in ecosystems.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it is clear that option D best represents the importance of decomposers in energy flow within an ecosystem."
