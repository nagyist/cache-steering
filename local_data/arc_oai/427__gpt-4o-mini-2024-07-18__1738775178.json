  "query": "Question: A bowling ball with a mass of 8.0 kg rolls down a bowling lane at 2.0 m/s. What is the momentum of the bowling ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: 4.0 kg x m/s\nB: 6.0 kg x m/s\nC: 10.0 kg x m/s\nD: 16.0 kg x m/s",
  "steps": [
    "To find the momentum of an object, we use the formula: momentum (p) = mass (m) \u00d7 velocity (v).",
    "The mass of the bowling ball is given as 8.0 kg, and the velocity is 2.0 m/s.",
    "Substituting the values into the formula, we calculate: p = 8.0 kg \u00d7 2.0 m/s.",
    "Now, performing the multiplication: 8.0 kg \u00d7 2.0 m/s = 16.0 kg x m/s.",
    "We find that the momentum of the bowling ball is 16.0 kg x m/s."
