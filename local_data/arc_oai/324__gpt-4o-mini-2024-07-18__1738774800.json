  "query": "Question: Bees can see wavelengths of only yellow, blue, and ultraviolet light. Many plant flowers consist of yellow, blue, and ultraviolet markings that are near the center of the flower. Which sentence describes which organisms benefit from this and explains why?\n\nChoices:\nA: Only plants benefit, because bees are unable to reach a food source on the plant.\nB: Only bees benefit, because flowers are damaged by bees.\nC: Neither bees nor plants benefit, because it does not help either to reproduce.\nD: Both bees and plants benefit, because bees find food and plants are aided in reproduction.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which organisms benefit from the relationship between bees and flowering plants, specifically considering the colors that bees can see.",
    "Bees are attracted to flowers that have yellow, blue, and ultraviolet markings, which are visible to them, indicating that they can find food through these colors.",
    "As bees visit flowers to collect nectar, they inadvertently aid in the pollination process, which helps flowers reproduce.",
    "Therefore, both bees gain a food source and plants benefit through pollination and reproduction, indicating a mutualistic relationship."
