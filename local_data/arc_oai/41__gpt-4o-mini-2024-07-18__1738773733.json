  "query": "Question: How is a moth's life cycle most different from an insect that goes through incomplete metamorphosis?\n\nChoices:\nA: It creates a cocoon.\nB: It becomes an adult.\nC: It lays eggs.\nD: It eats leaves.",
  "steps": [
    "First, it's important to identify the life cycle differences between moths and insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis. Moths undergo complete metamorphosis, which involves four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (cocoon), and adult.",
    "Insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis, such as grasshoppers, have three stages: egg, nymph (which resembles an adult but is smaller and lacks wings), and adult. There is no pupal stage in their life cycle.",
    "Given the options, we need to determine what is unique to the moth's life cycle compared to that of insects with incomplete metamorphosis. The creation of a cocoon occurs during the pupal stage of a moth, which does not happen in insects with incomplete metamorphosis.",
    "The other options (B, C, and D) refer to general aspects of life cycles that are not unique to moths specifically. Both types of insects lay eggs (C) and become adults (B) as part of their life cycles, and both may eat leaves (D) depending on their diet."
