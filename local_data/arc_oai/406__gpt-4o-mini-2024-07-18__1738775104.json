  "query": "Question: What best explains why some cooking pans have rubber handles?\n\nChoices:\nA: The rubber in the handles is easy to hold.\nB: The rubber in the handles is a good insulator.\nC: The rubber in the handles keeps the food in the pan hot.\nD: The rubber in the handles keeps the metal in the pan cool.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of handles on cooking pans. They need to be comfortable to hold, especially when the pan is hot.",
    "Next, evaluate the material of the handles. Rubber is known for its grip and insulation properties, which can allow for a more comfortable and safer handling of hot pans.",
    "Now, analyze the choices based on the information gathered. Choice A states that rubber is easy to hold, but that does not explain the use of rubber handles specifically in a cooking context.",
    "Choice B notes that the rubber is a good insulator, which means it can prevent heat from transferring to the handle, making it safe to touch when cooking.",
    "Choice C mentions that the rubber keeps food hot, which is incorrect since the rubber is not in contact with the food and doesn't affect its temperature directly.",
    "Choice D states that rubber keeps the metal cool, which is misleading because while rubber can insulate, it does not keep the metal itself cool\u2014rather, it protects the user from the heat of the metal.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the best explanation for why some cooking pans have rubber handles is that rubber serves as a good insulator, allowing for safe handling."
