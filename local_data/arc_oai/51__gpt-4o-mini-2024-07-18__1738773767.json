  "query": "Question: Rubbing sandpaper on a piece of wood produces what two types of energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: heat and light\nB: sound and heat\nC: light and electricity\nD: electricity and sound",
  "steps": [
    "Rubbing sandpaper on wood creates friction, which generates energy through the interaction between the two surfaces.",
    "This friction typically produces heat energy due to the resistance encountered while sandpaper moves against the wood.",
    "Additionally, the action of rubbing can create sound energy as the wood and sandpaper move past each other, producing noise.",
    "The other options mentioned (light and electricity) are not typically produced in this physical action on wood with sandpaper."

  "solution": "B"
