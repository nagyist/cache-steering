  "query": "Question: Read the description of the experiment below to answer the question. One hundred pea seeds were put in petri dishes and covered with wet paper towels. The petri dishes were then put inside black plastic bags. Half of them were placed in an incubator set to 10\u00b0C. The remaining half were placed in an incubator set to 30\u00b0C. This experiment was most likely designed to study the effect of which variable on the germination of pea seeds?\n\nChoices:\nA: temperature\nB: water\nC: light\nD: seed type",
  "steps": [
    "The experiment involves two groups of pea seeds being incubated at different temperatures (10\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C).",
    "The objective of the experiment appears to be to observe how varying temperatures affect the germination of the seeds.",
    "The setup indicates that other factors like water and light are controlled: the seeds are kept moist with paper towels and are placed in black plastic bags, which reduce light exposure.",
    "Since the only variable being altered between the two groups is temperature, it is logical to conclude that this is the primary variable under investigation."
