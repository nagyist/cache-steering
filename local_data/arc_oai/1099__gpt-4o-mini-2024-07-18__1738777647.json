  "query": "Question: Some power plants release heated water into rivers. This practice adds thermal energy to the river that most likely\n\nChoices:\nA: increases the amount of nutrients in the river.\nB: provides a better environment for native organisms to grow.\nC: keeps the river at balance with nature.\nD: threatens the existence of aquatic organisms.",
  "steps": [
    "Heated water released into rivers increases the overall temperature of the water.",
    "Higher temperatures can negatively affect the dissolved oxygen levels in the water, which is critical for most aquatic organisms.",
    "The increase in thermal energy can lead to a disruption of the natural habitat and affect the organisms that are not adapted to higher temperatures.",
    "Consequently, this practice can threaten the survival of sensitive aquatic species, leading to a decline in biodiversity."

  "solution": "D"
