    "Gravitational attraction between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them.",
    "Since the distance is equal for all pairs, we concentrate on the masses of the objects.",
    "Among the options given, refrigerators, bowling balls, and school buses, school buses have the highest mass.",
    "Therefore, the greatest gravitational attraction will be between the two objects with the largest mass: school buses."
