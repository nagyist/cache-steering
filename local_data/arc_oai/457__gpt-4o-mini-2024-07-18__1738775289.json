  "query": "Question: Which action best models the motion of an arm at the elbow joint?\n\nChoices:\nA: opening a drawer\nB: slicing an apple\nC: closing a car door\nD: pushing a wheelbarrow",
  "steps": [
    "The elbow joint functions primarily as a hinge joint, allowing for flexion and extension. Thus, any action that mimics this type of movement would be a suitable representation of elbow motion.",
    "Out of the provided choices, we need to analyze which action resembles the bending and straightening of the arm at the elbow joint.",
    "Opening a drawer primarily involves horizontal movement and does not effectively represent the motion of an elbow.",
    "Slicing an apple involves a downward cutting motion and does not accurately model the typical hinge action of the elbow joint.",
    "Closing a car door generally involves a motion that can be likened to flexion (as you bend your arm to push the door closed) and extension when you pull back or rest.",
    "Pushing a wheelbarrow involves using the arms and weight but is more about propelling forward rather than a direct hinge-like movement of the elbow.",
    "Among all the options analyzed, closing a car door best represents the action of bending and straightening at the elbow joint due to the flexion and extension involved in the action."
