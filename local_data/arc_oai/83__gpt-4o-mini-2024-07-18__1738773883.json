  "query": "Question: What do earthquakes tell scientists about the history of the planet?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth\u2019s climate is constantly changing.\nB: The continents of Earth are continually moving.\nC: Dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago.\nD: The oceans are much deeper today than millions years ago.",
  "steps": [
    "Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates, which indicates that the continents are not static but are constantly shifting due to geological forces.",
    "Studying earthquake patterns and the activity of faults can provide insights into the historical movement of these tectonic plates and the configuration of continents over geological time.",
    "Thus, earthquakes inform scientists about processes like continental drift and the evolution of the Earth\u2019s surface over millions of years."
