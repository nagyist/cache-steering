  "query": "Question: Some nonnative plants can adapt to their environments more quickly than some native plants or crops can. Which adaptation would least likely help a nonnative plant to survive in a new environment?\n\nChoices:\nA: having a large number of seeds\nB: having a resistance to herbicides\nC: having roots that develop rapidly\nD: having leaves that form at a slow rate",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which adaptation would be least beneficial for a nonnative plant trying to survive in a new environment.",
    "Having a large number of seeds (choice A) would typically help in spreading and establishing the plant in a new area, which is advantageous for survival.",
    "Having resistance to herbicides (choice B) is also a crucial adaptation as it allows the plant to survive even in environments where herbicides are used, thus increasing its chance of survival.",
    "Having roots that develop rapidly (choice C) would aid in accessing water and nutrients quickly, which is essential for establishing the plant in a new habitat.",
    "Having leaves that form at a slow rate (choice D) would likely hinder the plant\u2019s ability to photosynthesize effectively, making it less competitive in a new environment where it needs to grow quickly and establish itself."

  "solution": "D"
