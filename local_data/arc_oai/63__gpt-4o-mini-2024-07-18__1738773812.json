  "query": "Question: Which of these is an example of liquid water?\n\nChoices:\nA: Frost\nB: Ice\nC: Rain\nD: Steam",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify what constitutes liquid water. Liquid water is the state of water that is not solid (ice) or gas (steam).",
    "Next, we analyze the choices given. Frost is the formation of ice crystals and therefore is not liquid water.",
    "Ice is the solid state of water, so it does not qualify as liquid water.",
    "Steam is the gaseous state of water, meaning it is also not liquid water.",
    "Rain is the form of liquid water that falls from the atmosphere and is not solid or gas, so it qualifies as liquid water."
