  "query": "Question: If 100 grams of vinegar and 5 grams of baking soda are poured in a container, a small amount of gas will be produced. What will the final mass of the products be if the gas is trapped in the container?\n\nChoices:\nA: 100 grams\nB: 104 grams\nC: 105 grams\nD: 110 grams",
  "steps": [
    "The initial mass of the reactants is the sum of the mass of vinegar and baking soda, which is 100 grams (vinegar) + 5 grams (baking soda) = 105 grams.",
    "When vinegar and baking soda react, they produce carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. The mass of the gas produced does not leave the container, as it is trapped.",
    "Since the gas is trapped in the container, the total mass of the products will still equal the total mass of the reactants, which was calculated to be 105 grams."
