  "steps": [
    "When mercury changes state from liquid to solid, it undergoes a process known as freezing or solidification.",
    "During the freezing process, the kinetic energy of the atoms decreases, as they lose energy and begin to arrange themselves in a more fixed structure.",
    "As the kinetic energy decreases, the atoms move closer together compared to their state in the liquid phase, where they are more spread out and in constant motion."

  "solution": "A"
