  "query": "Question: A tuna is an ocean fish that is well adapted to catching small, fast-moving prey. Which of the following adaptations most helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey?\n\nChoices:\nA: large fins\nB: sharp teeth\nC: small gills\nD: tough scales",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify which adaptation is most relevant to swimming speed.",
    "Large fins can provide propulsion and stability in the water, which is crucial for fast swimming.",
    "Sharp teeth are important for capturing and holding onto prey but do not directly contribute to swimming speed.",
    "Small gills are related to respiration and not directly related to speed in swimming.",
    "Tough scales can protect the fish but are not primarily an adaptation for swimming speed.",
    "Among the options, large fins are the most significant adaptation for a tuna's ability to swim fast."
