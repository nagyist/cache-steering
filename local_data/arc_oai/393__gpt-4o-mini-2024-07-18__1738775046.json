  "query": "Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between the total amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold and the temperature of the atmosphere?\n\nChoices:\nA: The amount of water vapor is not related to atmospheric temperature.\nB: The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature increases.\nC: The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature decreases.\nD: The amount of water vapor decreases as the atmospheric temperature increases.",
  "steps": [
    "To understand the relationship between water vapor and atmospheric temperature, I recall that warm air can hold more moisture compared to cold air.",
    "As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the air can hold more water vapor, thereby increasing the total amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere.",
    "This leads me to conclude that with higher temperatures, there is a direct relationship with an increase in water vapor."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
