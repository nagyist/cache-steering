  "query": "Question: Chris left a glass of water on a windowsill. When he looked at the glass a few days later, some of the water had evaporated. Which of the following best describes what happened to the particles of water that evaporated?\n\nChoices:\nA: They became larger in size.\nB: They spread out into the air.\nC: They were absorbed by the glass.\nD: They passed through the glass into the air.",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves the process of evaporation, where water transitions from a liquid state to a gaseous state.",
    "During evaporation, the particles of water gain energy and move faster, allowing them to break free from the liquid and enter the air.",
    "Looking at the choices, option A is incorrect because the size of the water particles does not increase; they transition into gas form.",
    "Option C is incorrect because the water particles did not get absorbed by the glass; they transitioned into the air.",
    "Option D suggests that the particles passed through the glass, which is misleading since water evaporates into the air rather than passing through the glass itself.",
    "Therefore, option B correctly describes that the evaporated water particles spread out into the air as vapor."

  "solution": "B"
