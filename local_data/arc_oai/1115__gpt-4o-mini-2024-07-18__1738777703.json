  "query": "Question: The skin is the largest organ in the human body. Why is skin considered to be an organ?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is made of cells.\nB: It acts as a barrier.\nC: It is made of tissues.\nD: It is part of an organism.",
  "steps": [
    "The definition of an organ includes being composed of tissues that work together to perform specific functions.",
    "Skin is indeed made up of multiple tissues, including epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and nervous tissue, which collectively work to protect the body, regulate temperature, and provide sensory information.",
    "While skin acts as a barrier (choice B), the reason it is classified as an organ is primarily because it is made of tissues (choice C) that perform coordinated functions as a unit.",
    "Choice A (it is made of cells) is too broad, as all organs are made of cells. Choice D (it is part of an organism) does not directly explain why skin is considered an organ."
