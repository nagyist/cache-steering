  "query": "Question: The weathering of landforms depends on various factors. Which area would most likely have the fastest rate of chemical weathering?\n\nChoices:\nA: freezing and dry regions\nB: warm and moist regions\nC: cool and humid regions\nD: hot and dry regions",
  "steps": [
    "Chemical weathering is most effective in conditions that are warm and moist because water is a key component in the chemical reactions that weather rocks.",
    "Freezing and dry regions (Choice A) are not conducive to chemical weathering due to the lack of moisture and colder temperatures, which slow down weathering processes.",
    "Cool and humid regions (Choice C) can have some chemical weathering, but not as fast as warm and moist regions due to lower temperatures.",
    "Hot and dry regions (Choice D) also experience low rates of chemical weathering because of the lack of moisture, despite the high temperatures."
