  "steps": [
    "To determine the most reliable way to get unbiased results in a controlled experiment, we need to understand what each option entails and how it contributes to reliability and avoiding biases.",
    "Option A suggests using more than one control group. While this can provide additional data points, it doesn't directly address biases in the experimental procedure itself.",
    "Option B, trying a different experimental group, could introduce variability rather than control, which would make it difficult to obtain unbiased results.",
    "Option C, changing the hypothesis if it is incorrect, relates more to adapting the scientific method than ensuring an unbiased result. It doesn't help with the reliability of the current experimental setup.",
    "Option D states to repeat the procedure exactly the same each time, which emphasizes consistency in the experimental conditions, thereby minimizing variability and potential biases in the results."
