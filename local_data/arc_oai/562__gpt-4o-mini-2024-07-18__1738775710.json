  "steps": [
    "We need to identify the options and their corresponding actions to determine if they lead to a chemical change.",
    "Option A: A student smells a flower does not involve a chemical change; it is just the perception of odor.",
    "Option B: A teacher lights a candle involves burning the candle, which results in combustion and a chemical change as wax transforms into gases and other products.",
    "Option C: A student colors a paper blue is a physical change, as the paper's color is altered without changing its chemical composition.",
    "Option D: A teacher feels a rough cloth is another physical observation; it does not involve a chemical change.",
    "Among all the options considered, only Option B clearly indicates that a chemical change has taken place."
