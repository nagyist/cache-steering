  "query": "Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\n\nChoices:\nA: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\nB: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\nC: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\nD: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool",
  "steps": [
    "The current situation on the island is that sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, but sheep with light wool have been increasing in number in the absence of natural predators.",
    "When a predator is introduced to the island, the traits that improve survival against predation become more important for the sheep's survival.",
    "The sheep with dark wool, being larger and stronger, may have an advantage in defending themselves against predators or escaping them. This could help them survive better than the sheep with light wool when faced with predation.",
    "If the sheep with dark wool have a survival advantage due to their larger size and strength, it is likely that the sheep with light wool would be more susceptible to predation.",
    "Therefore, the first change to occur would likely be a decrease in the population of the sheep with light wool, as they are less well-suited to survive the new threat posed by predators."
