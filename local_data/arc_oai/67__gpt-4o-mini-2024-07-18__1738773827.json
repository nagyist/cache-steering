  "query": "Question: What adaptation is necessary in intertidal ecosystems but not in reef ecosystems?\n\nChoices:\nA: the ability to live in salt water\nB: the ability to use oxygen in respiration\nC: the ability to cope with daily dry periods\nD: the ability to blend into the surroundings",
  "steps": [
    "Intertidal ecosystems experience significant changes in water levels due to tides, which creates both wet and dry periods.",
    "Reef ecosystems, being submerged most of the time, do not experience these daily dry periods.",
    "An adaptation necessary for organisms in intertidal zones is the ability to cope with these daily dry periods to survive when exposed to air.",
    "Other adaptations mentioned in the choices, such as living in salt water or using oxygen, are important for both intertidal and reef systems.",
    "Thus, the unique adaptation required in intertidal ecosystems but not in reef ecosystems is the ability to cope with daily dry periods."
