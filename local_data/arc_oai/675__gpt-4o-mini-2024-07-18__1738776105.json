  "query": "Question: Which of the following structures is not present in animal cells?\n\nChoices:\nA: cell membrane\nB: cell wall\nC: mitochondrion\nD: nucleus",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's recall the basic structures found in animal cells. We know that animal cells have a cell membrane, mitochondria, and a nucleus.",
    "Next, we need to identify the structures that are typically absent in animal cells. A cell wall is a rigid layer found in plant cells, fungi, and bacteria, but not in animal cells.",
    "Now, let's analyze the options provided. Option A refers to the cell membrane, which is present in animal cells. Option C refers to mitochondria, which provide energy and are also present in animal cells. Option D refers to the nucleus, which contains the cell's genetic material and is present in animal cells.",
    "Therefore, the only structure listed that is not found in animal cells is the cell wall, which is option B."

  "solution": "B"
