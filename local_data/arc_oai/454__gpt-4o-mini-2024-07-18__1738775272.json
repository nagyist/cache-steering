  "query": "Question: In December, one side of Earth will receive less energy from the Sun than the other side. Which statement best explains this fact?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth rotates on its axis.\nB: Earth is tilted on its axis.\nC: Sunlight traveling to Earth reflects off the Moon.\nD: Sunlight traveling to Earth is blocked by Moon.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about the distribution of solar energy received by different sides of Earth in December, which suggests a relationship with Earth's orientation to the Sun.",
    "Option A states that \"Earth rotates on its axis.\" While it's true that Earth does rotate, this does not explain the variation in solar energy distribution in terms of time of year.",
    "Option B states that \"Earth is tilted on its axis.\" This tilt is responsible for the changing seasons and explains why one hemisphere receives more sunlight than the other during different times of the year.",
    "Option C suggests that \"Sunlight traveling to Earth reflects off the Moon.\" This is incorrect because the Moon doesn't reflect sunlight in a way that alters the sunlight distribution significantly on Earth.",
    "Option D claims that \"Sunlight traveling to Earth is blocked by the Moon.\" While the Moon can cause eclipses, it does not block sunlight in a way that significantly affects the overall distribution on a global scale.",
    "The best explanation for one side of Earth receiving less solar energy in December is indeed the axial tilt of Earth, which is responsible for seasonal variations in sunlight exposure."
