  "query": "Question: Which of the following is found farthest from the center of an atom?\n\nChoices:\nA: nucleus\nB: proton\nC: neutron\nD: electron",
  "steps": [
    "The center of an atom is the nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons. Thus, options A, B, and C (nucleus, proton, neutron) are all found at the center of the atom.",
    "Electrons, on the other hand, are found in the electron cloud that surrounds the nucleus. This means electrons are more distant from the center of the atom compared to protons and neutrons.",
    "Since electrons are not part of the nucleus and occupy regions around it, they are found farthest from the center of the atom."

  "solution": "D"
