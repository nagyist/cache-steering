  "query": "Question: The Milky Way is a part of 30 or more galaxies called the Local Group. Which would be the most likely reason these galaxies are considered to be part of the Local Group?\n\nChoices:\nA: They are all the same type of galaxy.\nB: They all have the same number of stars.\nC: They are all attracted to each other by gravity.\nD: They can all be seen without the aid of a telescope.",
  "steps": [
    "The Local Group consists of a collection of galaxies that are gravitationally bound to each other.",
    "If galaxies are part of the same gravitational group, they would be attracted to each other by gravity.",
    "The other options either do not necessarily apply to all galaxies in the Local Group (same type, same number of stars, visibility without a telescope) or are not defining characteristics of why they are grouped together."
