  "query": "Question: Plants use nutrients found in soil. Which of these can break down in soil and become nutrients?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: water\nC: leaves\nD: sunlight",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what materials can decompose in soil and contribute to nutrient cycles. Organic matter tends to break down and enrich the soil.",
    "Next, evaluate the options given to determine which can decompose. Air, water, and sunlight cannot decompose or provide nutrients directly.",
    "Leaves are organic materials that fall from trees and plants, and they can decompose in the soil, breaking down into nutrients that enrich the soil."
