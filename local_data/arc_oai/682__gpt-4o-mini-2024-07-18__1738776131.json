  "query": "Question: The water cycle describes the movement of the water of Earth. About 96% of the water of Earth is the salt water found in the oceans while the remaining 4% is fresh water. Where would the majority of the freshwater on Earth be found?\n\nChoices:\nA: groundwater and aquifers\nB: swamps and wetlands\nC: ice caps and glaciers\nD: lakes and rivers",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking where the majority of Earth's freshwater is located. We know that freshwater makes up about 4% of the total water on Earth.",
    "Out of this 4% of freshwater, various sources contain different proportions. Ice caps and glaciers are known to hold a significant portion of the world's freshwater compared to other sources.",
    "When comparing the estimated percentages, approximately 68.7% of the Earth's freshwater is stored in ice caps and glaciers, while groundwater and aquifers account for about 30.1%. The remaining freshwater sources like swamps and wetlands and lakes and rivers contain much less.",
    "Since the question specifically asks for where the majority is found, the choice that represents the highest percentage of freshwater storage is ice caps and glaciers."
