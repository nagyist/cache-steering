  "query": "Question: A scientist investigated the effect of workplace stress on heart disease in humans. Men of various ages were divided into two groups based on whether they described their work as very stressful or not very stressful. During the one year investigation the scientist monitored the heart health of each man. What was the bias in this investigation?\n\nChoices:\nA: The investigation only lasted one year.\nB: The only organ studied was the heart.\nC: The investigation tested only men.\nD: The age of the participants varied.",
  "steps": [
    "The investigation involved only male participants, which means it does not consider how workplace stress might affect women, leading to gender bias in the findings.",
    "The other choices do not indicate a significant bias in the investigation. For instance, the duration of one year (A) is not a bias but simply a time frame. Similarly, focusing on the heart (B) is standard for a study on heart disease, and varying ages (D) can actually help make the findings more relevant across different age groups.",
    "Therefore, the most significant issue in terms of bias is that only men were included in the study. This limits the applicability of the research conclusions to the general population, which includes both men and women."
