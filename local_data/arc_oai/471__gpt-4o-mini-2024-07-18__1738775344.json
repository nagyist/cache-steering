  "query": "Question: What structure can be found in both a virus and a cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: nucleic acid chain\nB: Golgi apparatus\nC: endoplasmic reticulum\nD: nuclear membrane",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze what both viruses and cells are composed of. Cells are the basic units of life, while viruses are considered to be at the edge of living and non-living entities.",
    "Next, we need to identify components that are common to both. Viruses contain nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) within their structure, which is essential for their replication. Cells also contain nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) for various functions, including genetic information storage and protein synthesis.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the other options given. The Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane are all structures found within eukaryotic cells but are not present in viruses. Therefore, they cannot be the correct answer.",
    "Having established that both viruses and cells contain nucleic acids, we can conclude that this is the common structure shared by both."
