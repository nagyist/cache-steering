  "query": "Question: A person catches and measures a large fish called a halibut. She thinks that this halibut is above average in size. To help support her thinking, it would be most helpful to measure\n\nChoices:\nA: many types of fish.\nB: many fish of the same type.\nC: fish from the same location.\nD: fish during a different season.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine if the halibut caught is above average in size, the measurement should be made against a relevant comparison group.",
    "Comparing the halibut to many fish of the same type (specifically other halibut) would provide the most accurate assessment of whether it is larger than average for that species.",
    "Measuring many types of fish would not be helpful since size averages can vary greatly among different species.",
    "Measuring fish from the same location might not be relevant to determining if this specific halibut is larger than average because location alone doesn't account for the size differences within the species.",
    "Measuring fish during a different season could introduce variability due to factors like growth patterns and spawning behavior, which may not effectively assess the size of the caught halibut against its species average."
