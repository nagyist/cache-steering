  "query": "Question: How many basic units of information in a DNA molecule are required to encode a single amino acid?\n\nChoices:\nA: 1\nB: 2\nC: 3\nD: 4",
  "steps": [
    "In a DNA molecule, the basic units of information are called nucleotides, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The DNA sequences are comprised of four different nucleotides.",
    "Each amino acid is encoded by a specific sequence of nucleotides known as a codon. A codon consists of three consecutive nucleotides.",
    "Since each amino acid requires one codon for encoding, and each codon is made up of three nucleotides, we can determine that three nucleotides are needed to encode a single amino acid."
