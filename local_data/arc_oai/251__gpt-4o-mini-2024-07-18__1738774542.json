  "steps": [
    "To determine the number of wolves that can live in an area, one must consider the availability of resources that support their population.",
    "Wolves are carnivorous animals and rely on the availability of prey for food. Therefore, the amount of food available is a critical factor influencing their population.",
    "The amount of snow or number of trees in the area does not directly relate to how many wolves can survive there, as both may have indirect effects but do not quantify resources that wolves need directly.",
    "Among the given options, the most relevant factor that would determine the number of wolves in a given area is the amount of food available."
