  "query": "Question: The students observed a large crack found in a boulder with a tree growing out of it. Which process were the students observing?\n\nChoices:\nA: oxidizing\nB: deposition\nC: weathering\nD: decomposition",
  "steps": [
    "The presence of a large crack in a boulder indicates physical changes in the rock structure, which suggests that the rock is breaking down or being altered in some way.",
    "The fact that there is a tree growing out of the crack suggests that plants are involved, which often contributes to the physical breakdown of rocks as roots grow and expand.",
    "This process of rocks breaking down due to environmental conditions, such as the growth of vegetation or temperature changes, falls under the category of weathering."
