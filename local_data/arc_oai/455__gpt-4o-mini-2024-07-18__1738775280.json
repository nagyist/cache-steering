  "query": "Question: Fossils of the fern Glossopteris have been found in the continents of South America, Africa, Asia, and Antarctica. The seeds of this fern were too small to be dispersed by wind. Which is best indicated by the presence of Glossopteris fossils on these continents?\n\nChoices:\nA: Glossopteris was versatile enough to adapt to all climates.\nB: The landmasses were joined together in pre-historic times.\nC: Fossils were much better preserved in the southern continents.\nD: The northern climate regions were not suitable for plant growth.",
  "steps": [
    "The presence of the same species of plant, Glossopteris, on different continents suggests that they must have been connected at some point in the past since the seeds could not be easily dispersed by wind.",
    "If the continents were once joined, it would have allowed for the diffusion of plant life over a continuous landmass, explaining the fossil distribution.",
    "The other options do not adequately account for the limited seed dispersal capability of Glossopteris, making choice B the most plausible explanation for the observed fossil distribution."

  "solution": "B"
