  "query": "Question: In which two parts of the water cycle does water absorb energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: condensation and evaporation\nB: precipitation and condensation\nC: melting and evaporation\nD: evaporation and precipitation",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the processes in the water cycle where energy is absorbed by water. Evaporation is a process where water absorbs energy to change from liquid to vapor.",
    "Next, consider other processes in the water cycle. Melting also involves water absorbing energy as ice turns into liquid water.",
    "Now, assess the options: \n- Option A (condensation and evaporation) includes condensation, which releases energy, not absorbs it. \n- Option B (precipitation and condensation) also includes condensation, which releases energy. \n- Option C (melting and evaporation) includes both processes that absorb energy. \n- Option D (evaporation and precipitation) includes evaporation, which absorbs energy, but precipitation does not."
