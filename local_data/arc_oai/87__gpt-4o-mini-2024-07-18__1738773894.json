  "query": "Question: Which geologic process most likely led to the uplifting of the Rocky Mountains?\n\nChoices:\nA: glaciation\nB: flooding\nC: faulting\nD: erosion",
  "steps": [
    "The Rocky Mountains are a major mountain range formed primarily through tectonic processes.",
    "Uplifting of mountains is typically associated with tectonic activities such as faulting, where the Earth's crust is broken and pushed upwards.",
    "Glaciation, flooding, and erosion can impact landscapes, but they do not primarily cause the uplifting of rock formations to the extent seen in mountain building.",
    "Given that the question asks specifically about the process leading to the uplifting of the Rocky Mountains, faulting is the most relevant choice."
