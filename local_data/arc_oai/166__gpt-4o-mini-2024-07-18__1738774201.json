  "query": "Question: Which is most likely needed when describing the change in position of an object?\n\nChoices:\nA: initial speed\nB: direction change\nC: reference point\nD: constant rate",
  "steps": [
    "To describe the change in position of an object, it is important to understand where it started, which is referred to as the initial position. This requires a reference point in relation to which movement is measured.",
    "While speed can affect the rate of change of position, it is not essential for describing how the position changes in terms of direction or distance alone.",
    "Direction change can be important, but without a reference point, it would be hard to quantify or contextualize that change.",
    "Having a constant rate could describe movement, but it does not inherently describe the change in position itself."
