  "query": "Question: Which of these methods of energy resource acquisition has the least effect on the lithosphere?\n\nChoices:\nA: surface mining for uranium\nB: pumping oil from under water\nC: harvesting wood by selective cutting\nD: collecting natural gas from old oil wells",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the effects of surface mining for uranium. This method involves removing large amounts of soil and rock, which significantly alters the landscape and can lead to erosion and habitat destruction, thus having a substantial effect on the lithosphere.",
    "Next, examine the impact of pumping oil from underwater. While this does not directly affect the land surface, it can still have geological implications such as subsidence and can affect sedimentation patterns, along with potential oil spills impacting marine ecosystems.",
    "Now, evaluate harvesting wood by selective cutting. This method involves removing only certain trees while preserving the overall ecosystem. Although it alters the landscape to some extent, it generally has a lesser impact on the lithosphere compared to more invasive mining practices.",
    "Lastly, look at collecting natural gas from old oil wells. This method typically involves using existing infrastructure, which minimizes the disturbance to the surrounding land. However, it can still pose risks such as gas leaks and land subsidence.",
    "Considering all methods, selective cutting of wood seems to have the least invasive impact on the lithosphere since it maintains a degree of ecological integrity compared to the other methods which involve significant land alteration or have direct consequences on geological structures."
