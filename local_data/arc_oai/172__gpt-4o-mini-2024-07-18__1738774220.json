  "steps": [
    "The development of a fertilized egg into a specific type of organism like a toad, snake, or lizard is primarily influenced by its genetic composition.",
    "The genes contained within the egg determine the biological characteristics and developmental pathways of the organism.",
    "Since all three options (toad, snake, lizard) come from different lineages with distinct genetic traits, the genes must dictate which type of animal the fertilized egg will develop into."
