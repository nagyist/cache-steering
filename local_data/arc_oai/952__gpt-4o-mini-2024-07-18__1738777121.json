  "query": "Question: Two balls rolled down two identical inclined planes. The balls were exactly the same mass and size, but one ball rolled down the inclined plane faster. Identify a possible reason that one ball rolled faster than the other ball.\n\nChoices:\nA: One ball was red and the other ball was blue.\nB: One ball was new and the other ball was old.\nC: One ball was shiny and the other ball was dull.\nD: One ball was sticky and the other ball was smooth.",
  "steps": [
    "Both balls have the same mass and size, so color (red vs. blue) does not affect their rolling speed.",
    "The condition of being new versus old (A vs. B) may not significantly impact the rolling speed unless the old ball has noticeable wear that affects its performance.",
    "Surface texture can influence how quickly an object rolls down an incline, as a smooth surface reduces friction better than a sticky one.",
    "A shiny ball may reflect light but it would not necessarily roll faster due to that property compared to a dull ball.",
    "Considering friction and overall surface interaction, the stickiness of one ball compared to the smoothness of the other is a likely reason for the difference in rolling speed."
