  "query": "Question: Steel cans are separated from aluminum cans in a recycling center. Which of the following is the best way the recycling center can separate the steel cans from the aluminum cans?\n\nChoices:\nA: sort the cans by size\nB: put the cans in water\nC: cool the cans to a low temperature\nD: put the cans under an electromagnet",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify a distinguishing property between steel and aluminum. Steel is magnetic, while aluminum is not.",
    "Next, we consider the options provided. Sorting by size does not differentiate materials based on their magnetic properties.",
    "Putting the cans in water will not differentiate them based on their material since both types of cans will float or sink similarly.",
    "Cooling the cans to a low temperature may not effectively separate them since both materials would likely respond similarly to temperature changes.",
    "Using an electromagnet takes advantage of the magnetic property of steel, allowing the recycling center to effectively separate steel cans from aluminum cans."

  "solution": "D"
