  "query": "Question: Evidence indicates that the magnetic field of Earth has reversed direction many times throughout history. After a magnetic reversal, which would most likely be affected?\n\nChoices:\nA: the length and severity of seasons\nB: the formation of new tectonic plates\nC: the direction of rotation of Earth on the axis\nD: the alignment of minerals in newly formed crust",
  "steps": [
    "The question mentions magnetic reversals, which are changes in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field orientation. This primarily affects the magnetic properties of materials and processes related to them.",
    "Option D refers to the alignment of minerals in newly formed crust, which can be influenced by the magnetic field during the cooling of magma and solidification of rocks. This implies that after a magnetic reversal, the orientation of iron-bearing minerals in the crust would change to align with the new magnetic field direction.",
    "Options A, B, and C talk about global phenomena that are not directly influenced by the magnetic field itself. The length and severity of seasons (A) are determined by the tilt of the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit around the Sun, while the formation of tectonic plates (B) and direction of rotation (C) are governed by geological and physical processes unrelated to the magnetic field."
