  "query": "Question: Which change will occur in the wire of an electrical circuit that is working properly?\n\nChoices:\nA: The wire will become warmer.\nB: The wire will lose some of its mass.\nC: The wire will form an electric field.\nD: The wire will develop a new crystal structure.",
  "steps": [
    "In an electrical circuit, current passes through the wire and can cause a resistance, which often leads to the generation of heat.",
    "As the wire conducts electricity, the movement of electrons generates thermal energy, making the wire warmer.",
    "While a wire can produce an electric field when current flows through it, it does not typically lead to a permanent change in the electric field itself due to standard operating conditions.",
    "The wire does not lose mass in normal operation; it maintains its physical integrity unless subjected to extreme conditions.",
    "Moreover, the wire does not undergo any structural changes, such as forming a new crystal structure under normal electrical circuit conditions."
