  "query": "Question: Ice water is poured into four cups made of different materials. The cup made of which material will be the coldest to touch after one minute?\n\nChoices:\nA: foam\nB: glass\nC: metal\nD: plastic",
  "steps": [
    "The thermal conductivity of materials determines how quickly they can transfer heat. Metals generally have high thermal conductivity, allowing them to quickly absorb heat from their surroundings, making them feel colder to the touch.",
    "Foam and plastic are known for their insulating properties, meaning they do not conduct heat well and therefore will not feel particularly cold to the touch.",
    "Glass, while it has higher thermal conductivity than foam and plastic, still does not conduct heat as quickly as metal.",
    "After one minute, the metal cup is likely to have absorbed more heat from the hand and might feel colder compared to the foam, glass, or plastic cups, even though it warms up quickly."
