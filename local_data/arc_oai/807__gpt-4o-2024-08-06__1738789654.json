  "query": "Question: In which way are rainforests and coral reefs different from ecosystems with few species?\n\nChoices:\nA: There are more prey than predators.\nB: The food web is more stable and lasting.\nC: Organisms often must compete for food.\nD: Plant populations are the primary producers.",
  "steps": [
    "Rainforests and coral reefs are rich in biodiversity, meaning they have many different species.",
    "Ecosystems with few species tend to be less stable because they have fewer interactions among species.",
    "A stable and lasting food web typically involves more species interactions, providing resilience against changes.",
    "While competition can be intense in diverse ecosystems, it is not a primary differentiator from ecosystems with few species."

  "solution": "B"
