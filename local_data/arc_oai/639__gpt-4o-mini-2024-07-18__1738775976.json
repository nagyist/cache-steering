  "query": "Question: How are green plants an important part of the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle?\n\nChoices:\nA: They add oxygen to the soil.\nB: They release oxygen into the air.\nC: They fix carbon dioxide in the soil.\nD: They store carbon dioxide in roots.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the role of green plants in the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle, which involves the processes of photosynthesis and respiration.",
    "Green plants use carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis to produce glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct.",
    "Among the provided choices, we are looking for the statement that accurately describes the contribution of green plants to this cycle, specifically regarding their oxygen production.",
    "The option that states they \"release oxygen into the air\" directly aligns with the process of photosynthesis, which is crucial to the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle."
