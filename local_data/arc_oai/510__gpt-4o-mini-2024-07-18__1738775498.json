  "query": "Question: Plants can help prevent erosion or contribute to erosion. Which describes how plants could contribute to erosion?\n\nChoices:\nA: Plants slow the runoff of water and soil.\nB: Plant roots grow in rocks, breaking the rocks.\nC: Plant roots hold the soil in place against wind.\nD: Plants break the impact of raindrops before they hit the soil.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze how plants can contribute to erosion rather than prevent it.",
    "Option A states that plants slow the runoff of water and soil, which suggests they prevent erosion, not contribute to it.",
    "Option C suggests that plant roots hold the soil in place against wind, which again indicates prevention of erosion.",
    "Option D indicates that plants break the impact of raindrops, which helps to reduce erosion, not contribute to it.",
    "Option B states that plant roots grow in rocks, breaking the rocks. This process could lead to increased soil exposure and erosion, making it a way in which plants can contribute to erosion."
