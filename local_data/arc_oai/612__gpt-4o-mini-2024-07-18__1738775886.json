  "query": "Question: Mr. Jenkins's class is studying sex chromosomes. He tells his students that the nuclei of human cells have 22 pairs of autosomes. How many sex chromosomes does the human body have?\n\nChoices:\nA: 1\nB: 2\nC: 23\nD: 46",
  "steps": [
    "The human genome is made up of a total of 46 chromosomes, which includes both autosomes and sex chromosomes.",
    "Out of these 46 chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of autosomes, which accounts for 44 chromosomes.",
    "The remaining chromosomes must be sex chromosomes. Thus, we calculate the number of sex chromosomes by subtracting the number of autosomes from the total number of chromosomes: 46 - 44 = 2.",
    "In humans, the two sex chromosomes are typically one from each parent, resulting in a total of 2 sex chromosomes."
