  "query": "Question: As part of a study, a scientist observed a number of different molecular changes in matter. Which of the following observations provides evidence of a physical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: using heat to burn a log in a fireplace\nB: using light to produce sugar in plants\nC: a cake that was baked from many ingredients\nD: a bottle that was broken into many small pieces",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which observation provides evidence of a physical change, I need to understand the difference between physical changes and chemical changes. Physical changes are those where the substance changes form but not its chemical composition, while chemical changes result in new substances being formed.",
    "Now, I will examine each option to identify which one represents a physical change. \nOption A describes burning a log, which is a chemical change because it transforms the log into ash, smoke, and gases through combustion.",
    "Option B describes the process of photosynthesis, where light is used to produce sugar. This is also a chemical change because it involves the transformation of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
    "Option C involves baking a cake where the ingredients undergo chemical reactions to produce a new substance (the cake). Therefore, this is a chemical change.",
    "Lastly, option D describes breaking a bottle. This is a physical change because the glass is merely changing its form by breaking into smaller pieces, but it remains glass chemically."
