  "query": "Question: Which action most often causes sinkholes to form on the surface of Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: removing groundwater\nB: meteor impacts\nC: plates colliding\nD: mechanical weathering",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the causes of sinkholes. Sinkholes typically occur when underground water erodes the soil and rock, leading to a collapse of the surface layer.",
    "Next, I will analyze the options provided. A: removing groundwater is related to the depletion of water that can cause cavities to form due to reduced support. B: meteor impacts do not directly contribute to sinkhole formation. C: plates colliding affect tectonic movements but do not specifically cause sinkholes. D: mechanical weathering pertains to surface processes but is not a primary factor for sinkholes.",
    "Among the options, A: removing groundwater is the most relevant, as it can lead to the destabilization of the ground and generation of sinkholes due to the loss of water that previously filled voids underground."
