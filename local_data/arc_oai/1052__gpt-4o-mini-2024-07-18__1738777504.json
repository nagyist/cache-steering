  "query": "Question: Which of the following best describes an interaction between Earth and solar energy that functions to warm up the planet?\n\nChoices:\nA: absorption of solar energy by continental land masses\nB: use of solar energy in the process of photosynthesis\nC: reflection of solar energy from polar snowcaps\nD: transformation of solar energy into auroras",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify how Earth interacts with solar energy to contribute to warming the planet. This will involve considering processes that lead to an increase in temperature.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices. Option A mentions absorption of solar energy by continental land masses, which indeed increases the temperature of those areas and contributes to overall warming.",
    "Option B describes photosynthesis, which involves solar energy but primarily converts it into chemical energy for plants, not directly warming the planet.",
    "Option C refers to the reflection of solar energy from polar snowcaps, which actually helps cool the Earth rather than warm it.",
    "Finally, option D discusses the transformation of solar energy into auroras. While this is an interaction with solar energy, it does not contribute to warming the planet in a significant way."
