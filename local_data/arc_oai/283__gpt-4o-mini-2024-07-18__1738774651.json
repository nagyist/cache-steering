  "query": "Question: The pull of gravity on Earth is a direct result of the\n\nChoices:\nA: mass of Earth.\nB: magnetic field of Earth.\nC: rotation of Earth on its axis.\nD: weight of Earth's atmosphere.",
  "steps": [
    "The pull of gravity on Earth is primarily due to the mass of the Earth itself, which creates a gravitational force that pulls objects toward its center.",
    "While the magnetic field of Earth and the rotation of Earth contribute to various physical phenomena, they do not directly cause the pull of gravity.",
    "The weight of Earth's atmosphere is influenced by gravity, but it does not cause gravity itself; rather, gravity is what keeps the atmosphere in place."
