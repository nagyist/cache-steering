  "query": "Question: Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic. Which is a type of potential energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: sound energy\nB: radiant energy\nC: thermal energy\nD: chemical energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to recall the definitions of potential and kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy based on an object's position or state, while kinetic energy is energy in motion.",
    "Next, we analyze the options provided to determine which one represents potential energy.",
    "A: Sound energy is a form of kinetic energy, as it involves the movement of sound waves.",
    "B: Radiant energy, such as light, is also considered a form of kinetic energy because it travels in waves.",
    "C: Thermal energy can be complex, but it primarily refers to the kinetic energy of particles in a substance, so it is mostly kinetic energy.",
    "D: Chemical energy is stored in the bonds of chemical compounds. When these bonds are broken, the stored energy can be released. This indicates that chemical energy is a type of potential energy."
