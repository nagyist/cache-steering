  "query": "Question: Four different students take turns pushing a large, heavy ball on the school parking lot. What is the best way to determine which student used the most force to push the ball?\n\nChoices:\nA: compare the sizes of the students\nB: compare the ages of the students\nC: compare the distances that the ball rolled\nD: compare the number of times the ball was rolled",
  "steps": [
    "Comparing the sizes of the students (Choice A) does not directly correlate to the amount of force each student exerted, as different students can apply different amounts of force irrespective of their size.",
    "Comparing the ages of the students (Choice B) is also irrelevant because age does not inherently determine the strength or effectiveness of a push.",
    "Comparing the distances that the ball rolled (Choice C) is a direct measurement of the effect of each student's push. The farther the ball rolls, the more force was likely applied.",
    "Comparing the number of times the ball was rolled (Choice D) does not indicate the force applied per roll, as a student may roll the ball many times with little force each time, or fewer times with a lot of force."

  "solution": "C"
