  "query": "Question: In which situation would it be an advantage to ship a product by plane rather than by truck?\n\nChoices:\nA: The product is very heavy and relatively large.\nB: The product is sensitive to changes in pressure.\nC: The product must be delivered a long distance soon after it is made.\nD: The product must be delivered to several sites located within a radius of 50 miles.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the general advantages of shipping by plane. Air transportation is typically faster than truck transportation, making it suitable for urgent deliveries.",
    "Next, evaluate each option to determine which situation emphasizes the need for speed in delivery.",
    "In option A, shipping heavy and large products may not be advantageous by plane due to weight restrictions and higher costs associated with air freight.",
    "Option B mentions products sensitive to pressure changes, which may require specialized handling, but this does not necessarily favor air shipping over truck shipping in terms of urgency.",
    "Option C clearly states that the product must be delivered a long distance soon after it is made. This situation aligns with the speed advantage of planes, as they can cover large distances quickly.",
    "Finally, option D discusses delivering products to several sites within 50 miles, which would typically be more efficiently handled by trucks, minimizing transport costs and time for short distances."
