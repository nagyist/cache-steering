  "query": "Question: Ten grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams (g) of water. How many grams is the sugar-and-water solution?\n\nChoices:\nA: 90 g\nB: 100 g\nC: 110 g\nD: 1000 g",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves determining the total mass of a solution made by dissolving sugar in water.",
    "We start with 10 grams of sugar and 100 grams of water.",
    "To find the total mass of the solution, we add the mass of the sugar to the mass of the water: 10 grams (sugar) + 100 grams (water).",
    "Calculating this gives us 10 g + 100 g = 110 g.",
    "Thus, the total mass of the sugar-and-water solution is 110 grams."
