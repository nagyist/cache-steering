  "query": "Question: Metal atoms will most likely form ions by the\n\nChoices:\nA: loss of electrons.\nB: loss of protons.\nC: gain of electrons.\nD: gain of protons.",
  "steps": [
    "Metal atoms typically have few electrons in their outermost shell and are inclined to lose these electrons in order to achieve a stable electron configuration, often resembling the nearest noble gas.",
    "Losing electrons results in a net positive charge, which is characteristic of metal ions. This process transforms metal atoms into positively charged ions (cations).",
    "In contrast, gaining protons would increase the positive charge and does not occur in the typical formation of metal ions. Gaining electrons is more aligned with nonmetals, which form anions."
