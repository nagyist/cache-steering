  "query": "Question: A teacher mixes a small amount of salt in a glass of warm water and asks the students to observe physical changes that occur as the salt dissolves. Which physical change will they most likely observe?\n\nChoices:\nA: The solution will become clear.\nB: The salt will form bubbles.\nC: The solution will increase in temperature.\nD: The water will evaporate.",
  "steps": [
    "The teacher is asking the students to observe physical changes, which are changes that do not alter the chemical composition of the substances involved.",
    "When salt is added to warm water, it dissolves, and this is a physical change. The appearance of the solution can change as a result of the salt dissolving.",
    "Among the choices given, option A states that \"The solution will become clear,\" which is true because when salt dissolves in clear water, it becomes a clear saline solution.",
    "Option B, \"The salt will form bubbles,\" is incorrect because dissolving salt does not produce gas bubbles.",
    "Option C, \"The solution will increase in temperature,\" is misleading in the context of dissolution, unless there's a specific exothermic reaction; typically, salt dissolving in water does not significantly change the temperature.",
    "Option D, \"The water will evaporate,\" is not a direct observation from just mixing salt and water in the context of this experiment without additional factors."
