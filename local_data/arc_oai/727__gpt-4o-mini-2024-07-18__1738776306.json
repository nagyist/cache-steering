  "query": "Question: A student pushes a shopping cart filled with groceries. The cart has a mass of 12 kilograms (kg). The student pushes the cart with a force of 15 newtons (N). Assuming the ground is frictionless, how fast will the cart accelerate until the student stops applying the force?\n\nChoices:\nA: 0.625 m/s^2\nB: 0.8 m/s^2\nC: 1.25 m/s^2\nD: 2.5 m/s^2",
  "steps": [
    "To find the acceleration of the cart, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).",
    "We know the force (F) applied to the cart is 15 N and the mass (m) of the cart is 12 kg. We need to solve for acceleration (a).",
    "Rearranging the formula F = ma, we get a = F / m. Now we can substitute the values we have: a = 15 N / 12 kg.",
    "Calculating this gives us a = 15 / 12 = 1.25 m/s\u00b2."
