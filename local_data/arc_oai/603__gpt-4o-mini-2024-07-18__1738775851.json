  "query": "Question: Which is a major function of the vacuoles found in cells?\n\nChoices:\nA: to store water and food for cells\nB: to release energy for cells\nC: to control what enters and leaves cells\nD: to provide protection for cells",
  "steps": [
    "Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles found in cells, primarily in plant and fungal cells. One of their main functions is to store various substances.",
    "In plant cells, vacuoles are large and often filled with water, providing turgor pressure which helps maintain cell structure and stores nutrients like sugars and amino acids.",
    "Option A states that vacuoles store water and food for cells, which aligns with the recognized function of vacuoles in both plant and some animal cells.",
    "The other options (B, C, and D) do not accurately describe the primary function of vacuoles as they are not directly involved in energy release, controlling cell permeability, or providing protection, which are functions of other cellular structures."
