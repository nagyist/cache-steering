  "query": "Question: If a book sitting on a flat table starts to move horizontally, it is most likely moving because\n\nChoices:\nA: a balanced force is being applied.\nB: a frictional force is being exerted.\nC: an unbalanced force is being applied.\nD: a gravitational force is being exerted.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about the movement of a book on a flat table, which indicates the situation involves horizontal motion.",
    "According to Newton's first law of motion, an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.",
    "If the book starts to move, it means that there must be a force that is disrupting its state of rest. This indicates the presence of an unbalanced force.",
    "Both frictional force and gravitational force are present in this scenario, but they do not initiate the movement; rather, they could oppose it or keep the book in place, respectively. The force causing the movement must be unbalanced."
