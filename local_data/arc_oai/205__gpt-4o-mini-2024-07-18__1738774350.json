  "query": "Question: John was using his mp3 player when it suddenly stopped working. What is the first thing John should do to try correcting the problem?\n\nChoices:\nA: recharge the battery\nB: take the player apart\nC: replace the player with a new one\nD: change to a different song",
  "steps": [
    "The first thing John should consider is whether the mp3 player has enough battery power to function, as this is a common issue that can cause devices to stop working.",
    "If the battery is dead, recharging it is a straightforward and non-invasive step that often resolves the issue without requiring any further action.",
    "Taking the player apart or replacing it with a new one are more drastic measures that should not be the first course of action, as they involve more effort and potential for damage.",
    "Changing to a different song is unlikely to resolve the problem if the device is not working at all, hence it should not be the first action to take."
