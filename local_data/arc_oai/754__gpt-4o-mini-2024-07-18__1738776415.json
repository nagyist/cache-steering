  "query": "Question: What particle always has a mass of one atomic mass unit (amu) and no charge?\n\nChoices:\nA: a neutron\nB: a proton\nC: an electron\nD: an atom",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the particle that is always associated with a mass of one atomic mass unit (amu).",
    "Among the given choices, neutrons and protons are nucleons typically found in atomic nuclei and each has a mass close to one amu.",
    "However, only the neutron specifically has no electric charge, while the proton carries a positive charge. Electrons are much lighter than one amu and carry a negative charge.",
    "The choice labeled as an atom is not a single particle but rather a collection of various particles, which doesn't fit the description asked in the question."
