  "query": "Question: In studying layers of rock sediment, a geologist found an area where older rock was layered on top of younger rock. Which best explains how this occurred?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earthquake activity folded the rock layers.\nB: Volcanic eruptions destroyed a rock layer.\nC: Erosion removed several layers of rock.\nD: Weathering changed the layering of the rocks.",
  "steps": [
    "The normal order of sedimentary rock layers is that older layers are found below younger layers because new sediment is deposited on top of existing layers over time.",
    "If older rock is found above younger rock, it suggests that there was some disruption to the normal process of sedimentation and deposition.",
    "Earthquake activity can cause tectonic movements that could fold over or flip rock layers, potentially placing older layers on top of younger ones.",
    "Volcanic eruptions might destroy a layer of rock, but they wouldn't necessarily cause older rock to be layered on top of younger rock.",
    "Erosion removes layers of rock, but it does not rearrange them to place older layers on top of younger layers. It tends to wear away the top and expose older layers beneath.",
    "Weathering alters the physical or chemical characteristics of rocks but does not rearrange the order of stratification."
