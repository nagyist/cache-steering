  "query": "Question: A pharmaceutical company has published the results of a limited experiment investigating the protective value of a chemical compound against high doses of UV rays on skin cells. It was later discovered that the results were not reproducible. What action could the company researchers have taken to avoid publishing erroneous results?\n\nChoices:\nA: Perform multiple trials.\nB: Use only low levels of radiation.\nC: Use different wavelengths of radiation.\nD: Look into results of similar experiments before forming a hypothesis.",
  "steps": [
    "The primary issue with publishing erroneous results is the lack of reproducibility, indicating potential issues with the initial experiment's reliability and robustness.",
    "Performing multiple trials would have provided a broader and more reliable data set, allowing researchers to confirm whether the initial results were consistent across various attempts.",
    "Using only low levels of radiation would not necessarily address the reproducibility of the experiment at high doses, which is the focus of the test.",
    "Using different wavelengths of radiation may provide additional information but doesn't directly address the core issue of whether the original findings could be reliably reproduced.",
    "Looking into results of similar experiments before forming a hypothesis could enhance understanding but would not directly allow for verification of the specific findings of this compound against UV radiation."
