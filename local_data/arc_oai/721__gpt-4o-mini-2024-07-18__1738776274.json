  "query": "Question: What do the energy resources uranium and coal have in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: They both are formed from the remains of dead organisms.\nB: They both are acquired by mining the lithosphere.\nC: They both release energy through combustion.\nD: They both generate radioactive wastes.",
  "steps": [
    "Uranium is a radioactive element used primarily as fuel in nuclear reactors, while coal is a fossil fuel that is burned to generate energy.",
    "Both uranium and coal are energy resources used to produce electricity, but their formation differs; uranium is not formed from organic remains like coal is.",
    "Uranium is extracted through mining processes, and coal is also mined, indicating they can both be acquired from the Earth's lithosphere.",
    "While coal generates waste through combustion, uranium produces radioactive waste as a byproduct of nuclear fission, which is not the same as combustion.",
    "The most accurate commonality between uranium and coal is that both are extracted from the earth through mining."
