  "steps": [
    "The smallest negatively-charged particle in an atom is called an electron.",
    "Electrons are not found in the nucleus; instead, they exist in orbital regions around the nucleus where they move in defined paths.",
    "The nucleus contains protons and neutrons, which are positively charged and neutral, respectively, but does not contain electrons.",
    "Given the options, the only choice that describes where electrons are found is \"orbits around the nucleus.\""
