  "query": "Question: Stars are often classified by their apparent brightness in the nighttime sky. Stars can also be classified in many other ways. Which of these is least useful in classifying stars?\n\nChoices:\nA: visible color\nB: composition\nC: surface texture\nD: temperature",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to evaluate the options related to how stars are classified. The visible color of a star can provide information about its temperature and stage in its lifecycle.",
    "Next, composition is crucial in classifying stars as it tells us about what elements are present and can indicate the star's origin and age.",
    "The temperature is directly related to a star's color and is a fundamental property used in classification systems such as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.",
    "Now, considering surface texture, stars are not typically classified by surface texture like one would with terrestrial objects. The appearance of a star is defined by its brightness and color rather than any textural qualities."
