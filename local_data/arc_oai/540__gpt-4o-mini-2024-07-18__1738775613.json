  "query": "Question: Which best describes a parallel circuit?\n\nChoices:\nA: Electricity flows along one pathway.\nB: The flow of electricity comes from one source.\nC: Electricity flows along more than one pathway.\nD: The flow of electricity comes from more than one source.",
  "steps": [
    "A parallel circuit is characterized by having multiple paths for electric current to flow through.",
    "In a parallel circuit, electricity can take different routes to reach the same end point, allowing multiple paths for current flow.",
    "The definition implies that there are at least two branches or pathways for the electricity, distinguishing it from a series circuit, which has only one path.",
    "Among the provided choices, option C accurately captures this concept of multiple pathways for electricity flow in a parallel circuit."
