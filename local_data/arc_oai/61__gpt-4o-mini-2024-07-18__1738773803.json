  "query": "Question: Franklin wants to know how fast he runs different distances. He uses a stopwatch to measure the time it takes him to complete a 50-meter, 100-meter, and 200-meter race. How can he calculate his speed for each race?\n\nChoices:\nA: Add the distances and the times.\nB: Divide the distances by the times.\nC: Multiply the distances by the times.\nD: Subtract the distances from the times.",
  "steps": [
    "Franklin wants to calculate his speed, which involves understanding the relationship between distance and time.",
    "Speed is defined as the distance traveled divided by the time taken to travel that distance.",
    "To find the speed for each race, Franklin should take the distance of each race (50 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters) and divide it by the time it took him to complete that race.",
    "The correct mathematical operation to find speed is therefore division of distance by time, leading to the conclusion that option B is correct."
