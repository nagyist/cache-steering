  "query": "Question: A hot, boiled egg is put into a cup of cold water. What happens to the temperature of the water and the egg?\n\nChoices:\nA: The water gets colder and the egg gets warmer.\nB: The water gets warmer and the egg gets colder.\nC: The water temperature stays the same and the egg gets colder.\nD: Both the water and the egg get warmer.",
  "steps": [
    "When a hot, boiled egg is placed in cold water, heat transfer occurs between the egg and the water.",
    "The hot egg will lose heat, causing its temperature to drop, while the cold water will absorb that heat, causing its temperature to rise.",
    "As a result, the temperature of the water increases (it gets warmer), and the temperature of the egg decreases (it gets colder)."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
