  "query": "Question: For his science project, Alan began a study of sugar maple trees. He noticed many differences among the sugar maple trees near his school. Which of the following three characteristics would vary the LEAST?\n\nChoices:\nA: height\nB: number of leaves\nC: type of seeds\nD: trunk width",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which characteristic varies the least among sugar maple trees, we must consider how each of the given options is influenced by the genetic makeup and environmental conditions affecting these trees.",
    "A: Height can vary significantly due to genetic factors, access to sunlight, water availability, and competition with other trees. It is likely to have substantial variability among individual trees.",
    "B: The number of leaves can also vary considerably based on the tree's health, age, and environmental factors such as nutrient availability and climate conditions.",
    "C: The type of seeds produced by a sugar maple tree is a characteristic that is genetically determined. Sugar maples typically produce similar seeds as they belong to the same species, leading to less variability in this characteristic.",
    "D: Trunk width can vary due to growth conditions, age, and health of the tree, suggesting a moderate level of variability among trees.",
    "Comparing all these characteristics, the type of seeds (C) is largely determined by the species' genetics and shows less variability among individual sugar maple trees than the other characteristics."
