  "query": "Question: Which of these factors affects how fast a sound wave moves?\n\nChoices:\nA: the kind of material it is moving through\nB: the amplitude of the sound wave's vibrations\nC: the wavelength of the disturbance in the medium\nD: the type of motion that caused the sound wave to form",
  "steps": [
    "The speed of a sound wave is influenced by the medium through which it travels, including properties like its density and elasticity.",
    "The kind of material (solid, liquid, or gas) significantly affects the speed of sound. For instance, sound travels faster in solids than in gases.",
    "While amplitude indicates the loudness of the sound, it does not affect the speed at which the sound travels through the medium.",
    "The wavelength of a sound wave is related to its frequency and speed (via the equation speed = frequency \u00d7 wavelength), but it does not directly affect how fast sound moves in a material.",
    "The type of motion that formed the sound wave may influence its characteristics but does not determine the speed of sound in different media."
