  "query": "Question: Which set of descriptions correctly states the difference between a population and a community?\n\nChoices:\nA: Population: one species in an area Community: one species worldwide\nB: Population: organisms in a small area Community: organisms in a large area\nC: Population: living parts of an area Community: living and nonliving parts of an area\nD: Population: one type of organism in an area Community: many types of organisms in an area",
  "steps": [
    "A population consists of individuals of the same species that live in a specific area, while a community is made up of different species that interact with each other in a given area.",
    "Option A incorrectly states that a population is one species in an area and that a community is one species worldwide, which misrepresents the definitions.",
    "Option B suggests that a population consists of organisms in a small area and a community consists of organisms in a large area; however, size is not a defining characteristic of a population versus a community.",
    "Option C inaccurately describes a community as including nonliving parts, while a community strictly consists of living organisms.",
    "Option D correctly differentiates between the two concepts: a population is defined as one type of organism in a specific area, and a community is comprised of many types of organisms within that area."
