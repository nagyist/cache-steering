  "query": "Question: Which causes the GREATEST change in a grassy field over time?\n\nChoices:\nA: The time of day\nB: Amount of yearly rainfall\nC: Number of birds nesting\nD: Seasonal migration of animals",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the factor that causes the greatest change in a grassy field over time.",
    "The time of day can affect light and temperature but is unlikely to cause significant long-term changes in a grassy field.",
    "The amount of yearly rainfall directly impacts the growth and health of grasses, influencing the ecosystem significantly over time.",
    "The number of birds nesting may have localized effects on a grassy field but does not generally cause substantial long-term changes in the ecosystem.",
    "The seasonal migration of animals can impact the field temporarily but is also less significant in inducing long-term changes compared to water availability and its effects on vegetation.",
    "Comparing the factors, the amount of yearly rainfall stands out as the most critical variable affecting how a grassy field develops over time."
