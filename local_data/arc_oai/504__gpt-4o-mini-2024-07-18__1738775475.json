  "query": "Question: A scientist has collected monthly population counts of three animal species in a forest for five years. To display this data, the scientist should use which of the following?\n\nChoices:\nA: a table\nB: a pie chart\nC: a line graph\nD: a scatterplot",
  "steps": [
    "The data consists of monthly population counts over time, which indicates that the data is continuous and changes over intervals.",
    "To effectively show how the populations of the three species change over the months, it's important to illustrate trends and comparisons between the species.",
    "A line graph is typically used to display continuous data over time, allowing viewers to easily see trends and fluctuations in population counts for multiple categories.",
    "While a table could display the data, it would not effectively show trends, and a pie chart is best for showing proportions at a single point in time rather than changes over time.",
    "A scatterplot is used to show the relationship between two quantitative variables rather than changes over time in a singular category."
