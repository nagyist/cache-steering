  "query": "Question: Which of these best describes how the surface of a beach is formed?\n\nChoices:\nA: mechanical weathering\nB: chemical weathering\nC: mass movement\nD: volcanic eruption",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the processes that contribute to the formation of a beach surface.",
    "Consider that beaches are primarily formed by the erosion of rocks and the transportation of sediment.",
    "Determine which option best describes the erosion and movement of sand and gravel that leads to the creation of a beach.",
    "Mechanical weathering often involves physical processes that break down rocks but does not account for the transportation of materials to a beach. Chemical weathering changes the chemical composition of rocks but isn't the primary process in beach formation either.",
    "Mass movement refers to the movement of soil and rock down slopes due to gravity and is not directly related to beach formation.",
    "Volcanic eruptions can create new landforms, but they do not typically form beaches.",
    "Thus, the best option left for the process that shapes and forms the surface of a beach is the transportation and erosion of materials, which are typically due to mechanical processes."
