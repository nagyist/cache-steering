  "query": "Question: Why is it safer to look at the Moon than it is to look at the Sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: The Moon is less bright.\nB: The Moon is closer to Earth.\nC: The Moon shines mostly at night.\nD: The Moon is full only once a month.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the brightness of the objects in question. The Sun is extremely bright and can damage eyesight if looked at directly, whereas the Moon reflects sunlight and is much dimmer.",
    "Next, evaluate the proximity of the Moon to Earth compared to the Sun. While the Moon is closer, this fact does not directly relate to the danger of looking at it.",
    "Then, analyze the timing of when the Moon is visible. The Moon is often visible at night, but this is not a factor that contributes to safety; it simply describes its visibility.",
    "Also, consider the lunar cycle. The Moon being full only once a month relates to its appearance but does not affect the safety of looking at it.",
    "Ultimately, the first reasoning about brightness directly addresses why the Moon is safer to look at compared to the Sun."
