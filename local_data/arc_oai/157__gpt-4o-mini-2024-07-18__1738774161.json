  "query": "Question: A doorbell contains a simple electromagnet. Which change would most likely increase the strength of an electromagnet?\n\nChoices:\nA: longer wires\nB: fewer wire coils\nC: an aluminum core\nD: a larger power source",
  "steps": [
    "The strength of an electromagnet can be influenced by various factors including the number of wire coils, the type of core, and the power source used.",
    "Longer wires (A) may allow for more resistance and therefore not necessarily increase the strength of the electromagnet as effective as other factors.",
    "Fewer wire coils (B) would result in a weaker magnetic field, as the strength of an electromagnet is generally enhanced by having more coils.",
    "An aluminum core (C) is not magnetic and would not enhance the strength of the electromagnet compared to using a ferromagnetic core like iron.",
    "A larger power source (D) would increase the current flowing through the wire, which would consequently increase the magnetic field strength produced by the electromagnet."

  "solution": "D"
