  "query": "Question: Tommy cut his finger. His body needed energy to help heal the cut. Where did the energy come from to heal the cut?\n\nChoices:\nA: from the bandage he put on the cut\nB: from the antiseptic cream he put on the cut\nC: from the food he ate\nD: from the water he drank",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify how the body gets energy for healing processes.",
    "The body primarily derives energy from the nutrients in food, which are broken down into energy that supports biological functions and healing.",
    "A bandage and antiseptic cream do not provide energy; they support the healing process mechanically or chemically but do not contribute any caloric energy.",
    "Water is essential for many bodily functions but does not provide energy in the form of calories.",
    "Therefore, the energy that Tommy's body used to heal his cut must have come from the food he ate."
