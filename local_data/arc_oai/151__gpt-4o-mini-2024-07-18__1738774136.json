  "query": "Question: One similarity between a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum is that both samples have\n\nChoices:\nA: a definite shape.\nB: a definite volume.\nC: the same number of atoms.\nD: the same amount of energy.",
  "steps": [
    "Both a small solid sample of aluminum and a large liquid sample of aluminum consist of the same elemental substance, which means they are made of aluminum atoms.",
    "Since both samples are made of aluminum, they contain the same type of atoms, although the number of atoms in each sample may differ based on size and state (solid vs. liquid).",
    "In terms of physical properties, while the solid aluminum has a definite shape, the liquid aluminum does not; it takes the shape of its container.",
    "However, both samples do have a definite volume, as solids usually have a fixed volume and liquids have a definite volume that is not fixed in shape.",
    "The option regarding the same number of atoms is incorrect unless stated as being the same size or mass, which isn\u2019t indicated for both samples; thus, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as true.",
    "Energy cannot directly be compared without specific details about temperature and state of the samples, so this option cannot be assumed."
