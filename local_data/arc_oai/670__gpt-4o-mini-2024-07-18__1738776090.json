  "query": "Question: The cellular membrane surrounds every human cell. The membrane protects the cell and transmits information about the cell's surroundings to organelles inside the cell. What organ system provides a similar function in the human body?\n\nChoices:\nA: endocrine system\nB: skeletal system\nC: integumentary system\nD: lymphatic system",
  "steps": [
    "The cellular membrane serves as a protective barrier, similar to how organ systems in the body often provide protection or communication for the body's structures.",
    "The integumentary system, which includes the skin, hair, and nails, serves as a protective barrier for the body and helps transmit information about the external environment.",
    "The other systems listed (endocrine, skeletal, lymphatic) do not primarily function as protective barriers or transmit information about the external environment in the same way that the integumentary system does."
