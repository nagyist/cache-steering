  "query": "Question: When a baby shakes a rattle, it makes a noise. Which form of energy was changed to sound energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: electrical\nB: light\nC: mechanical\nD: heat",
  "steps": [
    "The baby is shaking the rattle using their hands, which involves movement.",
    "This movement of the hands is a form of energy related to motion, known as mechanical energy.",
    "When the rattle is shaken, the mechanical energy from the baby's motion is transferred to the rattle, causing it to produce sound.",
    "Therefore, the form of energy that was transformed into sound energy is mechanical energy."
  ],
  "solution": "C"
