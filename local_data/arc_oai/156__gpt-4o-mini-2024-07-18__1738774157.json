  "steps": [
    "The question states that repeating experiments improves the likelihood of accurate results.",
    "More trials lead to a reduction in random errors and an increase in precision, which generally means that results become more reliable.",
    "Given that repeating experiments helps identify and minimize errors, the overall results are thus more likely to be correct.",
    "Among the answer choices, only option D states that results are \"more likely to be correct due to fewer errors being made.\""

  "solution": "D"
