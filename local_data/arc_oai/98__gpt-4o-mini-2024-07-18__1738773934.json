  "query": "Question: A plant that grows red flowers was crossed with the same kind of plant that grows white flowers. Their offspring grew pink flowers. Which best explains why the offspring grew pink flowers?\n\nChoices:\nA: The offspring experienced a genetic mutation.\nB: The offspring resulted from asexual reproduction.\nC: The genes for flower color exhibited incomplete dominance.\nD: A gene for pink-colored flowers was recessive in one of the parents.",
  "steps": [
    "We are dealing with a genetic cross between two plants, one with red flowers and one with white flowers. The outcome shows that the offspring have pink flowers, indicating a blending of traits.",
    "In genetic terms, red flower color and white flower color appear to be two different alleles. The presence of pink flowers in the offspring suggests that neither the red nor the white allele is completely dominant over the other.",
    "Incomplete dominance is a situation where the phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between those of the two homozygotes, which in this case results in pink flowers from red and white parents.",
    "This eliminates other choices: there is no indication of a mutation (A), asexual reproduction (B) is not relevant here as we are discussing sexual reproduction with two distinct flower colors, and the option of a recessive gene for pink flowers (D) does not apply since the pink color is due to the blending effect instead of being recessive."
