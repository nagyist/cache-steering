  "query": "Question: When prehistoric animals died and their soft parts decayed, which product was formed?\n\nChoices:\nA: oil\nB: sand\nC: coal\nD: shale",
  "steps": [
    "Prehistoric animals consist of both soft and hard parts. When they died, the soft parts decayed over time.",
    "The decay of organic material, such as the soft parts of prehistoric animals, over millions of years under heat and pressure typically contributes to the formation of fossil fuels.",
    "The specific type of fossil fuel formed depends on the combination of organic material and the conditions it was subjected to over time.",
    "Oil is typically formed from the remains of small marine organisms (including some prehistoric animals), subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years.",
    "Coal, on the other hand, is largely formed from plant material and is distinctly different from formations resulting from decayed animals.",
    "Shale is a type of sedimentary rock that can contain organic material, but is not directly formed from the soft parts of prehistoric animals.",
    "Sand is unrelated to decayed organic material, as it is composed largely of mineral particles.",
    "Thus, considering how oil is formed from organic material, including prehistoric animals, the final answer is oil."
