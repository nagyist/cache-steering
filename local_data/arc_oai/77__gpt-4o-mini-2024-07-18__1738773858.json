  "query": "Question: Giant redwood trees change energy from one form to another. How is energy changed by the trees?\n\nChoices:\nA: They change chemical energy into kinetic energy.\nB: They change solar energy into chemical energy.\nC: They change wind energy into heat energy.\nD: They change mechanical energy into solar energy.",
  "steps": [
    "Giant redwood trees undergo photosynthesis, a process where they convert sunlight into energy.",
    "During photosynthesis, trees specifically convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.",
    "I will examine the answer choices to see which one accurately describes this process.",
    "Choice A mentions changing chemical energy into kinetic energy, which is not accurate in the context of trees.",
    "Choice B states that they change solar energy into chemical energy, which aligns with the photosynthesis process.",
    "Choice C refers to wind energy being converted into heat energy, which is unrelated to the function of redwood trees.",
    "Choice D indicates conversion of mechanical energy into solar energy, which does not accurately reflect tree energy transformation."
