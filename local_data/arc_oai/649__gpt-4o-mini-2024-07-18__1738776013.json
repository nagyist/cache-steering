  "query": "Question: After a forest fire, which type of organisms will begin secondary succession?\n\nChoices:\nA: small shrubs\nB: mature oaks\nC: evergreens\nD: wildflowers",
  "steps": [
    "Secondary succession occurs in an area where a disturbance, such as a forest fire, has cleared away the existing vegetation but has left the soil intact. The first organisms to inhabit this area are typically those that can quickly grow and thrive in the newly available sunlight and soil nutrients.",
    "In general, wildflowers are among the first plants to colonize disturbed areas because they have a fast growth rate and can easily spread their seeds. This makes them a key component of early secondary succession.",
    "Other options like small shrubs, mature oaks, and evergreens typically take longer to establish themselves and may not be the immediate organisms that start the secondary succession in a recently disturbed area."
