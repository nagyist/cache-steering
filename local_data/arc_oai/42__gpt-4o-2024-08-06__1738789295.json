  "query": "Question: Where is the biological magnification of pollutants most likely to be the greatest?\n\nChoices:\nA: in an estuary\nB: in an open ocean\nC: at an intertidal zone\nD: at a hydrothermal vent",
  "steps": [
    "Biological magnification refers to the increase in concentration of a substance, such as pollutants, as it moves up the food chain.",
    "Pollutants are often more concentrated in areas where they accumulate and interact with various organisms, entering the food chain at the lower levels.",
    "An estuary is a region where pollutants can accumulate, as it is a transition area between river environments and marine environments. It has a high concentration of microorganisms and primary producers that can absorb pollutants, which are then magnified up the food chain.",
    "Open oceans are vast and pollutants are more dispersed, leading to lower concentrations compared to smaller, more contained areas like estuaries.",
    "Intertidal zones and hydrothermal vents also have less concentration of pollutants compared to estuaries due to their nature and location."
