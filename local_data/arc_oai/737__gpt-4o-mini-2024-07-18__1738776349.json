  "query": "Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?\n\nChoices:\nA: 5 km\nB: 20 km\nC: 40 km\nD: 50 km",
  "steps": [
    "First, determine the total distance traveled by the geese, which is given as 2,000 km.",
    "Next, calculate the total number of days traveled, which is provided as 40 days.",
    "To find the distance traveled per day, divide the total distance by the total number of days: 2,000 km \u00f7 40 days = 50 km/day."
