  "query": "Question: Several horses grazed in a fenced area across from a home. On rainy days, soil would wash down a slope and run toward the home. After the horses were moved a few years later, the soil no longer washed down when it rained. What could account for this change?\n\nChoices:\nA: The grass grew and kept the soil intact.\nB: The fence kept the soil contained.\nC: The soil was completely gone.\nD: The amount of rain decreased.",
  "steps": [
    "Initially, the presence of horses may have caused erosion due to their grazing habits, which could have disturbed the soil and vegetation, making it more susceptible to washing away during rain.",
    "After the horses were moved, the area was likely left to recover, allowing grass and other vegetation to grow back. This regrowth can stabilize the soil by holding it in place with their root systems.",
    "The option that best explains why the soil no longer washed down when it rained is that the grass grew and kept the soil intact, preventing erosion."
