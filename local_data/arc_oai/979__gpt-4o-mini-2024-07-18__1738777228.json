  "query": "Question: The drag of wind results in which feature of ocean surface currents?\n\nChoices:\nA: movement of water away from the equator\nB: cyclical variations in the height of high tides\nC: reduction in velocity with distance from Earth's poles\nD: deflection of water toward the direction of airflow",
  "steps": [
    "The drag of wind influences the movement of ocean surface currents, which are primarily driven by wind forces.",
    "As wind blows across the ocean surface, it creates friction that pulls the water along, resulting in the surface currents moving in the direction of the wind.",
    "This drag and movement behavior suggests that the surface water will tend to deflect in the direction of airflow, leading to the conclusion that the water moves towards the direction of the wind.",
    "Evaluating the answer choices, option D suggests the deflection of water toward the direction of airflow, which aligns with the described effect of wind drag on ocean currents."
