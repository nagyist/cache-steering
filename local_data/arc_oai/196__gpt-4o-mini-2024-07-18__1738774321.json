  "query": "Question: A student compared the speeds at which a large and a small marble rolled down an inclined plane. In order to make the findings more reliable, the student should\n\nChoices:\nA: release the marbles at different heights.\nB: repeat the experiment several times.\nC: tilt the plane at different angles.\nD: use two marbles that are the same size.",
  "steps": [
    "The student is looking to make the findings of the experiment more reliable by ensuring accurate and consistent comparisons between the large and small marble.",
    "Repeating the experiment several times (Choice B) helps to minimize the impact of random errors and variances in each trial.",
    "Releasing the marbles at different heights (Choice A) or tilting the plane at different angles (Choice C) would introduce additional variables that could affect the results.",
    "Using two marbles that are the same size (Choice D) does not apply here, as the student is comparing different sizes and needs to evaluate the differences accurately."

  "solution": "B"
