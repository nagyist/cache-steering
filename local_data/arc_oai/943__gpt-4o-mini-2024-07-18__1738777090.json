  "query": "Question: A strong magnet will separate a mixture of\n\nChoices:\nA: clear glass and green glass.\nB: paper cups and plastic cups.\nC: iron nails and aluminum nails.\nD: sand and salt.",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which materials in the options provided can be attracted by a magnet.",
    "Iron is a magnetic material, while aluminum is non-magnetic. Therefore, iron nails can be attracted to a magnet, while aluminum nails cannot.",
    "The other options consist of materials that do not respond to magnetism:\n- Clear glass and green glass are both non-magnetic.\n- Paper and plastic cups are also non-magnetic.\n- Sand and salt are both non-magnetic as well.",
    "Since the only option where magnetism can play a role is iron nails (which are magnetic), option C must be the correct one."

  "solution": "C"
