  "query": "Question: The human body produces motion by changing chemical energy into mechanical energy. Which of these best describes what happens to the energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: The total amount of energy increases.\nB: The total amount of energy is constant.\nC: The energy is destroyed through motion.\nD: The amount of chemical energy increases.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the transformation of energy in the human body when it produces motion.",
    "According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms.",
    "In the context of the human body, chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy to facilitate movement.",
    "Since energy is transformed from one type to another without loss, the total amount of energy remains constant throughout the process."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
