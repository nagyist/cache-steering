  "steps": [
    "To make liquid water become solid, we need to understand the process of freezing, which occurs at low temperatures.",
    "Putting water in a very cold place lowers its temperature, which can lead to freezing the water into ice.",
    "Heating the water on the stove would do the opposite of what we want, as it would increase the temperature and keep the water in its liquid form.",
    "Shaking the water container very fast does not lower the temperature sufficiently for the water to freeze.",
    "Adding salt to water typically lowers the freezing point, which would also keep the water in liquid form at lower temperatures."
