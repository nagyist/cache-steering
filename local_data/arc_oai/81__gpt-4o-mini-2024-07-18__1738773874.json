  "query": "Question: A \"widow's peak\" hairline in humans is coded by the dominant allele W. A straight hairline is coded by the recessive allele w. A man with a homozygous dominant WW produces a zygote with a woman with a heterozygous dominant Ww for the trait. Which allele combinations could occur in the zygote?\n\nChoices:\nA: WW or ww\nB: WW or Ww\nC: WW only\nD: Ww only",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the alleles for the man and the woman. The man has a homozygous dominant genotype of WW, and the woman has a heterozygous genotype of Ww.",
    "Determine the possible allele combinations for the zygote. The zygote will receive one allele from each parent.",
    "From the man (WW), the zygote can only receive a W allele. From the woman (Ww), the zygote can receive either a W or a w allele.",
    "Combine the alleles from both parents. The possible combinations for the zygote are:\n1. W (from the man) and W (from the woman) = WW\n2. W (from the man) and w (from the woman) = Ww",
    "Thus, the possible allele combinations for the zygote are WW and Ww."

  "solution": "B"
