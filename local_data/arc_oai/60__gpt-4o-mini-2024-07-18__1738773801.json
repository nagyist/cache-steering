  "query": "Question: In which taxonomic group are organisms found that share the characteristic of storing hereditary material in a single loop of DNA?\n\nChoices:\nA: bacteria\nB: fungi\nC: plants\nD: animals",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about organisms that store hereditary material in a specific structure of DNA. The structure in question is a single loop of DNA.",
    "In taxonomy, bacteria are known to possess DNA in the form of a single circular chromosomal loop, differentiating them from organisms like fungi, plants, and animals, which have linear DNA arranged in chromosomes.",
    "Fungi, plants, and animals have more complex cellular structures and typically have multiple linear chromosomes rather than a single circular one.",
    "Since the specific characteristic mentioned in the question directly aligns with bacteria, they are the correct choice for this query."
