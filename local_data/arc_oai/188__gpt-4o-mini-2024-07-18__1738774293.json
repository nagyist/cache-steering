  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the role each option plays in the decomposition and decay of dead plants and animals.",
    "Worms are known to break down organic matter and aerate the soil, which aids in decomposition.",
    "Fungi are important decomposers that break down complex organic materials, returning nutrients to the soil.",
    "Microorganisms, including bacteria and other microbes, play a crucial role in breaking down dead organic matter at a microscopic level.",
    "Plant roots mainly function in nutrient uptake and do not play a significant role in the actual breakdown process of dead plants and animals compared to the other options."
