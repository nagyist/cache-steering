  "query": "Question: Which is a true statement regarding the graphing of data?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is always better to leave data in a table than to graph it.\nB: Bar graphs are the best type of graphs for scientific data.\nC: For any given set of data, there is only one correct graph or way to display it.\nD: Data can be displayed in many types of graphs in order to show different things about the data.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will evaluate choice A: \"It is always better to leave data in a table than to graph it.\" This statement is not universally true because graphs can provide visual insights that tables may not convey effectively.",
    "Next, I'll consider choice B: \"Bar graphs are the best type of graphs for scientific data.\" While bar graphs are useful for categorical data, there are many types of scientific data that might be better represented by other forms, such as line graphs or scatter plots.",
    "Now, I will analyze choice C: \"For any given set of data, there is only one correct graph or way to display it.\" This statement is false because the same data can often be represented in multiple ways depending on what information needs to be emphasized.",
    "Finally, I will review choice D: \"Data can be displayed in many types of graphs in order to show different things about the data.\" This statement is true because depending on what aspect of the data is emphasized, different graph types can be more effective."
