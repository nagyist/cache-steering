  "query": "Question: Which of these substances conducts electricity the best?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wood\nB: Brick\nC: Copper\nD: Plastic",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the properties of the materials listed in the choices. Conductivity refers to the ability of a material to allow the flow of electric current.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option: Wood is generally an insulator and does not conduct electricity well. Brick is also a poor conductor and is usually considered a non-conductive material. Plastic is a synthetic material that is typically an insulator as well.",
    "Finally, I will assess Copper. Copper is widely known for its excellent electrical conductivity and is commonly used in electrical wiring and electronic devices."
