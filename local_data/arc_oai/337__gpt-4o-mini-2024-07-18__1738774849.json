  "query": "Question: Uranus is one of the outer planets of the solar system. The average distance of Uranus from the Sun is 2.87 billion kilometers. Which best explains why Uranus revolves in its orbit instead of moving out into space?\n\nChoices:\nA: The orbit of Neptune limits Uranus.\nB: Gravity pulls Uranus toward the Sun.\nC: Electromagnetic energy pulls on Uranus.\nD: Other planets have the same mass as Uranus.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking why Uranus remains in its orbit around the Sun rather than drifting away into space.",
    "One important factor that keeps a planet in orbit is the force of gravity, which pulls objects toward each other. In this case, the Sun's gravity pulls Uranus towards it.",
    "The other answer choices do not provide a logical explanation for why Uranus revolves in its orbit. For example, the orbit of Neptune does not limit Uranus's path significantly, and electromagnetic energy does not play a direct role in the orbit of planets in the solar system. Additionally, the mass of other planets does not influence Uranus's orbit."
