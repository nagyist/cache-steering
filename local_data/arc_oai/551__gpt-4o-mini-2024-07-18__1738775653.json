  "query": "Question: Water used in a factory is heated to 75 degrees Celsius. It is discharged into a nearby river that has a normal temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. Which should most likely be done to minimize damage to the river?\n\nChoices:\nA: decrease the temperature of the factory water\nB: increase the temperature of the river water\nC: remove the vegetation from the river\nD: add more fish to the river",
  "steps": [
    "The factory water is heated to 75 degrees Celsius, which is significantly higher than the river's normal temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. This temperature difference can be harmful to the river's ecosystem.",
    "To minimize damage to the river, it's important to consider methods that would reduce the temperature of the heated water before it is discharged into the river.",
    "Looking at the options provided, Option A suggests decreasing the temperature of the factory water, which directly addresses the issue of the high temperature being discharged into the river.",
    "Options B, C, and D do not address the need to cool the water before it enters the river and may also contribute to ecological harm rather than help."
