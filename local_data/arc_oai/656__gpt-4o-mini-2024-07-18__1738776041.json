  "query": "Question: The noble gases, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, rarely react with other elements because they\n\nChoices:\nA: are low-density gases.\nB: are not abundant on Earth.\nC: have complete outermost energy levels.\nD: have two electrons in their outermost energy level.",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the properties of noble gases. They are known for their lack of reactivity with other elements.",
    "Examine the reason why noble gases are unreactive. One key factor is the stability of their electron configuration.",
    "Identify what makes their electron configuration stable. Noble gases have complete outermost energy levels, which means they have a full set of electrons.",
    "Review the answer choices. Option C states that they have complete outermost energy levels, which accurately explains their unreactive nature."
