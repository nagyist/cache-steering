  "steps": [
    "The question describes a decrease in air temperature from 60\u00b0F to 35\u00b0F, which represents a significant drop in temperature.",
    "In cooler temperatures, the body's natural response is to generate heat, which often leads to shivering as a way to maintain body temperature.",
    "Sweating typically occurs in warmer temperatures to help cool the body down, so it would not be a likely response in this scenario.",
    "Blinking eyes is a normal reflex and is not specifically related to temperature changes, making it an unlikely choice in response to the cold.",
    "Feeling sleepy could be influenced by many factors, but is not directly tied to the drop in temperature in this specific situation."
