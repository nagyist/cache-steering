  "query": "Question: In which of the following ways are photosynthesis and cellular respiration alike?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both processes produce glucose.\nB: Both processes consume carbon dioxide.\nC: Both processes take place in chloroplasts.\nD: Both processes involve energy transformations.",
  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration to identify commonalities. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, while cellular respiration breaks down glucose to release energy.",
    "Analyze choice A: Both processes produce glucose. This is incorrect as photosynthesis produces glucose, but cellular respiration uses it.",
    "Analyze choice B: Both processes consume carbon dioxide. This is incorrect because photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide while cellular respiration produces it.",
    "Analyze choice C: Both processes take place in chloroplasts. This is incorrect since only photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts; cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria.",
    "Analyze choice D: Both processes involve energy transformations. This is correct; photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy, while cellular respiration transforms chemical energy into usable energy."
