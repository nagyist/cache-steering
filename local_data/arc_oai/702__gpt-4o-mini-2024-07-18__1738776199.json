  "query": "Question: The vampire finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands peck at another species of bird, the blue-footed booby, until the finches make a wound. Then, the finches drink the booby's blood. Scientists think that many generations ago finches used to peck bugs off the booby, and the behavior evolved to what it is today. Which statement best describes the birds' relationship generations ago and the relationship today?\n\nChoices:\nA: The old relationship was parasitic. The new relationship is mutualistic.\nB: The old relationship was mutualistic. The new relationship is parasitic.\nC: Both relationships are parasitic.\nD: Both relationships are mutualistic.",
  "steps": [
    "The historical relationship between the finches and the booby involved the finches pecking bugs off the booby, which benefited both birds, indicating a mutualistic relationship.",
    "In the current relationship, the finches peck at the booby to draw blood, which harms the booby while benefiting the finches, indicating a parasitic relationship.",
    "Therefore, the old relationship was mutualistic, while the new relationship is parasitic, as the finches no longer help the booby but harm it instead."
