  "query": "Question: Which animal would most likely stay where it is?\n\nChoices:\nA: a fox in forest fire\nB: a frog whose pond has dried up\nC: a beaver that just finished building its dam\nD: a rabbit whose food is gone because of a drought",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which animal would most likely stay where it is, we need to analyze the situations presented for each choice.",
    "Choice A, the fox in a forest fire, would likely flee the danger of the fire.",
    "Choice B, the frog whose pond has dried up, would have no choice but to leave since there\u2019s no water left.",
    "Choice C, the beaver that just finished building its dam, is likely to stay because it has a shelter and a food source nearby.",
    "Choice D, the rabbit whose food is gone because of a drought, would also need to find new food and would likely leave the area.",
    "Given these analyses, the beaver is the only animal described that has successfully created a habitat (the dam) and will likely stay put instead of leaving."
