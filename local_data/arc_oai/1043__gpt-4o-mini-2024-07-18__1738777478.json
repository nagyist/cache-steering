  "query": "Question: Which is most like the way a stem supports a flower?\n\nChoices:\nA: the way water supports a boat crossing a river\nB: the way a flagpole supports a flag in the schoolyard\nC: the way bookends support books on a shelf\nD: the way a belt supports pants on a person's waist",
  "steps": [
    "The stem of a flower provides physical support and maintains its position, similar to how other objects provide stability to something they support.",
    "Option A describes water as a support, but water doesn't provide physical structure; it simply floats a boat. This doesn't match the role of a stem.",
    "Option B discusses a flagpole supporting a flag, which involves a vertical structure holding up something else, much like a stem holds up a flower.",
    "Option C mentions bookends supporting books, which also involves providing structure and support, resembling the way a stem supports a flower.",
    "Option D talks about a belt holding up pants. While it provides support, it doesn't provide the same type of upright structure that a stem provides to a flower.",
    "Comparing the options, both B and C provide physical support structures, but B (flagpole) is a direct analogy to the upright supporting function of a stem."
