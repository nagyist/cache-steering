  "query": "Question: Which mechanism is not an example of a negative feedback mechanism in the human body?\n\nChoices:\nA: contracting muscles\nB: regulating blood pressure\nC: regulating body temperature\nD: maintaining blood sugar level",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define negative feedback mechanisms. They are processes that work to counteract changes in the body, returning it to a set point or normal function.",
    "Next, we analyze each option to determine if it is a negative feedback mechanism.",
    "Option A: Contracting muscles is generally a response to stimuli, but it does not function to return the body to a set point, so it may not be a negative feedback mechanism.",
    "Option B: Regulating blood pressure involves mechanisms like baroreceptors that respond to changes in blood pressure to bring it back to a normal range, which is a classic negative feedback process.",
    "Option C: Regulating body temperature involves processes like sweating or shivering to maintain a stable temperature, which is also a negative feedback mechanism.",
    "Option D: Maintaining blood sugar levels involves insulin and glucagon working to keep blood sugar within a normal range, representing a negative feedback mechanism as well.",
    "Since contracting muscles does not fit the definition of a negative feedback mechanism like the other options do, it is not an example of one. Therefore, the answer is A."
