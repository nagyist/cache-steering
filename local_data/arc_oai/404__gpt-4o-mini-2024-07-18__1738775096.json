  "query": "Question: Which soil component has the least capacity for holding water?\n\nChoices:\nA: silt\nB: clay\nC: sand\nD: humus",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the properties of soil components regarding water retention.",
    "Clay has a high surface area and small particle size, which enables it to hold a significant amount of water.",
    "Silt also has a good capacity for holding water but not as much as clay.",
    "Sand has larger particles and lower surface area, resulting in a poor ability to hold water compared to clay and silt.",
    "Humus, being organic matter, can enhance water retention but is not a primary soil component like sand, silt, or clay.",
    "Based on the analysis, sand is the soil component with the least capacity for holding water compared to the other choices."
