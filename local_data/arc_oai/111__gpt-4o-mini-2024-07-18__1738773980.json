  "query": "Question: Which phrase does not describe asexual reproduction in organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: requires two parents\nB: little variation in offspring\nC: only one type of cell involved\nD: duplicates its genetic material",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the key characteristics of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction typically involves a single parent and results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.",
    "Evaluate choice A: \"requires two parents.\" Asexual reproduction does not involve two parents; it involves only one. This choice contradicts the definition of asexual reproduction.",
    "Evaluate choice B: \"little variation in offspring.\" This is true for asexual reproduction, as it generally results in clones with little genetic variation.",
    "Evaluate choice C: \"only one type of cell involved.\" This could refer to single-celled organisms that reproduce asexually, and in the broad sense of asexual reproduction, it often involves one type of cell.",
    "Evaluate choice D: \"duplicates its genetic material.\" In asexual reproduction, the genetic material of the parent cell is duplicated to form offspring, which is a correct characteristic of this type of reproduction."
