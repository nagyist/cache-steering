  "query": "Question: A certain animal has specialized cells that can cause it to change color rapidly. This color change will most likely help the animal\n\nChoices:\nA: run quickly.\nB: digest food rapidly.\nC: hide from predators.\nD: retain body heat.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the animal has specialized cells that allow it to change color rapidly.",
    "Such a color change is often associated with camouflage or signaling, which are adaptations for survival.",
    "To determine the most likely benefit of this color change, we can evaluate the given options.",
    "Option A (run quickly) is not related to changing color, as speed is not influenced by color change.",
    "Option B (digest food rapidly) is also unrelated, as digestion does not correlate with the ability to change color.",
    "Option C (hide from predators) is directly related to color change, as many animals use color changes for camouflage to avoid detection by predators.",
    "Option D (retain body heat) does not directly connect with the ability to change color, though some animals may darken to absorb more heat; it is not the primary reason for color change behaviors observed in many species.",
    "Hence, the most logical choice considering the function of color change is Option C, as it aligns with the survival strategy of evading predators."
