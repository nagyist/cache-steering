  "query": "Question: Which process is most directly related to constructing new land?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion\nB: polluting\nC: deposition\nD: weathering",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the process that is responsible for constructing new land, which indicates a building or adding action rather than a destructive one.",
    "Erosion is the process that removes soil and rock from one location and transports it to another. This process does not create new land but rather diminishes existing land.",
    "Polluting refers to introducing harmful substances into an environment, which does not relate to the construction of land.",
    "Weathering involves the breaking down of rocks and minerals but does not create new land; it simply alters existing geological features.",
    "Deposition is the process that involves the accumulation of sediment, soil, and other materials in a new location, which can contribute to the formation of new land."
