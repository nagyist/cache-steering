  "query": "Question: When the first American astronauts were planning to walk on the Moon, they knew that the gravity on the Moon was less than the gravity on Earth. With this information, what did the astronauts expect to be most different on the Moon?\n\nChoices:\nA: their mass\nB: their height\nC: their weight\nD: their volume",
  "steps": [
    "The astronauts understood that gravity affects weight, which is the force that gravity exerts on an object. Since the Moon's gravity is about 1/6th that of Earth's, they anticipated a significant difference in how heavy they would feel.",
    "Mass, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and does not change regardless of location or gravity. Thus, while their mass would remain the same, their weight would change.",
    "Height and volume are physical characteristics that would not be influenced directly by the change in gravity either, so they would remain constant as well."

  "solution": "C"
