  "query": "Question: A girl walked for 30 minutes. She noticed that she traveled farther in the first 15 minutes of her walk than in the second 15 minutes. What can she conclude about her walk?\n\nChoices:\nA: She walked over many hills.\nB: Her average speed was faster during the first half of her walk.\nC: She walked in two different directions.\nD: She was walking at a constant speed.",
  "steps": [
    "The girl observed that she traveled farther in the first 15 minutes of her walk compared to the second 15 minutes.",
    "If she covered more distance in the first 15 minutes, it suggests her speed was greater during that time compared to the second 15 minutes.",
    "If her average speed was greater in the first half, then she could conclude that she did not maintain a constant speed throughout her walk.",
    "Options A, C, and D do not specifically relate to her observation about traveling farther in the first half of her walk, making them less likely to be accurate conclusions."
