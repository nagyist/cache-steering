  "query": "Question: A student is organizing a room. She moves a box from the floor to a shelf. She wants to estimate the amount of potential energy the box has on the shelf. What information does the student need?\n\nChoices:\nA: the volume and mass of the box\nB: the mass of the shelf and the mass of the box\nC: the mass of the box and the height of the shelf\nD: the volume of the box and the height of the shelf",
  "steps": [
    "To calculate the potential energy of the box on the shelf, the formula used is potential energy (PE) = mass (m) \u00d7 gravity (g) \u00d7 height (h).",
    "Given the formula, the student needs to know the mass of the box in order to determine the potential energy since it directly affects the calculation.",
    "Additionally, the height of the shelf is needed because it indicates how high the box has been raised, which also affects the potential energy.",
    "Options that mention mass and height together are the most relevant for finding potential energy in this context.",
    "Among the choices, option C provides both the mass of the box and the height of the shelf, which are essential for estimating potential energy."
