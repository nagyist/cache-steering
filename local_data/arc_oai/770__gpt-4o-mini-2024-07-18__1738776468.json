  "query": "Question: Earth makes a complete revolution around the Sun about once every\n\nChoices:\nA: day\nB: year\nC: season\nD: minute",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the definition of a complete revolution around the Sun. This refers to the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun once.",
    "Next, we know that the Earth completes this orbit in approximately 365 days, which aligns with one calendar year.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the choices given: \nA: day - This is too short a time for a full revolution.\nB: year - This accurately reflects the Earth's orbital period around the Sun.\nC: season - This is a time frame based on Earth's tilt and does not correspond to a full revolution.\nD: minute - This is far too short for a complete revolution."
