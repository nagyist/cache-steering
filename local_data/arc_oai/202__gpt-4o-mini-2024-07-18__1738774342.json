  "query": "Question: An increase in phosphate levels in a lake increases the population of algae in the lake. Increased algae blocks sunlight into the lake and results in a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake's water. Which of the following should be expected as a result?\n\nChoices:\nA: Plant populations in the lake increase.\nB: More predatory birds feed on lake animals.\nC: Phosphate levels in the lake decrease.\nD: Fish populations in the lake decline.",
  "steps": [
    "The increase in phosphate levels leads to an increase in algae population. This is a process known as eutrophication.",
    "The increased algae blocks sunlight, which negatively affects aquatic plants that rely on sunlight for photosynthesis.",
    "As sunlight is blocked and dissolved oxygen levels decrease, organisms like fish, which require oxygen, will struggle to survive.",
    "Given that the conditions in the lake are worsening for aquatic life, it is reasonable to conclude that fish populations will decline as a result."

  "solution": "D"
