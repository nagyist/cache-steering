  "query": "Question: Two pieces of the same metal are placed on a table. The pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture. Which characteristic must be the ONLY difference between the two samples?\n\nChoices:\nA: They have different dimensions.\nB: They have different boiling points.\nC: They are made up of a different type of matter.\nD: They contain a different amount of matter per unit volume.",
  "steps": [
    "Both pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture, which implies that they are likely made from the same type of matter.",
    "The difference between the two samples must be related to their size or dimensions since mass and density are equal, thereby indicating they both share the same volume based on their density equations.",
    "Boiling points (Choice B) and the amount of matter per unit volume (Choice D) cannot be different since density is already equal for both and implies consistency in material properties.",
    "Since they must differ in some capacity due to their identical physical properties (density, mass, texture), and the only characteristic capable of differing while preserving those conditions is their dimensions."
