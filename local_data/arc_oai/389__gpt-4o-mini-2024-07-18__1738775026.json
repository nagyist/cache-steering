  "steps": [
    "Photosynthesis is the process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy, specifically producing food in the form of glucose (sugar).",
    "During this process, carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) and water (from the soil) are utilized, leading to the production of sugar and oxygen as byproducts.",
    "The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere, while sugar can be used by the plant for energy or growth.",
    "Among the given choices, we need to identify which are produced during photosynthesis. The correct terms are oxygen and sugar."
