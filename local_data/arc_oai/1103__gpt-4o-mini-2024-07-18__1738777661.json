  "query": "Question: Swamp plants die, fall to the ground, and are buried by other dying plants. Approximately how long would it take for plants to possibly become a fossil fuel?\n\nChoices:\nA: 1,000,000 years\nB: 100,000 years\nC: 10,000 years\nD: 1,000 years",
  "steps": [
    "Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals through processes involving heat and pressure over long periods of time. The process typically takes millions of years.",
    "Considering this, the formation of fossil fuels can be quite a lengthy geological process. While plant material can start to decay and change into peat relatively quickly (within a few thousand years), turning into fossil fuels generally requires much longer timeframes.",
    "The time frame given in the options needs to be evaluated against geological time. Out of the options, 1,000,000 years is the most reasonable amount of time for plant material to transform into fossil fuels like coal, oil, or natural gas."
