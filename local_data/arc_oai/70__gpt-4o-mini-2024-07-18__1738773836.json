  "query": "Question: In the carbon cycle, carbon moves from reservoir to reservoir as various organic and inorganic processes occur on Earth. Only a small percentage of the global carbon is moved in this cycle each year. The remaining carbon is stored in these reservoirs. Which reservoir contains the greatest amount of stored carbon?\n\nChoices:\nA: plant biomass\nB: the atmosphere\nC: fossil fuels\nD: the deep ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the major reservoirs of carbon on Earth within the carbon cycle.",
    "The main reservoirs include the atmosphere, plant biomass, soils, fossil fuels, and the oceans.",
    "The atmosphere contains a relatively small amount of carbon compared to larger reservoirs, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide.",
    "Plant biomass stores a significant amount of carbon, but it is less than what is stored in oceanic and geologic reservoirs.",
    "Fossil fuels contain carbon that has been stored over millions of years and constitute a major reservoir with significant amounts of carbon.",
    "The deep ocean is known to contain the largest amount of carbon on Earth, as it holds dissolved carbon and carbon in the form of marine organisms.",
    "Among the choices given, we need to identify the reservoir with the greatest amount of stored carbon.",
    "While fossil fuels store a large amount, the deep ocean has been estimated to contain more carbon than all other reservoirs combined."
