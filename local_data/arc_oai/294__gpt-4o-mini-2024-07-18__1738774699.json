  "query": "Question: Which best represents the use of mechanical energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: a light bulb giving off heat\nB: a candle providing light\nC: a nail being hammered\nD: a can rusting",
  "steps": [
    "Mechanical energy is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object.",
    "Out of the options, we need to identify which one involves the direct application of force to move an object.",
    "A nail being hammered involves using a hammer to apply force on the nail, thus directly representing mechanical energy in action.",
    "The other options either involve different forms of energy (heat from a light bulb, light from a candle) or processes (rusting) that do not pertain to mechanical energy."
