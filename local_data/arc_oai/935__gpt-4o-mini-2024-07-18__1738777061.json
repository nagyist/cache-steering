  "query": "Question: When a plant wilts, the stomata close. How does this help the plant?\n\nChoices:\nA: It increases photosynthesis.\nB: It reduces further water loss.\nC: It increases cellular respiration.\nD: It reduces water intake by roots.",
  "steps": [
    "When a plant wilts, it is usually due to a lack of water, causing stress to the plant.",
    "Closing the stomata is a physiological response to conserve water.",
    "By closing the stomata, the plant reduces transpiration, which is the process of water loss through evaporation.",
    "This conservation of water helps the plant maintain its water supply for survival until conditions improve.",
    "The primary benefit of closing the stomata in response to wilting is to reduce further water loss."
