  "query": "Question: A student is given three identically sized blocks. Each block is made of a different material. What characteristic of the blocks should be examined to find out which block is made of metal?\n\nChoices:\nA: color\nB: weight\nC: texture\nD: conductivity",
  "steps": [
    "The characteristic of metal that is typically distinctive from other materials is its ability to conduct electricity efficiently.",
    "Color, weight, and texture can vary significantly among metals and non-metallic materials. Therefore, these characteristics are not reliable indicators for identifying metal.",
    "Conductivity is a definitive characteristic of metals, as metals are generally good conductors of electricity and heat compared to other materials."
