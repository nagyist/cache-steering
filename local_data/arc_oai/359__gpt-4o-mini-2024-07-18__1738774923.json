  "query": "Question: When a car engine is started, gasoline is mixed with air and burned. Heat, sound, and chemical products are released. As the engine operates, which of these remains constant?\n\nChoices:\nA: the masses of compounds found in the engine\nB: the amount of heat in the engine\nC: the total mass of gasoline\nD: the total amount of energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system. This suggests that the total mass of the reactants (gasoline and air) should remain constant.",
    "Next, evaluate the options in relation to the principles of thermodynamics. The amount of heat can change as the engine operates due to energy transformations during combustion.",
    "Also, while gasoline is being burned to produce energy, its mass is not constant; the gasoline is converted into chemical products, decreasing the total mass of gasoline available in the engine.",
    "The total amount of energy in a closed system, like the car engine, remains constant according to the first law of thermodynamics (energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed)."

  "solution": "D"
