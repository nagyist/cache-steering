  "query": "Question: Which of the following is a central role of carbon in the chemistry of living organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: Carbon can only bond with other carbon atoms.\nB: Carbon is a solvent that breaks chemical bonds.\nC: Carbon readily forms ionic bonds that separate easily.\nD: Carbon can form many types of molecules with covalent bonds.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the essential characteristics of carbon as an element in organic chemistry.",
    "Carbon atoms have four valence electrons, allowing them to form four covalent bonds with other atoms, leading to a diverse range of complex molecules.",
    "Options A and C are incorrect because carbon does not only bond with other carbon atoms (it can bond with various elements), and it primarily forms covalent bonds rather than ionic bonds.",
    "Option B is incorrect as carbon is not a solvent; it is the backbone of organic compounds and does not dissolve substances.",
    "Therefore, the best representation of carbon\u2019s central role in living organisms is that it can form many types of molecules with covalent bonds."
