  "query": "Question: In order to produce light, the atoms inside a light bulb transform electrical energy into\n\nChoices:\nA: kinetic energy.\nB: electromagnetic radiation.\nC: chemical energy.\nD: heat energy.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what type of energy the atoms inside a light bulb transform electrical energy into in order to produce light.",
    "When electrical energy is supplied to a light bulb, it causes the atoms within to gain energy and move more rapidly.",
    "This rapid movement and vibration of atoms typically produces heat as a byproduct, which is often perceived as thermal energy.",
    "In addition to heat, this excitation of atoms also results in the emission of light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation.",
    "The key focus of the question is on the type of energy responsible for producing light specifically, alongside any other forms of energy generated.",
    "Although heat is produced, the primary transformation of energy used for 'light' in this context is electromagnetic radiation, as light itself is a form of this type of energy."
