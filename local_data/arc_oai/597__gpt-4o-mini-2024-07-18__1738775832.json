  "query": "Question: Scientists launch a rocket into space for a mission. Once the rocket escapes the gravitational pull of Earth, how will the mass and weight of the rocket be affected?\n\nChoices:\nA: The mass and weight will change.\nB: The mass and weight will stay the same.\nC: The mass will stay the same, but the weight will change.\nD: The mass will change, but the weight will stay the same.",
  "steps": [
    "The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter it contains, and it remains constant regardless of the object's location in the universe.",
    "Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. It is calculated as the product of mass and gravitational acceleration (Weight = Mass \u00d7 Gravity).",
    "Once the rocket escapes the gravitational pull of Earth, the gravitational acceleration acting on it significantly decreases, which means its weight will decrease.",
    "Since the mass of the rocket remains the same as it travels into space, but its weight changes due to the decrease in gravitational pull, we can conclude that the mass will stay the same, but the weight will change."
