  "query": "Question: In 2005, a team of scientists discovered a photosynthetic bacteria living near the molten lava of a thermal vent ecosystem deep in the Pacific Ocean. The bacteria lived 2400 meters below the surface of the ocean, yet made energy from photosynthesis. Which conclusion best explains the results?\n\nChoices:\nA: Photosynthesis can occur without light.\nB: The hydrothermal vent emits usable light.\nC: High water pressure can power photosynthesis.\nD: The bacteria used to live at the ocean's surface.",
  "steps": [
    "Photosynthesis typically requires light to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
    "The environment in which the bacteria were found was 2400 meters below the surface where sunlight does not penetrate.",
    "For photosynthesis to occur at such a depth, there must be a source of light available underwater.",
    "Hydrothermal vents emit heat and various chemicals, but they are not known to emit significant visible light.",
    "The conclusion that best explains the results would be that the hydrothermal vent emits a usable form of light that the bacteria can use for photosynthesis."
