  "query": "Question: Human interaction with the environment has led to increasing amounts of acid rain. Which population have humans adversely affected the most by contributing to the production of acid rain?\n\nChoices:\nA: frogs in a pond ecosystem\nB: fish in an ocean ecosystem\nC: bears in a tundra ecosystem\nD: lions in a grassland ecosystem",
  "steps": [
    "Acid rain primarily targets aquatic ecosystems and can severely impact species that live in water bodies, especially those that are sensitive to changes in pH levels.",
    "Frogs in a pond ecosystem are particularly vulnerable to acid rain, as their reproductive cycles and developmental stages occur in water, where even slight changes in acidity can be detrimental.",
    "Fish in an ocean ecosystem may also be affected, but ocean waters generally have a higher buffering capacity compared to freshwater bodies, making them less susceptible than frogs in ponds.",
    "Bears in a tundra ecosystem and lions in a grassland ecosystem are less directly affected by acid rain because they are terrestrial animals and live in environments where the impact of acid rain on water sources would not be as immediate or severe.",
    "Considering all of these factors, frogs in a pond ecosystem are the most adversely affected by human contributions to acid rain."
