  "query": "Question: A student adds water and detergent to a cup of soil. The mixture is shaken and allowed to settle. The student observes that silt particles stay suspended long after the other particles form layers at the bottom of the jar. The most likely explanation is that the silt particles are\n\nChoices:\nA: organic.\nB: dissolving.\nC: less dense.\nD: moving faster.",
  "steps": [
    "The student observed that silt particles remain suspended in the mixture longer than other particles. This suggests that there is a specific property of the silt that causes this behavior.",
    "One possibility is that the silt particles are lighter or less dense than the other particles, which would prevent them from settling quickly.",
    "If the silt were organic, dissolving, or moving faster, it would typically not be the sole reason for them staying suspended for an extended time in comparison to other particles, since all particles would behave differently if they were organic or affecting dissolution.",
    "Given the behavior of the silt particles, the most reasonable explanation is that they are less dense than the other soil particles, causing them to remain suspended in the water longer."
