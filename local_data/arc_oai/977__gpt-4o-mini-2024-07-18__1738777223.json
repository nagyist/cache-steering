  "query": "Question: One effect of ocean pollution is that it can reduce populations of phytoplankton and algae. The reduction of these populations might have which impact on an ecosystem?\n\nChoices:\nA: decreasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\nB: decreasing the amount of oxygen being produced\nC: increasing the amount of marine sediments\nD: increasing salt-water fish populations",
  "steps": [
    "Ocean pollution negatively affects the health of marine ecosystems, including the populations of phytoplankton and algae, which are foundational to these ecosystems.",
    "Phytoplankton and algae are crucial for the process of photosynthesis, which generates oxygen as a byproduct.",
    "If the populations of phytoplankton and algae decrease, there will likely be a reduction in oxygen production in the ocean, which can have cascading effects on marine life.",
    "The other options (A, C, and D) do not directly correlate with the reduction of phytoplankton and algae; thus, they are less likely to be correct."
