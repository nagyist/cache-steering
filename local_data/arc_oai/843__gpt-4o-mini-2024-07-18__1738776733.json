  "query": "Question: Felicia noticed how air temperatures were cooler and there were fewer hours of daylight during some of the seasons. Which of the following contributes to these seasonal changes?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth rotates on its axis.\nB: Earth revolves around the Sun.\nC: The Sun has less energy in winter.\nD: The Sun moves further from Earth in winter.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the fact that seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis as it revolves around the Sun, resulting in varying sunlight distribution throughout the year.",
    "Next, assess each option: A relates to day/night cycles but does not directly explain seasonal changes. B relates to the Earth's revolution around the Sun, which is essential in explaining the seasons. C incorrectly attributes seasonal changes to the Sun's energy levels, which remain relatively constant. D suggests a physical distance between the Sun and Earth affecting winter, which is not accurate as this distance only slightly varies and does not cause the seasons.",
    "Thus, since the Earth's revolution around the Sun results in different parts of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight over the course of the year, it is the main factor contributing to seasonal changes."
