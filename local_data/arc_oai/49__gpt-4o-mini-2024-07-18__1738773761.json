  "query": "Question: In living things, smaller substances are linked to make up larger substances. Which of the following correctly describes a larger substance made by linking smaller substances?\n\nChoices:\nA: Nucleotides are linked to make up DNA.\nB: Amino acids are linked to make up DNA.\nC: Proteins are linked to make up nucleotides.\nD: Nucleic acids are linked to make up proteins.",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which option describes a larger substance being formed by the linking of smaller substances.",
    "Option A states that nucleotides are linked to make up DNA. This is correct because DNA is indeed formed of nucleotide units linked together.",
    "Option B states that amino acids are linked to make up DNA. This is incorrect, as amino acids form proteins, not DNA.",
    "Option C states that proteins are linked to make up nucleotides. This is incorrect; nucleotides are not formed from proteins.",
    "Option D states that nucleic acids are linked to make up proteins. This is also incorrect because proteins are made from amino acids, not nucleic acids.",
    "Based on the analysis, only option A correctly describes a larger substance (DNA) being made from smaller substances (nucleotides)."
