  "steps": [
    "Identify what a nonrenewable resource is. A nonrenewable resource is one that does not replenish at a sustainable rate for human consumption, meaning it can be exhausted.",
    "Examine the choices provided: oil, soil, food, and water, to determine which one is classified as nonrenewable.",
    "Assess option A: oil. Oil is formed over millions of years and cannot be replenished on a human timescale, making it a nonrenewable resource.",
    "Assess option B: soil. While soil can degrade over time, it is considered renewable as it can replenish itself through natural processes.",
    "Assess option C: food. Food can be produced and replenished through agricultural practices, making it a renewable resource.",
    "Assess option D: water. Although there can be scarcity issues, water is part of the hydrological cycle and is generally considered renewable.",
    "Conclude that the only option that does not renew quickly enough for human use is oil."
