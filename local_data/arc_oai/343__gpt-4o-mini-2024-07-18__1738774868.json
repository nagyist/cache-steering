  "query": "Question: Which nongaseous compound can be made from two elements that are gases at room temperature?\n\nChoices:\nA: water\nB: table salt\nC: iron oxide\nD: carbon dioxide",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the elements that are gases at room temperature. Common examples include oxygen (O\u2082) and nitrogen (N\u2082).",
    "Consider which of the answer choices can be formed from two gaseous elements. Water (H\u2082O) can be formed from hydrogen (H\u2082) and oxygen (O\u2082); table salt (NaCl) is formed from sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl\u2082), which includes a gas; iron oxide (Fe\u2082O\u2083) is formed from solid iron and gaseous oxygen; while carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is formed from carbon (solid at room temperature) and oxygen (O\u2082).",
    "Since I am looking for a compound made solely from two gaseous elements, the only option that satisfies this is water, as it is made from hydrogen (gas) and oxygen (gas)."
