  "query": "Question: A research scientist repeatedly observes a bird avoiding a specific butterfly species even  though it eats other types of butterflies. Which statement most likely explains the behavior of the bird?\n\nChoices:\nA: The behavior is a random act.\nB: The behavior is the result of a genetic mutation.\nC: The behavior is inherited from the bird's parents.\nD: The behavior is learned over the lifetime of the bird.",
  "steps": [
    "The bird is consistently avoiding a specific butterfly species, which suggests that this behavior is not random. Therefore, option A (The behavior is a random act) can be eliminated.",
    "A genetic mutation typically affects physical characteristics or traits, and does not explain learned behaviors or species-specific avoidance in this context. Therefore, option B (The behavior is the result of a genetic mutation) can also be eliminated.",
    "Since the bird is actively avoiding a specific species of butterfly, it is more likely that this behavior is either inherited (passed down genetically) or learned through experience.",
    "Given that the bird is avoiding one specific butterfly species and still eats other types, it suggests that this behavior might have been learned rather than completely inherited from its parents. Therefore, option C (The behavior is inherited from the bird's parents) seems less likely compared to option D.",
    "Considering that the behavior involves avoiding a specific species, which could be learned from experiences (such as past negative encounters with that species), option D (The behavior is learned over the lifetime of the bird) is the most plausible explanation."
