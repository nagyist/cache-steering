  "query": "Question: A sound is heard when you pluck a string on a guitar. What will happen to the sound if the same string is plucked harder?\n\nChoices:\nA: The volume will stay the same, and the pitch will be higher.\nB: The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.\nC: Both the pitch and the volume will be higher.\nD: Both the pitch and the volume will stay the same.",
  "steps": [
    "When a string on a guitar is plucked, it vibrates to produce sound, which has both pitch (frequency) and volume (amplitude).",
    "Plucking the string harder increases the amplitude of the vibration, which results in a louder sound (higher volume).",
    "The frequency of the string's vibration, and thus the pitch of the sound, remains determined by factors such as the string's length, tension, and thickness, which don't change when plucked harder.",
    "Therefore, when the same string is plucked harder, the volume increases while the pitch stays the same."
