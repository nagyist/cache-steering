  "query": "Question: Which statement is true about the particles of a liquid compared to the particles of a gas?\n\nChoices:\nA: Particles of a liquid are a slower and further apart.\nB: Particles of a liquid are faster and farther apart.\nC: Particles of a liquid are slower and closer together.\nD: Particles of a liquid are faster and closer together.",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to compare the behavior and arrangement of particles in liquids versus gases. In liquids, particles are generally more closely packed than in gases.",
    "Next, I need to consider the motion of the particles. In a gas, particles move rapidly and are not closely packed, whereas in a liquid, the particles have more freedom to move than in a solid but are not as fast as in gases.",
    "Based on these observations, I conclude that particles in a liquid are slower than those in a gas and are closer together than those of a gas, which are further apart."
