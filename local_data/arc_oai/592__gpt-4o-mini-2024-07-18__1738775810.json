  "query": "Question: Which of the following represents the process of photosynthesis?\n\nChoices:\nA: C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} -> 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O\nB: 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} +6O_{2}\nC: 2H_{2}O -> 2H_{2} + O_{2}\nD: 2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O",

    "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose (C6H12O6) using carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), while releasing oxygen (O2) as a byproduct.",
    "To find the correct representation, I need to look for a reaction that starts with carbon dioxide and water and produces glucose and oxygen.",
    "Option A states that glucose is converted into carbon dioxide and water, which is the reverse of photosynthesis and not correct.",
    "Option C shows water being broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, which is not the process of photosynthesis.",
    "Option D shows hydrogen reacting with oxygen to form water, which also does not represent photosynthesis.",
    "Option B displays the correct equation for photosynthesis: it starts with 6 carbon dioxide molecules and 6 water molecules to produce 1 glucose molecule and 6 oxygen molecules."
