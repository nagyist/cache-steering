  "query": "Question: A certain species of endangered parrots lives on an island that can be seriously affected by large floods. Which of these is considered a negative impact to the parrot population from flooding?\n\nChoices:\nA: a decrease in the availability of food\nB: a decrease in populations of predators\nC: an increase in suitable nesting locations\nD: an increase in places to hide from danger",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify what a negative impact on the parrot population from flooding would be. Flooding typically disrupts the environment and can harm wildlife.",
    "Option A states that there would be a decrease in the availability of food. Flooding can drown plants and reduce food resources, which is a negative impact for the parrots.",
    "Option B suggests a decrease in populations of predators. If predators decrease, this would generally be a positive impact for the parrots, as it would reduce threats to their population.",
    "Option C mentions an increase in suitable nesting locations. While flooding might create new areas for nesting, it is generally not considered a direct benefit, particularly if it also destroys existing habitats.",
    "Option D discusses an increase in places to hide from danger. While hiding spots might increase, the overall adverse effects of flooding would likely outweigh this as a benefit."
