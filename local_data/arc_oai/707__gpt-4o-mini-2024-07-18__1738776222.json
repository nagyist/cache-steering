  "query": "Question: Sound waves travel fastest in\n\nChoices:\nA: air.\nB: iron.\nC: water.\nD: a vacuum.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to recall how sound waves travel through different mediums\u2014solid, liquid, and gas. Sound travels fastest in solids.",
    "Next, I can compare the choices presented: air (gas), iron (solid), water (liquid), and a vacuum (no medium).",
    "I remember that sound cannot travel in a vacuum at all since there are no particles to transmit the sound waves.",
    "Among the remaining options, sound waves will travel fastest in iron as a solid compared to water and air since the density and elasticity of solids allow for faster sound propagation."
