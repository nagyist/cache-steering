  "query": "Question: When a blue light is shone on a yellow banana, what color does the banana appear to be?\n\nChoices:\nA: blue\nB: yellow\nC: green\nD: black",
  "steps": [
    "A yellow banana reflects yellow light. When illuminated with blue light, the banana cannot reflect blue light because it does not contain the pigment to reflect that color.",
    "Under blue light, the colors that the yellow banana can reflect would be limited to those that it absorbs. Since yellow absorbs blue light, it cannot reflect any color, resulting in an absence of visible color.",
    "In the absence of reflected light, the banana will appear to be black or very dark, as there is no light being returned to our eyes."
