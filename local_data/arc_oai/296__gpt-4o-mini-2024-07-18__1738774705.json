  "query": "Question: Which of these stars is most similar to the Sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: the red giant star Arcturus\nB: the white dwarf star Sirius B\nC: the main sequence star Alpha Mensae\nD: the blue supergiant star Rigel",
  "steps": [
    "The Sun is classified as a G-type main-sequence star (G dwarf). To identify a star similar to the Sun, we should look for stars that also belong to the main sequence and are of a similar spectral type.",
    "Among the options given, only Alpha Mensae is identified as a main-sequence star. The other options (Arcturus, Sirius B, and Rigel) do not fall under the same classification: Arcturus is a red giant, Sirius B is a white dwarf, and Rigel is a blue supergiant.",
    "Since the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, we should evaluate Alpha Mensae: it is classified as a G-type main-sequence star as well, making it the most similar to the Sun in terms of both type and position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram."
