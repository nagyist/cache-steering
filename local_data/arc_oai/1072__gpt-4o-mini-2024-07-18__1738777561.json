  "query": "Question: Which statement correctly describes a relationship between the distance from Earth and a characteristic of a star?\n\nChoices:\nA: As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases.\nB: As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases.\nC: As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases.\nD: As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases.",
  "steps": [
    "The apparent brightness of a star is the brightness observed from Earth, which is influenced by both its actual luminosity and its distance from Earth.",
    "When the distance from Earth to a star decreases, the light from that star has less distance to travel, resulting in an increase in apparent brightness.",
    "Conversely, if the distance from Earth to a star increases, the apparent brightness decreases because the light spreads out over a larger area.",
    "Therefore, the relationship can be summarized as: as the distance decreases, the apparent brightness increases."

  "solution": "C"
