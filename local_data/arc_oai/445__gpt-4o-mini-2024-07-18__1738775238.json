  "query": "Question: What is a benefit of the regulation of gene expression?\n\nChoices:\nA: conservation of genetic information\nB: conservation of cell resources\nC: trait adaptation to environmental change\nD: trait inheritance in offspring",
  "steps": [
    "The regulation of gene expression allows cells to control which genes are turned on or off at any given time.",
    "This control helps ensure that the cell uses its resources efficiently by producing only the necessary proteins and enzymes for specific functions.",
    "By conserving cell resources, the organism can better respond to environmental changes and adapt traits necessary for survival.",
    "While all options have importance, the aspect of conserving resources directly ties to efficiency in gene regulation and adaptation to changing environments."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
