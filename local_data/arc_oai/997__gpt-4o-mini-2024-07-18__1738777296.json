Which is the least likely way for the students to generate a wave?\n\nChoices:\nA: by tossing a ball in the air\nB: by shaking the ends of a rope\nC: by throwing a pebble into a pool of water\nD: by pulling on a coiled spring toy",
  "steps": [
    "Consider what constitutes wave generation. Waves are typically produced by some form of disturbance or movement.",
    "Option A involves tossing a ball in the air, which does not create a wave; rather, it creates a projectile motion.",
    "Option B, shaking the ends of a rope, is a well-known method to generate waves, particularly transverse waves.",
    "Option C, throwing a pebble into a pool of water, creates surface waves, which is another common method of wave generation.",
    "Option D, pulling on a coiled spring toy, also generates waves, as this creates compression and rarefaction in the coils, producing longitudinal waves.",
    "Among the options, tossing a ball does not generate waves at all, making it the least likely way for students to generate a wave."
