  "query": "Question: In a tropical rainforest, the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures is relatively small. In the desert, the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures is very large. Which factor contributes to the lower variation in rainforest temperatures?\n\nChoices:\nA: Foliage in the rainforest reflects heat.\nB: Organisms in the rainforest absorb moisture.\nC: Solar radiation in the rainforest is less intense.\nD: Cloud cover in the rainforest helps to retain heat.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the factor that contributes to lower temperature variation in a rainforest compared to a desert.",
    "In a rainforest, the coverage of vegetation and foliage is dense, which could help in retaining heat and maintaining stable temperatures.",
    "Cloud cover is also prevalent in tropical rainforests due to high humidity and frequent precipitation, which can further insulate the area and limit temperature swings between day and night.",
    "Considering the answer choices, option D states that \"Cloud cover in the rainforest helps to retain heat,\" which aligns with the idea that cloud cover reduces temperature variation."
