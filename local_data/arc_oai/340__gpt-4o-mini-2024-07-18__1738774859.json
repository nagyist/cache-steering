  "query": "Question: Which is true about reproduction for both an amoeba and a paramecium?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both can conjugate.\nB: Neither can conjugate.\nC: An amoeba can conjugate, but a paramecium cannot.\nD: A paramecium can conjugate, but an amoeba cannot.",
  "steps": [
    "Amoebas reproduce asexually through binary fission and do not have a process of conjugation.",
    "Paramecium can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and they do have a process called conjugation, which involves two paramecia exchanging genetic material.",
    "Since amoebas do not conjugate and paramecia can, the statement \"both can conjugate\" is false.",
    "The statement \"neither can conjugate\" is also false because paramecium can conjugate.",
    "The statements regarding amoeba conjugating but paramecium cannot are both false since paramecium can conjugate.",
    "Thus, the only remaining option states that a paramecium can conjugate, which is true, while an amoeba cannot, which is also true."

  "solution": "D"
