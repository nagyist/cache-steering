  "query": "Question: The crust, the mantle, and the core are structures of Earth. Which description is a feature of Earth's mantle?\n\nChoices:\nA: contains fossil remains\nB: consists of tectonic plates\nC: is located at the center of Earth\nD: has properties of both liquids and solids",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a description that is specific to Earth's mantle.",
    "Option A mentions fossil remains, which are usually found in the crust, not the mantle.",
    "Option B states that the mantle consists of tectonic plates, which are actually part of the lithosphere (including the crust), not the mantle itself.",
    "Option C claims that the mantle is located at the center of the Earth, but that description refers to the core, not the mantle.",
    "Option D states that the mantle has properties of both liquids and solids. This is correct as the mantle behaves as a solid but can flow slowly over time, demonstrating both solid and liquid properties."
