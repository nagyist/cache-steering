    "Evaluating and interpreting data involves analyzing the gathered information to derive meaningful insights, which is crucial for making informed conclusions.",
    "While classifying and sequencing methods (A) and developing multiple hypotheses (C) are important steps in the investigative process, they serve as preliminary frameworks rather than the final step in reaching a conclusion.",
    "Predicting the most likely outcome (D) can help guide the investigation but does not provide definitive conclusions based on evidence."
