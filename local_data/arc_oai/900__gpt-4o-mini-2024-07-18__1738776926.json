  "query": "Question: All of the following are examples of erosion EXCEPT:\n\nChoices:\nA: The wind in the desert blows sand against a rock.\nB: A glacier picks up boulders as it moves.\nC: A flood washes over a riverbank, and the water carries small soil particles downstream.\nD: An icy winter causes the pavement in a road to crack.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's review the definition of erosion. Erosion involves the process by which soil and rock are removed from one location and transported to another by wind, water, or ice.",
    "Next, analyze each option for whether it represents erosion. Option A describes wind carrying sand, which is erosion. Option B describes a glacier moving boulders, which is also erosion. Option C involves floodwater carrying soil particles downstream, making it a clear case of erosion as well.",
    "Lastly, consider Option D, where an icy winter causes pavement to crack. This is not about the movement of materials caused by transport; rather, it points to a physical change in materials due to temperature fluctuations, which is more like weathering than erosion."
