  "query": "Question: A college student looks through a microscope at blood cells and states that red blood cells are more important than white blood cells. This statement is a\n\nChoices:\nA: statement of fact.\nB: scientific conclusion.\nC: scientific hypothesis.\nD: statement of opinion.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the nature of the student's statement about blood cells. The student claims that red blood cells are more important than white blood cells.",
    "Next, I consider whether this statement is an objective fact or subjective opinion. Importance can be subjective, as it can vary based on context, such as whether one is looking at oxygen transport (red blood cells) or immune response (white blood cells).",
    "I also reflect on the terminology of the choices provided. A statement of fact would be an objectively verifiable fact, a scientific conclusion would imply results from experiments, a scientific hypothesis would suggest a testable prediction, while a statement of opinion is a personal belief or judgment.",
    "Since the student\u2019s assertion about importance is subjective and reflects their personal viewpoint rather than an objective measure, it fits the definition of a statement of opinion."
