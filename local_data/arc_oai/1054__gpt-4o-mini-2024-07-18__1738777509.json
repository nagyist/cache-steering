  "query": "Question: What would be the best evidence that two substances are made of different types of matter?\n\nChoices:\nA: Two substances have different reactions to light.\nB: Two substances have different temperatures.\nC: Two substances have different volumes.\nD: Two substances have different shapes.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine if two substances are made of different types of matter, we need to consider evidence that reflects their intrinsic properties rather than physical conditions like temperature or volume.",
    "Option A, which suggests that different reactions to light can indicate different types of matter, focuses on how the substances interact with energy, which could reveal differences in chemical structure.",
    "Options B, C, and D are influenced by external factors or physical states: temperature can vary due to environmental conditions, volume can change with temperature, and shapes can differ based on how substances are manipulated or arranged.",
    "Thus, the most reliable indicator of different types of matter would be a difference in how they react to light, since this reflects differing properties inherent to the materials themselves."
