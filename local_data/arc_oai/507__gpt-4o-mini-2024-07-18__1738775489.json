  "query": "Question: An appliance manufacturer has redesigned its original electrical fan. It has made the new fan more energy efficient. This means that the new fan\n\nChoices:\nA: converts more electricity into heat.\nB: spins at a slower rate than the original fan.\nC: requires more electricity than the original fan.\nD: reduces the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere.",
  "steps": [
    "The new fan being described as \"more energy efficient\" implies that it uses less electricity for the same or improved performance compared to the original model.",
    "If the fan is more energy efficient, it would likely reduce waste energy in the form of heat rather than increasing it. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",
    "Spinning at a slower rate might suggest less energy use, but energy efficiency does not necessarily mean operating at a lower speed; it can also mean maximizing the output while still using less power. So, option B is not necessarily true.",
    "If the new fan required more electricity, it could not be considered more energy efficient. Thus, option C is incorrect.",
    "Reducing the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere would indicate that the fan is retaining more of the energy supplied to it, making it more efficient. This matches the definition of being energy efficient. Therefore, option D is a valid conclusion."
