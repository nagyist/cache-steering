  "query": "Question: What most likely happens when a cold air mass comes into contact with a warm, moist air mass?\n\nChoices:\nA: The sky becomes clear.\nB: Rain or snow begins to fall.\nC: Cold air is pushed to high altitudes.\nD: Warm air is pushed to ground level.",
  "steps": [
    "When a cold air mass meets a warm, moist air mass, the cold air, being denser, tends to slide underneath the warm air.",
    "As the warm air is lifted, it cools and condenses, which can lead to cloud formation and precipitation.",
    "This process often results in various forms of precipitation, such as rain or snow, depending on the temperatures of the air masses involved."
