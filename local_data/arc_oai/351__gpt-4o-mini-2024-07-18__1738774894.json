  "query": "Question: Which element makes up most of the air we breathe.\n\nChoices:\nA: carbon\nB: nitrogen\nC: oxygen\nD: argon",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the composition of the Earth's atmosphere.",
    "The atmosphere is primarily composed of several gases, with some present in much larger quantities than others.",
    "Specifically, I should look at the proportions of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and argon.",
    "Nitrogen constitutes about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, while oxygen makes up about 21%.",
    "Carbon is present in much smaller amounts, and argon also contributes a small fraction.",
    "Since nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the air we breathe, it stands out compared to oxygen, carbon, and argon."
