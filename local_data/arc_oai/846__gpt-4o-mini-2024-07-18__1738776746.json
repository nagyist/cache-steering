  "query": "Question: Some foods that humans eat, such as corn and peas, are actually seeds from plants. What best describes the role of humans in a food web containing these plants?\n\nChoices:\nA: a consumer\nB: a decomposer\nC: a producer\nD: a scavenger",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the role of humans in a food web. In a food web, producers create their own food (like plants through photosynthesis), consumers eat plants or other animals, decomposers break down dead organic matter, and scavengers consume leftover remains of dead organisms.",
    "Humans eat plants like corn and peas, which means they are deriving energy and nutrients from these producers. Therefore, humans are not producing their own food in this context.",
    "Since humans consume these plants as part of their diet, they fit into the category of consumers in the food web. They do not perform the roles of decomposers, producers, or scavengers in this context but rather utilize what producers (plants) provide."
