  "query": "Question: When is wood a nonrenewable resource?\n\nChoices:\nA: When more trees are harvested than are replanted.\nB: When trees are harvested and replanted at the same rate.\nC: When trees are used as an energy resource.\nD: When trees are used as a material resource.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine when wood is considered a nonrenewable resource, we need to understand the definitions of renewable and nonrenewable resources. Renewable resources can replenish themselves over time, while nonrenewable resources cannot be replaced once depleted.",
    "A scenario where wood becomes a nonrenewable resource would occur when the rate of tree harvesting exceeds the rate of replanting. If more trees are cut down than are planted, the overall supply of trees diminishes, leading to a depletion of this resource over time.",
    "In contrast, if trees are harvested and replanted at the same pace, the wood would remain a renewable resource. Similarly, using wood for energy or materials does not inherently make it nonrenewable unless the harvesting process is unsustainable.",
    "Given the choices, option A directly aligns with the definition of wood becoming nonrenewable, as it emphasizes unsustainable harvesting practices. Options B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the conditions under which wood is classified as a nonrenewable resource."
