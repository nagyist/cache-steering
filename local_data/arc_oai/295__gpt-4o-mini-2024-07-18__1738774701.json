  "query": "Question: When a compression wave travels through a medium, in what direction is the medium displaced?\n\nChoices:\nA: upward\nB: downward\nC: in the same direction\nD: in the opposite direction",
  "steps": [
    "A compression wave, like a sound wave, consists of regions of compression and rarefaction within the medium through which it travels.",
    "In a compression wave, the particles of the medium are displaced from their equilibrium positions to create areas of high pressure (compression) and low pressure (rarefaction).",
    "The displacement of the medium's particles occurs in the same direction as the wave is propagating, meaning as the wave travels, the particles move back and forth in line with the direction of the wave."
