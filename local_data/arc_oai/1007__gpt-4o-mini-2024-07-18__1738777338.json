In addition to the loss of habitat, what most likely caused this frog population to decline?\n\nChoices:\nA: an increase in a food source\nB: more frog breeding grounds\nC: native wetlands preservation\nD: poisons dissolved in the water",
  "steps": [
    "The mountain chorus frog is endangered, which typically indicates that it faces significant threats that negatively impact its population.",
    "Considering the potential causes of decline in frog populations, habitat loss is often a significant factor, but other environmental issues can also contribute.",
    "Among the options, an increase in food sources (A) and more breeding grounds (B) would generally have a positive effect, not contribute to decline.",
    "Native wetlands preservation (C) would help protect the species rather than cause decline, making it unlikely to be a contributing factor.",
    "Poison dissolved in the water (D) is a plausible reason for population decline as chemical pollutants can adversely affect amphibians by reducing reproductive success and increasing mortality rates."
