  "query": "Question: Which activity is an example of a chemical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: sugar dissolving in water\nB: water evaporating in air\nC: lighting a match\nD: freezing water",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify the definition of a chemical change. A chemical change occurs when substances combine or break apart to form new substances with different properties.",
    "Next, I will analyze each option to determine if it represents a chemical change. \nOption A, sugar dissolving in water, is a physical change because the sugar can be recovered without any alteration to its chemical structure.",
    "For option B, water evaporating in air is also a physical change, as it involves a change of state from liquid to gas without changing the chemical composition of water (H2O).",
    "Next, I will examine option C, lighting a match. This process involves combustion, which transforms the chemical structure of the match stick and produces light, heat, and new chemical substances (e.g., ash, gases).",
    "Lastly, option D, freezing water, is a physical change because it involves a change of state from liquid to solid, without altering the chemical structure of water.",
    "After examining all options, only lighting a match (option C) results in new substances being formed, making it an example of a chemical change."
