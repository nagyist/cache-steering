  "query": "Question: What is the relationship between a community and a population?\n\nChoices:\nA: A population is smaller than a community.\nB: A population is larger than a community.\nC: A population includes communities of organisms interacting.\nD: A community includes populations of organisms interacting.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what a community is. A community is a group of different species that live together in a particular area and interact with each other.",
    "Next, we define a population. A population refers to a group of individuals of the same species that live in a particular area at the same time.",
    "Now, we analyze the relationship between a community and a population. Since a community consists of multiple species, it will naturally contain several populations of different species interacting in that area.",
    "From the definitions and the analysis, we can deduce that a community encompasses multiple populations rather than the other way around."
