  "query": "Question: After a soccer game, Brittany sat under a fan because she was hot. Under the fan, she felt cooler than before. Which explains why Brittany felt cooler under the fan?\n\nChoices:\nA: Air moving under the fan is cooler than air that is still.\nB: The evaporation of sweat absorbs heat from the skin.\nC: Water vapor from the fan condenses on the skin.\nD: The fan speeds convection currents in the air.",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the effect of the fan on the airflow around Brittany. The fan creates moving air, which can enhance the cooling effect on a person's skin.",
    "Evaluate the choices based on the principles of heat transfer. The sensation of cooling can largely be attributed to the evaporation of sweat, which lowers skin temperature as heat is absorbed.",
    "Analyze each option: Option A suggests cool air; Option B points to evaporation effects; Option C discusses condensation, which would typically create warmth rather than coolness; Option D mentions convection currents, which does relate to air movement but does not explicitly mention cooling through evaporation.",
    "Among the options, Option B best explains the mechanism by which Brittany feels cooler, as the evaporation of sweat from her skin due to the moving air under the fan results in heat being absorbed from her body, leading to a cooling effect."
