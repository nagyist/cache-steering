  "query": "Question: Which of the following human traits is least likely to be inherited?\n\nChoices:\nA: height\nB: eye color\nC: hair color\nD: fingerprints",
  "steps": [
    "I will evaluate which of the listed traits is most influenced by genetics and which is less likely to be inherited.",
    "Traits such as height, eye color, and hair color are well-documented to be heritable and influenced by genetic factors.",
    "Fingerprints, however, are not inherited in the same way as the other traits. They are influenced by environmental factors during fetal development, making them unique to each individual despite having some genetic predisposition.",
    "Comparing the four traits, I conclude that fingerprints are least likely to be directly inherited in the way that height, eye color, and hair color are."
