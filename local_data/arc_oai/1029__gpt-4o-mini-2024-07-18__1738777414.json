  "query": "Question: Whenever scientists carefully measure any quantity many times, they expect that\n\nChoices:\nA: all of the measurements will be exactly the same\nB: only two of the measurements will be exactly the same\nC: all but one of the measurements will be exactly the same\nD: most of the measurements will be close but not exactly the same",
  "steps": [
    "When scientists measure a quantity multiple times, they are aware of the inherent variability in measurements due to factors such as instrument precision, environmental conditions, and human error.",
    "They understand that while they strive for precision, it is unlikely that every single measurement will be identical due to these variabilities.",
    "Typically, scientists expect that the majority of the measurements will cluster around a central value (mean or median) but recognize that there can be small variations.",
    "Thus, the most reasonable expectation is that most measurements will be similar but may contain slight differences."
