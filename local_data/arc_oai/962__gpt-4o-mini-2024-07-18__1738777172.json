  "query": "Question: Food webs show feeding relationships among different types of organisms. Those organisms each have a specific niche. Which of the following best describes a function of decomposers in food webs?\n\nChoices:\nA: to recycle nutrients into soil\nB: to convert solar energy into food\nC: to provide food for secondary consumers\nD: to compete with secondary consumers for oxygen",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what decomposers do within an ecosystem. Decomposers break down dead organic material, such as dead plants and animals.",
    "Next, we consider the role of decomposers in recycling nutrients. As they break down organic matter, they release essential nutrients back into the soil, which can then be used by plants.",
    "Now, we evaluate the provided choices in relation to the function of decomposers. \nChoice A states that decomposers recycle nutrients into the soil, which aligns perfectly with what decomposers do.",
    "We then examine the other choices. Choice B suggests that decomposers convert solar energy into food; this is incorrect since primary producers (like plants) perform that function. \nChoice C indicates that decomposers provide food for secondary consumers, which is inaccurate because secondary consumers feed on primary consumers or producers, not decomposers.\nChoice D claims that decomposers compete with secondary consumers for oxygen, which is not relevant to the function of decomposers."
