  "query": "Question: Which statement is the best description of what happens in the rock cycle?\n\nChoices:\nA: Rocks on old mountains are gradually weathered away while mountain building and volcanism form new mountains.\nB: Once formed, rocks stay in place until rocks above them are weathered away, and they reach the surface.\nC: As sedimentary rocks are buried deep below other rocks, they are changed by heat and pressure, eventually return to the surface, and are weathered again.\nD: Younger sedimentary rocks are always deposited on top of older metamorphic or igneous rocks.",
  "steps": [
    "The rock cycle describes the continuous process that rocks undergo, including formation, breakdown, and reformation over geological time.",
    "Choice A mentions weathering of old mountains and formation of new mountains, which is a part of the cycle but does not encompass the broader processes involved in the entire rock cycle.",
    "Choice B implies that rocks remain in place until weathered away, which simplifies the processes and does not acknowledge the transformation and movement of rocks in the cycle.",
    "Choice C describes the transformation of sedimentary rocks under heat and pressure, their eventual return to the surface, and subsequent weathering, which accurately captures key elements of the rock cycle.",
    "Choice D states that younger sedimentary rocks are always deposited on top of older metamorphic or igneous rocks, which is not a universal truth, as sedimentary rocks can also form above other sedimentary rocks."
