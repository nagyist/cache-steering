  "query": "Question: Sea-floor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries. Which statement best identifies the geologic process taking place at the point where sea-floor spreading occurs?\n\nChoices:\nA: a trench is forming\nB: new crust is forming\nC: oceanic crust is subducting\nD: a continental plate is subducting",
  "steps": [
    "Sea-floor spreading is a process that occurs at divergent boundaries where tectonic plates move apart from each other.",
    "As the tectonic plates separate, magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap, leading to the formation of new oceanic crust.",
    "Given this process, the statement that best identifies what happens at the point where sea-floor spreading occurs is that new crust is being formed."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
