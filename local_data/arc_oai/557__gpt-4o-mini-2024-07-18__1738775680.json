  "query": "Question: Which of these is true when a piece of wood is completely burned in a fire?\n\nChoices:\nA: The change in the wood is reversible.\nB: The energy in the wood is destroyed.\nC: The change in the wood is physical.\nD: The energy in the wood is transformed.",
  "steps": [
    "When a piece of wood is burned, it undergoes a chemical change; its structure and composition change irreversibly.",
    "The energy in the wood is not destroyed but rather transformed into heat energy and other products like carbon dioxide and ash during combustion.",
    "The change that occurs in the wood when it burns is not physical but chemical, as new substances are formed.",
    "Since the energy is transformed rather than destroyed, and the change is chemical and irreversible, the correct statement must refer to the transformation of energy."

  "solution": "D"
