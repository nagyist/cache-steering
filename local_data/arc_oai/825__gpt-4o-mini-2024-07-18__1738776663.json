  "query": "Question: A change in the density of air can result in a breeze. Which diagram best shows a series of energy transfers that begins with the Sun and results in a breeze?\n\nChoices:\nA: radiation \u2192 conduction \u2192 breeze\nB: radiation \u2192 conduction \u2192 convection \u2192 breeze\nC: convection \u2192 radiation \u2192 breeze\nD: convection \u2192 conduction \u2192 radiation \u2192 breeze",
  "steps": [
    "We know that the Sun provides energy through radiation, which heats the Earth's surface and the air above it.",
    "The heated air becomes less dense and begins to rise, creating a temperature difference that leads to movement of air, which is known as convection.",
    "The rise of warm air allows cooler air to move in, creating a breeze, which is a result of this convection process.",
    "The diagram that correctly follows this sequence is one that shows radiation from the Sun, followed by conduction of heat into the air, followed by convection that ultimately leads to a breeze."
