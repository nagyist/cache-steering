  "query": "Question: What is a difference between mitosis and meiosis?\n\nChoices:\nA: Mitosis occurs in all the cells in animals and plants, while meiosis occurs in only in bacteria.\nB: In mitosis, the products are identical to the parent cell, while in meiosis the products are different from the parent cell.\nC: In mitosis, one cell divides into two cells, while in meiosis two cells combine to make one cell.\nD: Mitosis involves separating the chromosomes, while meiosis involves only the cytoplasm of the cell.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what mitosis and meiosis are. Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, while meiosis is a type of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and eggs) with half the number of chromosomes.",
    "Next, let's evaluate the choices provided. Choice A mentions that meiosis occurs only in bacteria, which is incorrect as meiosis occurs in eukaryotes for the production of gametes, not in bacteria.",
    "Then, looking at choice B, it states that in mitosis the products are identical to the parent cell, which is true, and that in meiosis the products are different, also true, thus making it a valid difference between the two processes.",
    "Now, analyzing choice C, it states that in mitosis one cell divides into two cells, which is correct, but it incorrectly states that in meiosis, two cells combine to make one cell. This is false; meiosis actually reduces the chromosome number, resulting in four distinct cells.",
    "Finally, in choice D, it claims that mitosis involves separating chromosomes but meiosis involves only the cytoplasm, which is incorrect as meiosis also involves the separation of chromosomes just like mitosis, in addition to separating the cell's cytoplasm multiple times."
