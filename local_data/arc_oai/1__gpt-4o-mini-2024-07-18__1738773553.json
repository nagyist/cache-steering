  "query": "Question: Which of the following statements best explains why magnets usually stick to a refrigerator door?\n\nChoices:\nA: The refrigerator door is smooth.\nB: The refrigerator door contains iron.\nC: The refrigerator door is a good conductor.\nD: The refrigerator door has electric wires in it.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what allows magnets to stick to surfaces. Magnets typically stick to ferromagnetic materials, which are materials that can be magnetized or are attracted to magnets.",
    "Next, we consider the options given. Option A states that the refrigerator door is smooth, which relates to its surface texture and not its magnetic properties. This does not explain why magnets stick.",
    "Option C states that the refrigerator door is a good conductor. While conductors can be made of certain metals, being a conductor does not necessarily mean it will attract magnets.",
    "Option D talks about electric wires in the refrigerator door. Even if there are wires, this does not directly relate to the material properties required for magnets to stick.",
    "Lastly, Option B mentions that the refrigerator door contains iron, which is a well-known ferromagnetic material. This means that the door can attract the magnetic field and hence allows magnets to stick."
