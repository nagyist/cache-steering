  "query": "Question: In a series of chemical reactions, X\u2192Y\u2192Z\u2192A, X converts to Y, Y converts to Z, and Z converts to A. Which term describes the process if the production of A interferes with the conversion of X to Y?\n\nChoices:\nA: a complimentary response\nB: a control system\nC: negative feedback\nD: positive feedback",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a sequence of chemical reactions where the formation of the final product A affects the initial conversion of X to Y.",
    "In biological systems, when a product (in this case, A) inhibits a reaction that leads to its own production (the conversion of X to Y), it often represents a regulatory mechanism to maintain homeostasis.",
    "This mechanism is known as negative feedback, where the output of a process reduces or inhibits its own production.",
    "I can eliminate the other options: a complimentary response (A) doesn't fit the concept described, a control system (B) is too vague without specific context, and positive feedback (D) would imply that A enhances the conversion of X to Y instead of inhibiting it."
