  "steps": [
    "To avoid being eaten by hawks or owls, a forest animal would need to think about how to avoid detection or attack from these birds of prey.",
    "Small size (choice A) may help the animal hide better, but it does not offer significant protection from airborne predators looking for prey.",
    "Sharp claws (choice B) can be useful for fighting back if captured but do not help in avoiding detection from above.",
    "Bright color (choice C) would likely make the animal more visible to hawks and owls, making this choice ineffective for camouflage or escape.",
    "An underground home (choice D) would provide safety from aerial predators, allowing the animal to hide and avoid being seen or attacked by hawks and owls."
