  "query": "Question: Which structure does a virus have in common with a prokaryotic cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: cell wall\nB: nucleic acid\nC: ribosome\nD: capsid",
  "steps": [
    "A virus and a prokaryotic cell both have genetic material, which is classified as nucleic acid. This structure is essential for carrying the genetic information necessary for replication and function.",
    "While prokaryotic cells have a cell wall, viruses do not possess cell walls; thus, choice A is incorrect.",
    "Viruses do not have ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis and are found in prokaryotic cells. Therefore, choice C is also incorrect.",
    "Viruses do have a protective protein coat called a capsid, but this is not a feature found in prokaryotic cells. Thus, choice D is incorrect as well."
