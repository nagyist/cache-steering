  "steps": [
    "The question states that water enters the cell and waste material leaves the cell through the cell membrane.",
    "For both water and waste material to pass through the cell membrane, it must allow certain substances to enter while restricting others.",
    "This property of the cell membrane indicates that it is not completely impermeable; rather, it selectively allows certain molecules to pass through based on size, charge, or other factors.",
    "The term that describes a membrane that allows certain substances to pass while blocking others is \"semi-permeable.\""
