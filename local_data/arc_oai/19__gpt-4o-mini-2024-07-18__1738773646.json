  "query": "Question: What do cells break down to produce energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: food\nB: water\nC: chlorophyll\nD: carbon dioxide",
  "steps": [
    "Cells break down various substances to produce energy. One primary source for most cells is food, which provides the nutrients necessary for energy production.",
    "Water, while essential for many cellular processes, is not primarily broken down to produce energy; instead, it is often a byproduct of processes like cellular respiration.",
    "Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants that is involved in photosynthesis, allowing plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. However, it is not a substance that cells break down to produce energy.",
    "Carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration. Cells do not break it down for energy; rather, they produce it when they metabolize food."
