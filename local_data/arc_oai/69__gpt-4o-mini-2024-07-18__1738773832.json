  "steps": [
    "Elements in the same group in the Periodic Table have similar chemical properties due to having the same number of valence electrons.",
    "Chemical reactivity is primarily determined by the number of valence electrons; thus, elements in the same group tend to react similarly with other substances.",
    "While atomic mass, number of protons, and atomic size can vary within a group, the greatest similarity in behavior comes from chemical reactivity."

  "solution": "D"
