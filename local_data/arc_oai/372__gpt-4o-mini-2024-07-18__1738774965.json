  "query": "Question: A researcher examines a marine organism that is the size of an average human hand. Without more information, which statement about the organism is most likely accurate?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is mobile.\nB: It has organ systems.\nC: It is made of many cells.\nD: It makes its own food.",
  "steps": [
    "The organism is described as being the size of an average human hand, which suggests it is likely a small marine creature such as a mollusk or a small fish.",
    "If the organism is a living creature, it is most likely made up of many cells, as all complex organisms are multicellular.",
    "While many multicellular organisms are mobile, some, such as certain types of coral, may not be mobile despite being multicellular.",
    "Not all marine organisms have complex organ systems; for example, some simpler organisms like sponges do not have true organ systems.",
    "It is also likely that not all marine organisms make their own food, as many are heterotrophic and rely on consuming other organisms.",
    "Given that the organism is likely a small multicellular creature, the statement that it is made of many cells is the most universally applicable."
