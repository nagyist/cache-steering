  "steps": [
    "To determine which process in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates, we need to consider what sexual reproduction involves. In vertebrates, sexual reproduction typically involves the combination of genetic material from two parents to produce offspring with genetic diversity.",
    "In plants, sexual reproduction involves the production of seeds from ovules, which are fertilized by pollen grains. This process often requires the involvement of two different plants to achieve genetic variation, similar to the way sexual reproduction in vertebrates works.",
    "Among the options, cross-pollination is the process where pollen from one plant fertilizes the ovule of another plant, leading to genetic variation in the seeds produced. This concept aligns closely with the idea of using genetic material from two different sources, as seen in sexual reproduction in vertebrates.",
    "Self-pollination involves a single plant fertilizing itself, resulting in less genetic variation. Therefore, it is not as similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates.",
    "Cell division and seed development, while related to plant reproduction, do not closely mirror the process of combining genetic material from two parents as sexual reproduction in vertebrates does."
