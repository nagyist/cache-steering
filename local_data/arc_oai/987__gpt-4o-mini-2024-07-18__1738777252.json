  "query": "Question: Which of these has the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun?\n\nChoices:\nA: air\nB: land\nC: oceans\nD: plants",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the specific heat capacity of each option. Air has a relatively low specific heat capacity, making it less effective at storing thermal energy.",
    "Next, land also has a moderate specific heat capacity, but it can heat up and cool down quickly compared to bodies of water.",
    "Looking at oceans, they have a high specific heat capacity due to their large volume and the water's ability to absorb and store thermal energy effectively.",
    "Finally, while plants can store some thermal energy, they do not have the same capacity as oceans since they are mostly composed of water and do not cover large areas in comparison."
