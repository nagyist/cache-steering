  "query": "Question: James put some water in a pan. He put the pan on a stove and turned the stove on low. What will happen to the water?\n\nChoices:\nA: The water will melt.\nB: The water will evaporate.\nC: The water will form a solid.\nD: The water will condense into tiny droplets.",
  "steps": [
    "The water is placed in a pan and heated on a low stove setting.",
    "Heating the water will increase its temperature, which can lead to changes in its state.",
    "At low heat, water does not reach boiling but can still evaporate slowly.",
    "The other options such as melting, forming a solid, or condensing do not apply to water in this scenario."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
