  "query": "Question: Wind turbines are being used to generate electricity in many parts of the United States. One advantage of wind turbines is that no fossil fuels are burned. Which of the following is a disadvantage of wind turbines?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wind turbines can emit dangerous radiation if damaged.\nB: Wind turbine farms must be located near large bodies of water.\nC: Wind turbines do not produce energy until many years after being built.\nD: Wind turbine farms require a lot of area compared to how much energy they produce.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is looking for a disadvantage of wind turbines in comparison to other methods of generating electricity.",
    "Choice A states that wind turbines can emit dangerous radiation if damaged. This is not true; wind turbines do not emit radiation.",
    "Choice B suggests that wind turbine farms must be located near large bodies of water. This is incorrect; wind turbines can be installed on land and do not require proximity to water bodies.",
    "Choice C claims that wind turbines do not produce energy until many years after being built. This is misleading; while it may take time for the investment to pay off, wind turbines begin generating electricity as soon as they are built and operational.",
    "Choice D states that wind turbine farms require a lot of area compared to how much energy they produce. This is a valid concern, as wind farms typically need significant land space for installation, which can limit where they can be placed and may not yield as much energy compared to the land used."
