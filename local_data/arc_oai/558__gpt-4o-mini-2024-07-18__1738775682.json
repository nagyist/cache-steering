  "query": "Question: Many scientists think that burning fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. What effect would the increase of carbon dioxide most likely have on the planet?\n\nChoices:\nA: a cooler climate\nB: a warmer climate\nC: lower relative humidity\nD: more ozone in the atmosphere",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the effects of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to burning fossil fuels.",
    "Many scientists agree that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which means it can trap heat in the atmosphere.",
    "An increase in greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, typically results in a warming effect on the planet, leading to a warmer climate.",
    "Choices A, C, and D represent scenarios (a cooler climate, lower relative humidity, and more ozone) that are not consistent with the known effects of increased carbon dioxide."
