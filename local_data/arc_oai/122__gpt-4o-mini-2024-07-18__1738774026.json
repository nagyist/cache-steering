  "query": "Question: A mountain with a melting glacier has a stream with a waterfall. The waterfall fills a lake at the base of the mountain. Where is the water coldest?\n\nChoices:\nA: glacier\nB: stream\nC: waterfall\nD: lake",
  "steps": [
    "Water from the glacier is typically at or below freezing due to its close proximity to the ice, making it the coldest source of water.",
    "As the glacier melts, the water that enters the stream will remain cold, but it will warm slightly as it travels downwards and interacts with the surrounding environment.",
    "The waterfall contains water that has fallen from a height, which can cause some degree of cooling due to the rapid movement and evaporation, but it is still warmer than the water directly from the glacier.",
    "The lake at the base of the mountain is filled with water from the waterfall and stream, which means it is warmer than the glacier, as it stores and slowly heats the water."
