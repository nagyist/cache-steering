  "query": "Question: In the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a new theory on the heliocentric structure of the solar system. Which of these statements best describes this new theory?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth is at the center of the solar system.\nB: There are eight planets in the solar system.\nC: The Sun is at the center of the solar system.\nD: Moons have circular orbits in the solar system.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the statement that best describes Nicolaus Copernicus's heliocentric theory.",
    "Copernicus's heliocentric theory posits that the Sun, not the Earth, is at the center of the solar system.",
    "Choice A states that Earth is at the center, which directly contradicts Copernicus's theory.",
    "Choice B mentions the number of planets, which is not directly related to the heliocentric theory itself.",
    "Choice D discusses the orbits of moons, which is also not relevant to the central assertion of the heliocentric theory.",
    "Choice C accurately states that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, aligning perfectly with Copernicus's proposal."
