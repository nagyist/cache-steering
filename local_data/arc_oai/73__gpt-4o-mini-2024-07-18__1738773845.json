  "steps": [
    "The question involves a weight restriction for a new laptop computer, so we need to identify which reason aligns best with the characteristics and purposes of laptops.",
    "Laptops are designed to be portable and convenient for users, and therefore, weight is a critical factor in their usability and transportability.",
    "Among the choices, option C directly relates to portability and convenience, which are key selling points for laptops. A lighter laptop would indeed be easier to transport.",
    "The other options either focus on testing, cost reduction in manufacturing, or prototype building, which are less directly related to the end user's experience with the product."
