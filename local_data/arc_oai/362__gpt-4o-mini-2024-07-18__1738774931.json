  "query": "Question: As a heavy metal ball rolls down a hill, it goes faster and faster. Which statement is true?\n\nChoices:\nA: The ball's potential energy is changing to kinetic energy.\nB: The ball is gaining potential energy from the hill.\nC: The ball is rapidly losing kinetic energy as it rolls down the hill.\nD: The ball will continue gaining kinetic energy until it stops.",
  "steps": [
    "The ball starts at a higher position on the hill, which means it has potential energy due to its height.",
    "As the ball rolls down the hill, it loses height, which results in a decrease in potential energy.",
    "The lost potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, making the ball move faster.",
    "This implies that the statement \"The ball's potential energy is changing to kinetic energy\" is true.",
    "The other statements either contradict the laws of physics or do not accurately describe the situation."

  "solution": "A"
