  "query": "Question: In the water cycle, water moving from oceans to clouds involves which change in the water?\n\nChoices:\nA: It changes from a solid to a gas.\nB: It turns from saltwater to freshwater.\nC: Its crystal size becomes smaller.\nD: Its chemical energy increases.",
  "steps": [
    "In the water cycle, evaporation is the key process that moves water from oceans to clouds.",
    "During evaporation, water changes from liquid to gas, specifically from ocean water to water vapor.",
    "The question involves the change in the nature of water during this process.",
    "Ocean water is saline, but as it evaporates, it leaves the salts behind and becomes freshwater in the form of vapor.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer involves the water turning from saltwater to freshwater."
