  "query": "Question: Which best determines the health of a lake used as a source of freshwater?\n\nChoices:\nA: its depth and width\nB: its temperature and pH\nC: its location and depth\nD: its temperature and depth",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the health of a lake, factors affecting water quality and conditions must be prioritized over simple physical characteristics like depth and width.",
    "Temperature influences biological activity in the water, and pH affects the solubility of nutrients and metals, thus impacting aquatic life.",
    "While location and depth can matter, they do not directly relate to water quality or ecosystem health as temperature and pH do.",
    "Evaluating water quality and its impacts on aquatic ecosystems points towards temperature and pH as more critical indicators of health."
