  "query": "Question: During a lecture, a professor was talking about the potential that hydrogen has for exploding under certain conditions. Which was most likely the topic of the professor's lecture?\n\nChoices:\nA: Conductivity of Gases\nB: Phase Changes in Matter\nC: Chemical Properties of Gases\nD: Physical Properties of Elements",
  "steps": [
    "The professor discussed hydrogen explosions, which indicates a focus on reactions involving hydrogen gas. Explosions are typically associated with chemical reactions.",
    "Considering the topic revolves around hydrogen's potential to explode, this implies a study of its behavior with other substances, thus reflecting its chemical properties rather than just its physical characteristics or phase changes.",
    "The choices include \"Chemical Properties of Gases,\" which directly aligns with the emphasis on hydrogen's explosive potential as it involves understanding the reactions hydrogen can participate in, making this the most relevant choice."
