  "query": "Question: Electric circuits provide energy for lightbulbs. Which of these prevents the flow of electrons?\n\nChoices:\nA: a circuit that is closed\nB: a series circuit\nC: a circuit that is open\nD: a parallel circuit",
  "steps": [
    "I need to understand the concepts of electric circuits and how they function. A closed circuit allows for the flow of electrons, while an open circuit interrupts that flow.",
    "Next, I will analyze the provided choices. A closed circuit (Choice A) enables electron flow, while a series circuit (Choice B) can still be closed and allows flow. A parallel circuit (Choice D) also allows for the flow of electrons when closed.",
    "Now, I will focus on Choice C: an open circuit. By definition, an open circuit has a break or gap that interrupts the flow of electrons, preventing any current from flowing through."
