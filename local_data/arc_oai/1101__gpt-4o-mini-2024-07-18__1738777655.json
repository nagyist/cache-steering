  "query": "Question: A mutation that occurs in an organism that reproduces sexually will most likely affect the traits of the offspring if the mutation\n\nChoices:\nA: is located in the cells of the nervous system.\nB: alters DNA in a gamete of the parent.\nC: alters the behavior of the organisms.\nD: is located near the locus of a chromosome.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which mutation would most likely affect offspring traits, we need to understand the role of gametes in sexual reproduction. Gametes (sperm and eggs) carry genetic information to the offspring.",
    "If a mutation alters DNA in a gamete, this means that the genetic information being passed to the offspring is directly affected. Thus, any change in the gamete's DNA can lead to changes in traits in the offspring.",
    "Choices A, C, and D refer to mutations in areas that do not directly alter the genetic information provided to offspring during reproduction. For example, mutations in the nervous system (A) or behavioral changes (C) do not directly change the genetic code passed to the next generation. Choice D mentions a mutation near a chromosome locus, but it does not specify if it affects gametes directly."
