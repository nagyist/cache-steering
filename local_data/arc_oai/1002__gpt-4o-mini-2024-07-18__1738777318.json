  "query": "Question: A teacher builds a model of a hydrogen atom. A red golf ball is used for a proton, and a green golf ball is used for an electron. Which is not accurate concerning the model?\n\nChoices:\nA: number of particles\nB: relative mass of particles\nC: types of particles present\nD: charges of particles present",
  "steps": [
    "The model uses a red golf ball to represent a proton and a green golf ball to represent an electron, which indicates that the teacher is attempting to demonstrate the basic components of a hydrogen atom.",
    "In a hydrogen atom, there is one proton and one electron, which means the number of particles is accurately represented by the model.",
    "However, the mass of a proton is approximately 1836 times greater than that of an electron, while both are inaccurately represented by equally sized golf balls, which means the relative mass of the particles is not accurately depicted.",
    "The types of particles present in a hydrogen atom (a single proton and a single electron) are accurately represented in the model.",
    "The charges of the particles (positive for the proton and negative for the electron) are also accurately reflected in the model by the color choice, suggesting their relationship in terms of charge is correct."
