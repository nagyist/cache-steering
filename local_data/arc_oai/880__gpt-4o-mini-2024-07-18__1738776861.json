  "query": "Question: Which behavior of a dog is the best example of a learned behavior?\n\nChoices:\nA: barking\nB: tail-wagging\nC: digging a hole\nD: coming when called",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the difference between innate behaviors (natural) and learned behaviors (acquired through experience).",
    "Barking and tail-wagging are natural behaviors that dogs typically engage in without prior training or learning; these are instinctual.",
    "Digging a hole can sometimes be an instinctual behavior as well, as dogs may dig for various reasons, such as to create a den or find prey.",
    "Coming when called, however, is a behavior that requires training and reinforcement. This behavior is learned through practice and positive reinforcement from the owner."
