  "query": "Question: Which best explains how most soils are alike?\n\nChoices:\nA: Most soils have many rocks.\nB: Most soils are found in layers.\nC: Most soils hold the same amounts of water.\nD: Most soils have the same texture.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the characteristics of soil. Soils can have different amounts of rocks, which suggests that option A may not apply to most soils universally.",
    "Next, examine if soils being found in layers (option B) is a common characteristic. While many soils do have layers due to the process of soil formation, this isn't true for every soil type globally.",
    "Now, let\u2019s evaluate if soils hold the same amounts of water (option C). Soil water retention can vary greatly depending on soil type, composition, and other factors like organic matter, so this choice likely doesn't apply to most soils.",
    "Lastly, investigate option D regarding soil texture. Different soils can have varying textures (sandy, clayey, loamy), so this statement likely does not hold true for most soils either.",
    "Given the examination of all options, while most soils have common characteristics regarding composition and processes, none of the provided options truly reflect a fundamental similarity that applies to all soils universally."
