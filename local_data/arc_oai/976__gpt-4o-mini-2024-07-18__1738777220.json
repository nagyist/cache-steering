  "query": "Question: The majority of the fresh water on Earth is frozen in glaciers and ice caps. If the climate changed around the world, causing glaciers and ice caps to melt, which situation would most likely occur?\n\nChoices:\nA: Land would become more fertile.\nB: Air temperatures would decrease.\nC: Ocean water would become saltier.\nD: Land masses would become smaller.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the melting of glaciers and ice caps is a direct result of climate change, implying a significant amount of freshwater would enter the oceans.",
    "If freshwater from melted ice caps enters the oceans, it would dilute the seawater, making it less salty, rather than saltier.",
    "Considering other effects, melting ice and rising sea levels could lead to flooding, which would not directly relate to changes in land fertility or decreases in air temperatures.",
    "The option stating that air temperatures would decrease (B) contradicts the initial premise of climate change causing warming and melting ice, leading to less likelihood of temperature decrease.",
    "The option stating that land masses become smaller (D) does align with the idea that rising sea levels can cause the inundation of coastal areas."

  "solution": "D"
