Dawn wants to perform a scientific investigation to determine the reason her chocolate bar melted in her backpack. Which hypothesis should Dawn use for her investigation?\n\nChoices:\nA: Chocolate will taste better when melted.\nB: Chocolate will taste the same even when melted.\nC: If the chocolate is broken then the chocolate will melt.\nD: If heat is added to chocolate then the chocolate will melt.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify the main factor affecting the chocolate bar, which is the heat in her backpack.",
    "Next, we should determine what we are investigating: the cause of the chocolate melting.",
    "Among the hypotheses, we need one that directly correlates heat with the melting of chocolate.",
    "Hypothesis D states that if heat is added to chocolate, then the chocolate will melt, which directly addresses the investigation."
