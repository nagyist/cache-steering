  "steps": [
    "Too much fishing in an area depletes the fish population, which affects the food chain.",
    "If the fish population decreases significantly, predators that rely on fish for food may struggle to find enough resources.",
    "As a result, the populations of these predators could decline, leading to potential endangerment due to starvation.",
    "The choices provided must be evaluated in this context to determine which one aligns with the impact of overfishing on the ecosystem."
