  "query": "Question: Which layers of Earth are mostly made of solid material?\n\nChoices:\nA: inner core and outer core\nB: crust and inner core\nC: crust and mantle\nD: mantle and outer core",
  "steps": [
    "The Earth's internal structure consists of several layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.",
    "The crust is a solid layer that forms the Earth's surface, while the mantle, which lies beneath the crust, is mostly solid but has some areas that can flow over long periods.",
    "The outer core, in contrast, is composed of liquid iron and nickel, which means it is not solid. The inner core is, however, made of solid iron and nickel due to the extremely high pressures at that depth.",
    "From the choices provided, I need to identify which layers are mostly solid. The crust and inner core are both solid.",
    "Although the mantle is mostly solid, it is not explicitly mentioned in the choices as a separate solid layer apart from the crust and inner core. Therefore, I need to focus only on the options provided."
