  "query": "Question: Which characteristic do single-celled organisms and multicellular organisms have in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both have cells with specialized functions for each life process.\nB: Both perform all life processes within one cell.\nC: Both have a way to get rid of waste materials.\nD: Both are able to make food from sunlight.",
  "steps": [
    "Single-celled organisms consist of just one cell that performs all functions necessary for life, while multicellular organisms are made up of many cells that work together.",
    "Answer choice A suggests that both types of organisms have specialized cells, but single-celled organisms do not have specialized cells, as they perform all life processes within one cell.",
    "Answer choice B directly states that both types perform all life processes within one cell, which is only true for single-celled organisms and not for multicellular ones.",
    "Answer choice D implies that both types can make food from sunlight, which is only applicable to certain multicellular organisms like plants, and not to all single-celled organisms.",
    "Answer choice C states that both types have a way to get rid of waste materials, which is true since single-celled organisms can expel waste via their membrane, and multicellular organisms have specialized systems to do the same."
