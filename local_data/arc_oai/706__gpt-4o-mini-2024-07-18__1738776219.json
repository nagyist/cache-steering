    "Mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy in an object, which is associated with the motion or position of that object.",
    "A wagon rolling down a hill possesses kinetic energy due to its motion, as well as potential energy due to its elevated position at the top of the hill.",
    "In contrast, wood burning (choice A) transforms chemical energy into heat and light energy, while light shining (choice B) is electromagnetic energy. A song playing on a radio (choice C) involves electrical energy being converted to sound, not mechanical energy.",
    "Since choice D is the only option that directly involves mechanical energy through the movement of the wagon, it stands out as the best example of mechanical energy."
