  "query": "Question: Compared to similar-sized gasoline-powered vehicles, electric-gasoline-hybrid vehicles are primarily designed to\n\nChoices:\nA: produce more horsepower.\nB: eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.\nC: operate independently of fossil fuels.\nD: provide better gas mileage.",
  "steps": [
    "Evaluate the main advantages of electric-gasoline-hybrid vehicles compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.",
    "Recognize that hybrid vehicles combine an electric motor with a gasoline engine to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.",
    "Determine which choice aligns best with the typical goal of hybrid vehicles, focusing on fuel economy rather than solely producing more power or completely eliminating emissions.",
    "Assess each option: \n- A (produce more horsepower) is less relevant to hybrids, as they focus on efficiency.\n- B (eliminate greenhouse gas emissions) is overly ambitious since hybrids still produce some emissions.\n- C (operate independently of fossil fuels) suggests complete independence, which is not accurate for hybrids.\n- D (provide better gas mileage) is the primary design goal of hybrid vehicles."
