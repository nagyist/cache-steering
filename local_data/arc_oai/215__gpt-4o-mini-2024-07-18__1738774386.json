  "query": "Question: Which characteristic of the asthenosphere helps explain the evidence of crustal-plate motion?\n\nChoices:\nA: the magnetic properties\nB: the semiliquid physical state\nC: the ability to deflect solar winds\nD: the ability to absorb heat energy",
  "steps": [
    "The asthenosphere is a layer of the Earth's mantle located beneath the lithosphere that is partially molten and has a semi-fluid state. This characteristic is crucial in understanding how tectonic plates move.",
    "The semi-liquid physical state of the asthenosphere allows it to flow and deform, providing a lubricated layer upon which tectonic plates can move. This flow enables the movement of crustal plates, which is evidenced by phenomena like earthquakes and volcanic activity.",
    "Other choices, such as magnetic properties, the ability to deflect solar winds, and the ability to absorb heat energy, do not relate directly to plate tectonics and crustal-plate motion."
