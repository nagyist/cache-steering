  "query": "Question: Which food provides the most energy for the body in the shortest amount of time?\n\nChoices:\nA: potato\nB: meat\nC: milk\nD: fruit",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the energy content of each food option. Foods high in carbohydrates, like fruit and potatoes, generally provide quick energy, while proteins and fats take longer to digest and convert into energy.",
    "Next, among the options: \n- Potatoes (A) are starchy and provide complex carbohydrates but take time to break down. \n- Meat (B) is high in protein and takes longer to convert to energy.\n- Milk (C) has carbohydrates (lactose) and protein but is moderate in speed for energy release.\n- Fruit (D) is typically high in simple sugars, which can provide rapid energy.",
    "Now, I will compare the speed of energy release. Simple carbohydrates in fruit can be absorbed quickly, providing immediate energy. In contrast, potatoes and meat will take longer to digest and break down.",
    "Based on this analysis, fruit is likely to provide the most immediate energy because of its simple sugar content, followed by milk, potatoes, and finally meat."
