  "query": "Question: Heat transfer is part of everyday life. Which of these examples involving heat transfer occurs mainly by conduction?\n\nChoices:\nA: The sun warms the ground.\nB: A hot oven warms a cold kitchen.\nC: A campfire warms a person's hands.\nD: Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what conduction is. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between materials.",
    "Next, we evaluate each option to see which one describes heat transfer that occurs through direct contact.",
    "Option A involves the sun warming the ground, which primarily occurs through radiation, not conduction.",
    "Option B describes an oven warming a kitchen, but this also involves convection (the movement of warm air) rather than conduction as it mainly involves air.",
    "Option C talks about a campfire warming hands, which primarily occurs through radiation from the fire and also through convection from the heat of the air.",
    "Finally, in option D, hot soup is in contact with a metal spoon, leading to heat transfer directly from the soup to the spoon through conduction, as they are touching."
