  "steps": [
    "A chemical reaction involves a transformation that results in the formation of new substances. When magnesium is burned, it reacts with oxygen in the air to form magnesium oxide, producing light as a result of this chemical reaction.",
    "The evaporation of water from a solution is a physical change, not a chemical one, since the chemical composition of water remains unchanged as it changes state from liquid to gas.",
    "The fizzing of a soft drink is a physical change involving the release of carbon dioxide gas that was previously dissolved in the liquid under pressure, not resulting from a new substance being formed.",
    "The heat from a light bulb is the result of electrical energy being converted into thermal energy, not a chemical reaction."
