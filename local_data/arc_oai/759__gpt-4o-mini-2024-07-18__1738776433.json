  "query": "Question: Which comparison of ecosystems is true?\n\nChoices:\nA: Tundras are warmer than grasslands.\nB: Grasslands get more rain than deserts.\nC: Deserts have more plants than rainforests.\nD: Rainforests are rockier than tundras.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the climate of tundras and grasslands. Tundras are characterized by cold temperatures and permafrost, while grasslands generally have milder climates with moderate rainfall. Therefore, tundras are not warmer than grasslands.",
    "Next, evaluate the rainfall in grasslands compared to deserts. Grasslands typically receive more precipitation than deserts, which are known for their arid conditions. Thus, this statement appears to be true.",
    "Now, examine the number of plants in deserts versus rainforests. Deserts are known for their sparse vegetation due to limited water, while rainforests have an abundance of diverse plant life. This comparison shows that deserts do not have more plants than rainforests.",
    "Lastly, assess the terrain comparison between rainforests and tundras. Rainforests are often lush and filled with vegetation, while tundras are characterized by a more barren landscape with minimal plant growth due to cold conditions. Hence, rainforests are not rockier than tundras."
