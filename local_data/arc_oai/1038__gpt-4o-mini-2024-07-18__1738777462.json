  "query": "Question: How much time is required for a bicycle to travel a distance of 100 m at an average speed of 2 m/s?\n\nChoices:\nA: 0.0\nB: s B 50 s\nC: 100 s\nD: 200 s",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to use the formula for time, which is time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 100 meters and the speed is 2 meters/second.",
    "Substituting the values into the formula: time = 100 m / 2 m/s.",
    "Calculating the division: 100 m / 2 m/s equals 50 seconds.",
    "Now we can compare this result with the choices provided."
