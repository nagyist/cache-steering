  "query": "Question: A student observed a sample of water in three states of matter. The student should describe the liquid water as a state of matter that has\n\nChoices:\nA: more kinetic energy than the solid state.\nB: more mass than the solid state.\nC: less kinetic energy than the solid state.\nD: less volume than the solid state.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the characteristics of liquid water compared to the solid state (ice).",
    "In the solid state, water molecules are arranged in a fixed, rigid structure and have lower kinetic energy. In the liquid state, those molecules can move past each other, indicating a higher kinetic energy.",
    "Thus, liquid water has more kinetic energy than its solid form (ice).",
    "Now, considering the answer choices, A states that liquid water has more kinetic energy than the solid state, which aligns with the observations we have made.",
    "The other options (B, C, and D) do not accurately describe the relationship between liquid water and solid water in terms of mass, kinetic energy, and volume."
