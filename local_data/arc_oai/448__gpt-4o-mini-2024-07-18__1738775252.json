  "query": "Question: If a new organism were discovered, which of the following would most likely be used to classify it into the appropriate kingdom?\n\nChoices:\nA: the color of the organism\nB: the organism's natural habitat\nC: the structure of the organism's anatomy\nD: the location where the organism was found",
  "steps": [
    "To classify an organism into a kingdom, scientists typically rely on biological characteristics rather than superficial traits or environmental factors.",
    "Among the options, the structure of the organism's anatomy is a fundamental characteristic that offers insights into its cellular organization, reproductive methods, and evolutionary relationships.",
    "The color of the organism (A) is not typically a reliable classification trait since different organisms of the same species can vary in color. The habitat (B) can provide contextual information but does not define the biological classification. The location (D) is also irrelevant to the intrinsic biological classification."
