  "query": "Question: A cell that is low in water will most likely immediately lose the ability to\n\nChoices:\nA: remain rigid.\nB: absorb sunlight.\nC: release oxygen.\nD: reproduce again.",
  "steps": [
    "A cell that is low in water typically experiences plasmolysis, where the cell membrane detaches from the cell wall, leading to loss of turgor pressure.",
    "The rigidity of a plant cell is maintained by this turgor pressure which is primarily dependent on water content.",
    "If the cell loses its rigidity, it will not be able to maintain its structure and function effectively.",
    "While the ability to absorb sunlight, release oxygen, and reproduce might be affected indirectly, the immediate loss of rigidity is the most direct consequence of low water levels."
