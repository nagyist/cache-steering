  "query": "Question: In a lab investigation, students use Brand X batteries in a flashlight and Brand Y batteries in a radio. After two hours, the flashlight stops working, but the radio continues to work. As a result, the students conclude that Brand Y batteries last longer. Which statement about the conclusion of the investigation is most accurate?\n\nChoices:\nA: The conclusion is valid because they tested two different brands.\nB: The conclusion is invalid because the test had multiple variables.\nC: The conclusion is valid because they conducted the investigation in a lab.\nD: The conclusion is invalid because the real names of the batteries were hidden.",
  "steps": [
    "The students compared two different brands of batteries, which is a valid approach to determining their lifespan. However, they also need to consider if any other factors influenced the results.",
    "The investigation involved two different devices (flashlight and radio) which may have different power requirements, making it difficult to draw a clear conclusion solely based on the two-hour duration. This indicates the presence of multiple variables affecting the results.",
    "The environment of the lab does not inherently make the investigation valid; what matters is the control of variables and conditions. Here, because they tested two different devices, the comparison becomes unreliable.",
    "Hiding the real names of the batteries does not directly impact the validity of the conclusion but signifies a lack of transparency in the experiment. However, the major issue is the multi-variable testing setup."
