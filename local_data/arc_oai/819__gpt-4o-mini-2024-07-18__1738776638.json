  "query": "Question: The marsh willow herb is a plant native to the northeastern United States. It grows best in damp habitats. Which of the following environmental changes would most likely cause a decrease in the marsh willow herb population in an area?\n\nChoices:\nA: a rainstorm lasting several weeks\nB: a drought lasting twelve months\nC: unusually low temperatures during the month of July\nD: unusually high temperatures during the month of January",
  "steps": [
    "The marsh willow herb thrives in damp habitats, indicating that it needs sufficient moisture to survive and grow.",
    "A rainstorm lasting several weeks (Choice A) would likely contribute to increased moisture in the habitat, which is beneficial for the marsh willow herb, so it wouldn't cause a decrease in population.",
    "A drought lasting twelve months (Choice B) would severely limit the water supply necessary for the marsh willow herb to thrive, making it the most likely choice to cause a decrease in its population.",
    "Unusually low temperatures during July (Choice C) may affect growth but would not directly impact moisture levels; thus, it\u2019s less likely to cause a significant decrease compared to the drought.",
    "Unusually high temperatures during January (Choice D) also would not significantly impact the marsh willow herb's population as it is more resilient to temperature fluctuations compared to prolonged drought conditions."
