  "steps": [
    "Identify the nature of the choices given. An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.",
    "Analyze each choice: \nA: KBr (potassium bromide) is a compound made of potassium and bromine.",
    "Continue analysis: \nB: O_{2} is a diatomic molecule of oxygen, which is an element.",
    "Proceed with analysis: \nC: 2KCl (potassium chloride) is a compound, as it consists of potassium and chlorine.",
    "Finish analysis: \nD: FeO_{2} (iron dioxide) is also a compound made of iron and oxygen.",
    "From the analysis, the only option that represents an element is O_{2}."
