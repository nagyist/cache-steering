  "query": "Question: The average rainfall in Nevada is about 7 inches per year. The most likely reason for the low amount of rainfall is the\n\nChoices:\nA: high elevations of deserts.\nB: location north of the equator.\nC: lack of moisture in the air.\nD: great distance from the ocean.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the geographical features of Nevada, which includes a large desert area. Deserts typically receive low rainfall due to their climatic conditions.",
    "Next, evaluate the options provided. Option A discusses high elevations of deserts, which may contribute to rainfall reduction, but this is not the primary reason.",
    "Now, look at option B, which refers to the location north of the equator. While this might affect temperature, it does not directly relate to the rainfall amount observed in Nevada.",
    "Then, consider option C, which speaks to the lack of moisture in the air. This is a significant factor in why areas like Nevada receive minimal rainfall.",
    "Lastly, option D mentions the great distance from the ocean, which typically affects moisture availability and precipitation patterns in inland areas like Nevada. This option is also a strong contender.",
    "However, the most direct and applicable reason for the low rainfall in Nevada, considering its desert climate and lack of humid air, points towards the lack of moisture in the air (Option C). Hence, that will be chosen as the answer."
