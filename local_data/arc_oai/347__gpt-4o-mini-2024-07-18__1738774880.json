  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a property of water that facilitates the transportation of materials in the Earth system.",
    "Option A states that water expands as it solidifies; this is more related to ice formation and buoyancy rather than transport.",
    "Option B claims that water is transparent; while this allows light penetration in bodies of water, it does not contribute significantly to transporting materials.",
    "Option C states that water dissolves many substances; this characteristic is critical for transporting nutrients and other materials in ecosystems.",
    "Option D mentions that water is a compound; while this is true, it does not specifically address how water transports materials."
