  "query": "Question: The alkaline earth metal elements are in the same family in the periodic table because they all have\n\nChoices:\nA: one valence electron.\nB: two valence electrons.\nC: seven valence electrons.\nD: eight valence electrons.",
  "steps": [
    "The alkaline earth metals belong to Group 2 of the periodic table.",
    "Elements in the same group or family have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons.",
    "Alkaline earth metals, such as beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium, each have two valence electrons.",
    "Therefore, the correct statement about alkaline earth metals having the same family in the periodic table is that they all have two valence electrons."
