  "query": "Question: Which layer of Earth is the source of lava that erupts from volcanoes?\n\nChoices:\nA: asthenosphere\nB: inner core\nC: outer core\nD: lithosphere",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the source of lava that erupts from volcanoes.",
    "Lava is molten rock that reaches the Earth's surface during a volcanic eruption.",
    "The molten rock comes from the upper part of the Earth's mantle, specifically the asthenosphere, which is partially molten and capable of flowing.",
    "The outer core is liquid but it is too deep beneath the Earth's surface to be the source of lava. The inner core is solid due to extreme pressure and does not contribute to volcanic activity.",
    "The lithosphere, while it includes the crust where volcanoes can be found, does not contain molten rock that can erupt as lava; it refers to the rigid outer layer of the Earth."
