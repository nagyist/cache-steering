  "query": "Question: Materials combine chemically or physically. Which materials form a new substance when chemically combined?\n\nChoices:\nA: salt and pepper\nB: water and sugar\nC: iron nails and pennies\nD: baking soda and vinegar",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand the difference between physical and chemical combinations. A physical combination does not change the substances into new materials, while a chemical combination results in the formation of a new substance.",
    "Next, let's analyze the choices to identify which combination leads to a new substance. \nChoice A: salt and pepper remain as individual components when mixed, which is a physical combination. \nChoice B: water and sugar combine physically to create a solution, not a new substance, so it's not a chemical combination.",
    "Continuing, for choice C: iron nails and pennies do not chemically react with each other; they remain separate entities, so this is also a physical combination.",
    "Lastly, in choice D: baking soda and vinegar, when combined, undergo a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas along with new substances, making this a chemical combination."
