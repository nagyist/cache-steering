  "query": "Question: How long does it take for Earth to rotate on its axis seven times?\n\nChoices:\nA: one day\nB: one week\nC: one month\nD: one year",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine how long it takes for Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis. This is known as a day and takes approximately 24 hours.",
    "Next, we calculate the time it takes for Earth to rotate seven times. Since one rotation takes 24 hours, we multiply 24 hours by 7 rotations.",
    "Calculating 24 hours multiplied by 7 gives us 168 hours.",
    "Now, we convert 168 hours into days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we divide 168 by 24.",
    "Dividing 168 by 24 gives us 7 days.",
    "Finally, we compare our result of 7 days to the answer choices provided."
