  "query": "Question: Charisma has a goldfish she keeps in a tank. She planted several underwater plants in the bottom of the tank. How are the goldfish and the plants in the tank similar?\n\nChoices:\nA: Both add oxygen to the water.\nB: Both perform photosynthesis.\nC: Both are made up of cells.\nD: Both eat food.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the characteristics of the goldfish. Goldfish are living organisms that are made up of cells, and they require oxygen to breathe.",
    "Next, examine the underwater plants. These plants are also living organisms, and like all plants, they are made up of cells. They also perform photosynthesis, which allows them to produce oxygen.",
    "Now, evaluate the answer choices provided. Option A states that both add oxygen to the water, which is true for the plants due to photosynthesis, but not for the goldfish, which consumes oxygen.",
    "Option B claims that both perform photosynthesis. This is incorrect as only the plants perform this process, while goldfish do not.",
    "Option C states that both are made up of cells, which is accurate for both goldfish and plants as they are both living organisms.",
    "Lastly, Option D says that both eat food. This is only true for the goldfish, as the plants do not eat food in the same sense\u2014they absorb nutrients from the water and soil."
