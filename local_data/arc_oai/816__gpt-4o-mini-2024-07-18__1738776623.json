  "query": "Question: The water cycle describes the continuous movement of the water of Earth. Which part of the water cycle is directly responsible for returning water to the soil?\n\nChoices:\nA: condensation\nB: evaporation\nC: precipitation\nD: transpiration",
  "steps": [
    "The water cycle consists of several processes, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and transpiration.",
    "Precipitation is the process through which water is returned to the surface of the Earth, including soil, in forms such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.",
    "While evaporation turns liquid water into vapor and transpiration involves the release of water vapor from plants, neither of these processes is responsible for directly returning water to the soil.",
    "Thus, the part of the water cycle that directly returns water to the soil is clearly precipitation."

  "solution": "C"
