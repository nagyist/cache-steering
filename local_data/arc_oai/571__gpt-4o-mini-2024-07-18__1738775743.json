  "query": "Question: In plants, which describes sexual reproduction but not asexual reproduction?\n\nChoices:\nA: Five limbs are grafted onto the same tree.\nB: New plants are grown from pieces of other plants.\nC: A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo.\nD: Offspring are produced that have the same genetic information as the parent.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to differentiate between sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two distinct parents, while asexual reproduction involves a single organism producing offspring that are genetically identical to itself.",
    "Next, we evaluate each choice to see which demonstrates sexual reproduction definitively.",
    "Choice A (\"Five limbs are grafted onto the same tree\") describes a method of asexual reproduction called grafting, where pieces of plants are joined together. This does not involve sexual reproduction.",
    "Choice B (\"New plants are grown from pieces of other plants\") also describes a form of asexual reproduction called vegetative propagation. This does not involve fertilization or genetic combination from two parents, so it doesn't describe sexual reproduction.",
    "Choice C (\"A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo\") clearly describes sexual reproduction. It involves the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, leading to the formation of an embryo that contains genetic information from both parents.",
    "Choice D (\"Offspring are produced that have the same genetic information as the parent\") describes a characteristic of asexual reproduction, where offspring are clones of the parent and genetically identical.",
    "Since Choice C is the only option that describes a process involving genetic combination and fertilization, it is the correct answer that applies to sexual reproduction only."
