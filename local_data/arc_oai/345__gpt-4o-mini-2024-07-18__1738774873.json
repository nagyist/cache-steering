  "query": "Question: Gavin has two rocks. Both rocks are made up entirely of the same mineral. What other property of his two rocks is most likely to be the same?\n\nChoices:\nA: size\nB: shape\nC: color\nD: weight",
  "steps": [
    "Gavin has two rocks made entirely of the same mineral, which means they share a common chemical composition.",
    "The mineral composition suggests that certain physical properties, like color, are likely to be similar among rocks formed from the same mineral type.",
    "While rocks can vary in size, shape, and weight due to physical processes, the color is more closely tied to the mineral composition, making it more likely to be similar in both rocks."
