  "query": "Question: Which pair of elements has the most similar properties?\n\nChoices:\nA: Li and B\nB: I and Ca\nC: K and He\nD: N and P",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the properties of the elements in the choices. Group elements with similar properties are often found in the same group (column) of the periodic table.",
    "Choice A, Li and B: Lithium (Li) is an alkali metal, while Boron (B) is a metalloid, meaning their properties are not very similar.",
    "Choice B, I and Ca: Iodine (I) is a halogen and Calcium (Ca) is an alkaline earth metal; these two belong to different groups and have quite different properties.",
    "Choice C, K and He: Potassium (K) is an alkali metal, while Helium (He) is a noble gas. They belong to different groups, and their properties are distinctly different.",
    "Choice D, N and P: Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are both in Group 15 of the periodic table, sharing similar chemical properties because they are both nonmetals.",
    "Based on the analysis, N and P are in the same group and therefore likely have the most similar properties compared to the other pairs."
