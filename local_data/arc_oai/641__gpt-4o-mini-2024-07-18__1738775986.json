  "query": "Question: What unit do scientists use to measure the distance between stars?\n\nChoices:\nA: light-year\nB: angstrom unit\nC: astronomical unit\nD: apparent magnitude",
  "steps": [
    "Scientists measure distances in space using various units depending on the scale. For the distance between stars, a common unit used is the light-year, which is the distance light travels in one year.",
    "The angstrom unit is typically used for measuring very small distances, such as the size of atoms and molecules, and is not suitable for astronomical distances.",
    "The astronomical unit (AU) is used to measure distances within our solar system, particularly the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, and is less practical for interstellar distances.",
    "Apparent magnitude measures the brightness of a star as seen from Earth, which is not a unit of distance.",
    "Given the options provided, the appropriate unit for measuring the distance between stars is a light-year."
