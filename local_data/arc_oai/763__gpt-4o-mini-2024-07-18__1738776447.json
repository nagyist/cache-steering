  "query": "Question: Two flowers are both roses. One rose is larger and has more fragrance than the other rose. What advantage will one of the roses most likely gain because of this difference?\n\nChoices:\nA: The larger rose will have fewer petals than the smaller rose.\nB: The larger rose will more easily attract bees than the smaller rose.\nC: The smaller rose will have more pollen than the larger rose.\nD: The smaller rose will grow faster than the larger rose.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that one rose is larger and has more fragrance than the other. Generally, larger size and more fragrance in flowers lead to better attraction of pollinators such as bees.",
    "Given that bees are attracted to flowers that are more fragrant and prominent, the larger and more fragrant rose will most likely have an advantage in attracting these pollinators.",
    "Looking at the options, we need to identify which one aligns with the advantage of being larger and more fragrant.",
    "Option B states that the larger rose will more easily attract bees than the smaller rose, which is a reasonable conclusion given the characteristics mentioned.",
    "The other options do not logically follow from the information given: Option A contradicts the premise, Option C implies a relationship that hasn't been established, and Option D is unrelated to size or fragrance."
