  "query": "Question: A student notices that an inflated balloon gets larger when it is warmed by a lamp. Which best describes the mass of the balloon as a result of this change?\n\nChoices:\nA: The mass of the balloon increases because the size of the balloon has increased.\nB: The mass of the balloon increases because the temperature of the balloon has increased.\nC: The mass of the balloon stays the same because the gas inside the balloon still has the same mass after it warms up.\nD: The mass of the balloon stays the same because warming decreases the mass enough to cancel out the effect of increasing the size.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that an inflated balloon gets larger when warmed, suggesting that the volume of the air (gas) inside the balloon increases due to increased kinetic energy from the heat.",
    "The mass of an object is determined by the amount of matter it contains. In the case of the balloon, when it warms up, the air inside it expands, but this does not add more air or mass to the balloon; it just changes the state of the existing air.",
    "Thus, even though the size of the balloon increases, the mass of the gas inside the balloon remains the same because the amount of gas does not increase\u2014just its temperature and volume do."
