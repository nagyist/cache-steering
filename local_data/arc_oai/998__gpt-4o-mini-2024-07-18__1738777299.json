  "query": "Question: Which of these animals is most likely to be found living and feeding on the forest floors of Virginia?\n\nChoices:\nA: Bat\nB: Trout\nC: Deer mouse\nD: Golden eagle",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the typical habitat of each animal. Bats are typically found in the air or roosting in trees, while trout are freshwater fish that inhabit streams and rivers, not forest floors.",
    "Next, I consider the deer mouse. This species is known to inhabit various environments, including forests, where they can be found on the forest floor, feeding on seeds and insects.",
    "Then, I examine the golden eagle. These birds are primarily found in open and mountainous regions and typically do not reside on the forest floor.",
    "Based on the habitat analysis, the most suitable choice that aligns with living and feeding specifically on the forest floors of Virginia is the deer mouse."
