  "query": "Question: A researcher is conducting an investigation to determine if water temperature affects the growth rate of a certain type of fish in a lake. Which unit would the researcher use when determining the mass of the fish?\n\nChoices:\nA: centimeters\nB: kilometers\nC: grams\nD: liters",
  "steps": [
    "The researcher is examining the growth rate of fish, which is related to their mass or weight.",
    "Mass is typically measured in units that quantify the amount of matter within an object.",
    "Among the provided options, \"grams\" is the appropriate unit for measuring the mass of small objects, such as fish.",
    "The other options do not pertain to the measurement of mass: centimeters measure length, kilometers measure distance, and liters measure volume."
