  "query": "Question: When you make soap bubbles, what is inside the bubbles?\n\nChoices:\nA: Air\nB: Soap\nC: Water\nD: Nothing",
  "steps": [
    "When a soap bubble is formed, a thin layer of soap film traps a gas inside the bubble.",
    "This gas is typically air, which consists of various gases, primarily nitrogen and oxygen.",
    "The soap film is composed of soap molecules and water, but the interior of the bubble itself is filled with air, not soap or water.",
    "Thus, the primary component inside a soap bubble is air, while soap and water are part of the bubble's structure but not what is inside the bubble."
