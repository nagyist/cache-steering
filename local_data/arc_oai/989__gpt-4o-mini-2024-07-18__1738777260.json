  "query": "Question: People may remove fallen trees from forests to reduce fire risk. Removing the trees is now thought to have an impact on the health of the forest. Which impact would removing fallen trees from forests most likely have on forest health?\n\nChoices:\nA: increased risk of forest fire\nB: increased food sources for forest fungi\nC: decreased soil fertility by preventing nutrient recycling\nD: decreased forest vegetation by increasing sunlight penetration",
  "steps": [
    "Removing fallen trees from forests prevents the natural process of decomposition, which is important for recycling nutrients back into the soil.",
    "When trees fall and decay, they add organic material to the soil, which helps maintain its fertility and supports the growth of other plants.",
    "If fallen trees are removed, this nutrient recycling is disrupted, leading to decreased soil fertility over time.",
    "Therefore, the most likely impact of removing fallen trees from forests would be decreased soil fertility by preventing nutrient recycling."
