  "query": "Question: Which statement about photosynthesis and respiration is true?\n\nChoices:\nA: Photosynthesis stores energy and respiration releases energy.\nB: Respiration stores energy and photosynthesis releases energy.\nC: Photosynthesis and respiration are the same process.\nD: Photosynthesis and respiration do not have anything to do with energy.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert light energy into chemical energy, storing it in the form of glucose.",
    "Next, we'll look at respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to release energy, using it to fuel their activities.",
    "Now, we can confirm the relationship between the two processes. Photosynthesis captures and stores energy, while respiration releases that stored energy for cellular use.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the statements based on our analysis. Statement A correctly describes that photosynthesis stores energy and respiration releases energy.",
    "For the other statements: Statement B is incorrect because respiration does not store energy; Statement C is also incorrect because they are different processes; and Statement D is incorrect as both processes are directly related to energy transformation."

  "solution": "A"
