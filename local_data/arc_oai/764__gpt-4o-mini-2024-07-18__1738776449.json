  "query": "Question: Clams, oysters, and mussels eat plankton filtered from water. How would clams, oysters, and mussels most likely be affected if the amount of plankton in a large body of water was significantly reduced?\n\nChoices:\nA: They would increase in number.\nB: They would find a new food source.\nC: They would become prey to other animals.\nD: They would compete for a limited food source.",
  "steps": [
    "Clams, oysters, and mussels are filter feeders that rely specifically on plankton as their primary food source.",
    "If the amount of plankton in the water is significantly reduced, their main source of sustenance would be diminished.",
    "With less plankton available, these organisms would likely struggle to find enough food to survive and reproduce effectively.",
    "In this situation, they may end up competing for the limited amount of plankton that is available after the reduction."
