  "query": "Question: Which would a scientist use in trying to model the cause of planetary years?\n\nChoices:\nA: planetary mass\nB: planetary color\nC: a planet's core temperature\nD: a planet's distance from the Sun",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which factor a scientist would use to model the duration of planetary years, which generally refers to how long it takes a planet to orbit the Sun.",
    "The time it takes for a planet to complete one orbit around the Sun largely depends on its distance from the Sun, according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion.",
    "While planetary mass, color, and core temperature may have other scientific significance, they do not directly relate to the duration of a planet's year as its distance from the Sun does."
