  "query": "Question: Which energy conversion happens when a person shivers and the energy is transferred to make the muscles and joints move?\n\nChoices:\nA: kinetic energy to potential energy\nB: heat energy to kinetic energy\nC: potential energy to chemical energy\nD: chemical energy to mechanical energy",
  "steps": [
    "When a person shivers, their muscles contract and relax, which involves movement and energy transfer.",
    "Shivering generates heat as a byproduct of muscle activity, indicating that energy is being converted during this process.",
    "The muscles use stored chemical energy from the body's food intake to perform work (movement), which is categorized as mechanical energy.",
    "Thus, the process of shivering represents the conversion of stored chemical energy into the mechanical energy of moving muscles."
