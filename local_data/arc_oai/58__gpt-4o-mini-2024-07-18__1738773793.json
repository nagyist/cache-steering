    "The question asks which option would most likely improve air quality in large Texas cities. We need to evaluate each choice based on its potential impact on air pollution.",
    "Option A suggests limiting the number of cars on the roads. This could reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions, which are significant sources of air pollution in urban areas. Thus, it is likely to improve air quality.",
    "Option B involves switching to wood stoves for home heating. Wood stoves can emit particulate matter and other pollutants, potentially worsening air quality instead of improving it. Therefore, this choice is not beneficial for air quality.",
    "Option C suggests requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel. Diesel engines can produce more pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulates compared to gasoline engines, particularly if they are not equipped with modern emission controls. This option is therefore unlikely to improve air quality.",
    "Option D involves maintaining filters in large buildings. While this can help with indoor air quality, it may not have a significant impact on outdoor air quality in cities. Thus, it is less relevant in the context of improving urban air quality.",
    "Considering the evaluations, option A (limiting the number of cars on the roads) is the most effective choice for improving air quality in large Texas cities."
