  "query": "Question: When a finger is cut and bleeds, platelets and plasma proteins move to the cut to stop the bleeding. As these move to the cut, this stimulates more platelets and proteins to move to the cut to stop the bleeding. What type of mechanism is being illustrated?\n\nChoices:\nA: negative feedback\nB: positive feedback\nC: regulatory feedback\nD: stimulation feedback",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a process where the presence of platelets and plasma proteins at the cut stimulates even more platelets and proteins to move to the site of injury.",
    "This indicates that the initial response (movement of platelets and proteins) leads to an increase in the response (more platelets and proteins moving to the cut) rather than a decrease or stabilization.",
    "In biological terms, this is characteristic of a positive feedback loop, where the initial action is amplified by subsequent actions."

  "solution": "B"
