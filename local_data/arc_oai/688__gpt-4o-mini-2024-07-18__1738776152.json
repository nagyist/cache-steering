  "query": "Question: Which of these would be a model of diffusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: a student passes through a door\nB: two students pass by each other\nC: two students bump into each other\nD: students pass from a crowded room into a hall",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what diffusion means in this context. Diffusion typically refers to the process of spreading or dispersing from a concentrated area to a less concentrated area.",
    "Next, I will examine each choice to see which one illustrates the concept of diffusion.",
    "Choice A: A student passes through a door. This doesn't depict diffusion as it's a singular action without dispersion.",
    "Choice B: Two students pass by each other. This doesn't demonstrate diffusion; they are just moving alongside one another.",
    "Choice C: Two students bump into each other. This is a collision, not diffusion, as it does not involve spreading or dispersing.",
    "Choice D: Students pass from a crowded room into a hall. This shows a movement from a high concentration (the crowded room) to a lower concentration (the hall), which is characteristic of diffusion."
