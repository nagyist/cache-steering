  "steps": [
    "Plants generally receive more sunlight and energy during the summer season due to longer daylight hours and more direct sunlight.",
    "Spring also provides adequate sunlight, but the days are shorter compared to summer, thus providing less energy for plant growth.",
    "Fall and winter have decreasing sunlight hours and weaker sunlight intensity, which means plants receive less energy during these seasons.",
    "Since summer has the longest days and the highest intensity of sunlight, it is the best season for plants to receive energy for growth."
