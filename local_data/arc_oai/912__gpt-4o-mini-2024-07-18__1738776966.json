  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the purpose of the reflective outer layers of astronauts' space suits.",
    "The primary concern for astronauts in space is to protect against extreme conditions, including radiation and intense sunlight, since they are exposed to the sun\u2019s rays without the atmosphere filtering them.",
    "While micrometeoroids and vacuum conditions are also concerns, the specific purpose mentioned in the question emphasizes protection from light rather than physical impacts or pressure changes.",
    "Considering the choices, the most direct answer related to reflection is intense sunlight, as reflective materials are effective in minimizing heat absorption and protecting against harmful radiation."
