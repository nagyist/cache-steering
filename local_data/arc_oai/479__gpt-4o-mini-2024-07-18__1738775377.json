  "query": "Question: A conducting wire wrapped in plastic protects the user because the plastic\n\nChoices:\nA: keeps the wire cool.\nB: allows heat to move freely.\nC: is a good electrical insulator.\nD: has magnetic properties.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks why a conducting wire wrapped in plastic protects the user.",
    "One key property of plastic is that it serves as an insulator, preventing electrical current from passing through it.",
    "This insulation provided by plastic means that if a user accidentally touches the wire, they are not in direct contact with the conducting material, thus avoiding electric shock.",
    "Now, let's evaluate the answer choices: \n- A (keeps the wire cool) does not directly relate to user protection.\n- B (allows heat to move freely) is the opposite of what is true for insulation.\n- C (is a good electrical insulator) aligns with the protective function of plastic.\n- D (has magnetic properties) is irrelevant to the context."
