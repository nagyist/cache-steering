  "query": "Question: An air mass in a valley travels up a mountainside. What causes the movement of this air?\n\nChoices:\nA: tidal pull of the moon's gravity\nB: evaporation of water from soil in the valley\nC: warming by solar energy re-radiated from the ground\nD: cooling effect of ice crystals in the air over the mountain",
  "steps": [
    "The air mass in the valley is likely to rise due to temperature differences as it encounters the mountainside.",
    "The ground is typically heated by solar energy during the day, which can warm the air above it.",
    "As the warm air rises, it creates a lower pressure at the surface, drawing more air from the valley upwards.",
    "The process described points towards warming of the air mass by solar energy, as opposed to the other factors listed which are less directly related to the vertical movement of air."
