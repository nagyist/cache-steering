  "query": "Question: Which food items can be broken down mostly into amino acids?\n\nChoices:\nA: spaghetti noodles\nB: hamburger patties\nC: apple slices\nD: cucumber slices",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to understand what amino acids are and which food items are primarily composed of them. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.",
    "Next, I should identify which of the given food items are high in protein, as protein is primarily broken down into amino acids in the body.",
    "Looking at the choices, spaghetti noodles (A) are primarily carbohydrates, which are not broken down into amino acids. Apple slices (C) and cucumber slices (D) are also low in protein and mostly consist of carbohydrates and water.",
    "On the other hand, hamburger patties (B) are made primarily of meat, which is a rich source of protein. Therefore, hamburger patties are the food item that can be broken down mostly into amino acids."
