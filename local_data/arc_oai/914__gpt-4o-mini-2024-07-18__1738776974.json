  "query": "Question: Which of these is an important safety rule to follow when using an electrical device?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wear an apron.\nB: Keep work area dry.\nC: Extinguish all flames.\nD: Wear protective gloves.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I consider the context of safety rules related to electrical devices. The primary concern when using electrical devices is the risk of shock or fire, which can be exacerbated by water or flammable materials.",
    "Next, I evaluate the options: A (Wear an apron) does not specifically relate to electrical safety. B (Keep work area dry) directly addresses the risk of electrical shock by eliminating moisture, which can conduct electricity. C (Extinguish all flames) is important for fire safety but is not specific to the use of electrical devices. D (Wear protective gloves) could be relevant but only if they are insulated for electrical use.",
    "Among all the options, keeping the work area dry is the most critical safety rule when using electrical devices, as it helps prevent accidental electrocution or short circuits."
