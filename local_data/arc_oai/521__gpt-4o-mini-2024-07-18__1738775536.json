  "query": "Question: A student is measuring the boiling point of a salt and water mixture. He takes one temperature measurement of 105\u00b0C. Which is the best way to ensure the results are valid?\n\nChoices:\nA: repeat the investigation\nB: change the volume of water\nC: add more salt to the mixture\nD: do the investigation without salt",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to determine if the single temperature measurement of 105\u00b0C is reliable. A single measurement may not provide an accurate boiling point due to potential measurement errors or fluctuations.",
    "Repeated investigations help to confirm the consistency of the results. If the student measures the temperature multiple times and consistently obtains a similar value, it would support the validity of the findings.",
    "Changing the volume of water could alter the boiling point because the boiling point can be affected by concentration. However, this does not help verify the original measurement.",
    "Adding more salt to the mixture would not validate the initial measurement; instead, it might change the boiling point further, complicating the results.",
    "Conducting the investigation without salt is not beneficial if the goal is to determine the boiling point of a salt and water mixture."
