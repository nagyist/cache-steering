  "query": "Question: Human bodies have complex structures that support growth and survival. What is the most basic structure of the human body that supports growth and survival?\n\nChoices:\nA: a cell\nB: a tissue\nC: an organ\nD: an organ system",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what the most basic structure of the human body is. The options provided are a cell, a tissue, an organ, and an organ system.",
    "A cell is the fundamental unit of life. All living organisms, including humans, are made of cells, and they perform essential functions needed for survival and growth.",
    "A tissue is made up of a group of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function, but it is not the most basic unit of life.",
    "An organ is a structure composed of different types of tissues that work together to perform specific functions, and an organ system is a group of organs that work together to perform complex functions.",
    "Since the question asks for the most basic structure that supports growth and survival, the answer must be the cell, as it is the smallest unit that can carry out all life processes."
