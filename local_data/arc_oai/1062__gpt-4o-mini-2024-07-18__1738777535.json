  "query": "Question: Which statement about the Sun is true?\n\nChoices:\nA: The Sun is a very large star that exists far from the Milky Way Galaxy.\nB: The Sun is at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nC: The Sun is a medium-sized star near the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nD: The Sun has the Milky Way and several other galaxies moving in orbits around it.",
  "steps": [
    "Evaluate statement A: The Sun is relatively large but is actually located within the Milky Way Galaxy, not far from it. Therefore, this statement is false.",
    "Evaluate statement B: The Sun is not at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy; it is located in one of the outer arms, specifically the Orion Arm. This statement is also false.",
    "Evaluate statement C: The Sun is considered a medium-sized star (a G-type main-sequence star) and is located near the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy, making this statement true.",
    "Evaluate statement D: The Sun does not have the Milky Way or other galaxies orbiting around it; instead, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way along with other stars and systems. This statement is false as well."
