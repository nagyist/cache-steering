  "query": "Question: The burning of fossil fuels has increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. What is a possible effect that the increased amount of carbon dioxide is likely to have on our planet?\n\nChoices:\nA: A warmer climate\nB: A cooler climate\nC: Lower relative humidity\nD: More ozone in the atmosphere",
  "steps": [
    "The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, which is known to contribute to the greenhouse effect.",
    "The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in overall global temperatures.",
    "Considering that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, an increase in its concentration is likely to result in a warmer climate rather than a cooler one.",
    "The other options such as cooler climate, lower relative humidity, and more ozone do not directly correspond with the known effects of increased carbon dioxide levels."
