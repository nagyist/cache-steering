  "steps": [
    "Sodium (Na) is a soft metal that readily reacts with nonmetals, particularly halogens like chlorine (Cl_{2}).",
    "Chlorine (Cl_{2}) is a diatomic molecule that can react with sodium to form metal halides.",
    "When sodium reacts with chlorine, it forms sodium chloride (NaCl), which is commonly known as table salt.",
    "The other options (sugar, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide) do not result from the direct reaction of sodium and chlorine."
