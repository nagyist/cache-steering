  "query": "Question: Which statement best explains why the Sun and the Moon appear to be about the same size in the sky?\n\nChoices:\n1: The Sun and the Moon have the same diameter.\n2: The Moon is larger in diameter and farther from Earth than the Sun.\n3: The Moon is smaller in diameter and is closer to Earth than the Sun.\n4: The Sun and the Moon are the same distance from Earth.",
  "steps": [
    "The apparent size of an object in the sky is determined by its actual size and its distance from the observer.",
    "The Sun is much larger in diameter than the Moon, but it is also much farther away from the Earth than the Moon.",
    "The Moon is smaller in diameter compared to the Sun, but it is much closer to Earth than the Sun.",
    "Due to the combination of the Sun's large size and great distance, and the Moon's smaller size but close proximity, their apparent sizes in the sky are roughly the same."
