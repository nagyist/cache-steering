  "query": "Question: How does acid rain most likely affect forests?\n\nChoices:\nA: Top soil loses all of its nutrients.\nB: Plants begin to grow deeper roots.\nC: Animals have more food sources.\nD: Trees become less healthy over time.",
  "steps": [
    "Acid rain can lower the pH of the soil in forests, which can lead to the leaching of essential nutrients that trees and plants need to thrive.",
    "When trees do not receive adequate nutrients, their health and growth can be negatively impacted, making them more susceptible to diseases and environmental stressors.",
    "While it is possible that some plants might adapt by growing deeper roots, the overall effect of acid rain is detrimental to the health of trees.",
    "The increased nutrient depletion and adverse effects on tree vigor suggest that the most likely outcome of acid rain is that trees become less healthy over time."
