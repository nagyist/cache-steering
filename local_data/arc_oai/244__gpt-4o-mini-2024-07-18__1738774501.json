  "query": "Question: Many houses are built on the sides of hills. Which of these actions would best prevent houses from sliding down hills after heavy rainfalls?\n\nChoices:\nA: increasing the slope of the hill\nB: spraying herbicides on the hill\nC: adding plants to the hill\nD: removing grass from the hill",
  "steps": [
    "Houses built on hills are at risk of sliding down due to soil erosion and instability, particularly after heavy rainfall.",
    "One effective method to prevent soil erosion is to improve vegetation cover on the slopes, as plants help to stabilize the soil with their roots.",
    "Among the choices given, adding plants to the hill would provide the best stability, as the roots would hold the soil together and reduce water runoff.",
    "Conversely, increasing the slope of the hill (A) would exacerbate the problem, while spraying herbicides (B) or removing grass (D) would reduce plant cover, worsening soil erosion."
