  "query": "Question: An ice cube placed in sunlight melts quickly. Which BEST explains this event?\n\nChoices:\nA: The Sun is far away.\nB: The Sun makes heat.\nC: The ice cube is a solid.\nD: The ice cube looks clear.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the BEST explanation for why an ice cube melts quickly when placed in sunlight.",
    "Choice A states that \"The Sun is far away,\" which does not explain the melting because the distance of the Sun does not impact the heat it provides to the ice cube.",
    "Choice B states that \"The Sun makes heat,\" which directly relates to the melting process as the heat from the Sun warms the ice cube, causing it to melt.",
    "Choice C states that \"The ice cube is a solid,\" but being a solid does not explain why it melts quickly when exposed to sunlight.",
    "Choice D states that \"The ice cube looks clear,\" which is irrelevant to the melting process influenced by sunlight.",
    "From the analysis, the most relevant explanation for the melting of the ice cube when placed in sunlight is due to the heat produced by the Sun."
