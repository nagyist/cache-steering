  "query": "Question: Water evaporates and falls back to Earth as rain or snow. What is the primary energy source that drives this cycle?\n\nChoices:\nA: The wind\nB: The Sun\nC: Air pressure\nD: Ocean currents",
  "steps": [
    "Water evaporation is a key process in the water cycle, where liquid water transforms into vapor.",
    "This transformation from liquid to vapor requires energy, which is primarily provided by the heat from the Sun.",
    "After evaporation, water vapor rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds, which eventually lead to precipitation as rain or snow.",
    "The wind, air pressure, and ocean currents are not direct energy sources; they can influence the cycle but do not provide the primary energy necessary for evaporation."
