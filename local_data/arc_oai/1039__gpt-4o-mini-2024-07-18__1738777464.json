  "query": "Question: A bird has just hatched from an egg. Which of the following stages most likely comes next in the life cycle of the bird?\n\nChoices:\nA: birth\nB: death\nC: growth\nD: reproduction",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves the life cycle of a bird and asks what stage follows hatching from an egg.",
    "After hatching, a bird is considered a chick, which is the initial stage of its life following the egg.",
    "In the natural progression of a bird's life, the next logical stage after hatching is growth, as the chick will need to grow and mature.",
    "The other options (birth, death, reproduction) do not logically follow immediately after hatching; birth occurs before hatching, death is a later stage, and reproduction is further into the life cycle."
