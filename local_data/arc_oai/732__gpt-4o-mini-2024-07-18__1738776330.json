  "query": "Question: A chicken is able to gain energy that came from the Sun by\n\nChoices:\nA: eating seeds.\nB: drinking water.\nC: laying eggs.\nD: breathing oxygen.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking how a chicken can gain energy from the Sun.",
    "One way energy from the Sun enters the food chain is through plants, which use photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy.",
    "Chickens can gain energy by consuming plants or seeds that have absorbed sunlight, which makes option A (eating seeds) relevant.",
    "The other options (B, C, D) do not describe how a chicken directly gains energy from the Sun. Drinking water does not provide energy, laying eggs is a reproductive process, and breathing oxygen is related to respiration, not energy acquisition."
