  "query": "Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fish reproduction rates will increase.\nB: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.\nC: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.\nD: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.",
  "steps": [
    "The question concerns the impact of oil on a coastal habitat, which is typically negative, particularly for wildlife and plants.",
    "Option A states that \"Fish reproduction rates will increase.\" However, oil spills usually harm fish populations by contaminating their habitat and affecting their reproductive health.",
    "Option B claims that \"Water birds will be unable to use their wings.\" While oil can coat feathers and hinder a bird's ability to fly, this statement is more about the immediate physical effect rather than the overall habitat effect.",
    "Option C indicates that \"Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.\" An oil spill would usually block sunlight, thus reducing the amount of light available to underwater plants rather than increasing it.",
    "Option D suggests that \"Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.\" Oil does not provide nutrients and can instead introduce toxic substances into the environment, which would not benefit coastal plants.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the most accurate understanding of the effects of oil on coastal habitats is that oil negatively impacts many species, especially aquatic birds."
