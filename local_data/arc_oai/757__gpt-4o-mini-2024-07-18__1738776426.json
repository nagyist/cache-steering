  "query": "Question: The concept of continental drift, continents drifting over the ocean floors, was proposed by Alfred Wegner in 1915. This concept was replaced by the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s. Changes from the continental drift concept to the plate tectonics theory required which of the following?\n\nChoices:\nA: strong earthquakes occurring along fault zones\nB: data and ideas being shared among scientists\nC: a scientific law being passed by Congress\nD: teachers beginning to teach the newer theory",
  "steps": [
    "The continental drift theory suggested that continents were once connected and have since drifted apart. However, it lacked a mechanism to explain how this drift occurred.",
    "The theory of plate tectonics provided explanations for the movement of the plates and included evidence from geology, fossils, and ocean studies, showing that continents are part of larger plates that move due to underlying mantle convection.",
    "The transition from continental drift to plate tectonics involved collaboration and communication among scientists to accumulate and share new data, forming a more cohesive scientific understanding of the Earth's processes.",
    "A scientific law being passed by Congress or teachers simply starting to teach the theory do not reflect the scientific basis for change in understanding; it was based on new evidence and theory development."
