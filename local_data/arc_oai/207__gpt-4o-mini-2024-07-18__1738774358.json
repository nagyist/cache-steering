  "query": "Question: Many cars are equipped with a catalytic converter, a device that helps remove hydrocarbons and oxides from car exhaust. As a result, this device helps to\n\nChoices:\nA: increase the production of ozone.\nB: decrease the production of smog.\nC: increase the emission of nitrogen.\nD: decrease the emission of carbon dioxide.",
  "steps": [
    "Understand the function of a catalytic converter. It is designed to reduce harmful emissions from car exhaust, specifically targeting hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides.",
    "Recognize that one of the main benefits of reducing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides is that it helps decrease overall air pollution, which is a significant contributor to smog.",
    "Assess the provided choices concerning the primary effects of using a catalytic converter. Since the device cleans exhaust gases, an outcome would logically be a decrease in smog.",
    "Eliminate options that do not directly relate to the benefits of a catalytic converter: A suggests an increase in ozone (which could occur from smog but is not directly related), C talks about an increase in nitrogen emissions (which is contrary to the function of a catalytic converter), and D focuses on carbon dioxide, which is not primarily targeted by the converters."
