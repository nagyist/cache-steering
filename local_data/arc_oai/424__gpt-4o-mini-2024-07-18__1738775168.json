  "query": "Question: Which example describes a behavioral adaptation?\n\nChoices:\nA: A bird builds its nest in the ash near a volcano.\nB: A whale has the ability to hold its breath for 20 minutes.\nC: A fox's hair is white in the winter and brown in the summer.\nD: A monkey has long arms that allow it to swing from one branch to another.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what a behavioral adaptation is. Behavioral adaptations are actions or behaviors that organisms perform to survive in their environment.",
    "Now, let\u2019s analyze each option. \nOption A describes a bird building its nest in a specific location, which is an action related to its survival.",
    "Option B talks about a whale's ability to hold its breath, which is a physiological characteristic rather than a behavior.",
    "Option C describes a fox\u2019s fur color changing with the seasons, which is also a physiological adaptation and not a behavior.",
    "Option D describes a monkey's physical trait (long arms) that helps it in its environment, which is again a physical adaptation rather than a behavior.",
    "After examining all the options, only Option A involves a specific action taken by the bird, which qualifies as a behavioral adaptation."
