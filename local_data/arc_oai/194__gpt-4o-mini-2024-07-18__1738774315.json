  "query": "Question: Corn can be used to make ethanol, which is a fuel for some cars. What problem could be caused by the increased use of ethanol?\n\nChoices:\nA: increase in fossil fuel production\nB: decrease in corn production\nC: increase in severe weather\nD: decrease in nutrients in soil",
  "steps": [
    "Increased use of ethanol can lead to higher demand for corn since corn is a primary feedstock for ethanol production.",
    "This higher demand for corn could result in farmers prioritizing corn production over other crops, leading to potential decreases in the variety of crops grown.",
    "With more land being used for corn and potentially fewer crop rotations, soil health could decline, resulting in lower overall nutrient levels in the soil over time.",
    "Therefore, among the provided options, a significant problem caused by increased ethanol use is likely to be related to the agriculture impact on soil quality and nutrients."
