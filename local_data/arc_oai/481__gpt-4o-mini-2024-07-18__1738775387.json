  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what it means for substances to react to form new substances. This generally involves a chemical change where reactants are transformed into different products.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option to see if a chemical change has occurred and if new substances have been formed in each case.",
    "Option A, H_{2}O(l) -> H_{2}O(g), describes a phase change from liquid water to water vapor. This does not involve a chemical change or the formation of new substances.",
    "Option B, 2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O, shows hydrogen and oxygen reacting to form water. This is a chemical reaction that produces a new substance.",
    "Option C, 2Na + Cl_{2} -> 2NaCl, presents sodium reacting with chlorine to create sodium chloride, which is also a chemical change where new substances are formed.",
    "Option D, 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}, illustrates carbon dioxide and water undergoing photosynthesis to produce glucose and oxygen, representing another chemical change and new substances formed.",
    "After analyzing all the options, it is clear that option A is the only one that does not describe a reaction forming new substances since it only represents a change in state and not a chemical reaction."
