  "query": "Question: How do the sprouts of seeds buried in complete dark in the soil find their way to the surface of the soil?\n\nChoices:\nA: They grow toward light.\nB: They grow toward surface warmth.\nC: They grow opposite the direction of the bedrock.\nD: They grow opposite the direction of the pull of gravity.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks how sprouts of seeds buried in dark soil navigate to the surface. Since they are in complete darkness, they cannot respond to light cues.",
    "One of the key natural mechanisms that plants use to orient their growth is gravitropism, where they sense the direction of gravity and grow in response.",
    "In gravitropism, roots typically grow downward (positive gravitropism) while shoots grow upward (negative gravitropism) in response to gravity.",
    "Given that the sprouts are trying to reach the surface, they must be growing opposite the pull of gravity in order to reach upward toward the surface."
