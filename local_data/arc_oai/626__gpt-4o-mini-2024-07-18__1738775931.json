  "query": "Question: A cupful of water and a similar cupful of gasoline were placed on a table near a window on a hot sunny day. A few hours later it was observed that both the cups had less liquid in them but that there was less gasoline left than water. What does this experiment show?\n\nChoices:\nA: All liquids evaporate.\nB: Gasoline gets hotter than water.\nC: Some liquids evaporate faster than others.\nD: Liquids will only evaporate in sunshine.\nE: Water gets hotter than gasoline",
  "steps": [
    "The liquids in both cups are exposed to the same conditions (hot sunny day), indicating that they have the same opportunity to evaporate.",
    "Since it is observed that the gasoline has evaporated more than the water, this suggests a difference in the rate of evaporation between the two liquids.",
    "This leads to the conclusion that some liquids have different evaporation rates, meaning not all liquids evaporate at the same speed."

  "solution": "C"
