  "query": "Question: Which organ in a frog has a function similar to the function of lungs in a bird?\n\nChoices:\nA: kidney\nB: skin\nC: liver\nD: heart",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the function of lungs in birds, which is to facilitate respiration by exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide.",
    "Consider the respiratory system of frogs, which can use multiple structures for gas exchange, including their skin and lungs.",
    "Recognize that frog skin is capable of gas exchange due to its moist surface, allowing oxygen to be absorbed and carbon dioxide to be released.",
    "Evaluate the options: a kidney does not have a respiratory function, a liver mainly processes nutrients, and a heart pumps blood but does not exchange gases.",
    "Conclude that the function of the frog's skin in gas exchange is the most similar to the function of lungs in birds."
