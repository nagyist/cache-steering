  "query": "Question: The interior of Earth is made up of several physically different layers. The solid layer of Earth that moves over a viscous layer is called the\n\nChoices:\nA: core.\nB: crust.\nC: asthenosphere.\nD: atmosphere.",
  "steps": [
    "The Earth's interior is composed of multiple layers which include the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.",
    "The core is the innermost part of the Earth, composed primarily of iron and nickel, and is not a layer that moves over another.",
    "The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding the Earth and is not a solid layer.",
    "The crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth, which includes both the continental and oceanic crust, and indeed moves over the layer beneath it.",
    "The asthenosphere is a semi-viscous layer located below the lithosphere (which includes the crust and upper mantle), allowing the crustal plates to move.",
    "Based on the question, we need to identify the solid layer that moves over a viscous layer, which matches the crust moving over the asthenosphere."
