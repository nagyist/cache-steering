  "query": "Question: An owl hunts mice that live in a farmer's field. After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice have fewer places to hide. Which is most likely to happen after the crops are gathered?\n\nChoices:\nA: The owl will catch more mice.\nB: The owl will hunt in a different field.\nC: The owl will have new material to build its nest.\nD: The owl will have a hard time feeding its young.",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes the effect of the farmer gathering crops on the mice's habitat. With fewer places to hide, this likely makes it easier for the owl to hunt.",
    "If the owl can catch mice more easily due to the decreased cover, it's reasonable to deduce that its hunting success will increase after the crops are gathered.",
    "While other options mention behaviors or outcomes unrelated directly to the immediate changes in the environment after crops are harvested, the most logical result is an increased hunting success for the owl."
