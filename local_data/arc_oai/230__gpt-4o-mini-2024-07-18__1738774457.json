  "query": "Question: The feathers of male goldfinches become brightly colored each spring. Which best describes why the color of the feathers changes each year?\n\nChoices:\nA: a genetic mutation\nB: a learned behavior\nC: a behavioral adaptation\nD: a physical adaptation",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the reason for the seasonal color change of male goldfinches' feathers.",
    "The color change occurs in response to environmental factors (such as the arrival of spring) rather than a genetic mutation.",
    "It is not a learned behavior, as the birds do not need to learn to change their feathers; this change is inherent and automatic.",
    "While the color change could be considered a response to environmental cues, it is best classified as a physical adaptation rather than a behavioral one, as it pertains to a change in the birds\u2019 physical traits (feather color) for reproductive purposes."
