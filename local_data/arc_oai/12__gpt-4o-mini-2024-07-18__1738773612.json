  "query": "Question: Which of the following areas is most likely to form metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist?\n\nChoices:\nA: a sea floor\nB: a windblown desert\nC: a site deep underground\nD: a site covered by a glacier",
  "steps": [
    "Metamorphic rocks are formed through the alteration of existing rocks under conditions of high pressure and temperature, typically occurring deep underground.",
    "A sea floor is usually characterized by sedimentary processes and does not provide the conditions necessary for the formation of metamorphic rocks.",
    "A windblown desert is primarily shaped by weathering and erosion processes rather than the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions needed for metamorphism.",
    "A site covered by a glacier primarily affects rock through erosion and the movement of ice but does not provide the sustained high temperatures or pressures typical for metamorphic rock formation.",
    "Therefore, the area most likely to form metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist is a site deep underground, where the conditions for metamorphism are present."
