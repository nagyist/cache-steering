  "query": "Question: Manuel wants an area in the yard to wash the dog without making mud puddles. He wants to put something on the ground that water passes through easily. Which of these materials would be the best for him to use?\n\nChoices:\nA: clay\nB: plastic\nC: soil\nD: pebbles",
  "steps": [
    "The goal is to find a material that allows water to pass through easily to prevent mud puddles.",
    "Clay is a dense material that retains water, which would create mud puddles rather than prevent them.",
    "Plastic is not permeable, so water cannot pass through it, leading to pooling instead.",
    "Soil can absorb water but may still retain enough moisture to create mud.",
    "Pebbles allow water to drain through them due to the spaces between each stone, preventing the formation of mud puddles."
