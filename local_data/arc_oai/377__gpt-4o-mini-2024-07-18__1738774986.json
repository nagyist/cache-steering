  "query": "Question: Which of these soil changes is due only to natural causes?\n\nChoices:\nA: Loss of minerals due to farming.\nB: Deserts forming due to tree cutting.\nC: Flooding due to dam construction.\nD: Minerals washing out due to heavy rain.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify which options describe changes to soil that occur solely due to natural causes, without any human intervention.",
    "Option A, \"Loss of minerals due to farming,\" clearly involves human actions (farming), so it cannot be considered a natural cause.",
    "Option B, \"Deserts forming due to tree cutting,\" also involves human activity (tree cutting), thus it is not a natural cause.",
    "Option C, \"Flooding due to dam construction,\" is again related to human activity (dam construction) and therefore is not a natural cause.",
    "Option D, \"Minerals washing out due to heavy rain,\" is a process that can occur naturally without human influence, as heavy rain can lead to soil erosion and loss of minerals naturally."

  "solution": "D"
