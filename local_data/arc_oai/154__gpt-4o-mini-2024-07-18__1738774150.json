  "steps": [
    "We need to identify what is common between plant and animal life cycles.",
    "Both plants and animals go through a series of stages in their life cycles, which typically include a beginning, a growth period, and a mature stage.",
    "The other options mention specifics that do not universally apply to both plants and animals. For instance, not all plants begin as eggs, and the time required can vary greatly between species.",
    "Based on these considerations, the most accurate choice is that both have distinct stages that include beginning, growing, and maturity."
