  "steps": [
    "The first step is to consider which of the characteristics listed is likely to change based on environmental factors. Characteristics that are directly influenced by their surroundings would be influenced by elements like climate, habitat, and availability of resources.",
    "Next, evaluate each option. The size of a wolf\u2019s feet (A) is primarily determined by genetics and does not change with the environment. The color of its eyes (B) also stems largely from genetic factors and is stable over time. The shape of its ears (C), while can have some variability, is also largely genetically predetermined.",
    "Now, consider the condition of its fur (D). The fur of a wolf can change based on environmental factors like temperature, seasons, and health due to diet and living conditions. For example, wolves might develop thicker fur in colder environments or changes in fur condition based on health and parasite load."
