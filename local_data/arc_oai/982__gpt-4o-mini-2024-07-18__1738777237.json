  "query": "Question: Use the information to answer the question. Over the last 150 years, the use of fossil fuels has increased, resulting in more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some scientists think that these atmospheric gases will result in global warming. Scientists have recorded data on global temperature changes and have predicted possible changes in sea level that may affect Maryland residents. Which result of global warming will most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland?\n\nChoices:\nA: loss of shore land\nB: erosion of mountains\nC: decrease in average temperature\nD: increase in the size of the polar ice caps",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the result of global warming that will most negatively affect coastal residents specifically in Maryland.",
    "Global warming primarily leads to rising sea levels, which can result in the loss of coastal land and increased flooding in coastal areas.",
    "Among the options given, \"loss of shore land\" directly correlates to the effects of rising sea levels and would significantly impact coastal residents in Maryland.",
    "The other options, such as erosion of mountains, decrease in average temperature, and increase in the size of the polar ice caps, do not specifically address the immediate impacts on coastal regions in Maryland."
