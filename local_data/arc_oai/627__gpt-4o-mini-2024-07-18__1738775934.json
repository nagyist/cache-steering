Which of the following is most likely to happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fish will have more food.\nB: Trees will be able to get more light.\nC: Raccoons will not be able to find food.\nD: Underwater plants will receive less light.",
  "steps": [
    "The mudslide introduces a significant amount of mud into the pond, which can cloud the water.",
    "Cloudy water reduces the amount of light that can penetrate through, which affects photosynthesis.",
    "Underwater plants rely on sunlight for photosynthesis, so with decreased light due to mud, their growth will be hindered.",
    "Choices A, B, and C do not directly relate to the effects of reduced light in the water."
