  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify which question can be answered through a practical investigation typically conducted by a science class. This would involve experiments, observations, and data collection.",
    "The question regarding the climate on Jupiter (Choice A) cannot be directly investigated by a science class, as it involves astronomical measurements that are not feasible for classroom experiments.",
    "The question about plant growth with and without light (Choice B) can indeed be tested in a science class through simple controlled experiments comparing plant growth under different light conditions.",
    "Choice C, concerning the warmest place on Earth that has life, while it is a geographical question, it does not lend itself to straightforward investigation or data collection typically done in science class without extensive field studies.",
    "Finally, the migration of monarch butterflies (Choice D) could be investigated, but it generally requires long-term observation and possibly field trips, making it less likely to be a typical classroom investigation."
