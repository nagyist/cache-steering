  "query": "Question: A drop of red food coloring is added to a bowl of water. Several minutes later, all of the water is red. Which of these describes the change that took place?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion\nB: osmosis\nC: diffusion\nD: transfusion",
  "steps": [
    "The process described involves the spreading of red food coloring throughout the water until it is uniformly colored.",
    "This phenomenon occurs because the particles of the food coloring move from an area of higher concentration (where the drop was added) to areas of lower concentration (the surrounding water) until there is an even distribution.",
    "The movement of particles from high concentration to low concentration is known as diffusion.",
    "The other options do not accurately describe this process: erosion relates to the wearing away of materials, osmosis refers to the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane, and transfusion typically applies to transferring fluids between people or organisms."
