  "query": "Question: Two students are asked to make a chart on the electromagnetic spectrum. Reading left to right, one student's chart shows the spectrum from gamma rays to radio waves, while the other student's chart shows the opposite. If the teacher says that both charts are correct, then\n\nChoices:\nA: it does not matter how the students label their charts.\nB: there are multiple ways to organize information.\nC: the waves have the same properties.\nD: the students are being encouraged to do their work.",
  "steps": [
    "The first student's chart displays the electromagnetic spectrum starting from gamma rays on the left to radio waves on the right, which follows the convention of organizing the spectrum by increasing wavelength.",
    "The second student's chart starts from radio waves on the left and goes to gamma rays on the right, which is simply a reverse representation of the same spectrum.",
    "Since the teacher states that both charts are correct, it implies that the orientation of the charts does not impact the validity of the information they represent.",
    "This suggests that how the charts are labeled or ordered is flexible, thus indicating that various interpretations or formats can be accepted as long as the information itself is accurate."
