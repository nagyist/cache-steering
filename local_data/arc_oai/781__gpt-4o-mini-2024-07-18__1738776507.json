  "query": "Question: Which of the following changes occurs as a solid is heated?\n\nChoices:\nA: The kinetic energy of the solid decreases.\nB: The average density of the solid increases.\nC: The specific heat capacity of the solid decreases.\nD: The average molecular speed in the solid increases.",
  "steps": [
    "When a solid is heated, energy is added to the particles that make up the solid.",
    "The added energy increases the kinetic energy of the particles, causing them to vibrate more rapidly.",
    "As the kinetic energy increases, the average molecular speed also increases.",
    "The density of a solid typically decreases when heated, as most materials expand when heated.",
    "The specific heat capacity can vary with temperature, but it generally doesn't decrease in a manner consistent with the question's context."
