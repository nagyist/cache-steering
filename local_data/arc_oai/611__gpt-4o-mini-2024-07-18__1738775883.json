  "query": "Question: Which body of water has the fewest plants and animals living in it?\n\nChoices:\nA: ocean\nB: stream\nC: glacier\nD: estuary",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the characteristics of each body of water listed in the choices. Oceans are large and generally contain a diverse range of flora and fauna due to their vastness. Streams, being freshwater bodies, usually have some level of plant and animal life based on their size and location. Estuaries are nutrient-rich environments where freshwater meets saltwater, supporting many plants and animals.",
    "Next, analyze glaciers. Glaciers are large ice formations and are inhospitable to most life forms. The extreme cold and lack of liquid water during certain conditions significantly limit the number of plants and animals that can survive in or on a glacier.",
    "Compare the level of biodiversity among the options. Oceans, streams, and estuaries support a wide variety of life, while glaciers are primarily devoid of life due to their harsh conditions. Therefore, glaciers would have the fewest plants and animals living in them compared to the other bodies of water listed."
