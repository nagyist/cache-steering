  "query": "Question: Mercury and gold are both metals. Unlike gold, mercury cannot be used to make jewelry because it is a liquid at room temperature. The difference in the state of matter is an example of which type of property?\n\nChoices:\nA: chemical\nB: electrical\nC: nuclear\nD: physical",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the state of matter differences between mercury and gold. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, while gold is a solid.",
    "Next, determine what type of properties involve states of matter. States of matter (solid, liquid, gas) are described as physical properties.",
    "Consider the definitions of the other options: \n- Chemical properties relate to a substance's ability to undergo chemical changes.\n- Electrical properties pertain to how a material interacts with electricity.\n- Nuclear properties involve the behavior of atomic nuclei.\nNone of these pertain to the state of matter."
