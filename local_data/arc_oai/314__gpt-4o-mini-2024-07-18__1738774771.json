  "query": "Question: In a grassland ecosystem, if the population of eagles suddenly decreased, what will most likely be the effect on the rest of the ecosystem?\n\nChoices:\nA: The ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes.\nB: There will be a decrease in the population of snakes in the ecosystem.\nC: The nutrition of the soil in the ecosystem will decrease.\nD: More types of plants will begin growing in the ecosystem.",
  "steps": [
    "The population of eagles generally preys on smaller animals, including snakes. If the eagle population decreases, there will be less predation on these smaller animals.",
    "With reduced predation pressure, the population of snakes is likely to increase due to lower mortality rates.",
    "An increase in the snake population can lead to greater competition for food among those snakes and can affect the populations of their prey, which may include rodents or other small animals.",
    "The question specifically asks for the effect on the rest of the ecosystem, and since the population of snakes is likely to increase, this suggests that option A, stating the ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes, is the most plausible outcome."
