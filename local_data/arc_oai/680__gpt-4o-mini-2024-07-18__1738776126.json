  "query": "Question: Growth and activities of organisms can speed up the chemical weathering of rocks. Which organisms naturally cause most of the chemical weathering of rocks?\n\nChoices:\nA: small mammals\nB: plant seedlings\nC: mosses\nD: insects",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what chemical weathering is and how it occurs. Chemical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks through chemical reactions, often influenced by the presence of certain organisms.",
    "Next, we consider which of the given organisms are known to contribute significantly to these chemical processes. Organisms that release acids or organic matter can enhance weathering.",
    "Mosses, in particular, can secrete organic acids and contribute to the weathering process of rocks. They thrive in moist environments and can grow on rocks, breaking down minerals more effectively than many other organisms.",
    "While insects, plant seedlings, and small mammals may interact with rocks and soil, they generally do not play as direct a role in chemical weathering as mosses do."
