  "query": "Question: Mice, rabbits, bobcats, and squirrels all live in a brush ecosystem. Which animal would have the most difficult time surviving if the population of the other three animals continued to decrease?\n\nChoices:\nA: mouse\nB: squirrel\nC: bobcat\nD: rabbit",
  "steps": [
    "First, assess the relationships between the animals in terms of food chains and ecosystems. Mice, rabbits, and squirrels are herbivores, while bobcats are carnivores that prey on these smaller animals.",
    "Next, consider what happens when the populations of mice, rabbits, and squirrels decrease. The decrease in these herbivores would lead to less food available for the bobcat, which relies on them as a primary food source.",
    "Now, think about the survival of the herbivores themselves. If their populations are decreasing, they are still able to find enough sustenance to survive for a time but would be limited in numbers.",
    "Determine the effect of a dramatic decline in the herbivore population. A continued decline would severely impact the bobcat's ability to find food, making survival increasingly difficult for the bobcat compared to the other animals."
