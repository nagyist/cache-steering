  "query": "Question: A student uses clay to build models of an ocean plate and a continental plate. What characteristic cannot be accurately represented by the models?\n\nChoices:\nA: the shapes of plates\nB: the relative sizes of plates\nC: the relative densities of plates\nD: the arrangement of plates relative to one another",
  "steps": [
    "The student is using clay to create physical models of the ocean and continental plates, which can help visualize the shapes and arrangements of these plates.",
    "While the shapes of the plates can be modeled and they can be made to reflect the general arrangement and relative sizes of the plates based on knowledge, the actual densities of materials cannot be accurately represented with clay.",
    "In reality, oceanic plates are denser than continental plates, a property that clay cannot depict since it has a uniform density and does not vary like the natural substances of the Earth's crust."

  "solution": "C"
