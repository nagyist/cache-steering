  "query": "Question: Birds that do not receive adequate nutrition during development sing less often and for shorter periods of time as adult birds. Which best describes the outcome of nutritional stress in these songbirds?\n\nChoices:\nA: They are less likely to ward off predators.\nB: They are less likely to obtain good nesting sites.\nC: They are less likely to find adequate food supplies.\nD: They are less likely to attract mates and pass on their genes.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that birds experiencing nutritional stress during development sing less often and for shorter periods as adults. This suggests that their ability to communicate effectively through song is compromised.",
    "In songbirds, an important function of song is to attract mates. If these birds are not singing sufficiently or effectively due to nutritional stress, it is likely that they will struggle to attract mates.",
    "Attracting mates is critical for passing on genes. Therefore, if these birds are less likely to attract mates, it would adversely affect their reproductive success and the continuation of their genes in the population."
