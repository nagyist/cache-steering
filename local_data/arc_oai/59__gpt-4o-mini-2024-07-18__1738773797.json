  "query": "Question: Which term best describes the life cycle of an insect that reaches the adult stage without being a pupa?\n\nChoices:\nA: incomplete metamorphosis\nB: complete metamorphosis\nC: alternation of generations\nD: spontaneous mutation",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the type of life cycle of an insect. It specifically mentions that the insect reaches the adult stage without being a pupa.",
    "Insects typically undergo one of two types of metamorphosis: complete metamorphosis or incomplete metamorphosis.",
    "Complete metamorphosis involves four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Since the question states there is no pupa involved, this cannot be complete metamorphosis.",
    "Incomplete metamorphosis, on the other hand, involves three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The nymphs look similar to the adults, and there is no pupa stage.",
    "Given that the insect life cycle described has no pupa stage, it aligns with the definition of incomplete metamorphosis."
