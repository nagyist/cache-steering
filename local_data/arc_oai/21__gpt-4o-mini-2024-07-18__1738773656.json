  "query": "Question: A signal from the brain to a muscle in the arm is transmitted by which structures?\n\nChoices:\nA: sensory neurons\nB: interneurons\nC: motor neurons\nD: mechanoreceptor neurons",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the type of neurons that transmit signals from the brain to a muscle in the arm.",
    "Sensory neurons are responsible for transmitting signals from sensory organs to the brain, not from the brain to muscles.",
    "Interneurons are primarily involved in processing information within the central nervous system and do not directly control muscle movements.",
    "Motor neurons are specifically responsible for carrying signals from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, facilitating movement.",
    "Mechanoreceptor neurons are sensory receptors that respond to mechanical pressure or distortion but do not transmit signals from the brain to the muscles."
