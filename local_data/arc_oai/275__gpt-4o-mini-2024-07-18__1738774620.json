  "steps": [
    "First, we examine each option to see how it helps defend against predators. A cat's long tail can assist with balance, but it is not a defense mechanism against predators.",
    "Next, a dog's thick fur may help in thermoregulation and protection from the environment, but it does not directly defend against predators.",
    "A beaver's flat tail is primarily used for swimming and can be used to slap the water as a warning sign, but it does not serve as a significant defense mechanism.",
    "A skunk's strong scent is a well-known defense mechanism that can deter predators effectively by causing an unpleasant reaction when sprayed."
