  "query": "Question: A scientist put several different plants in a sealed container. Every hour, she checked the oxygen in the container to see if it changed. How did the oxygen in the container most likely change?\n\nChoices:\nA: The amount of oxygen increased.\nB: The amount of oxygen decreased.\nC: The oxygen was transformed into water.\nD: The oxygen was transformed into carbon dioxide.",
  "steps": [
    "The plants in the container undergo photosynthesis, a process in which they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen in the presence of sunlight.",
    "Since the scientist is checking the oxygen levels every hour, it is reasonable to assume that the plants are exposed to light, allowing them to perform photosynthesis.",
    "If the plants are actively photosynthesizing, the oxygen level in the sealed container would be expected to increase as the plants release oxygen as a byproduct."

  "solution": "A"
