  "query": "Question: Which of the following does not affect the strength of an electromagnet?\n\nChoices:\nA: number of times the wire is looped around the core\nB: size of the object being attracted by the core\nC: type of material in the core\nD: amount of material in the core",
  "steps": [
    "Electromagnet strength is affected by the number of wire loops around the core. More loops create a stronger magnetic field.",
    "The type of material used for the core (ferromagnetic materials like iron) significantly impacts the strength of the electromagnet. Certain materials enhance the magnetic field considerably.",
    "The amount of material in the core can also influence strength; more material usually means a stronger electromagnet, as it can conduct more magnetic lines of force.",
    "However, the size of the object being attracted by the core does not affect the strength of the electromagnet itself but rather the interaction of the electromagnet with the object."
