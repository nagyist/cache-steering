  "query": "Question: Which is the best example a chemical change has occurred?\n\nChoices:\nA: change of state\nB: release of energy\nC: temperature change\nD: formation of a new substance",
  "steps": [
    "A chemical change occurs when a substance transforms into one or more different substances.",
    "Option A, \"change of state,\" refers to physical changes like melting or freezing, which do not involve a change in chemical composition.",
    "Option B, \"release of energy,\" can occur in both physical and chemical changes, so this alone does not confirm a chemical change.",
    "Option C, \"temperature change,\" can also happen in both physical and chemical processes and does not specifically indicate a chemical change.",
    "Option D, \"formation of a new substance,\" is a definitive indicator of a chemical change since it signifies that the original substance has undergone a transformation on a molecular level."

  "solution": "D"
