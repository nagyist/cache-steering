  "query": "Question: Students recorded the initial and final temperatures of different-colored soils exposed to direct sunlight for three hours. The students want to compare the total temperature change for each soil color. Which of these formats would be the most appropriate for displaying the results of this investigation?\n\nChoices:\nA: bar graph\nB: line graph\nC: pie chart\nD: data table",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what the students are measuring: the total temperature change for each soil color.",
    "The data involves comparing different values (temperature changes) across multiple categories (soil colors).",
    "A bar graph would effectively show the temperature change for each soil color, making it easy to compare the heights (changes) visually.",
    "A line graph is more suitable for showing trends over time, which is not applicable here since there is just a single period of measurement (three hours).",
    "A pie chart displays parts of a whole, which does not apply in each case of comparing temperature changes across separate categories.",
    "A data table would present the information clearly but may not allow for easy visual comparison as a graph would."
