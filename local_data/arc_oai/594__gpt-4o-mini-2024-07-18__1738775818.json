  "query": "Question: If there is a great deal of precipitation occurring in a short time, which process in the water cycle will be affected first?\n\nChoices:\nA: runoff\nB: evaporation\nC: condensation\nD: transpiration",
  "steps": [
    "A great deal of precipitation indicates that rain or snow is falling from the atmosphere to the ground.",
    "When precipitation occurs, it typically results in excess water on the surface, which leads to surface runoff.",
    "Evaporation, condensation, and transpiration are processes that are less immediately impacted compared to the direct impact of precipitation.",
    "Therefore, runoff is the process that is affected first when a significant amount of precipitation occurs."

  "solution": "A"
