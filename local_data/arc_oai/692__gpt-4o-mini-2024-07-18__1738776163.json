  "query": "Question: A student prepares a report on gradual environmental changes. Which is the best topic for this report?\n\nChoices:\nA: forest fires in mountain regions\nB: succession that transforms grassland to forest\nC: decomposition of a desert rodent\nD: flash flooding in a country area",
  "steps": [
    "The report focuses on gradual environmental changes, which implies a topic that involves slow and progressive alterations in ecosystems or environments over time.",
    "Choice A (forest fires in mountain regions) refers to sudden events that cause immediate changes, rather than gradual ones.",
    "Choice C (decomposition of a desert rodent) concerns the breakdown of organic material, which could involve gradual processes, but is relatively specific and does not address larger environmental changes overall.",
    "Choice D (flash flooding in a country area) also describes sudden occurrences rather than gradual changes.",
    "Choice B (succession that transforms grassland to forest) involves a gradual process of ecological change, where species replace one another over time, making it the best fit for the report's focus."
