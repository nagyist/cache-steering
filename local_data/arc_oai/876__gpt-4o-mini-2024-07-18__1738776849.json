  "query": "Question: Which of these describes water in a solid state?\n\nChoices:\nA: Vapor rising in the sky\nB: Hail during a storm\nC: Waves crashing on the seashore\nD: Rain falling from the clouds",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify the option that describes water in its solid state, which is ice.",
    "The option that directly mentions a solid form of water is important, so we will look for words related to ice or solidification.",
    "Option A refers to water vapor, which is a gas, and does not describe a solid state.",
    "Option B mentions hail, which is also a solid form of water (ice) that forms during specific weather conditions.",
    "Option C describes waves, which are a movement of liquid water, not a solid state.",
    "Option D refers to rain, which is liquid water falling from the clouds, therefore not a solid.",
    "From our analysis, the only option that accurately describes water in a solid state is Option B, which is hail."
