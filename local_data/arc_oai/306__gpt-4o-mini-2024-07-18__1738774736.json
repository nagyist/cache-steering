  "query": "Question: If an experiment results in data that do not support the hypothesis, what is the most likely step to take next?\n\nChoices:\nA: Change the data to support the hypothesis.\nB: Perform the experiment without using control groups.\nC: Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.\nD: Perform the experiment using a larger number of variables.",
  "steps": [
    "If the results of the experiment do not support the hypothesis, it indicates that the initial hypothesis may be incorrect or requires modification.",
    "One appropriate scientific method after receiving data that does not support the hypothesis is to make further observations related to the experiment and form a new testable hypothesis based on these observations.",
    "Changing the data is unethical (choice A). Performing the experiment without control groups is not advisable as it would reduce reliability (choice B). Increasing variables in the experiment can complicate results rather than clarify them (choice D)."
