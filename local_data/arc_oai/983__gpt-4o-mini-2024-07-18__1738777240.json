  "steps": [
    "The fossil found has longer tusks and is larger than current elephant species, which suggests a comparison between past and present features of elephants.",
    "The differences in size and tusk length imply that there have been physical changes in elephants over time, indicating evolutionary adaptations.",
    "Examining the fossil's characteristics in relation to currently living elephants allows scientists to understand how elephants have evolved."
