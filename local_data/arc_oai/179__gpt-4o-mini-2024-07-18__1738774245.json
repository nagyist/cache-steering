  "query": "Question: Most electrical wires are covered with plastic or rubber. The wires are covered with plastic or rubber because those materials\n\nChoices:\nA: are conductors of electricity\nB: make complete electric circuits\nC: are not conductors of electricity\nD: make the electricity move quickly",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the main function of the plastic or rubber covering on electrical wires.",
    "Understand that the covering prevents electrical current from flowing outside the wire.",
    "Recognize that materials used for covering wires must not conduct electricity to ensure safety.",
    "Evaluate the options based on the reasoning that the covering materials must prevent electricity from passing through.",
    "Determine which choice correctly explains that the materials used (plastic and rubber) are insulators, meaning they do not conduct electricity."
