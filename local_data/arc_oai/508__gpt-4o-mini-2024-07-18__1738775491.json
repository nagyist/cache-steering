The force exerted by the table must be\n\nChoices:\nA: equal to the force of the ball.\nB: continually changing with the ball.\nC: greater than the force of the ball.\nD: less than the force of the ball.",
  "steps": [
    "The bowling ball exerts a downward force due to its weight, which is a result of gravity acting on its mass.",
    "According to Newton's third law of motion, the force exerted by the table on the ball (the normal force) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the ball on the table.",
    "Since the ball is motionless and not accelerating, the forces must be balanced; therefore, the normal force from the table must equal the weight of the ball."
