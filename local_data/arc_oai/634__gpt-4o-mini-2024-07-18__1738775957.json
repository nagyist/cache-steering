  "query": "Question: Which fact about water is an example of a chemical property?\n\nChoices:\nA: Water expands when it freezes.\nB: The boiling point of water is 100\u00baC.\nC: Water can separate into hydrogen and oxygen.\nD: The density of water is greater than the density of ice.",
  "steps": [
    "A chemical property describes a substance's ability to undergo changes that transform it into different substances.",
    "Choice C states that water can separate into hydrogen and oxygen, which indicates a change in its chemical composition.",
    "Choices A, B, and D describe physical properties of water, such as its expansion upon freezing, its boiling point, and its density compared to ice, respectively.",
    "Since only choice C describes a transformation resulting in new substances (hydrogen and oxygen), it is the correct example of a chemical property."
