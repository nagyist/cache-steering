  "query": "Question: Many plants tend to wilt on a hot, sunny day. The most likely cause of this wilting is\n\nChoices:\nA: geotropism.\nB: photosynthesis.\nC: dehydration.\nD: blooming.",
  "steps": [
    "Plants tend to wilt when they lose more water than they are able to absorb from the soil, especially on hot, sunny days when evaporation rates increase.",
    "Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which does not directly cause wilting, although high rates of photosynthesis can increase water usage.",
    "Geotropism refers to a plant's growth response to gravity, which is unrelated to the wilting process.",
    "Blooming refers to the process of flowering and is not directly related to the conditions causing wilting.",
    "Given the context, the most likely cause of wilting due to the loss of water on a hot day is dehydration."
