  "steps": [
    "We need to identify the type of motion that describes one complete year for Earth.",
    "An Earth year is defined as the time it takes for Earth to complete one full orbit around the sun.",
    "This motion is referred to as revolution, specifically the revolution of Earth around the sun.",
    "The other choices either incorrectly describe the motion or refer to incorrect subjects (e.g., the sun revolving around Earth)."
