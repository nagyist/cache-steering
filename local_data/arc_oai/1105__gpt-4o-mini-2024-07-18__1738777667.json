  "query": "Question: A species of bird has not been seen since the 1900s and is considered extinct. Which evidence would best disprove the claim that the bird is extinct?\n\nChoices:\nA: A bird watcher makes a sketch of the bird.\nB: A scientist discovers fossil remains of the bird.\nC: A researcher takes a photograph of the bird.\nD: A park ranger finds a suitable habitat for the bird.",
  "steps": [
    "To disprove the claim that the bird is extinct, there needs to be direct, conclusive evidence that the bird is still alive.",
    "Option A involves a sketch made by a bird watcher, which, while it suggests a sighting, does not provide definitive proof that the bird is alive as sketches can be based on imagination or memory.",
    "Option B entails the discovery of fossil remains, which only provides evidence of the bird's existence in the past and cannot demonstrate that it is currently alive.",
    "Option C involves a photograph of a live bird, which would serve as solid evidence that the bird still exists today and effectively disproves its claimed extinction.",
    "Option D discusses the discovery of a suitable habitat but does not provide any direct evidence of the bird's existence or survival in that habitat."
