  "query": "Question: Which of these tools would be best to use when observing insects in a field?\n\nChoices:\nA: compass\nB: hand lens\nC: microscope\nD: thermometer",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the purpose of observing insects. To effectively study insects in their natural habitat, one needs a tool that enhances visibility of small details.",
    "Next, evaluate the provided options. A compass helps with navigation, a thermometer measures temperature, but neither directly aids in observing small creatures.",
    "Then, a microscope is designed for very close examination, but using it in a field setting might be impractical since it requires a stable, controlled environment.",
    "Now, a hand lens is portable and specifically designed for magnifying small objects like insects, making it very useful in field observations.",
    "Finally, compare the effectiveness of a hand lens to other tools; it strikes a balance between functionality and convenience for observing insects in the field."
