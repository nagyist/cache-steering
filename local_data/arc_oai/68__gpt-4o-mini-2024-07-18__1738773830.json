  "query": "Question: Why do areas in the middle of a large continent generally have more extreme differences in temperature than areas near the coastline?\n\nChoices:\nA: There are generally more clouds near the oceans.\nB: Landlocked areas are usually at a lower altitude than coastline areas.\nC: Coastlines are usually surrounded by mountains that block air masses.\nD: Oceans change temperature slowly and regulate the temperature of nearby land.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about temperature differences in the interior of large continents compared to coastal areas.",
    "Coastal areas are influenced by large bodies of water, which have a moderating effect on temperature.",
    "Land areas can heat up quickly in summer and cool down quickly in winter, leading to more extreme temperatures.",
    "Oceans have a higher heat capacity than land, meaning they change temperature more slowly, which helps to regulate the climate of coastal areas.",
    "Thus, the correct choice relates to the ocean's role in temperature regulation, which points to option D as the most accurate explanation."
