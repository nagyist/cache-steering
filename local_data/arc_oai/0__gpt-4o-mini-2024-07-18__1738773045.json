  "query": "Question: George wants to warm his hands quickly by rubbing them. Which skin surface will produce the most heat?\n\nChoices:\nA: dry palms\nB: wet palms\nC: palms covered with oil\nD: palms covered with lotion",
  "steps": [
    "The primary source of heat generation when rubbing hands together comes from friction between the skin surfaces.",
    "Dry skin surfaces will generate more friction because there is less lubrication compared to wet or oily surfaces.",
    "Wet palms will tend to slide against each other more easily, reducing friction and consequently lower heat generation.",
    "Palms covered with oil will also create a slippery surface, decreasing friction and heat compared to dry skin.",
    "Palms covered with lotion may provide some moisture but typically still allow for more friction than completely wet or oily surfaces.",
    "Among the options provided, the dry palms will create the most friction and, therefore, generate the most heat."
