  "query": "Question: Daffodils are plants that can perform both asexual and sexual reproduction. How does a daffodil population benefit more by reproducing sexually than asexually?\n\nChoices:\nA: It can reproduce more rapidly.\nB: It can adapt faster to its environment.\nC: It can increase the diversity of inherited traits.\nD: It can eliminate unfavorable traits from the gene pool.",
  "steps": [
    "Daffodils can reproduce both sexually, which involves combination of genetic material from two parent plants, and asexually, which involves cloning the same genetic material from one parent.",
    "Sexual reproduction leads to genetic variation, as the offspring have different combinations of genes from both parents.",
    "This genetic variation is beneficial for populations because it can lead to a greater diversity of inherited traits, enhancing adaptability to changing environments.",
    "On the other hand, asexual reproduction generates genetically identical offspring, which may limit adaptability and resilience against diseases and environmental changes.",
    "Among the provided options, the one that best summarizes the advantage of sexual reproduction in increasing the variety of traits in a daffodil population is the increase in diversity of inherited traits."
