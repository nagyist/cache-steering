  "query": "Question: In a tug-of-war game, balanced forces are best represented when both teams cause the flag to\n\nChoices:\nA: stay in the middle.\nB: fall to the ground.\nC: move slowly in one direction.\nD: be pulled quickly in one direction.",
  "steps": [
    "In a tug-of-war, balanced forces occur when neither team is able to overpower the other, resulting in a stable position of the flag.",
    "If both teams are exerting equal force, the flag would not move towards either team, indicating that the forces are balanced.",
    "Therefore, the best representation of balanced forces is when the flag stays in the middle, as it shows that no clear force is winning over the other."

  "solution": "A"
