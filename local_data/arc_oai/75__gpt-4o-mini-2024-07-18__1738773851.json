  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which property of a mineral is observable just by looking at it, without any testing or measurement tools.",
    "Luster refers to how light reflects off the surface of a mineral, which can be easily assessed visually.",
    "Mass and weight require measurements with specific tools like a scale, thus they cannot be determined just by looking.",
    "Hardness is typically determined through testing against other materials, so visual assessment alone is insufficient.",
    "Since luster can be observed directly by looking at the mineral, it is the only property from the choices given that can be determined in this manner."
