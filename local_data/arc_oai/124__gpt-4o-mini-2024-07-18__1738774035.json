  "query": "Question: Which of the following will reduce a home electric bill?\n\nChoices:\nA: using cloth napkins rather than paper towels\nB: drying clothes on a clothesline on sunny days\nC: keeping appliances plugged in when not in use\nD: using incandescent light bulbs in the lamps",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze each option regarding their potential to reduce a home electric bill.",
    "Option A: Using cloth napkins instead of paper towels primarily reduces disposable paper waste, but does not have a direct impact on the electric bill.",
    "Option B: Drying clothes on a clothesline on sunny days eliminates the need for a clothes dryer, directly reducing electricity consumption and thereby lowering the electric bill.",
    "Option C: Keeping appliances plugged in when not in use wastes electricity due to phantom load, which would increase the electric bill rather than reduce it.",
    "Option D: Using incandescent light bulbs consumes more electricity compared to energy-efficient alternatives such as LED bulbs, and therefore would lead to higher electricity costs.",
    "From the analysis, it is clear that option B is the only choice that will effectively reduce a home electric bill."
