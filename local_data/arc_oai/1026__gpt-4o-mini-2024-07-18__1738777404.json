    "A bird's egg is primarily a means of reproduction and contains a developing embryo, which is similar in function to a seed in a plant.",
    "A seed contains the plant embryo and the necessary nutrients to support its early growth, much like an egg contains the bird embryo and nutrients.",
    "The other options (leaf, root, stem) do not reproduce or develop into new organisms in the same way that seeds do."
