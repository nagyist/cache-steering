  "query": "Question: The Periodic Table of the Elements is arranged so that elements with similar characteristics are in the same column. Which element is a highly reactive metal?\n\nChoices:\nA: chlorine (Cl)\nB: helium (He)\nC: magnesium (Mg)\nD: silver (Ag)",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the categories of elements listed in the choices: chlorine is a non-metal, helium is a noble gas, magnesium is an alkaline earth metal, and silver is a transition metal.",
    "Determine the reactivity of each element: chlorine is a highly reactive non-metal, helium is inert and not reactive, magnesium is a moderately reactive metal, and silver is known for being less reactive.",
    "Evaluate the options for highly reactive metals: among the choices, magnesium is the only metal listed and it is known for its reactivity, especially with water and acids.",
    "Although chlorine is highly reactive, it is not a metal. Therefore, magnesium is the best choice for a highly reactive metal among the options provided."
