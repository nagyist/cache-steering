  "query": "Question: Which is a nonrenewable resource?\n\nChoices:\nA: oil\nB: trees\nC: solar energy\nD: food crops",
  "steps": [
    "To classify a resource as nonrenewable, it should not be able to replenish naturally within a human timescale or at a rate comparable to its consumption.",
    "Oil is formed from ancient organic materials over millions of years, and the current rate of consumption far exceeds the rate at which it can be naturally replenished.",
    "Trees and food crops are examples of renewable resources as they can be regrown and harvested repeatedly within a human timescale.",
    "Solar energy is also a renewable resource, as it is continuously available from the sun's rays and can be harnessed without depletion.",
    "Since oil is the only option that fits the definition of a nonrenewable resource among the choices provided, it is the correct answer."
