  "query": "Question: When a button is pushed on a battery-operated clock, the time display is illuminated. What process has taken place?\n\nChoices:\nA: Pressure has been converted to light.\nB: Force has been converted to light.\nC: Closing an electric circuit has produced light.\nD: Opening an electric circuit has produced light.",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a button that, when pushed, causes the time display of a clock to become illuminated.",
    "Illumination in this context typically involves the flow of electricity powering a light source (like an LED) that lights up the display.",
    "Pushing the button likely completes or closes an electric circuit, allowing electricity to flow to the display and produce light.",
    "The choices given suggest we are looking for what exactly happens when the button is pushed in terms of electrical processes.",
    "Since the button press closes the circuit and allows the display to light up, the most accurate description of the process is that closing an electric circuit has produced light."
