  "query": "Question: Secondary succession is a process that reestablishes a previously colonized, but disturbed or damaged habitat. Which will most likely result in colonization by large herbivores and carnivores?\n\nChoices:\nA: saplings and trees\nB: grasses and shrubs\nC: lichens and mosses\nD: seedlings and bushes",
  "steps": [
    "Secondary succession begins in an area where the environment has been disturbed or damaged but where soil is still present.",
    "The initial stages of secondary succession typically see pioneer species such as grasses and shrubs taking hold because they can quickly colonize and stabilize the soil.",
    "Over time, these pioneer species provide the necessary conditions for larger plants and trees to grow by improving the soil quality.",
    "Large herbivores and carnivores are typically attracted to an environment that offers substantial vegetation, such as saplings and trees, which provide both food and shelter."
