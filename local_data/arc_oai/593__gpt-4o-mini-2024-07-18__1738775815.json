  "query": "Question: In certain species of plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p). If two heterozygous plants are crossed, what will be the phenotype of the offspring?\n\nChoices:\nA: 100% purple flowers\nB: 100% white flowers\nC: 75% white flowers, 25% purple flowers\nD: 25% white flowers, 75% purple flowers",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the genotypes of the parent plants. Since both plants are heterozygous for flower color, their genotypes are Pp and Pp.",
    "Determine the possible gametes produced by each parent. Each heterozygous plant (Pp) can produce two types of gametes: P (dominant) and p (recessive).",
    "Set up a Punnett square to find out the possible genotypes of the offspring from the cross Pp x Pp. The Punnett square will have four squares:\n- PP (homozygous dominant)\n- Pp (heterozygous)\n- Pp (heterozygous)\n- pp (homozygous recessive)",
    "Count the phenotypes of the offspring from the Punnett square results. The phenotypes corresponding to the genotypes are:\n- PP = purple flowers\n- Pp = purple flowers\n- Pp = purple flowers\n- pp = white flowers\nThus, there are 3 purple (PP and Pp) and 1 white (pp), leading to a ratio of 3:1.",
    "Convert the ratio to a percentage. 3 out of 4 (or 75%) of the offspring will have purple flowers, and 1 out of 4 (or 25%) will have white flowers."
