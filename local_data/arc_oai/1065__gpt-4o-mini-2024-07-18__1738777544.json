  "query": "Question: An oceanic plate subducts under a continental plate. Which of these landforms most likely results from the interaction of these plates?\n\nChoices:\nA: volcanic mountains\nB: transform boundaries\nC: continental shelves\nD: normal faults",
  "steps": [
    "An oceanic plate is denser than a continental plate, so when they interact, the oceanic plate typically subducts beneath the continental plate.",
    "Subduction of an oceanic plate leads to the melting of mantle material and contributes to volcanic activity as magma rises to the surface.",
    "Volcanic mountains are commonly formed at subduction zones where the oceanic plate pushes under the continental plate, resulting in mountain ranges like the Andes.",
    "The other options (transform boundaries, continental shelves, normal faults) do not directly result from the subduction of an oceanic plate under a continental plate."
