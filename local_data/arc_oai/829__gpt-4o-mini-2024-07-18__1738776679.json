  "steps": [
    "I need to identify which of the listed factors has not been determined by doctors to cause heart disease in humans.",
    "Reviewing the options, A (genes that code for heart defects) is known to contribute to heart diseases due to hereditary issues.",
    "B (infections that damage the heart muscle) is also a recognized cause, as certain infections can lead to conditions like myocarditis, which affects heart function.",
    "C (other diseases that cause the heart to wear out) typically refers to diseases that can affect heart functionality over time, such as diabetes or hypertension, which can lead to heart disease.",
    "D (intense exercise that increases the heart rate) generally is not considered a cause of heart disease; in fact, moderate to intense exercise is often associated with cardiovascular health improvements.",
    "Since D is the only option that is more commonly linked to benefits for heart health rather than causing heart disease, it is the correct answer."
