  "query": "Question: Acid rain has a pH below 5.6. This rain can damage soil, lakes, crops, and buildings. Acid rain is caused by all of the following except\n\nChoices:\nA: industrial emissions from factories.\nB: coal that is burned to produce heat and power.\nC: automobile exhaust.\nD: nuclear power plants that produce radiation.",
  "steps": [
    "Acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere, which can result from industrial emissions, burning coal, and automobile exhaust.",
    "Option A (industrial emissions from factories) contributes to acid rain because factories release pollutants like SO2 and NOx.",
    "Option B (coal that is burned to produce heat and power) also causes acid rain since burning coal releases sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.",
    "Option C (automobile exhaust) adds nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere, which can lead to the formation of acid rain.",
    "Option D (nuclear power plants that produce radiation) does not produce sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides associated with acid rain formation."
