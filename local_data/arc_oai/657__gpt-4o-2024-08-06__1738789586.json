  "query": "Question: When a battery operated train is turned on, it moves along the track. Which best identifies the order of the types of energy used to make the train move?\n\nChoices:\nA: mechanical, chemical, electrical\nB: electrical, chemical, mechanical\nC: electrical, mechanical, chemical\nD: chemical, electrical, mechanical",
  "steps": [
    "The battery in the train stores energy in chemical form.",
    "When the train is turned on, the chemical energy in the battery is converted into electrical energy.",
    "The electrical energy is then used to power the train's motor, which converts the electrical energy into mechanical energy to make the train move."
  ],
  "solution": "D"
