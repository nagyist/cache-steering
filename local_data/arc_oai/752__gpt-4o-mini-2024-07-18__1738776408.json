  "query": "Question: Two pure substances combine to make a new substance. The new substance cannot be physically separated and has a different boiling point than each of the original substances. This new substance can best be classified as\n\nChoices:\nA: an atom.\nB: a mixture.\nC: an element.\nD: a compound.",
  "steps": [
    "The problem states that two pure substances combine to form a new substance. This indicates a chemical change has occurred.",
    "The new substance is described as having a different boiling point than either of the original substances, indicating that it possesses distinct chemical properties.",
    "Since the new substance cannot be physically separated back into the original substances, this further confirms that a chemical compound has formed.",
    "An atom refers to the smallest unit of an element, and an element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down further. A mixture refers to a physical combination of substances that can be separated. However, the new substance created by the combination of the two pure substances does not fit any of these definitions, but it does fit the definition of a compound."
