  "query": "Question: A car is traveling on a highway at a constant velocity. Which statement best describes the forces acting on the car?\n\nChoices:\nA: The forces acting on the car are balanced.\nB: The forces acting on the car are in the same direction.\nC: The forces acting on the car are continuing to increase.\nD: The forces acting on the car are equal to the force of gravity.",
  "steps": [
    "The car is traveling at a constant velocity, which implies that there is no net acceleration acting on it according to Newton's first law of motion.",
    "If there is no net acceleration, the forces acting on the car must be balanced, meaning that the total forces in one direction are equal to the total forces in the opposite direction.",
    "The forces can include any combination of applied forces (like engine force pushing it forward) and resistive forces (like friction and air resistance), and these must equal each other at constant velocity."
