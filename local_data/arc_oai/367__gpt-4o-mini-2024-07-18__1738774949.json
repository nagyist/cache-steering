  "query": "Question: Visible light passes through glass. Other types of electromagnetic radiation are able to pass through other materials in a similar way. Which of the following are used in medical technology because they can pass through some parts of the human body?\n\nChoices:\nA: x-rays\nB: infrared waves\nC: microwaves\nD: ultraviolet rays",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's identify which types of electromagnetic radiation can penetrate human tissues. X-rays are known for their ability to pass through the human body, making them useful in medical imaging.",
    "Next, while infrared waves can penetrate some tissues, they are primarily used for thermal imaging and treatments rather than for imaging internal structures.",
    "Microwaves are generally not used to penetrate human tissues for medical imaging; they are often associated with heating or cooking food rather than medical applications.",
    "Ultraviolet rays can damage tissues and are not typically used for imaging purposes. Their primary concern is in dermatology rather than penetration for imaging.",
    "Based on these evaluations, x-rays stand out as the primary type of radiation used in medical technology to image and analyze the human body."
