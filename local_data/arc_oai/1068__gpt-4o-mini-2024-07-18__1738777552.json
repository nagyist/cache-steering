  "query": "Question: Which most likely contributes to the rotational pattern of a hurricane that develops in the Atlantic Ocean?\n\nChoices:\nA: Gulf Stream\nB: Coriolis effect\nC: low relative humidity\nD: high-pressure systems",
  "steps": [
    "To understand the rotational pattern of a hurricane, we should first consider what factors influence its formation and movement. Hurricanes require certain conditions to develop, including warm ocean water and specific atmospheric conditions.",
    "The Coriolis effect is a result of the Earth's rotation, causing moving air and water to turn and twist. This effect is essential for the development of the rotation in large storm systems like hurricanes, influencing their spiral structure.",
    "The Gulf Stream does transport warm water and can influence hurricane intensity and paths, but it does not directly cause the rotational pattern. Hence, it is less directly related to the question.",
    "Low relative humidity would likely hinder the development of a hurricane, and high-pressure systems generally do not contribute to the development of hurricanes themselves but can affect their paths."
