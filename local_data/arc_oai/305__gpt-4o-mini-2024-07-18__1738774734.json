  "query": "Question: A student used the dimmest setting on a light microscope to observe a euglena and an amoeba. The student shined a narrow beam of light at the top of the cover slip. She observed that the euglena swam up toward the light but the amoeba did not. She knew the amoeba was alive because it slowly changed shape while she watched. What inference should the student draw from her observation?\n\nChoices:\nA: An amoeba can only move side to side.\nB: An amoeba is unable to respond to light.\nC: An amoeba moves too slowly to observe.\nD: An amoeba only moves when it is hungry.",
  "steps": [
    "The student observed that the euglena swam up toward the light, indicating a positive response to light, or phototaxis. In contrast, the amoeba did not exhibit similar movement toward the light source.",
    "Despite the amoeba not swimming toward the light, it was confirmed to be alive because it changed shape slowly during observation. This means that the amoeba is capable of movement, just not in response to the light.",
    "Therefore, the student's observations suggest that the amoeba does not respond to light, as indicated by its lack of movement toward the light source.",
    "Based on the conclusions drawn from the observations, the most logical inference is that the amoeba is unable to respond to light, which aligns with option B."

  "solution": "B"
