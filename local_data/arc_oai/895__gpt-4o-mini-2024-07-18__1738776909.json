  "query": "Question: The ocean water near the equator absorbs more heat throughout the year than ocean water near the North Pole. Which of the following best explains this difference?\n\nChoices:\nA: The equator is closer to the Sun.\nB: The equator has higher sea levels.\nC: The equator receives more direct sunlight.\nD: The equator rotates more quickly on Earth's axis.",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves understanding how sunlight impacts ocean temperatures at different latitudes, specifically comparing the equator to the North Pole.",
    "At the equator, sunlight strikes the Earth's surface more directly compared to the North Pole, where sunlight arrives at a lower angle. This direct exposure increases the amount of solar energy absorbed by ocean water.",
    "Choice A mentions proximity to the Sun; however, the Earth is roughly the same distance from the Sun across its surface, making this option inaccurate in the context of heat absorption differences.",
    "Choice B discusses sea levels, which do not have a direct effect on the absorption of heat by the ocean water in this context.",
    "Choice D refers to the rotational speed of the Earth, which does not significantly influence how much solar energy the ocean absorbs at different locations.",
    "Therefore, the best explanation for why ocean water near the equator absorbs more heat than near the North Pole is that the equator receives more direct sunlight."
