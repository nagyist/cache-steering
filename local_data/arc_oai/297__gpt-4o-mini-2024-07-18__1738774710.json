  "query": "Question: Nectar is a sweet liquid that some flowering plants produce. A hummingbird drinks nectar from a flower. When a hummingbird drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the hummingbird's beak. The picture shows a hummingbird drinking nectar from a flower. Which statement explains the role of a hummingbird in the life cycle of a flowering plant?\n\nChoices:\nA: A hummingbird carries food to the plant.\nB: A hummingbird helps the plant reproduce.\nC: A hummingbird protects the plant from predators.\nD: A hummingbird makes the flowers produce nectar.",
  "steps": [
    "The question revolves around the interaction between hummingbirds and flowering plants, specifically during the hummingbird's feeding on nectar.",
    "The essential aspect of this interaction is that when a hummingbird drinks nectar, pollen sticks to its beak. This pollen can then be transferred to other flowers, facilitating pollination.",
    "Pollination is a critical process in the reproduction of flowering plants, as it leads to fertilization and the eventual production of seeds.",
    "Evaluating the answer choices, option B states, \"A hummingbird helps the plant reproduce,\" which directly correlates with the role of hummingbirds in pollinating flowers.",
    "The other choices (A, C, and D) do not accurately describe the hummingbird's role in the life cycle of flowering plants. They mention actions that either do not occur (like carrying food, protecting from predators, or making flowers produce nectar) or are irrelevant to the reproduction process."
