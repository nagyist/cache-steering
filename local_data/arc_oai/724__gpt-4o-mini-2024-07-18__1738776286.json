  "query": "Question: Light is refracted the least when passing through a\n\nChoices:\nA: telescope lens.\nB: a tinted window.\nC: magnifying glass.\nD: a pair of eyeglasses.",
  "steps": [
    "Let's analyze the options based on the optics principles of refraction. Refraction occurs when light passes through mediums of different densities. The amount of bending is determined by the refractive index of the materials involved.",
    "A telescope lens is designed to collect and focus light, often resulting in significant refraction.",
    "A tinted window allows some light to pass while also absorbing and reflecting certain wavelengths, which likely involves moderate refraction.",
    "A magnifying glass has a specific shape to greatly magnify an image by increasing the refraction as light passes through it.",
    "Eyeglasses are designed to correct vision and thus involve refraction, but the effect might be less dramatic compared to a magnifying glass.",
    "Among these options, the one that refracts light the least would typically be a window since it permits light to pass with only minor refraction compared to lenses designed for focusing or magnification."
