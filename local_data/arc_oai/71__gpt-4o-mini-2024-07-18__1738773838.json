  "query": "Question: New engine technology has helped cars get more mileage per gallon of gas. Since gasoline comes from oil, this technology will affect the world supply of oil by\n\nChoices:\nA: increasing the need to search for more oil.\nB: reducing the time it takes for oil to be renewed.\nC: decreasing the amount of oil that exists underground.\nD: extending the time that oil will be available for people to use.",
  "steps": [
    "The new engine technology improves fuel efficiency, meaning cars can travel further on a gallon of gas.",
    "As cars consume less gasoline due to improved mileage, the overall demand for gasoline will likely decrease.",
    "Since gasoline is derived from oil, a decrease in gasoline demand translates to a lower demand for oil extraction and production.",
    "With reduced consumption of oil, it implies that the available oil supply will last longer, extending the time oil is available for use."
