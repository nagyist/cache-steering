  "query": "Question: A fox gave birth to an offspring that had a better sense of hearing than most foxes. How could this small change most likely result in descendants that are different from the original fox?\n\nChoices:\nA: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may mutate more frequently than other foxes.\nB: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may be hunted more frequently.\nC: Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.\nD: Over time, descendants of this fox may become extinct.",
  "steps": [
    "The question explores how a small change in an individual's characteristics can influence the evolution of descendants over time.",
    "The detail given in the question is that the offspring has a better sense of hearing, which could provide a survival advantage in hunting prey.",
    "Option C suggests that as the descendants inherit this advantageous trait, they may become better hunters overall, leading to them being more successful in obtaining food.",
    "Option A suggests a relationship between mutation frequency and the sense of hearing, but it is not relevant to the direct question about evolution and traits being passed down.",
    "Option B implies that better hearing causes increased hunting pressure, which contradicts the idea that better traits provide advantages for survival and reproduction.",
    "Option D posits the possibility of extinction, which does not connect logically to the benefit of having better hearing as a survival trait.",
    "Thus, the best explanation supporting how a small change can lead to differences in descendants over time is option C, as better hearing can lead to better hunting skills which can ensure greater survival and reproduction rates."
