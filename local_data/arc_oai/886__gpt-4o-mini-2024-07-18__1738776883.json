  "query": "Question: A beaker containing 50 milliliters of ice is placed on a windowsill. After several hours, the ice melts. What property of the ice did not change when it melted?\n\nChoices:\nA: the mass\nB: the volume\nC: the temperature\nD: the state of matter",
  "steps": [
    "The ice begins with a mass, and when it melts, the mass of the water formed from the ice will be the same as the mass of the ice initially present. Therefore, the mass does not change.",
    "The volume of the ice may change upon melting because ice is less dense than water, so it expands when in solid form. Thus, the volume likely changes and is not consistent.",
    "The temperature of the ice remains at 0 degrees Celsius (the melting point of ice) until all of the ice has melted. Therefore, the temperature does not change during the melting process until the ice has completely transformed into water.",
    "The state of matter changes from solid (ice) to liquid (water) when the ice melts, so this property does change."

  "solution": "A"
