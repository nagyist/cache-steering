  "query": "Question: Heavy rains cause flooding in a valley. Which animals would most likely thrive?\n\nChoices:\nA: porcupines\nB: otters\nC: deer\nD: mice",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which animals would thrive in a flooded valley, we need to consider their habitat preferences and adaptability to wet conditions.",
    "Porcupines (A) are primarily terrestrial and prefer wooded areas with ample vegetation, making them less suited for flooded environments.",
    "Otters (B) are aquatic mammals that thrive in and around water bodies, such as rivers and lakes. They are well-adapted to wet conditions and could benefit from an increase in water availability.",
    "Deer (C) are generally terrestrial and can navigate through wet areas, but they prefer dry land and are not specifically adapted to thriving in flooded conditions.",
    "Mice (D) may survive in various environments, but they tend to prefer drier areas and can be impacted by flooding, which could lead to danger or displacement.",
    "Based on the above reasoning, the animal most likely to thrive in a flooded valley is the otter, due to its strong adaptations to living in wet environments."
