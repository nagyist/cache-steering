  "query": "Question: Puddles on a sidewalk are evaporating quickly. What most likely causes the puddles to evaporate?\n\nChoices:\nA: heat\nB: clouds\nC: air\nD: water",
  "steps": [
    "To determine what causes puddles to evaporate, we first consider the process of evaporation itself, which involves liquid turning into vapor.",
    "Heat is a significant factor in evaporation because higher temperatures provide more energy to the molecules in the liquid, causing them to gain enough energy to escape into the air as vapor.",
    "While clouds and air are relevant elements in the environment, they do not directly cause evaporation. Instead, the presence of heat influences the rate at which evaporation occurs.",
    "Water, being the substance that is evaporating, is not a cause of the evaporation process; it's the state that is changing."
