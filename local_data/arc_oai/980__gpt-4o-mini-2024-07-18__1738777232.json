  "query": "Question: As a glacier melts and retreats, a layer of bedrock is exposed. Which term best describes the process that establishes a community on the bedrock?\n\nChoices:\nA: disturbance\nB: succession\nC: weathering\nD: stabilization",
  "steps": [
    "The question involves a process that leads to the establishment of a community on a newly exposed layer of bedrock due to glacier retreat.",
    "The term \"succession\" refers to the process by which ecosystems change and develop over time, specifically after a disturbance or change in the environment, like bedrock being exposed.",
    "\"Disturbance\" typically refers to an event that disrupts the existing community but does not directly apply to the establishment of a new community.",
    "\"Weathering\" involves the breakdown of rocks and minerals, which is not the same as establishing a biological community.",
    "\"Stabilization\" indicates a state where a community has reached a balance but does not explain the process of how that community is created in the first place."
