  "query": "Question: A new battery claims that it \"lasts twice as long as competing batteries under the same loading conditions.\" Which comparison of the battery with competing batteries would validate this claim?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is twice as large.\nB: It contains more electrons.\nC: It stores more chemical energy.\nD: It destroys less energy when used.",
  "steps": [
    "The claim states that the battery lasts twice as long as competing batteries under the same loading conditions, which implies that it should be able to deliver energy for an extended period of time compared to others.",
    "To validate this claim, one would need to show that the new battery has a greater capacity for storing energy compared to competing batteries because increased energy storage would naturally lead to longer usage times.",
    "Among the options provided, the one that directly relates to the ability to last longer under the same usage conditions is the storage capacity of chemical energy, as more chemical energy would allow for a longer discharge time."
