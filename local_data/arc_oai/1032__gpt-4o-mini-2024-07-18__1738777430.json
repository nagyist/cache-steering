  "query": "Question: One of the principal causes of acid rain is\n\nChoices:\nA: waste acid from chemical factories being pumped into rivers\nB: acid from chemical laboratories evaporating into the air\nC: gases from burning coal and oil dissolving in water in the atmosphere\nD: gases from air conditioners and refrigerators escaping into the atmosphere",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the principal cause of acid rain, we need to understand what acid rain consists of. Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere, where they can dissolve in moisture and form sulfuric and nitric acids.",
    "Now, let's analyze each option. Option A talks about waste acid being pumped into rivers, which does not directly relate to the phenomenon of acid rain in the atmosphere.",
    "Option B discusses acid from chemical laboratories evaporating into the air, but this is not how the formation of acid rain typically occurs, as it doesn't involve major atmospheric reactions with significant gases.",
    "Option C states that gases from burning coal and oil dissolve in water in the atmosphere. This aligns with the known sources of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are primarily released from the combustion of fossil fuels, leading to acid rain.",
    "Lastly, Option D mentions gases from air conditioners and refrigerators, which are not substantial contributors to acid rain compared to the gases from burning coal and oil."
