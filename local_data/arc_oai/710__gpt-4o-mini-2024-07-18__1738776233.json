  "query": "Question: The radioactive isotope content of a rock can be used to identify which property of the rock?\n\nChoices:\nA: the total mass of the rock\nB: the rate at which the rock formed\nC: the types of fossils that the rock contains\nD: the amount of time passed since the rock formed",
  "steps": [
    "The radioactive isotope content of a rock is commonly used in radiometric dating methods, which provide insights into the age of the rock.",
    "By measuring the ratios of parent and daughter isotopes, scientists can calculate the elapsed time since the rock formed.",
    "This method does not provide information about the total mass of the rock, the rate of its formation, or the types of fossils present."
