  "steps": [
    "To determine which compound does not contain individual molecules, I need to consider the nature of each substance listed in the choices.",
    "Salt (NaCl) consists of a lattice structure in which sodium and chloride ions are arranged in a repeating pattern, rather than forming discrete molecules.",
    "Water (H2O) exists as individual molecules, each with a fixed ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms.",
    "Hydrogen gas (H2) is comprised of diatomic molecules (H2), which are individual molecules consisting of two hydrogen atoms.",
    "Carbon monoxide (CO) also exists as discrete molecules, with each molecule consisting of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.",
    "Based on the analysis, salt does not consist of individual molecules, but rather an ionic lattice, while the other options consist of distinct molecular units."
