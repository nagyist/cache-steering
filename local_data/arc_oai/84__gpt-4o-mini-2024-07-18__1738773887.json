  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the source of energy that drives the Earth's water cycle.",
    "The water cycle involves processes like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, which require energy.",
    "The primary source of energy that drives these processes is sunlight, which heats the Earth's surface and water bodies, allowing water to evaporate.",
    "While wind can influence the water cycle, it is not the primary energy source. Earth's radiation and gravity from the Sun do not provide the necessary energy for the water cycle itself."
