  "query": "Question: Screech owls have two color variations-red and grey. What advantage does the grey screech owl have over the red screech owl in a habitat that is made up of trees with dark-colored bark?\n\nChoices:\nA: nesting\nB: feeding\nC: reproduction\nD: camouflage",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the advantage that grey screech owls have over red screech owls in a specific habitat with dark-colored bark.",
    "In a habitat with dark-colored bark, coloration plays an important role in survival, primarily through camouflage.",
    "Grey screech owls, being a color that blends in with the dark bark, are less visible to predators and more effective at hunting prey compared to the red screech owls.",
    "Since camouflage is specifically about being less detectable in a given environment, this would be the main advantage the grey screech owl has over the red screech owl in such a habitat."
