  "query": "Question: Researchers recently discovered a gene in humans that previously was unknown to science. Which statement best explains why the gene probably was not discovered much sooner?\n\nChoices:\nA: The gene only recently evolved in humans.\nB: The technology used to study genes is still being developed.\nC: Scientists were not interested in genes until a few years ago.\nD: Scientists were sure they had already discovered every possible gene.",
  "steps": [
    "Consider why genes might not be discovered immediately, despite possibly being very influential. Technological limitations often restrict scientific discovery.",
    "Genes are complex and diverse, and not easily detected without advanced technology. The field of genetics often requires cutting-edge tools for detection and analysis.",
    "Interests and motivations of scientists typically accelerate the discovery process, so it\u2019s less likely that a gene remained hidden simply due to lack of interest.",
    "It's unlikely that scientists assumed they knew all possible genes, since science is inherently uncertain and open to discovery."

  "solution": "B"
