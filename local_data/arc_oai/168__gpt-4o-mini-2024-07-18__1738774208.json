  "steps": [
    "Young birds are vulnerable to predators while they are still learning to fly and are often unable to escape quickly.",
    "One of the ways that young birds can protect themselves from being seen by predators is through camouflage.",
    "The speckled brown coloring that mimics the appearance of leaves or ground cover can help young birds blend into their environment, making them less noticeable to potential predators.",
    "In contrast, chirping loudly, being hatched from an egg, or having small beaks are not strategies for avoiding predation before they learn to fly."
