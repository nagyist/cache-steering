  "query": "Question: Which of the following best describes the purpose of the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: to store the genetic instructions needed to specify traits\nB: to release energy by breaking down food molecules\nC: to transport nutrients into and out of the cell\nD: to protect the cells from microorganisms",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the purpose of chromosomes, which are located in the nucleus of a cell.",
    "Chromosomes are made up of DNA, which contains the genetic information that dictates how an organism develops and functions.",
    "The purpose of DNA and chromosomes is to store genetic instructions needed to specify traits, which is fundamental to biology.",
    "The other choices do not relate directly to the function of chromosomes: releasing energy is a function of mitochondria, transporting nutrients is done by the cell membrane, and protecting from microorganisms isn't associated with chromosomes."
