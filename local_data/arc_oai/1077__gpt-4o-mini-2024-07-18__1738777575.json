  "query": "Question: To determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use all of these tools except\n\nChoices:\nA: a stopwatch.\nB: a heat source.\nC: safety goggles.\nD: a thermometer.",
  "steps": [
    "The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which it changes from liquid to gas, which requires accurate measurement of temperature.",
    "To measure the temperature accurately, a thermometer is necessary to determine at what temperature the liquid boils.",
    "A heat source is also essential to heat the liquid until it reaches its boiling point, so it cannot be excluded.",
    "Safety goggles are important for protection but are not a tool used to directly determine the boiling point itself.",
    "A stopwatch is useful for timing but is not necessary for measuring the boiling point of a liquid."

  "solution": "A"
