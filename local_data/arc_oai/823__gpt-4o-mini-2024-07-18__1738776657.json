  "query": "Question: Which location on Earth has the least intense sunlight on December 22?\n\nChoices:\nA: Equator\nB: Florida\nC: Maine\nD: North Pole",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the date: December 22 is around the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, when sunlight is least intense in northern regions.",
    "Identify locations from the choices: The Equator receives nearly consistent sunlight year-round, and Florida, being in a warmer climate, also receives more sunlight. Maine, being further north, receives less sunlight than Florida and the Equator during this time, but it is still more than the North Pole.",
    "Evaluate the North Pole: At the North Pole on December 22, the sun is below the horizon throughout the day, resulting in no direct sunlight at all.",
    "Compare the sunlight intensity: Since the North Pole has no sunlight, it has the least intense sunlight compared to the other options listed, as all other locations receive some sunlight."
