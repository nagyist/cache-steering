  "query": "Question: Some animals are very rare. For example, there are very few Siberian tigers. If the only Siberian tigers left are female, what will most likely happen?\n\nChoices:\nA: The females will find another type of male animal to mate with and produce more Siberian tigers.\nB: The females will mate with each other and produce more Siberian tigers.\nC: The females will only be able to produce female Siberian tigers.\nD: The females will not be able to produce more Siberian tigers, and they will die out.",
  "steps": [
    "The situation presented states that only female Siberian tigers are left. In a typical species, the mating of male and female is required to produce offspring. If there are no male Siberian tigers, the females cannot mate.",
    "Choice A suggests that the females will find another type of male animal to mate with and produce more Siberian tigers. This is biologically impossible, as Siberian tigers can only reproduce with other Siberian tigers.",
    "Choice B states that the females will mate with each other to produce more Siberian tigers. However, female animals cannot typically produce offspring without a male partner.",
    "Choice C suggests that the females will only be able to produce female Siberian tigers. Similar to choice B, females cannot produce any offspring without a male.",
    "Choice D states that the females will not be able to produce more Siberian tigers, and they will die out. This is the most logical outcome since without males, reproduction will cease."
