  "steps": [
    "The student is using a magnifying lens, which is designed to enhance the visibility of small details in objects.",
    "Among the options, \"different colors of insect bodies\" might be visible, but the lens would not be as effective in revealing this aspect unless the colors are very distinct.",
    "The \"how insects protect themselves\" could include behavioral aspects or camouflage that may not be made clearer by simply magnifying the insects.",
    "The \"type of eyes insects have\" refers to the complex structure of their eyes, which can be observed in detail with a magnifying lens.",
    "The \"size of the insects\" can be observable due to magnification, but the primary purpose of the lens is to explore fine details, not just overall size."
