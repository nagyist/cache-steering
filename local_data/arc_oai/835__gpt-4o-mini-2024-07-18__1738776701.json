What is the most likely reason that the weeds are pulled?\n\nChoices:\nA: Weeds add fertilizer to the soil.\nB: Weeds use nutrients the roses need to grow.\nC: Weeds increase the bacteria in the soil.\nD: Weeds consume most of the oxygen.",
  "steps": [
    "The student is actively pulling weeds from around the rosebushes, indicating a concern for the health of the roses.",
    "Weeds compete with plants for resources such as nutrients, water, and light, which are essential for the growth of the rosebushes.",
    "Since the question asks for the most likely reason the weeds are being pulled, it would be logical to conclude that the weeds are using nutrients that the roses need to grow healthy.",
    "Options A, C, and D do not address the competition for nutrients that directly affects the roses' growth."
