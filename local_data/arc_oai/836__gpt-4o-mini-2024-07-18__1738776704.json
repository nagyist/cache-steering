  "query": "Question: A female opossum can give birth to 5-15 offspring. What increases with a larger litter?\n\nChoices:\nA: the rate at which they mature\nB: the number of reliable food sources\nC: the amount of maternal care per offspring\nD: the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce",
  "steps": [
    "A larger litter means that more offspring are born at once, which increases competition for resources.",
    "If competition for resources increases, it can lead to a decreased rate of survival for each individual offspring due to limited food and care provided by the mother.",
    "Therefore, with more offspring, it becomes less likely that all will receive adequate care and resources, making option C (the amount of maternal care per offspring) not increase but actually decrease.",
    "Option D states that the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce increases with larger litters because, despite the challenges, having more individuals increases the number of potential survivors.",
    "Thus, focusing on the broader implications of having a larger number of offspring, we can conclude that this does indeed increase the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce."
