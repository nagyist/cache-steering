  "query": "Question: Most of the volume of the universe is found in the space between galaxies. Objects found in the regions between galaxies are most likely to be closest in size to which of these?\n\nChoices:\nA: a dust particle\nB: an asteroid\nC: a planet\nD: a star",
  "steps": [
    "The question indicates that most of the volume of the universe is found in the intergalactic space, which generally contains a very low density of matter.",
    "Objects found in these regions are expected to be significantly smaller than galaxies and stars, as these regions are mostly empty.",
    "Among the choices given, a dust particle is much smaller in size compared to an asteroid, a planet, or a star.",
    "An asteroid is still relatively large compared to dust particles and would not typically be the smallest object found in vast empty regions of space.",
    "The appropriate choice would be the one that signifies something extremely small, which is illustrated by a dust particle rather than larger celestial bodies."
