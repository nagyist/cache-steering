  "query": "Question: Students made lemonade using the following recipe: 100 grams of lemon juice 100 grams of sugar 1,000 grams of water The students combined the lemon juice, sugar, and water in a container. They stirred the lemonade until all the sugar dissolved. They poured the lemonade into a plastic tray and put the tray in a freezer. The next day, the students removed the tray from the freezer and observed that the lemonade was a solid. What is the mass of the solid lemonade?\n\nChoices:\nA: 100 grams\nB: 200 grams\nC: 1,000 grams\nD: 1,200 grams",
  "steps": [
    "Start by identifying the total mass of all the ingredients used to make the lemonade. The recipe includes 100 grams of lemon juice, 100 grams of sugar, and 1,000 grams of water.",
    "Calculate the total mass by adding the masses of all components together: 100 grams (lemon juice) + 100 grams (sugar) + 1,000 grams (water) = 1,200 grams.",
    "Since the students combined all these ingredients and there is no loss of mass during the mixing and freezing process (assuming no evaporation), the mass of the solid lemonade will remain the same as the total initial mass.",
    "Therefore, the mass of the solid lemonade that they observed after removing it from the freezer is 1,200 grams."
