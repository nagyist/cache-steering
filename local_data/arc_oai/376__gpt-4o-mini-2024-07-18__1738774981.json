  "query": "Question: Which item below is NOT made from a material grown in nature?\n\nChoices:\nA: a cotton shirt\nB: a wooden chair\nC: a plastic spoon\nD: a grass basket",
  "steps": [
    "Identify which items listed are made from natural materials. A cotton shirt is made from cotton, which is a natural fiber grown from cotton plants. A wooden chair is made from wood, which comes from trees, and trees are also a natural resource. A grass basket is made from grass, another natural material.",
    "Now, look at the option for the plastic spoon. Plastic is a synthetic material that is derived from petrochemicals and is not grown in nature.",
    "Since a plastic spoon is the only item that does not originate from a natural source, we can conclude that it is the answer to the question."
