  "query": "Question: Which type of water reservoir contains the largest volume of fresh water?\n\nChoices:\nA: lakes\nB: rivers\nC: ice sheets\nD: aquifers",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the options provided: lakes, rivers, ice sheets, and aquifers.",
    "Understand that fresh water can be found in various forms: surface water (like lakes and rivers), groundwater (like aquifers), and frozen water (like ice sheets).",
    "Research statistics on the volume of fresh water in each type: lakes are significant but not as large as ice sheets, rivers contain the least volume, aquifers hold a substantial amount but still less than ice sheets.",
    "Ice sheets, particularly in Antarctica and Greenland, contain the majority of Earth's fresh water in a solid form.",
    "Based on this information, conclude that the type of water reservoir with the largest volume of fresh water is ice sheets."
