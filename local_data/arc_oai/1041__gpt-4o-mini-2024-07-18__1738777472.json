  "query": "Question: Which is an advantage of using renewable resources?\n\nChoices:\nA: They make energy more affordable.\nB: They make electricity less dangerous.\nC: They will be available for many years.\nD: They will reduce the demand for electricity.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's analyze the choices given in relation to renewable resources. Renewable resources are those that can be replenished naturally over a short time span, such as solar, wind, and hydro energy.",
    "Option A states that renewable resources make energy more affordable. While the cost of renewable energy has decreased, this isn't a guaranteed advantage universal to all renewable resources at all times.",
    "Option B suggests that renewable resources make electricity less dangerous. However, the danger associated with electricity usually pertains to how it is managed rather than the source of the electricity itself.",
    "Option C claims that renewable resources will be available for many years. This is a strong advantage because renewable resources are based on natural cycles that can be sustained indefinitely when managed properly.",
    "Option D states that renewable resources will reduce the demand for electricity. However, renewable resources provide an alternative supply of energy rather than reducing the overall demand for energy.",
    "Considering all options, option C stands out as the most accurate statement about the advantages of renewable resources."
