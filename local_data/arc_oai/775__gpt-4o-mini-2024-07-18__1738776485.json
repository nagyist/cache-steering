  "query": "Question: Which structure of a bird is correctly paired with its function?\n\nChoices:\nA: claws for obtaining food\nB: wings for eliminating waste\nC: feathers for breathing\nD: eyes for growing",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will evaluate each choice to determine if the structure is correctly paired with its function.",
    "Choice A states that \"claws are for obtaining food.\" This is correct, as many birds use their claws to catch or hold onto food.",
    "Choice B states \"wings are for eliminating waste.\" This is incorrect, as the primary function of wings is for flight, not waste elimination.",
    "Choice C claims that \"feathers are for breathing.\" This is also incorrect because feathers do not serve the function of breathing; birds breathe through their respiratory system.",
    "Choice D states \"eyes are for growing.\" This is incorrect because eyes are sensory organs and do not have a direct role in growth.",
    "After analyzing all options, the only correctly paired structure and function is in choice A, where claws are used for obtaining food."
