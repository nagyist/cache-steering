  "query": "Question: Astronomers and biologists study different areas of science. Many astronomers observe far distant objects in the sky. Many biologists study extremely small objects. What do these astronomers and biologists have most in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: They both examine the history of life on Earth.\nB: They both make discoveries using optical devices.\nC: They both study how organisms change over time.\nD: They both search for evidence about the origins of the universe.",
  "steps": [
    "Astronomers observe celestial objects, while biologists study living organisms, which are vastly different subject areas within science.",
    "However, both fields rely heavily on observation and analysis to draw conclusions about their respective subjects.",
    "Optical devices, such as telescopes for astronomers and microscopes for biologists, are essential tools for both groups to conduct their studies.",
    "The other options (A, C, and D) do not apply equally to both fields, as they speak to specific domains (history of life, organism change, origins of the universe) that are not shared."
