Which observation should be recorded as a fact?\n\nChoices:\nA: The air feels very cold.\nB: The wind is blowing at 5 m/s.\nC: It is nicer than the day before.\nD: It looks like it might warm up later.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an observation that should be recorded as a fact, which means it needs to be objective and measurable.",
    "Option A (\"The air feels very cold\") is subjective because it relies on personal feelings.",
    "Option B (\"The wind is blowing at 5 m/s\") is a measurable observation that can be objectively recorded.",
    "Option C (\"It is nicer than the day before\") is also subjective and depends on personal interpretation of what \"nicer\" means.",
    "Option D (\"It looks like it might warm up later\") is a prediction and not a fact based on current observations."
