  "query": "Question: Cell membranes are described as selectively permeable. Four students were asked to explain what this means and provided the answers given below.Student 1: Cell membranes prevent all materials from entering the cell.Student 2: Cell membranes only provide structural support for the cell.Student 3: Cell membranes regulate which substances can enter and exit the cell.Student 4: Cell membranes allow water and water-soluble substances to enter the cell.Which student correctly identified the function of the selectively permeable membrane?\n\nChoices:\nA: Student 1\nB: Student 2\nC: Student 3\nD: Student 4",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what \"selectively permeable\" means. It refers to the ability of a cell membrane to allow certain substances to pass through while restricting others.",
    "Student 1 states that cell membranes prevent all materials from entering the cell, which is incorrect since selective permeability means that some substances can cross the membrane.",
    "Student 2 claims that cell membranes only provide structural support for the cell. This is not entirely correct as it overlooks the functional aspect of regulating what enters and exits the cell.",
    "Student 3 states that cell membranes regulate which substances can enter and exit the cell. This is consistent with the definition of selectively permeable membranes.",
    "Student 4 mentions that cell membranes allow water and water-soluble substances to enter the cell. While this is true, it doesn't encompass the broader function of regulating all substances, not just water and soluble ones."
