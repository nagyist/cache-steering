  "query": "Question: A science teacher filled one balloon with helium gas and a second balloon with carbon dioxide. The helium-filled balloon rose to the ceiling, and the balloon filled with carbon dioxide fell to the floor. Which statement is an inference based on this demonstration?\n\nChoices:\nA: Each balloon behaved differently.\nB: Helium gas has a lower density than air.\nC: Carbon dioxide causes a balloon to expand.\nD: Balloons can be filled with different gases.",
  "steps": [
    "The problem describes a scenario where a balloon filled with helium rises while a balloon filled with carbon dioxide falls.",
    "The behavior of the balloons indicates that helium is less dense than the surrounding air, allowing it to rise, while carbon dioxide is denser than air, causing it to fall.",
    "The statement we are looking for should be an inference drawn from the fact that one balloon rose and the other fell, which specifically relates to their densities.",
    "While all options could be true based on the scenario, we need to isolate the inference that best explains the observed behavior."

  "solution": "B"
