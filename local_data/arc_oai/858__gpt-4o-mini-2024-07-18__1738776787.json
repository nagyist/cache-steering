  "query": "Question: Carbon on Earth is found in both living and nonliving matter. In order for carbon to be continuously available, it must be recycled. Through which process is carbon made available in the atmosphere?\n\nChoices:\nA: formation of fossil fuels\nB: layering of soil\nC: plant photosynthesis\nD: forest fires",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify which process contributes to the release of carbon into the atmosphere.",
    "Photosynthesis involves plants taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it to organic matter, effectively removing carbon from the atmosphere.",
    "The formation of fossil fuels occurs over millions of years and does not directly release carbon back into the atmosphere.",
    "Layering of soil does not involve a direct release of carbon into the atmosphere; it relates more to nutrient cycling within the soil.",
    "Forest fires do release carbon back into the atmosphere as they burn biomass, which primarily consists of carbon-based materials.",
    "Among the options given, the process that directly contributes to carbon being made available in the atmosphere through a significant release is forest fires."

  "solution": "D"
