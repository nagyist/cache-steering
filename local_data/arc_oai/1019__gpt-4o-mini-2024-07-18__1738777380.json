  "query": "Question: Which statement best describes a neutron?\n\nChoices:\nA: It has a negative charge.\nB: It moves around the nucleus.\nC: It adds mass to the nucleus.\nD: It has a positive charge.",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for a statement that best describes a neutron, which is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom.",
    "Neutrons are known to have no electric charge, meaning they are neutral; thus, options that state it has a negative or positive charge (A and D) are incorrect.",
    "While neutrons do not move around in the same way electrons do, they are stationary within the nucleus, which makes option B not the best description.",
    "Neutrons contribute to the overall mass of the nucleus, as the mass of the nucleus comes from protons and neutrons combined; thus, option C is accurate."

  "solution": "C"
