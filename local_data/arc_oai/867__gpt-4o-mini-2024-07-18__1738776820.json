  "query": "Question: Which function makes a plant cell different from an animal cell?\n\nChoices:\nA: ability to use energy\nB: ability to absorb nutrients\nC: ability to divide into two cells\nD: ability to convert sunlight into energy",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the main differences between plant cells and animal cells. One key feature of plant cells is their ability to perform photosynthesis.",
    "Next, we analyze the function related to the choices provided. The conversion of sunlight into energy specifically refers to the process of photosynthesis, which occurs in chloroplasts found in plant cells.",
    "As we evaluate the other options: A (energy usage), B (nutrient absorption), and C (cell division) are functions that are not unique to plant cells, as animal cells also have these capabilities.",
    "Thus, the only function listed that distinguishes plant cells from animal cells is the ability to convert sunlight into energy."
