  "query": "Question: Which of the following would make the best insulator against the flow of electricity?\n\nChoices:\nA: copper wire\nB: steel tubing\nC: plastic tape\nD: aluminum foil",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the properties of good electrical insulators. Good insulators are materials that do not allow the easy flow of electric current.",
    "Examine the choices provided. Copper wire and aluminum foil are metals and are known to be good conductors of electricity. Steel is also a metal and therefore a conductor.",
    "Assess the remaining option, plastic tape. Plastic is a common and well-known insulator, often used to prevent electrical conduction.",
    "Compare the conductivities of the materials. Since copper, steel, and aluminum are all conductive materials while plastic is an insulator, plastic tape stands out as the best insulator."
