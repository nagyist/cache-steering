  "query": "Question: Soils change both through natural processes and as a result of human activity. Which of the following soil changes is due only to natural causes?\n\nChoices:\nA: degradation of nutrients due to pesticides\nB: formation of deserts due to tree felling\nC: flooding due to dam construction\nD: removal of nutrients due to heavy rains",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what constitutes a natural cause. Natural causes refer to processes that occur without human intervention.",
    "Review each option to determine if the change is solely due to natural causes.",
    "Option A involves pesticides, which are a human activity, thus it is not a natural cause.",
    "Option B involves tree felling, which is again a human activity, hence not natural.",
    "Option C pertains to dam construction, a clear human intervention, so this is not natural either.",
    "Option D discusses the removal of nutrients due to heavy rains. While heavy rainfall is a natural event, it is not dependent on human activity. The nutrient removal is a natural consequence of that event and does not involve human intervention."

  "solution": "D"
