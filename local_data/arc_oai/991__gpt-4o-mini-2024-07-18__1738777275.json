  "query": "Question: Which pair of human body systems functions most closely together?\n\nChoices:\nA: nervous and excretory\nB: digestive and muscular\nC: skeletal and circulatory\nD: respiratory and cardiovascular",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze how each pair of body systems interacts with each other. The nervous system primarily controls bodily functions and responses, whereas the excretory system removes waste. While they interact, they don't work closely together in a direct functional sense.",
    "Next, the digestive system is responsible for breaking down food and nutrients, while the muscular system facilitates movement, which includes the movement of food through the digestive tract. These systems cooperate, but their functions are not directly dependent on each other.",
    "The skeletal system provides structure and support to the body, while the circulatory system transports blood and nutrients throughout the body. Though they are related, they do not have as direct a functional relationship as seen in other pairings.",
    "Finally, the respiratory system and the cardiovascular (or circulatory) system work extremely closely together. The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, while the cardiovascular system carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns deoxygenated blood back to the lungs."
