  "query": "Question: Which of the following is an example of a chemical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: clouds forming\nB: sugar dissolving\nC: water freezing\nD: a candle burning",
  "steps": [
    "A chemical change involves a transformation that alters the substance's chemical structure, resulting in new substances being formed.",
    "Option A (clouds forming) is a physical process involving water vapor condensing, not a chemical change.",
    "Option B (sugar dissolving) is also a physical change, as the chemical structure of sugar does not change when it dissolves in water.",
    "Option C (water freezing) is a physical change as well, since the molecular structure of water remains H2O whether it is in liquid or solid form.",
    "Option D (a candle burning) involves wax undergoing a combustion reaction, which produces new substances such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, indicating a chemical change."
