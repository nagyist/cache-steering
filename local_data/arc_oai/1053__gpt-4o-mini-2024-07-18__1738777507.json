  "steps": [
    "To determine which characteristic aids in obtaining food in small places, we need to consider the physical traits that enable birds to access such locations.",
    "Webbed feet (A) mainly help birds swim and do not significantly impact their ability to obtain food in tight spaces.",
    "A large body (B) would likely hinder access to small areas, making it less effective for reaching food in constricted locations.",
    "Soft feathers (C) do not have a direct correlation with obtaining food in small places; they provide insulation and protection but not for foraging.",
    "A skinny beak (D) is advantageous for reaching into narrow crevices or extracting food from tight spots, making it the most suitable choice for this purpose."
