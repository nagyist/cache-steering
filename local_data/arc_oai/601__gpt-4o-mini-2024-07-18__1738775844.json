  "query": "Question: Kevin is observing the sky on a clear night. With the unaided eye he is able to see Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Why would Venus appear to be brighter than the other planets?\n\nChoices:\nA: It reflects the most sunlight toward Earth.\nB: It is hotter than the other planets.\nC: It is larger than the other planets.\nD: It is closest planet to the Sun.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we recognize that the brightness of a planet as seen from Earth is determined by several factors, one of them being how much sunlight it reflects back towards Earth.",
    "Next, we consider that Venus has a thick atmosphere composed of reflective clouds, which allows it to reflect a significant amount of sunlight. This high albedo makes it appear brighter than the other planets.",
    "Then, we evaluate the options given: \n- Option A states that Venus reflects the most sunlight toward Earth, which aligns with our understanding of its reflective properties. \n- Option B discusses temperature but does not directly correlate with perceived brightness from Earth.\n- Option C mentions size, but larger size does not necessarily mean it appears brighter.\n- Option D focuses on proximity to the Sun, but Venus is not the closest planet, as Mercury is, making this option inaccurate.",
    "Since Option A most directly addresses why Venus appears brighter compared to the other planets due to its reflective ability, it is the most accurate choice provided."
