Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?\n\nChoices:\nA: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.\nB: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.\nC: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.\nD: The forces influencing the car are balanced.",

    "The toy car rolls down the inclined track due to the force of gravity acting on it, causing it to accelerate. When it reaches the flat surface, the gravitational force does not change, but the dynamics of the car's motion does.",
    "On the flat surface, the car experiences different forces; kinetic friction comes into play as it interacts with the surface, opposing its motion and thus reducing its speed.",
    "For the car to maintain a constant speed, the forces acting on it must be balanced. However, when it moves to the flat surface and friction acts upon it, the force of friction becomes significant enough to overcome the forward motion, causing an unbalanced force situation where the net force is directed opposite to the motion."
