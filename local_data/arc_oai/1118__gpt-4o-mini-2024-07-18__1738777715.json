  "query": "Question: A scientist is measuring the amount of movement along a fault. Which tool is best used for making this measurement?\n\nChoices:\nA: barometer\nB: stopwatch\nC: meter stick\nD: magnifying lens",
  "steps": [
    "The scientist needs to measure the movement along a fault, which involves distance or displacement measurements.",
    "A barometer measures atmospheric pressure and is not relevant for measuring fault movement.",
    "A stopwatch is used to measure time, which does not directly help in measuring the movement along a fault.",
    "A meter stick is a tool used for measuring lengths or distances, making it suitable for measuring movement or displacement along a fault.",
    "A magnifying lens is used to magnify small objects and details and is not designed for measuring distances or movements."
