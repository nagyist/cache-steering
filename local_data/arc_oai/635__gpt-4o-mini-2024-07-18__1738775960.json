  "query": "Question: Physical and chemical properties can be used to classify substances. Which of these shows a chemical property?\n\nChoices:\nA: Silver melts.\nB: Magnesium burns.\nC: Sulfur is a yellow solid.\nD: Aluminum conducts heat.",
  "steps": [
    "We need to identify which of the options reflects a chemical property. A chemical property is observed when a substance undergoes a chemical change.",
    "Option A states that silver melts. Melting is a physical change, so this does not indicate a chemical property.",
    "Option B states that magnesium burns. Burning is a chemical reaction that produces new substances, which qualifies as a chemical property.",
    "Option C states that sulfur is a yellow solid. This is a physical property, as it describes the state and color of sulfur without changing its composition.",
    "Option D states that aluminum conducts heat. This describes a physical property related to the material's ability to conduct thermal energy, not a chemical change."
