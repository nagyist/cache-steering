  "query": "Question: Which planet has the longest planetary year?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth\nB: Venus\nC: Jupiter\nD: Neptune",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for the planet with the longest orbital period, known as a planetary year, which is the time it takes for a planet to complete one full orbit around the Sun.",
    "Each planet has a different orbital period based on its distance from the Sun. Generally, the further a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbital period.",
    "Earth has an orbital period of about 1 year (365 days), Venus has about 0.615 Earth years, Jupiter has about 11.86 Earth years, and Neptune has about 165 Earth years.",
    "Comparing these values, Jupiter's year is significantly shorter than Neptune\u2019s, which takes the longest time to orbit the Sun."
