  "steps": [
    "To identify an example of a form of energy, we need to understand the options provided and whether they represent energy directly or something else that contains or facilitates energy.",
    "Choice A, the air in a sealed jar, is matter and does not directly represent energy itself.",
    "Choice B, the wire in a metal hanger, is also a physical object made of material and does not embody energy.",
    "Choice C, the water in a small puddle, represents a liquid, which is matter; while it can contain potential energy, it is not a form of energy itself.",
    "Choice D, the sound in a loud classroom, is the vibration of air molecules and is a form of energy. Sound energy is the result of vibrations that travel through the air."
