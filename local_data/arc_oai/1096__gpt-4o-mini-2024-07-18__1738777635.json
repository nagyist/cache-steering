  "query": "Question: Why are coal, oil, and natural gas called fossil fuels?\n\nChoices:\nA: They were once fossils.\nB: They were formed in prehistoric times.\nC: They are used to heat our homes and businesses.\nD: They formed from the remains of prehistoric plants and animals.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what fossil fuels are and how they are formed. Fossil fuels are energy sources derived from the remains of ancient plants and animals.",
    "Next, we recognize that these remains undergo a natural process of decomposition over millions of years, transforming them into coal, oil, and natural gas.",
    "Now, we examine the choices given: \n- Option A suggests they are fossils, which is inaccurate. Fossil fuels are not actual fossils but products derived from them.\n- Option B states they were formed in prehistoric times, which is true but not specific enough to explain why they are called fossil fuels.\n- Option C states their usage, which does not explain their origin.\n- Option D accurately describes that they formed from the remains of prehistoric plants and animals, which is the defining characteristic of fossil fuels."
