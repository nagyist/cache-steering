  "query": "Question: During most of the year, the air over Boston, Massachusetts, contains a high amount of moisture. Which of the following best explains why there is a high amount of moisture in the air?\n\nChoices:\nA: Boston is close to an ocean.\nB: Boston is at a low elevation.\nC: Boston is near many mountains.\nD: Boston is far north of the equator.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the geographical location of Boston and its proximity to water bodies. Boston is situated near the Atlantic Ocean, which is a significant source of moisture.",
    "Next, evaluate the options: Option A states that Boston is close to an ocean, which logically allows for a higher concentration of moisture in the air due to evaporation from the ocean.",
    "Looking at option B, being at a low elevation does not directly correlate with increased moisture levels, as various elevations can exist even in moist regions.",
    "Option C mentions mountains; while mountains can influence weather patterns, Boston itself is not in a mountainous area and thus is not greatly impacted by mountainous weather phenomena.",
    "Lastly, option D notes Boston's latitude; while it is true that being far north might influence certain climatic factors, it is not a primary determinant of air moisture compared to proximity to oceans."
