  "query": "Question: Red is dominant to white for flower color in a particular plant. If a red flowered plant (RR) is crossed with a white flowered plant (rr), what color will the offspring be?\n\nChoices:\nA: 100% pink\nB: 100% red\nC: 50% white, 50% red\nD: 100% white",
  "steps": [
    "In this genetic cross, we are dealing with a dominant-recessive relationship where red (R) is dominant to white (r).",
    "The red flowered plant has the genotype RR, meaning it carries two dominant alleles for red color.",
    "The white flowered plant has the genotype rr, meaning it carries two recessive alleles for white color.",
    "When we perform the cross RR (red) x rr (white), we can use a Punnett square to visualize the possible combinations of alleles in the offspring.",
    "The offspring will inherit one allele from each parent. The red flowered plant contributes R alleles and the white flowered plant contributes r alleles.",
    "Therefore, all offspring will have the genotype Rr, resulting in a phenotype of red flowers since R is dominant over r."

  "solution": "B"
