  "steps": [
    "First, I need to identify what a mixture is. A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that do not chemically bond and can be separated by physical means.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each option to see if it describes a mixture.",
    "Option A describes rust forming on an iron nail, which is a chemical reaction, not a mixture.",
    "Option B describes sugar crystals dissolving in water. This process creates a solution, which is a type of mixture where the sugar is evenly distributed in the water.",
    "Option C describes sodium and chlorine combining to form table salt, which is a new compound and therefore not a mixture.",
    "Option D describes hydrogen and oxygen reacting to produce water, which also forms a compound and not a mixture.",
    "Only option B represents the formation of a mixture, where sugar dissolves in water to form a solution."
