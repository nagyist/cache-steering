  "query": "Question: When a tadpole grows, its gills change into lungs. What does it now need to survive?\n\nChoices:\nA: Air\nB: Water\nC: Soil\nD: Fins",
  "steps": [
    "The tadpole initially has gills, which allow it to extract oxygen from water.",
    "As the tadpole develops and its gills are replaced by lungs, it becomes adapted for breathing air instead of water.",
    "Since lungs are used for breathing air, the tadpole now requires air to survive.",
    "The other options (water, soil, fins) are not necessary for survival after the conversion to lungs."
