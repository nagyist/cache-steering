  "query": "Question: Why are different stars seen during different seasons?\n\nChoices:\nA: Some stars shine brighter during different seasons.\nB: The Sun shines on different stars during different seasons.\nC: Earth changes position in its orbit during different seasons.\nD: The Moon changes position in its orbit during different seasons.",
  "steps": [
    "To understand why different stars are visible during different seasons, we should consider the Earth's position relative to the stars and the Sun.",
    "The Earth orbits the Sun, and as it moves along its orbit, the night sky changes. This is because the side of Earth that faces the Sun during the day limits our view of stars.",
    "In different seasons, the Earth is on different parts of its orbit around the Sun, exposing different sections of the night sky in the evening.",
    "Consequently, as the Earth revolves around the Sun, it presents different constellations to observers on the surface at different times of the year."
