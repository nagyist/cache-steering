    "With the availability of electric light, people can read comfortably at any time, enhancing their ability to enjoy books, study, and engage in other reading-related activities.",
    "The other activities listed (swimming, walking, and talking) do not directly benefit from artificial light in the same way that reading does since they are not as dependent on visibility during nighttime."
