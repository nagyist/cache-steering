  "query": "Question: Which change resulted from the heating of the planets as they formed?\n\nChoices:\nA: Their masses increased.\nB: They lost most of their radioactive isotopes.\nC: Their structures differentiated into distinct layers.\nD: They started to revolve around the Sun.",
  "steps": [
    "When planets form, they undergo a process of heating due to gravitational compression and the decay of radioactive isotopes within them.",
    "As a result of this heating, materials within the planets can melt and move, allowing denser materials to settle toward the center while lighter materials remain on the surface.",
    "This process of separating into different layers based on density is known as differentiation, resulting in distinct layers like a core, mantle, and crust.",
    "The other options provided do not accurately describe the effects of heating during planet formation: masses do not increase (option A), they would retain some radioactive isotopes rather than losing most (option B), and their revolution around the Sun is a separate process that occurs after the formation (option D)."
