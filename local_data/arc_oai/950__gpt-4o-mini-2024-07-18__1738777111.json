  "query": "Question: Forests have been cut and burned so that the land can be used to raise crops. Which consequence does this activity have on the atmosphere of Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: It reduces the amount of carbon dioxide production.\nB: It reduces the production of oxygen.\nC: It decreases the greenhouse effect.\nD: It decreases pollutants in the air.",
  "steps": [
    "Cutting and burning forests releases a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as trees store carbon and when they are cut down or burned, that carbon is released.",
    "The process of deforestation not only releases carbon dioxide but also reduces the number of trees available to produce oxygen, as trees play a critical role in photosynthesis.",
    "Deforestation can increase the greenhouse effect rather than decrease it because the release of carbon dioxide contributes to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
    "Pollutants might not necessarily decrease as a result of deforestation; in fact, burning can introduce additional pollutants into the air."

  "solution": "B"
