  "query": "Question: On February 21, a student observes that the Moon cannot be seen in the clear night sky. On what date will the student not be able to see the Moon again in the clear night sky?\n\nChoices:\nA: February 28\nB: March 7\nC: March 14\nD: March 21",
  "steps": [
    "The Moon is not visible during the new moon phase. The lunar cycle takes approximately 29.5 days to complete.",
    "February 21 is a new moon day. Adding 29.5 days to this date gives the next new moon.",
    "Counting 29.5 days from February 21 brings us to March 22. However, we typically would look at the calendar date either just before or after, since the cycle might slightly adjust.",
    "Since none of the given options is March 22, we check the cycle approximation. March 21 would be the date the new moon starts."
