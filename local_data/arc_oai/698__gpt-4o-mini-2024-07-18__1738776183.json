  "query": "Question: Students finished a laboratory experiment using chemicals. The students made sure they safely disposed of the chemicals because they\n\nChoices:\nA: poured the chemicals down the sink drain.\nB: placed the chemicals carefully in the trash can.\nC: placed each chemical back in its original container.\nD: followed the directions provided by the teacher for each chemical.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we can eliminate option A because pouring chemicals down the sink drain is generally unsafe and is not a proper disposal method for laboratory chemicals.",
    "Next, we can eliminate option B because placing chemicals in the trash can is also not a safe or appropriate way to dispose of most laboratory chemicals, especially hazardous ones.",
    "Now, let's consider option C. Placing each chemical back in its original container does not necessarily indicate that the chemicals have been disposed of safely; it suggests they are being stored rather than disposed of.",
    "Finally, option D states that the students followed the directions provided by the teacher for each chemical. This implies they acted according to safety protocols which would typically encompass both proper disposal methods and safety measures."
