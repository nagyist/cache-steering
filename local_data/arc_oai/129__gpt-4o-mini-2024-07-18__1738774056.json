  "query": "Question: Which best describes two organ systems working together to help maintain homeostasis?\n\nChoices:\nA: The reproductive organs produce sex cells.\nB: The nerves carry signals from the eye to the brain.\nC: The bones and muscles of the hand work together to grip a pencil.\nD: The muscles of the chest tighten to push carbon dioxide out of the lungs.",
  "steps": [
    "To maintain homeostasis, different organ systems must coordinate their functions to regulate internal conditions such as temperature, pH, and ion balance.",
    "Option A describes the reproductive organs which focus on reproduction rather than homeostasis, so it is not relevant.",
    "Option B describes the nervous system's function in relaying signals but does not illustrate a collaboration of systems to maintain balance in the body.",
    "Option C describes the skeletal and muscular systems working together to achieve an action (gripping a pencil), which illustrates their collaboration, but does not directly relate to maintaining homeostasis.",
    "Option D describes the muscular system's role in expelling carbon dioxide, which helps regulate internal carbon dioxide levels thereby maintaining homeostasis. It illustrates how muscles and lungs work together effectively."
