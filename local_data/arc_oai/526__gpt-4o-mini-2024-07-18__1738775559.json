  "query": "Question: Helena investigates how enzymes are important to body processes. How is the role of enzymes in biochemical activity best explained?\n\nChoices:\nA: Enzymes work at all pH levels.\nB: Enzymes decrease the rate of metabolism.\nC: Enzymes enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures.\nD: Enzymes raise the activation energy needed for a reaction.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the function of enzymes in biochemical processes. Enzymes act as catalysts that speed up reactions in the body, allowing them to occur more efficiently and at lower temperatures.",
    "Next, we evaluate each answer choice in relation to what we know about enzymes. Choice A states that enzymes work at all pH levels, but this is not true as enzymes have optimal pH ranges for activity.",
    "Choice B claims that enzymes decrease the rate of metabolism, which is incorrect because enzymes actually increase the rate of metabolic reactions.",
    "Choice D suggests that enzymes raise the activation energy needed for a reaction, but this is also incorrect; enzymes lower the activation energy required for reactions to occur.",
    "Finally, Choice C states that enzymes enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures, which aligns with the known function of enzymes as they help facilitate reactions without the need for high temperatures."
