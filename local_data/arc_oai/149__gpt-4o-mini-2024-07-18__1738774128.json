  "query": "Question: Joann is testing soils to see which kind is best for growing marigolds. Which of the following should she do?\n\nChoices:\nA: Plant the marigolds in the same soil, but water some plants more than others.\nB: Plant the marigolds in one kind of soil, radishes in another, and daisies in a third kind.\nC: Plant the marigolds three kinds of soil, and give them different amounts of sun.\nD: Plant the marigolds in three kinds of soil, and give them the same amounts of water and sun.",
  "steps": [
    "Joann's goal is to determine which type of soil is best for growing marigolds. To do this effectively, she needs to isolate the variable of soil type while keeping other factors consistent.",
    "Option D suggests planting the marigolds in three different kinds of soil while controlling the amounts of water and sun, which meets the criteria of maintaining consistent growing conditions for a proper comparison.",
    "Option A, which involves varying watering practices, introduces a confounding variable, making it unclear whether the growth differences are due to soil type or watering.",
    "Option B introduces a completely different type of plant (radishes and daisies) in addition to marigolds, meaning she cannot directly compare the effects of the soil on marigolds alone.",
    "Option C introduces a variable of sunlight along with different soil types, which complicates the results and does not allow her to draw a clear conclusion about soil effectiveness on the growth of marigolds."
