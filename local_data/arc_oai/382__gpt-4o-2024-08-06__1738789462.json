  "query": "Question: Which of these is one similarity of the elements in the first group of the periodic table?\n\nChoices:\nA: The elements in the group have similar atomic masses.\nB: The elements in the group have the same number of electrons.\nC: The elements in the group are very unreactive metals.\nD: The elements in the group react with oxygen in similar ways.",
  "steps": [
    "The first group of the periodic table consists of alkali metals.",
    "Alkali metals include elements like lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium.",
    "These elements all have one electron in their outermost shell.",
    "The similar number of electrons in the outermost shell gives them similar chemical properties.",
    "Alkali metals are known to react vigorously with oxygen.",
    "Therefore, one similarity is that the elements in this group react with oxygen in similar ways, due to their valence electron configuration."
