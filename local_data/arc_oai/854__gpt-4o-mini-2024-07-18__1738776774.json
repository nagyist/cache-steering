    "To calculate speed, one must understand the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time.",
    "In this case, Marni has run a specific distance of 1500 meters, but to find her speed, she also needs to know the time it took her to cover that distance.",
    "The other choices (B, C, and D) do not provide the necessary information to calculate speed: the number of steps, heart rate, and direction of running do not directly influence the speed calculation."
