  "query": "Question: Michael has a pencil case made of pine wood. The surface of the pencil case scratches and dents easily. He wants to make a new pencil case that will not scratch or dent easily. Which of the following should Michael do to make a new pencil case that will not scratch or dent easily?\n\nChoices:\nA: make the pencil case a different size\nB: use a different material to make the pencil case\nC: make the pencil case from another piece of pine wood\nD: use a thicker piece of pine wood to make the pencil case",
  "steps": [
    "Michael's current pencil case is made of pine wood, which is known to scratch and dent easily.",
    "To create a new pencil case that is resistant to scratches and dents, Michael needs to consider materials that are more durable than pine wood.",
    "Choice A suggests changing the size, which would not solve the problem of durability.",
    "Choice C involves using another piece of pine wood, which will have the same scratch and dent issues as the original.",
    "Choice D suggests using a thicker piece of pine wood, but thickness alone does not necessarily improve scratch and dent resistance significantly.",
    "Choice B offers the option to use a different material, which is the most logical solution to avoid the scratching and denting problem."
