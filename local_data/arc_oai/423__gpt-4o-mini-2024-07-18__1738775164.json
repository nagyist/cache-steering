  "query": "Question: A town built a road through a forest. Deer live in the forest on both sides of the road. Which would not help protect deer from the cars on the road?\n\nChoices:\nA: feeders on the side of the road\nB: lights along the side of the road\nC: signs telling drivers to be careful of deer\nD: bridges that let the deer walk under the road",
  "steps": [
    "First, we analyze the options presented and their effects on protecting deer from cars on the road.",
    "Feeders on the side of the road (Option A) would potentially attract deer closer to the road, increasing the likelihood of them being hit by cars, hence this does not help protect them.",
    "Lights along the side of the road (Option B) may increase visibility for drivers, which could help reduce accidents involving deer. Thus, they could assist in protecting the deer.",
    "Signs telling drivers to be careful of deer (Option C) would inform drivers of the potential danger, helping to raise awareness and possibly reduce collisions, indicating that this option aids in protection.",
    "Bridges that let the deer walk under the road (Option D) would provide a safe passage for deer and effectively prevent them from interacting with road traffic, hence this also supports their protection.",
    "Based on the analysis, Option A (feeders) would not help protect the deer and could cause harm instead."
