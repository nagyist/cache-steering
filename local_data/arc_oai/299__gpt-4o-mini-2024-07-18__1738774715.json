  "query": "Question: Sonar equipment sends waves into deep water and measures the\n\nChoices:\nA: time delay of the reflected waves.\nB: refraction of the transmitted waves.\nC: direction of the transmitted waves.\nD: interference of the transmitted and reflected waves.",
  "steps": [
    "Sonar equipment is designed to send acoustic waves into water and receive echoes or reflections of those waves.",
    "The primary purpose of sonar is to determine the distance to the objects underwater by measuring the time it takes for the sound waves to return.",
    "Thus, the critical measurement that sonar equipment makes is the time delay of the waves after they bounce off an object and return to the source."

  "solution": "A"
