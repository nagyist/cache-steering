  "query": "Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. On Hirta, sheep with light wool outnumber sheep with dark wool because sheep with light wool\n\nChoices:\nA: produce more wool\nB: have a more restricted diet\nC: produce fewer offspring each year\nD: have a better chance of surviving and reproducing",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes how, despite the larger size and strength of dark wool sheep, the light wool sheep have increased in number over the past 20 years on the island of Hirta.",
    "Typically, larger and stronger animals are favored for survival and reproduction. However, this is not the case here as light wool sheep have outnumbered dark wool sheep.",
    "The likely reason for the increase in the number of light wool sheep must be related to their ability to survive and reproduce despite their smaller size.",
    "Among the options provided, the statement that fits best is that light wool sheep have a better chance of surviving and reproducing, which contributes to their increased population."
