  "query": "Question: Which of the following statements best explains why the tilt of Earth on its axis causes summer to be warmer than winter in the Northern Hemisphere?\n\nChoices:\nA: The warm ocean currents flow from the tropics to the Northern Hemisphere in the summer.\nB: The rays of the Sun strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in the summer.\nC: The greenhouse effect increases in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer.\nD: The Northern Hemisphere is closer to the Sun in the summer.",
  "steps": [
    "In the Northern Hemisphere, summer occurs when the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun, leading to longer daylight hours and more direct sunlight.",
    "Direct sunlight means that the rays of the Sun are concentrated over a smaller area, increasing the temperature.",
    "Other options, such as ocean currents or greenhouse effects, do not fundamentally explain the primary reason for the temperature difference caused by Earth's axial tilt.",
    "Option D is incorrect because the Earth's distance from the Sun changes slightly throughout the year but does not significantly influence seasonal temperature variations."

  "solution": "B"
